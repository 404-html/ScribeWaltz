1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,720
Okay.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,260
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:09,380
August 3rd, 2050 what's
going on out? Whoa.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,770
Okay.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,540
Oh, can you believe it's already
August 3rd? Where is the summer going?

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,380
No need to fret everyone because now
that we are in the golden age of global

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,740
warming, you know right before
all the bad shit happens.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,130
The great thing is is summer goes right
through to like October at this point.

9
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:33,690
So there's still time to
get your beach body lay

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,470
and gentlemen.
Um,

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,440
you don't really helps with you.
You have,

12
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:44,750
you just get depressed at how quickly
life is going by how quickly time is going

13
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:48,740
by. You know, what really helps that
is if you're working towards something.

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,600
Okay.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,570
I swear to God and I tried to get
all fucking goofy here in self help.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm actually excited for August to end
to get right through this month because I

17
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,440
know where I'm going to
be. Cause I, I had been,

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,620
oh I've been working out today.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,800
I stepped on the scale and my goal
was to get, go for one 80 to one 77,

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,460
dropped by three pounds by the fucking
week. I go to the gym every day,

21
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,710
just be calm.
And you know,

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,330
every day you can't.

23
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,410
Wow. Um, I got on,

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,620
I got on the scale babbled
laptop when I got out of bed, um,

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,320
on the scale this morning.
And uh,

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,350
I weighed in at one 76.4 or point Pfoa
is some people say in Massachusetts or

27
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:51,251
basically the new England area
once every 6.46 ounces to spare.

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm pretty psyched about that.
Um,

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,170
what I did this week was I just kept
eating the exact same way that I've been

30
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:04,880
eating. Uh, which is, is perfect
as I know how to eat. You know,

31
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,510
there's only so much you can
read about nutrition, you know,

32
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:13,130
about good carbohydrate, a good
fats, bad fats, good cholesterol,

33
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:17,720
bad cholesterol, fucking
glycerin, whatever the fuck it is.

34
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:22,280
I just a glucose and all that shit. I
just love, I just shut up. All right.

35
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,620
With your, your, your words. You know, I,
I, those fucking words don't excite me.

36
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,910
They don't make me go, oh, what's
the next sentence going to read?

37
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:35,030
I've got to figure out how to get
excited about reading about nutrition.

38
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,800
You know, I just can't, I cannot get
into reading about nuts and berries,

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,100
you know what I mean? There's no
car chase. There's no Teddy's,

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,650
there's no classic lines.
Snow, snow, shiny suits him.
Well, well, there's nothing.

41
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,650
What is their way of for me?

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,240
Okay.

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
You know, like sitting through
of some fucking movie, you know,

44
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:56,970
you didn't want to see,
but you fucked up in your relationships.

45
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,980
So you trying to repair it. See like,
all right, all right, I'll fucking, uh,

46
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,210
oh yeah, let's go see this movie. What
is, what is it called? What is it called?

47
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,560
Seven suppers in September.

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,220
What I'm thinking about
dinner dates, divine, whatever
the fuck it's going to be.

49
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:19,760
Anyways,
but I switched up the cardio this week.

50
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:22,040
I went to the gym and I skipped
a rope a couple of times,

51
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,980
so it was a different kind of cardio. So
my body's still like, hey, whoa, whoa.

52
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:28,510
What the fuck's going on? You
know, because I overheard somebody,

53
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:31,820
you say you're supposed to confuse your
body every light color three to six

54
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:35,900
weeks. So I did that. And it's
working for me. It's working for me.

55
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,530
Oh boy, boy. And I'm psyched
that I'm losing weight, but, uh,

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,910
this is the time and because I'm
recording this on Sunday night and, uh,

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,630
it's about, I dunno, seven, eight o'clock.
I didn't know what the fuck time it is.

58
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,250
And, uh, this is the time of night
where I usually a crack open a cold one,

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,470
and I'm not, I'm 28 days in
29 when you hear this, and,

60
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,040
uh, you know, so now I'm not craving
alcohol. I don't give a fuck about it.

61
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,130
I'm going to give a shit, but
like, I'm not like, you know,

62
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,830
I'm used to my new lifestyle,
you know,

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,080
this is it just wide awake.

64
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,090
Oh, fucking brain cells, straight align,

65
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,500
all counted for Jesus
Christ. I'm bored shitless,

66
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,820
fucking bored shitless, but I am working
towards a few things. I took my first, uh,

67
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,860
um, autorotation, uh,

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,210
advanced autorotation class and I fucking
loved it and I felt like I became,

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,890
I got like 30% better Adam in one lesson
and I'm just going to keep taking those

70
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:39,770
fucking things until I can simulate a,

71
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:43,490
a engine failure and landed like
essentially in a parking spot.

72
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,040
And once I do that, then I'm
going to feel like, all right,

73
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,380
now I feel comfortable the fly around,

74
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,780
take some passengers and that
type of shit. That's what you do.

75
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:53,420
You don't get your license and then
go, wow, I get it. Pass the bucket.

76
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,310
Let me just fly around and hope nothing
happens. That's not what you do.

77
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,660
You keep going, you keep
learning. Keep trying.

78
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,590
Um,
fuck.

79
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,910
28 days in 72 days was 72 months,
28,

80
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:15,290
that's 52 minus eight, 44,
44 days to go. Ah, I'm,

81
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm rapidly approaching the halfway point,

82
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:22,350
which is 36 days was 28,
seven 35 shit,

83
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,620
that feels hoping next week I was gonna
be at the halfway point. Who's kidding?

84
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:25,760
Who People.
I'm going to come off.

85
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm going to drop about 20 pounds and I
am going to come off this fucking this

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,940
stretch and no Busan and I'm going to
pull it on least 30 pounds. Just a booze.

87
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:38,840
Wait, forget about all the dump food
choices I want to make when I'm hammered.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,400
Um, now Jesus. So anyways, once
76.4 there, you got to swallow.

89
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,430
I got to do is lose 2.4 this week.
I don't give a fuck.

90
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,700
I just got to plow through
this fucking week, you know,

91
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,850
cause then I'll be down to one 74
and then it gets exciting. Right.

92
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:57,300
Then you start getting into the low one
seventies and that's basically, you know,

93
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,000
that's where, you know, when my person,

94
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,100
so I could go out and get a headshot
and maybe a book, a cheerios commercial.

95
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,030
That's an exciting way to be at.
You know what I mean? Oh, you go,

96
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:09,060
you sit there and laugh. Those toasted
that commercials. They fucking pay.

97
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,990
I did one a long time ago. I think it's
up on Youtube. Uh, if you search for it.

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,720
Such search whole a Billy red
face toasted owes no, I'm kidding.

99
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:19,531
I never did one of those,

100
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:24,390
but I wasn't a honeycomb commercial
when I was just a kid. Honey Cosby. Yay.

101
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,560
Yeah, it's not smile and I wasn't
in that shit either. Um, anyways,

102
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:32,760
let's get on with the podcast
here. So, uh, that's the deal.

103
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,530
Trying to get in shape,
you know what I mean?

104
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,710
Because I'm not a young fella anymore.
And uh,

105
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,020
if anything tells me that is when fucking,
you know,

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,950
heroes of mine from when I
was a kid die in this sleep.

107
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,080
Fucking devastating news of Rod Rowdy
Roddy Piper passing away this week. Man,

108
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,340
I couldn't believe he was fucking 61.
I couldn't really was that old.

109
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:57,290
And I also was thinking like,
that's 14 years away from me and 14,

110
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,030
14 years you can die in your sleep.
Like that can happen.

111
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,930
And everybody's okay with that, you know,
like, oh, you know, no, not okay with it.

112
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:08,640
I mean, they miss the guy
and shit. But anyways, so

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,200
breast and peace, Rowdy Roddy Piper.
Thank you for all the fucking labs.

114
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:17,820
Piper's pit man. That was the best. Just
when they think they know the answers,

115
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,140
I changed the questions.

116
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,180
I got to meet him a couple of times when
I was down in the comedy store. And, uh,

117
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,030
it had a chance to hang out with them
one time and I didn't because he was that

118
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,050
big a deal for me.

119
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,790
And I didn't want to know him too well
because he was such a big fucking deal.

120
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,930
That's when I'm telling you before
the Rock and stone cold, Steve Austin,

121
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,440
which was definitely a golden age,

122
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,560
and I think the rock is the
best guy ever on the Mike.

123
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:47,640
Other than fucking ric flair. That's what
I, my own personal opinion, whatever.

124
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,620
But, um, before the golden age of the
Rock Stone Cold Steve Austin, mankind,

125
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,610
um, um, oh, who's the guy

126
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,680
with the fuck was he called? I just
know what the rock used to call him.

127
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,520
Used to call them the red. You
know what? Ah, what was his name?

128
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,000
I forget anyways,
in the 80s.

129
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,460
Was it cane? Something like that.
I can't fucking remember. Um,

130
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,970

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,450
the fucking moon dogs.

143
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:01,920
Okay.

144
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,940
Mr Fuji and Mr Tsai. Edo.
The men of the wild Samoans.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Captain Lou Albano. Freddie Blassie,
the grand wizard of wrestling.

146
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,860
I used to watch that shit
every fucking week. I loved it.

147
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,150
And one of the biggest parts of when,

148
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,780
when fucking Rowdy Roddy Piper
came on the scene, it was like,

149
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:23,760
who the fuck is this guy came out and
that kilt and from day one was talking,

150
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,730
she was one of those guys.
Steve g showed up and he was a star.

151
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,700
It seemed like it was just overnight.
He was so good.

152
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,910
You couldn't remember wrestling without
a man. And I can't believe that man,

153
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,330
61 years old, he looked great too.
When I saw him, fuck it. Look Great.

154
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,320
Terror of that. I mean I'm getting to
that age whether that's gets terrifying,

155
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:45,090
like how old was he? What the
fuck? So, uh, anyways, um,

156
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,710
yeah,
yes.

157
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:50,100
They may start to make me feel old so
I feel good that I'm actually working

158
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,180
towards some shit. So, Oh, Billy fucking
20 hobbies here. So I'm working on those,

159
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:54,271
uh,

160
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:58,410
auto rotations and I actually started
taking drum lessons again cause I'm sick

161
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,050
of fucking flailing around the kid.

162
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,310
Nah.
You know,

163
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,060
I was always a,
I always admired guys that had debt,

164
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:10,260
that fucking flawless technique and I
think c and Keith Carlock when he played

165
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:14,010
with the steely Dan and just watching the,

166
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,900
obviously no matter how
much technique I have,

167
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,910
I'm never going to play like that guy.
But just watching,

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,553
mmm.

169
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Him just effortlessly go around the
kit and the sticks are doing the work.

170
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,210
He's just guiding it with this
hand. It's just fun. It's,

171
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,960
it's really some drunk geek shit, but
it's fucking unreal. And having said that,

172
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:34,390
does anybody know who was Jim Croce?
His Drummer?

173
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,780
Does anybody have any of the idea? I'm
trying to figure out who played on that.

174
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:40,810
Working at the car wash blues,
which is really, you know,

175
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:44,080
it's kind of a Corny fucking song. Who's
kid? No, but the drums on it are there.

176
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:47,740
Shit,
I love the drums on that fucking song.

177
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,170
And I finally figured out
that little fucking, uh,

178
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,840
I'll play a little something for you.

179
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
This is a little fucking press role
that the guide does in the beginning.

180
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,950
I'll say, where the hell is
it? Come on. Oh, here we go.

181
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,170
There it is coming up right now,

182
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,343
right?
Yeah.

183
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,960
Oh, I fucking love that. And two,

184
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,550
three and add one.
But bad at that.

185
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,590
I've been sitting in my fuck.
Just like if the fucking rain man,

186
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,390
trying to figure that thing out.
And I started taking lessons in, uh,

187
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,330
my teacher helped me out with the sham,
but I'm just so I suck at it, but I know,

188
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:30,070
I know physically how to do it.

189
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:32,680
So I just got you just sit there and
you do it a million times. Who knows?

190
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:37,060
Maybe I'll bust that song out at the,
uh, the comedy jam. Little Jim Croce.

191
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,870
God Damn it.
That guy's got some depressing songs,

192
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,383
Huh?

193
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,560
New York is not my home.

194
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,140
Okay.

195
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,090
And I learned a lot of lessons and they
will not the NASCAR kind it all the

196
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:55,410
shitty things about fucking sleeping
in a doorway, getting mugged,

197
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:59,040
having to call his parents
that New York's not my home.

198
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,000
I just started singing that.

199
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,100
Don't you know that I
gotta get Outta here?

200
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,430
I'm so low.

201
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,690
Don't you know that I gotta
get hottie because New York's

202
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,040
not my home.

203
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,640
Thank God I never knew that song existed
when I first moved to New York and was

204
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:19,480
eating my balls at the old Boston comedy
club. I would've gone home crying.

205
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,700
That was that early 70 shit.
They were not about bringing people up.

206
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:29,650
They would just sit in it, sit
in that depression, you know,

207
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,160
he's got a couple, he's
got, I got a name, you know,

208
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,090
lack of pine trees
lining the winding road.

209
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,870
I've got a name,
I got name sat.

210
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,790
The song doesn't make any sense.
Like to sing and burden the croaking toad.

211
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,960
I've got a name that neither one of
those animals has really as a name,

212
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:52,690
unless it's a pet. Other than
that, it's just called what it is.

213
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,140
That'd be like if your name
was human being, right?

214
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,170
Yeah.

215
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,570
Yeah. Maybe we should just sit back and
enjoy this song. I don't fucking know,

216
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,410
but I just,
you know,

217
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,690
and I carry it with me like my daddy did.

218
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,270
And even then it gets said, but I'm
living the dream that he couldn't give.

219
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,240
What did that mean?
He drank away his paycheck every week.

220
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:20,040
It was just fucking good Lord guys putting
a number one songs and he's all fees.

221
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,630
All fucking said is me. The, the
the Seattle guy there, right?

222
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:25,980
With the page boy haircut.

223
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,420
He was a Sadie to weigh it all these
great fucking album. Z, Gen y, k here.

224
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,980
Um, anyways, what am I doing?
What am I talking about here?

225
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,840
So something I wanted to talk about. Oh,
so my wife, for whatever fucking reason,

226
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,040
absolutely loves that show.
Uh, that American greed.

227
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,623
And um,

228
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,510
she watches like three of those episodes
every fucking night before we go to bed

229
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:50,700
night.

230
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,910
And I and I always ended up falling
asleep cause it's the same fucking story

231
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:57,330
over and over again. You
know, it's the same thing.

232
00:13:57,331 --> 00:14:00,640
That guy starts up for fucking business.
He dressing the parties,

233
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,570
faking it till you make it.
He gets a bunch of investors,

234
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,500
he hands out fake spreadsheets and they
got these fucking innocent people just

235
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:11,670
go in like, you know all you know I
shy Shaw there Richards, you know,

236
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:14,250
I was getting dirty, appreciate
it. And I was like, Whoa,

237
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,250
it's shower was like a good Gail or me.
Right.

238
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,870
And then they always go, you know, this
always gets some really bad metaphor.

239
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,320
They invested in an ice cream chain,

240
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,530
but this wasn't the flavor
they were looking for when
we would turn glass in the

241
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:32,310
ice cream.

242
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,340
Oh Wow.

243
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,260
Fucking song for American greed.
I'll tell you.

244
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:43,940
And I was going to end up on fucking
American grade. Is that cunt?

245
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,500
Who shot that lion?

246
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,550
Everybody's talking about this dentist
that went over and illegally poached this

247
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,720
lion that was friendly with
people. I love that shit. Oh,

248
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:56,170
is it refreshing with people until what?
It bites somebody fucking head off.

249
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,800
Okay.

250
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,980
Fucking unreal. You know what I mean?
Everybody's fucking salient gas.

251
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,560
The pit bulls, you shoot a
fucking line. Everything.

252
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,560
It was nice.
It was a good line.

253
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,520
I'm not saying it was a bad line. I'm not
saying the guy shouldn't have done it.

254
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,190
I think everybody's missing
the fucking story here.

255
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,490
Yeah.

256
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,000
All right.
Speaking of American greed,

257
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,250
this guide page 50 grand.
All right.

258
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,050
That's just for the fuck.

259
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,430
That's not even for his flight to go
over there and killed his fucking lion.

260
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,400
All right. Oh, trying to
stir anything up here.

261
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:37,401
But how the fuck can a dentist afford to
drop 50 grand to fly to Africa to shoot

262
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:42,330
a fucking lion

263
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,573
illegally?

264
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,510
Just think of the [inaudible].

265
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,000
How expensive the shoes he had to buy
that he had to sneak around and they had

266
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,800
to be some sort of Ninja were fucking,
I'm going to shoot it. Uh, uh,

267
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:57,500
protected lion where that he had on,
right.

268
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,090
I drop 50 grand on that and now he's gone
underground. They go over to his house,

269
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:06,950
he's got a match. Right? And all they
talking about as his fucking line.

270
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:09,620
And I'm,
I'm watching an episode of American greed.

271
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,610
Okay.

272
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,430
Oh Wow.
Wow.

273
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,380
Why the fuck are you a phone call or fill
in fucking how many teeth you fill it.

274
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,760
It's guys pulling teeth. He's,
I'm telling you right now,

275
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,090
I used to work in a dental
office, right? And I,

276
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,100
there was some good dentists just
like cops. There's some good cops.

277
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,790
There's some bad cops.
And I'm not talking about interrogation.

278
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,940
Bob Brandishing a weapon. Uh, no,

279
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:41,630
I'm talking about fucking people pulling
teeth that didn't need to be pulled.

280
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,770
Fucking doing root filling fillings on
teeth that did not need to be fucking

281
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,160
drilled into because they
bought a car beyond their own

282
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,150
fucking needs or whatever. Their,
their, their financial responsibility.

283
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,830
All right,

284
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,210
I think this guy should be fucking take
it back there just for the simple fact,

285
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,660
just for the simple
fact that, that he, uh,

286
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,840
he went to another country and did that.
What do we got over here?

287
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,660
Does the MGM still have a lion?
What if you,

288
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,720
what if somebody from Zimbabwe came over
here? What about the MGM Lion? Right,

289
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,710
right. As they were recording
that you're watching an MGM film.

290
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,250
They fuck the police. Turn
the air conditioning back
on back on the lovely knee.

291
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:32,620
Everybody she came in. This is a
studio man. Dave Letterman had it cold.

292
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:35,470
I'm having a cold.
He lasted fucking 30 years on television.

293
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,500
I want to do 30 years of podcasting,
positioning wherever we live.

294
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,120
Yeah.

295
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,550
Well, what's good is the air conditioning.
If you're going to fucking turn it off.

296
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,780
Listen, I'm talking about that dentist
that went out, went over to Zimbabwe.

297
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,260
You got to go grab a Mike from
the, uh, from the closet there.

298
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,450
You know. No one wants to listen to
somebody. Just hit pause here. I fucking,

299
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:02,010
I never hit pause. Um, do
you know that story in here?

300
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,890
This dentist from Minnesota,
he's a B. You know, he likes,

301
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,870
he's one of those big game hunters.
You know what I mean?

302
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,010
He's one of those fucking guys.

303
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm going to shoot something that people
think is scary and then I can be like,

304
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,890
God, I killed that Shit. You know,

305
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:21,530
like it went up and he fucking put it
in a choke hold. Take you didn't you,

306
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,850
you went over and you shot it.
The fact that you can go,

307
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,720
you can walk up and kill an armed man.

308
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,280
A human being with a gun. You could
fucking kill. You could, you could do it.

309
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,910
Even if he knew you were coming, you have
a gun, he has a gun, you could do that.

310
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,700
So now you're going up to a lion.
The thing doesn't have a gun.

311
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,270
So I mean how fucking difficult is that?
Actually they, her with a crossbow,

312
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,400
but there a reason why they shut off
with a crossbow is cause they were trying

313
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:48,900
to disguise it. Doesn't he have, he's
gone big game hunting before, right?

314
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:52,370
Like he's done at align. Well,
here's the thing that I have awesome.

315
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,680
Weirdly alarm is headline being like,
you know,

316
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:59,550
he's like a serial killer of animals and
it's like the way they were putting it

317
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:02,560
was like, you know, this is what he
does all the time. I don't know. Random.

318
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,540
He's one of those guys. He thought he
doesn't seem like he kills to eat it.

319
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,960
A is for sport. Yeah. He's one
of those guys to be like, Yay.

320
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,040
You ever hear of an alligator fucking
shot one in the head as he put it up in

321
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,470
his study or something like that.
He's one of those guys. So you want,

322
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,350
what about him? He fled, right?
Like he, uh, he will goes over,

323
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,020
he went over to Zimbabwe like a crossbow
and he fucking went into some like

324
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:29,070
wildlife sanctuary. Allegedly.
This lion was friendly with people.

325
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,750
I love that shit. That's all the lion see
solo or whatever it was. It was, yeah.

326
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,850
It's friendly until it isn't until the
one day you do something that reminds us,

327
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,380
you know, shopping from its childhoods
and it fucking bite your head off.

328
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,060
But it's was sort of supposed to toe.
It's a lion. Yeah. You Kill Shit. Yeah,

329
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:45,780
of course.

330
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,560
So he went in and he fucking killed it to
capitated it skinned the fucking thing.

331
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,460
Hey, what's the head? Yeah. First of
all, how do you get the head back?

332
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,290
I don't know. I don't want to know
that you've got to go gym bag.

333
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,660
You get to drain it out. They
probably do it. They're like, oh no.

334
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,640
You know what he did?
He product taxidermy.

335
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,460
Well he probably like takes the fucking,

336
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,070
just the skin from the head.

337
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,800
You bring that back and then you just,

338
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,330
you have somebody like make a like a
lion skull and then you put it over that

339
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:21,360
cause no one's going to note
the skull isn't in there. Right.

340
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,640
This is the kind of shit this
is like pat have no idea.

341
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,240
But let me ask you this near
because you're into American greed.

342
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:31,650
This guy's a dentist. He paid 50 grand
to do that. Now he's gone underground.

343
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,590
They're going by his house, he
has a mansion, sky's a dentist.

344
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:37,980
He is a mansion and he's got all
these expensive fucking uh, you know,

345
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:39,630
going around killing all these,

346
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,510
how does a dentist have all that
fucking money and see like a Hoity,

347
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:46,830
toity fancy dentist that like
doesn't take any insurance at all.

348
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:47,950
Like pay.
And in

349
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,080
the, I've worked in a dental office.
Nobody was going on a safari.

350
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,800
Even if just look at them. Forget
about too. Just to go on a safari.

351
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:56,900
How much money that is.
Forget about.

352
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,890
You're going to go over there and
then sneak back later. Kill a lion.

353
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,080
Butcher the fucking thing and
sneak it back. Yeah, I dunno.

354
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,380
He sounds very sketchy though.

355
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,910
Wow.
Wow.

356
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,850
Greensville doing the
theme to American greed.

357
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,540
You know, do your best Stacy
Keach impression. We'll
give me a scenario. What?

358
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,930
It's always the same scenario.
Same thing.

359
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:29,550
It's like a Ponzi scheme and he throws
lavish parties and he buys Ferrari's and

360
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:33,360
BMWs and Ferrari. Mike. Dude,

361
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,780
how many times is [inaudible] Mike?

362
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,200
How many times is ludicrous going to
show up in the background of one of those

363
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,410
oddly shown up on two episodes.
Episodes of American greed.

364
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,570
Greedy white people love.
Hey,

365
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,500
fucking can't get enough of them. I don't
know. It's really weird though. Yeah,

366
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,450
he came up twice.
It's fucking hilarious.

367
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:57,030
Not that he does business with
these people, but he is like,

368
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,250
he knows the people that did business
with the person being profiled.

369
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,710
It's like that private party,
you know and they like show rich.

370
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:07,130
You can have a ludicrous
wrapping your living room.

371
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,910
I love that show.
It's a fucking

372
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,530
fucking missy Elliot saw.
He used to drive me up the way

373
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,030
we eat

374
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,370
and when that fucking song
pass that Dutch. Yeah,

375
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,370
they'd be like [inaudible] nobody
peds. Hence no, we gave him shit.

376
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,320
It was the only good part of the song was
when he came on. You're talking about,

377
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,060
so Chris was solo 12 aggregators.

378
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,430
That is the best part. I loved
it. It was inspirational.

379
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,830
No one believed in him and he said,
fuck this.

380
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:52,530
He made his own God damn tape and then
he was selling them out of the back of

381
00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:57,240
the car and they was crushing it. That's
true. He's going to be on empire next to,

382
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,230
I didn't,
I didn't like,

383
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,350
I didn't like the part where he started
buying the gators. It's just like, no, no,

384
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:05,670
no, no real estate. Oh, I'm
sure he has tons of real estate.

385
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,060
That's a guy's singing a Bob
type of the guys wrapping a box.

386
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,270
That's all by ludicrous. Oh, I thought
you were talking about ludicrous.

387
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,450
How soon before ludicrous
is on American greed.

388
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,580
At some point he's got to come clean,
like going to be on empire. Right?

389
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,730
It's all the next season he's
going to be on empire. Well,

390
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm telling you right now, if he
shows up on a third, a third artist,

391
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,070
American greed, somebody's got to be
like ludicrous. Like, yeah. Who is he?

392
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:33,690
Who was he hanging out with you? I don't
get it. I don't know. We've got white am,

393
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,510
I don't know any white guy on that
show. That's pretty interesting, Huh?

394
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,110
I'm sure you do actually.
They just haven't shown up yet.

395
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,670
I'm sure you know or have
somehow tangently you've
been involved with some like

396
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,320
crazy American greed type dude,
but it's just so fun. I use,

397
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,440
I used to do corporate gigs. I put
one of those guys went down. Yeah, no,

398
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,090
but not if you're not.
If you donate to a fucking a campaign,

399
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,320
like a white guy working in
show business like theirs.

400
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,370
That's some point you came across
somebody that did some American greed type

401
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:08,510
shit, like that's just how it
goes. No, I don't think so.

402
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,420
I don't think they go to the
funny bones in the end. For us.

403
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,920
I think we'd just sell out
stadiums like him, theaters,

404
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,430
like venues, promoters, you
know, last one we watched,

405
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:26,540
this guy ended that he throws a party
in like Indianapolis and he has ice

406
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,750
sculptures cut into playboy of Indiana.
Yeah,

407
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,850
cut into like fucking dollar signs and
then he stood on his balcony with hundred

408
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,990
dollar bills in this. None of the
money was his and just fucking did the,

409
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,850
he made it rain. He made it rang in
like, just what I love about those,

410
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:46,850
what I find that so
fascinating about them is just,

411
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,910
just that living in the
moment and thinking like,

412
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,190
how long do you think you're going
to fucking get away with this?

413
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,800
And then they do, but then what?
Then it's always kind of funny.

414
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,110
It's just a dumb shit they buy.

415
00:24:57,111 --> 00:25:01,190
But then once they actually start showing
the people that lost, it's always like,

416
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:05,390
you know, he was a farmer.
He grew food for the cadre.

417
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,060
He never sold out to corporate farmers.
He had all hundred 70 grand.

418
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,790
He gave it all to
Ferrari. Mike, that's new.

419
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,660
They have like a nice watch.
He was well spoken.

420
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,860
I thought he was a nice person.
Yeah,

421
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,800
it's always like 120 170,000 I'd like
their entire lives and then they take it

422
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,300
and they go,
all right,

423
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:33,470
and they still get the fake fucking
spreadsheets and they immediately walk out

424
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:37,170
the door and they go buy a watch with
that. Like you really level cycle.

425
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,310
Just like does it go spend it on
themselves? Yeah, those yachts,

426
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:44,280
that $6 million yacht we saw, I was
surprised it was only 6 million bucks.

427
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,450
I didn't feel like it was really all
that for a second million dollars,

428
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:50,990
like the deck of the core and
everything and just basic to me,

429
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,270
I thought that that thing would be
like 40 million bucks. That thing. Oh,

430
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,500
it had seven bedrooms. What? Their own
bathroom on a boat. No, I know it is.

431
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,900
All that shit go mia.
Let's expensive.

432
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,130
Can you turn the fucking ac back
on please? Are you really that hot?

433
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:08,800
I was freezing my ass off when I came in.

434
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,240
I know you were in some old
lady sweater on and that's,

435
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:16,250
are you hot or you just wanted on David
Letterman had it on. Are you actually,

436
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,090
yeah, no, it's, I'm dying
in here. Really? I'm white.

437
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,030
You know it's all that hot air.
Oh,

438
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,600
to shake white people like
the fucking cold knee.

439
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,780
We do. We're pasty. We are
white like the snow. Nia.

440
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,190
All right. I wanted you to go, well,

441
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:39,650
I think there was a question that
somebody wanted to fucking ask you.

442
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,610
Where is it? Where is it? Talk about
our beautiful day by the pool today. Oh,

443
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,620
it was so nice.

444
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,650
Can we talk about fucking UFC fucking now
let's talk about 30 40 seconds of pure

445
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:58,860
domination by Ronda Rousey.

446
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,150
I didn't know shit. I didn't know what
that girl had said about her father.

447
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:06,120
That was the first,
like when you said that last night,

448
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:11,121
that was the first time I had heard that
that girl or like one of our friends

449
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:11,491
did it.

450
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:16,410
They came over last night that she said
something about her dead father and she

451
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,244
don't do that.

452
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,080
Rhonda already hates you just by virtue
of the fact that you guys are going to

453
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:22,590
fight.

454
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,270
Why would you throw fuel on that fire
by talking about her family like she

455
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,510
already just feels like if I
stepped into the record with you,

456
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,010
I want to like kill you.
Hurt everyone that like loves you.

457
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,600
That's what her mindset is.

458
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:39,660
So I don't understand why she
thought that was a good idea.

459
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,010
Strategically trying to do something like
psychological warfare when she knocked

460
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:48,950
her road and Rogan said she went
down when she got hit by a sniper,

461
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,830
I immediately that goes in
is all time fucking quotes.

462
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,850
Everybody in our living room burst out
laughing. She looked like she got shot.

463
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,331
She did.

464
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:01,200
She would fell over in that weird posture
where like you sort of in a falling on

465
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:04,860
your neck bent over at the ways
and your ass up in the air.

466
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,660
Like with you're on your
knees. Just terrible. Yeah,

467
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,550
like somehow your legs stay awake longer
than your upper body and you just go,

468
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,020
look, I respect anybody who goes
into that fucking thing. But like,

469
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,320
why the fuck would you go
in and no sale that shit.

470
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,710
Not a good idea. Well she learns.
She learns. Rhonda. I usually,

471
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,750
I usually root for an underdog,
especially when someone is so dominant.

472
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,610
You just want to see a fight or whatever.

473
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,410
But once she said all that Shit
about her dad, I was like, yeah,

474
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,580
I know what you have to a UFT.

475
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,090
I was actually upset that she
didn't get to beat her longer. Yeah.

476
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,760
Cause she deserves another like 34
seconds getting around Third Cup,

477
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,800
third punch. She had a look on her
face like Oh fuck. And I have done, I,

478
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,710
I think I said this is already over.

479
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,560
I feel like that needs to kind
of like caught her off guard.

480
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:55,710
I think she got a little winded when she
got her that like left knee to the body.

481
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,760
Kind of like cool. Not sure. Nothing
that I would have started crying. Yeah.

482
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,030
Once I got my wind back.
Um,

483
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,800
well I dunno, I can't find the lesson.
I don't see one here. Well listen,

484
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,820
your pocket has yours as the
Russia one and Ronda Rousey's dom.

485
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,850
It's just like,
it's the same thing every time.

486
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:22,440
Now it's just the same like she's
probably not going to fight it for another

487
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,470
couple of years. There's no other
woman that's lined up ready to fight.

488
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:29,940
Ronda Rousey is there, like, I don't know.
My friend said she does have another,

489
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,970
he thinks maybe she'll fight again
another six months or so, but like,

490
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:37,730
I don't know who out there can take her.
I don't know.

491
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:40,410
I don't give a shit.
Just stick somebody else in front of her.

492
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,160
It's fucking amazing

493
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,580
to watch. I don't give a fuck. Do
we look good? You have pay per view.

494
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,310
It's only 30 some seconds.
It's like you're watching a legend.

495
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,900
You're watching a fucking little and
she's already a legend at this point and

496
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,940
you're watching.
I don't even think she's in a prime.

497
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:58,690
She's do the arm bar thing all
the time and that she came in. No,

498
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:03,670
I'm buyer [inaudible] the fuck out. She
just knocked her fucking block off. Yeah,

499
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,020
this is great.
Totally fucking enjoyed it.

500
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,640
So anyways, let's, let me, I can't
find the fucking question here.

501
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,010
I like better when I
bring you on in the end.

502
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,950
Cause then we ride it out because
I always feel weird like heaven.

503
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:22,870
You swing by like we don't live
together. You know what I mean? Okay,

504
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,620
well look, you can find them.
We'll do it on Thursday. Okay.

505
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,380
Well here's something for
you. You'll even, yes,

506
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,990
I was going to talk about that Paleo Diet.

507
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,660
Those people trying to just tell us the
whole thing that you want to do Paleo.

508
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,150
I think it's fucking hilarious.
Why

509
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,750
meat and vegetables. That's pretty
much it. Well, I mean that makes sense.

510
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:49,560
But here at this fucking thing here.
Oh, by the way. So do you think the,

511
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,620
do you hope that the United States extra
dates this dentist back to Zimbabwe,

512
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,740
they feel like he should do 10 years
in prison in a hardcore prison and it's

513
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,970
going to get, he's going
to get, but Rick, I think,

514
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,250
I think he should be fine. Probably
a lot. Like a lot about fuck that.

515
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,720
I think he should be taken back.

516
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,250
It's some point you got to put a
value on animals lives. I agree.

517
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,440
It was the way you're saying he
should've gone to Jay. I think he should.

518
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:17,080
I don't think he should go
to the hardcore one. Right.

519
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,660
I think that he should go to the jail,

520
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,100
be in protective custody and through
his 10 years he should have to fix

521
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:26,530
everybody's teeth.
I think for free.

522
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,600
He said work in an animal sanctuary
like cleaning up all like the shit and

523
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:36,430
everything you can't have, it's like
having a pedophile work at a kindergarten.

524
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,510
Eventually he's going to fucking kill
some. He's telling me a whole list.

525
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,450
That's all.

526
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,450
I mean that there's not some law in
place about him going and killing that

527
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:50,380
animal because it's in there
already because I know there is,

528
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:52,570
but he left the country.
He left the country.

529
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:56,430
He's back here and now he's got to get
the United States to send one of their

530
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:57,460
own.
Now the United States,

531
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:01,690
we're not going to send the guy
because that's one of our guys.

532
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:05,440
He's got the Barcode on the back of his
neck and he's not making us any fucking

533
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,610
money if he's by us. I mean the
Illuminati guys, you know what I mean?

534
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:13,840
He's not paying any fucking a income
tax or any of that type of shit.

535
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,090
He's not walking around,
you know,

536
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:19,210
saying what he's supposed to be
saying cause he got it out of his TV.

537
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,250
You need that Zombie, you need that
guy. He's a big game hunter, that guy,

538
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,860
he's going to be on the side of those.
I gotta be honest with you,

539
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,610
I totally respect hunting. I think
it's the shit. I love animals too.

540
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:34,690
But I think if you go out and you hunt
and then you do it for food or whatever,

541
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:38,290
or you're doing it to learn how to do it.
I respect that. Go shoot a fucking deer.

542
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,010
There's a zillion of them.
They're like mosquitoes

543
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,720
but like to go out there and, and uh,
you know, shoot a lion, a Leopard Dj,

544
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,120
these beautiful fucking animals. They do
it. Me, if there was a bunch of fucking,

545
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,200
if it would herds,
a lions running along the prairies,

546
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:54,020
I mean that's what we would have on
his a 4th of July. But we're not,

547
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:58,520
we fucking killed all of them. And I
think there's really something, uh, like,

548
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:03,020
uh, I don't what this guy does, I
don't lump all hundred hunters into,

549
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,920
did he go out on his own? Was He
liked this row? We hired these guys.

550
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,560
I was going to say he hired people. Right.
So he had people who knew that Saran.

551
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,460
Those guys are fussing, guys are, are,

552
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,760
are going to trial and they're staring
at 10 years. Oh they are? Oh yeah.

553
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,290
And being a bottom.
I was going to say,

554
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,770
I know he paid somebody like an exorbitant
amount of money in order to do that.

555
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,120
He didn't just go out there on his own.
Yeah.

556
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:28,040
It was incredibly stupid of the people
who live there in this fucking guy.

557
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:28,610
I don't know.

558
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,240
He must've had the size of that duffle
bag that he must've put the fucking head

559
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:36,320
in. It's just the whole, how
does the head travel from,

560
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,500
man,
what do you do?

561
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,010
Don't know. I don't know how you'd
take your hand. Put it up his ass.

562
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,340
Like those drugs, meals, you know, I
have to fill out those little cards.

563
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,360
We travel internationally.
It's like, are you gonna?

564
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,880
Are you bringing any fruit or any
like wildlife? Right, like plants.

565
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,480
I got an elephant's that my duffle bag.

566
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,640
Do you mind if I look in
your bag sir? Uh, yes I do.

567
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,520
Do you have any liquids in there?
No.

568
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:10,970
It's all been drained and he's so
sharp optic. He didn't do any of that.

569
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,050
But the fucking with the,

570
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,820
I actually think there's something
fucking wrong with you if you have to go

571
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:21,620
around and killed the most
deadliest animals to human beings,

572
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:23,780
like walking around doing that shit.

573
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:26,750
I feel like that was an old
school like Teddy Roosevelt.

574
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,230
I'm an insecure guy and like you see

575
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,920
this like foreign land,
like isn't that the whole thing?

576
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:37,670
It's like you sort of take over the
people and the neighborhoods and like the

577
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,860
countries and then like
kill all their wildlife,

578
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:44,861
isn't it all about like I'm the big man
and I can just sort of roll nature as

579
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:48,950
well as man. I Dunno where
it's above what I can tell you.

580
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,740
The only thing I'll give him prompts was
as he used to crossbow, you know, that's,

581
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,460
but of course for, you know what, I
had to fucking laser pointer and shit,

582
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:56,750
but like I just,

583
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,910
anything that America has bigger
problems than rich people shooting lions,

584
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,590
meaning what? They shouldn't, they
shouldn't pay attention to this.

585
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,540
[inaudible] I just think there's more
important things to rally behind.

586
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,390
I don't really care. I mean, I
don't give a fuck about a line.

587
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:17,810
I give a shit about this. I, yeah,
of course I care about lions,

588
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,350
but I care about human beings more.

589
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,170
Who Do you care more about lions
or a snoop lion? Snoop Lion.

590
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,220
Yeah. I care more about snoop
lion then an actual lion. Yeah.

591
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:36,050
I guess because he is that to animal
names? Yeah. It's extra snoopy in line.

592
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,280
No, I mean I just, like I said,

593
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:43,150
I don't think it's right that he's
going over there and I'd take my end.

594
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:44,140
It's completely wrong,

595
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,770
but I think that in the league you should
be turned over given everything that's

596
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,400
going on right now.
I don't,

597
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:53,060
I can't bring myself to what's going on

598
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,570
climate in terms of like politically,
racially, all that stuff, all that stuff.

599
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:03,120
Why I was telling you how I'm afraid for
my brother to drag racial climate. Yeah.

600
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,290
I care more about that then.
Uh, Elian and Zimbabwe. I do.

601
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,620
That's just how it goes.
But I love lions.

602
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,540
Why you're looking at me like that.
It's not that confusing. No, I don't.

603
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:21,340
I'm just fascinated by, I was interested
in, I was sitting there looking at like,

604
00:36:21,341 --> 00:36:23,830
I think animals are more important
than people at this point.

605
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,340
I feel like that's the way
a lot of people's reaction.

606
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,350
They get so upset over animals.

607
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,810
I think it's a very peaceful place.
Their I,

608
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,730
or when it comes to rights,
I just swim.

609
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:39,470
Sometimes we like the rights of animals
seem to be worth more than the rights of

610
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,080
some people. And I think
that's fucked up. I don't, no,

611
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,020
they care more about lions.
You care more about Elian and snoop.

612
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,810
I care more about snoop plan than a lot.
I got nothing against snoop.

613
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,770
It was a bad
funny though.

614
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,530
No, I just think that, uh,

615
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,060
there's too many of us and I definitely
rather be in a room full of animals.

616
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,390
I think that a room full of people.
I don't live with animals. I don't,

617
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,160
and I like people.
There's just too many of us.

618
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:12,670
And the fact that we don't think we're
animals is bizarre to me because we

619
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:17,510
behave way worse than they do. Way
Worse. Yeah, that's true. Yeah,

620
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,690
we've completely,
you know,

621
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,550
bears don't change rivers and straighten
them out and fucking poison them and

622
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:28,250
build nuclear pores. Fucking
animals. We're animals. Right?
Torture. Shit. Kill Shit.

623
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,000
Kill Shit. The kill Shit. We lie and cheat
and shit. Well fucking I'm an animal.

624
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,810
Well fucking awful. But in the
same sense, too many of us,

625
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,290
I had to choose between that dentist
guy and Elian. Cause you said right,

626
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,620
she was a lion or snoop
lion and I said Snoop Lion.

627
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,710
But if I had to choose between
a lion and that dentist guy,

628
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,180
I would choose the lion racist. All
right, thank you for being here.

629
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,050
What have snoop lion killed the lion?
That would be hard.

630
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,130
But what if he just sorta,

631
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,290
he just sorta that Leesie laid
back fucking boys justified.

632
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,300
I don't know.
I just don't see snoop.

633
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,010
You gave her a lot of CD situation where
he would kill a lion because he's not

634
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:10,200
going to, even when it's not going
to fuck with Amnon what he would,

635
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,640
oh cause we don't do that. You mean
you don't do that? We don't do that.

636
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:17,450
You guys like to do that
whole racing with animals.

637
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,890
I mean listen to fuck with these shows
about like wilderness and survival and

638
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:25,230
like naked and afraid. It's
like, I mean there was,

639
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,700
there was one black dude that I saw in
the commercial but like for the most part

640
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,790
and you can always find one person that's
going to be an exception to the rule,

641
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,890
but it's like, I don't know why
white people feel like they,

642
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,740
it's a constant like fuck with animals
or like be out in nature naked.

643
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:43,760
Like we've evolved past that past that
like why are you doing it? I don't get it.

644
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,890
We're bored. Oh really?
Yeah. We don't have a cause.

645
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
We're not being oppressed.

646
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,570
So you need to give you that sort of
marijuana way. Russia 16 hours a day.

647
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:59,090
That's it. That's where we jump around
and flip around and skateboards and shit.

648
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:03,140
We're bored. Oh Jesus. That's so
terrible. And not saying it's terrible.

649
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,440
We're just bored. Generally
speaking, white people

650
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,170
remember as I showed you that
for certain income we're bored.

651
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,440
Where there's a white guy like
standing like an, I don't know,

652
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:16,680
like the Grand Canyon or someplace really
fucking scary. And it's like, you know,

653
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,240
white people will do shit like this.

654
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,750
But then they'll like cross the street
when walking on the same side with like a

655
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:25,410
black person, but they'll stand on
the ledge of some fucking, you know,

656
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:28,080
clever or like Mount Everest. It's
like, what are you guys doing?

657
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:29,070
Like what are you trying to prove?

658
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:32,510
What all that wrestling gators in
the by you like what the fuck is,

659
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,090
I don't what I love
all that and Australian

660
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,450
fucking accent. And then you brought
up the by you and fucking the world.

661
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:39,771
Well,

662
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:44,771
like why I really though it's what the
nature in the fucking with animals,

663
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:50,540
why do you do that? I mean, can't you do
that with every culture and race? Be like,

664
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,850
why do you do that?
I suppose,

665
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:56,270
but I feel like white people really
like push the envelope in terms of these

666
00:39:56,271 --> 00:40:00,000
extreme experiences in nature and like,
I don't,

667
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,320
I don't know because we,
we, we don't have any gangs.

668
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:09,110
White people have gangs. What are you
talking about? They're like a feral many.

669
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:11,810
There are many white
gangs. No, but like, okay,

670
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:16,811
name them Jesse James Gang Klu Klux Klan.

671
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:21,470
And that's again fuck white people
have gangs come on. You know,

672
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:23,000
like in certain areas like,
you know,

673
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,610
we have groups where we don't have love.

674
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,140
We have colonization governments,

675
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,470
but I should, it's like main stream.
Okay. I remember a long time ago,

676
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,370
I got this fucking hilarious
talk with Patrice. Can you,

677
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,250
can you push that thing so it's
not rattling over there? Oh my God.

678
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:47,170
This whole [inaudible] situation is,
is what we live in an old house.

679
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,561
Okay.

680
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:52,561
The fucking is rattled a little bit that
we run the acs for wheezing in here.

681
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,390
Um, oh goodness. You gotta fucking
Afghan on. I know, and I'm still cold.

682
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:01,900
That's how I got to this hilarious
RB one day, like Patrice,

683
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:04,450
when he used to just get sick
of white people, would you know,

684
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,350
he just would stop coming down to the
club for a little bit and then sometimes

685
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:12,540
he would call me up and
vent about white people. No,

686
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,730
he would vent at me representing

687
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,060
so what time

688
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,590
I'm sitting at home just being white,
you know,

689
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,090
hanging out and having a fucking
peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

690
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,190
phone fucking ranks. I pick it up and
like, hello and he just goes, Bill.

691
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,020
He goes,
what

692
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:39,050
are white people do you
need to say a log? You mean?

693
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:41,000
He goes, what? What do you do?

694
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,670
I'm like, I was like, did you just
get pulled over by a cop? Like,

695
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,380
Whoa, where's this coming from? Like
what do you mean what? What do you mean?

696
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:54,230
What do we do? Like what?
He's like, what do you do?

697
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,610
Like what do you mean the table? It's
like black people, we do this, we do that.

698
00:41:58,611 --> 00:41:59,900
What do you guys do?

699
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,770
You go has hilarious like you say.
Yeah. But the thing about it is,

700
00:42:05,771 --> 00:42:09,260
and as you answer him, I fucking
answered. I'm like, I go,

701
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:13,460
what do you mean what do we do? You just
don't recognize our shit is mainstream.

702
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,210
It's, it's like hiding in plain
sight so you don't see it.

703
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:17,861
So you don't think that,

704
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:20,270
that you don't think that there's
any sort of culture or anything?

705
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:24,590
Like what do we do? Um, the, all the
ECC, look at skateboarding. Okay.

706
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:27,260
They came from surfing, you know,
and the fucking ways weren't there.

707
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:30,560
And next thing you know, skateboarding
and totally evolved the what that is,

708
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,790
what stock card, Polynesian people
were doing. Stock car racing.

709
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,440
I'm not going to sit here and have you,

710
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:38,540
ted tried to tell me that white
people didn't come up with anything.

711
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,290
I'm just fucking do that.
All the fucking Thailand,

712
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,190
most advanced ketchup shut up.
I don't know. Skateboarding.

713
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,820
Polynesians came up with
skateboarding. I know, but escape.

714
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,640
I saw that documentary with Dogtown and
see boys and a fucking empty swimming

715
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,020
pool.
And Santa Monica,

716
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,190
but I thought it skateboarding came
from surfing and then this is an Asian

717
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:01,400
people. I don't know. I could
be wrong. He thought what?

718
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,580
It's didn't surf income from
lag indigenous people. Oh No,

719
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:08,780
I'm talking about skateboarding. I know,
but skateboarding came from surfing.

720
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,910
It was sort of derived of that.
Yes sir.

721
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,850
So saying but then surfing come from,

722
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,460
so you're saying white people
don't get credit for skateboard?

723
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,190
I didn't say that.

724
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:24,191
I was just asking who came up with
a thing that inspired skateboarding.

725
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,080
I'm just wondering,
I'm just wondering what this is like.

726
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:34,140
Literally then this becomes the argument
ended. Pamela. Patrice, alright.

727
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,740
Stock stock. Car Racing. Okay.
That came out of moonshine.

728
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,270
What does that stop motion?

729
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,190
Basically the back during prohibition
when alcohol was fucking illegal. Right.

730
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,240
What you would do is if you will
fucking bringing illegal booze,

731
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,840
moonshine, fam, you know, cross state
lines and all that type of shit.

732
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:56,420
You wanted a fast car,
but you didn't want it to look fast.

733
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,360
So what you did was it
looked like a stock car.

734
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:02,990
I guess stock car you got from Detroit
that just looks like a Chevy that looks

735
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:03,560
like a Ford.

736
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,220
But underneath the fucking hood you soup
the fucking thing up and you were able

737
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:10,100
to outrun the cops and the cops
didn't have fucking radios back then.

738
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,960
So these guys that did this shit,

739
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,090
all right would talk shit about my car
is faster than your car now it isn't blah

740
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:20,480
blah blah blah blah. So they started
racing and that started stock car racing.

741
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,730
That's a cultural fucking thing.

742
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,820
So then it's on fucking TV like so
I started listing all of that shit.

743
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,500
He was actually going late. He said,
I think at one point he went, he said,

744
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:35,460
good answer, what he said and
I just, I'm like fuck you.

745
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:39,360
I'm not asking for your approval. This
whole fucking conversation is annoying.

746
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,250
Is that car racing like something that's
very important to people? Like I said,

747
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:48,230
I a big deal. No, you're already looking
at me cause I know what you're going to,

748
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,800
I think I came out wrong. I'm not
even gonna get into this conversation.

749
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,470
I never go to go to music.

750
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:58,860
And then everything in music is somehow
going to go back to the fucking blues.

751
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:03,570
Like Beethoven heard the fucking blues
and the fucking Irish music and all that.

752
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:05,220
Like, well, if you actually
then nozzle be like,

753
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:08,670
well it all came from the Pyramids
and black people built those.

754
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,340
How would you know that?
How would you know that?

755
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,400
Because you went to [inaudible] dot com
and you fucking read shit that said you

756
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:16,530
guys did it.
Like that is the dumbest shit.

757
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:20,750
Like that whole fucking credit thing
is so fucking stupid. It's everybody.

758
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,600
Africans. So that's black. I
know. It isn't. No, they're not.

759
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,130
All right that they're African.
Yeah. So that's my point. Yeah. So,

760
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,280
so like when you see,
when you see an Egyptian guy,

761
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,090
you think that guy looks like you.
I don't know.

762
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:40,880
I feel like some of them are really, so
I'm French, German and Irish year France.

763
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,100
So yeah, I have a little bit
of French, but I'm mostly
German. Irish. Let me finish.

764
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:49,020
Oh, so I'm European. So me and Italians,
yeah, we're on the same fucking page.

765
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,890
So Ferrari. Yeah, that
was us. That was us.

766
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,080
That was pasty. Freckle guys. We did
that shit. Give me a fucking break. No,

767
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:02,250
you guys invented like vodka
and stuff like that, man. No,

768
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:07,080
no. Irish Russians. Sorry.
Sorry. I don't know. I don't,

769
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:08,760
I don't know the history,
any of that shit.

770
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,910
And I didn't want to get into this
fucking debate as more of a like a German

771
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:19,140
Irish whiskey. Um, what's the other ones?

772
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,513
Bourbon.

773
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:25,140
No Bourbon scotches from Scotland.
Bourbons.

774
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,680
Kentucky whiskey was but Egypt now,

775
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,340
but now it's from everyone's was nausea's
point. Is that, was that a true thing?

776
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:36,300
That Africa is a fucking
continent? Yeah, it is not a race.

777
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,420
It's a continent. There you go. So like,

778
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,000
can Irish people take credit for shit
that happens in Romania because they're

779
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,100
all European. I feel like there's
a reason why this is different,

780
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:49,710
but I don't know why I said I'm
not going to answer that question,

781
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,420
but I feel like, can I fucking have
that written on a tee shirt? Like,

782
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,610
I feel like an Egyptian per
se.

783
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,100
I am African or would
they say I am Egyptian?

784
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,580
They would probably say I am Egyptian,

785
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,330
but I don't know enough about all I
know is that all this is in Africa.

786
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,490
You met anybody over in Europe saying
I'm European. No, they go, I'm French.

787
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,790
That's true. I'm Swish,
Swish. I'm Swiss. This is a,

788
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,490
this is actually, this is like a toxic,
this always becomes a toxic conversation.

789
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,400
Went okay, let's try it again.
No, I'm talking about you and me.

790
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,700
I'm just saying it because I don't want
to stir up everybody cause it's very

791
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:30,130
easily, it can go off the rails.
Then it becomes this big fucking

792
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,830
race. You're a fucking racist
and all this type of shit. Um,

793
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,410
resist the urge to read too much
into this people. Um, anyways,

794
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,160
I'm just,

795
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,570
so soccer was, it was for white people
is what you were saying. No, no, no.

796
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:49,010
I'm not saying wow. You know what
I hate about this conversation?

797
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:53,170
What I hate about this conversation,
I know it's like

798
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,100
I can't find anything if I say it.
Like, they can't come back and say,

799
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,830
if I say anything, then all of a
sudden it's this, this and this.

800
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,440
There's a whole bunch of
shit that I'm leaving off

801
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,120
cause I'll then become, I'll be called
a fucking elitist. Okay. What do we do?

802
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:15,550
We fucking pretend to go the moon dust.

803
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,870
The space shuttle. That's the
shit where you just see it on TV.

804
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,050
Okay.

805
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,370
That's, that's some shit that we did. I
mean that's, that's kind of a cool, no,

806
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,460
it's amazing.
I know the astronaut's weren't rapping.

807
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,960
They didn't have this space
suits hanging off their asses.

808
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,340
I know that the kids didn't
want but the kids coolest,

809
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,960
but the kids still wanted to do it.
Get the fuck out.

810
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:45,160
He didn't want to hear you got a mother
fucker out there could be a brown with

811
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:45,671
the,
I'm just,

812
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:49,210
I'm just getting your goat cause I see
you wind to leap out of your skin right

813
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:51,000
now. Uh, I

814
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,400
hate when you do that. My brother
used to do that. What? You just say?

815
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,960
Shit to get me going.
I'm,

816
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:01,440
I'm being honest with you and
I'm saying what I'm feeling.

817
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,330
Don't just be like you think I can't
say some shit to get you going.

818
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,460
I know you can.
You do all the time.

819
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,880
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mots
stock car racing or any of that stuff.

820
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,510
That was a nice, yeah.
The thing, you know,

821
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:18,030
what the fuck do you have is one of the
greatest things about stock car racing.

822
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,530
Okay.
Is what's going on.

823
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,490
The level of intellect in the pit versus
across the racetrack sitting in the

824
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:26,010
stance.
That's why I love [inaudible] car race.

825
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,210
And is that why people think that
are elitist or something? No,

826
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,390
because you got these guys like what
the fuck they have to do because it's so

827
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:36,720
regulated now just to try to squeeze it
and then they'll fucking hundreds of a

828
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:41,160
hundredth of a second to try and win this
fucking race. The, the level of science,

829
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:46,110
physics and all that shit that's involved
that these guide the fucking egg shit

830
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:49,290
that's going on in there. And then
right across the track is just fucking,

831
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,500
I dunno,
I,

832
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,540
I went to the Indianapolis
502 years in a row.

833
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,610
I went to drag racing.
Do you know,

834
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:06,090
in between races they pull the whole
fucking engine out and rebuild the whole

835
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:10,410
goddamn thing in between. Racist.
There's a whole team of guys. Why?

836
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,660
I don't know why. Because it matters that
much. Everything has to be brand new.

837
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,340
Okay. I like that cool song you guys
made up, right? Right. I know everything.

838
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,420
Sorry. Everything has to be
fucking brand because if it isn't,

839
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,150
if it isn't a brand new fucking engine,

840
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,550
the amount of money they could cost
you that split second it costs.

841
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:33,740
She was a different, like six figures. A
lot of money. That's what they're doing.

842
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,200
When they stop and all the guys
run over and they're like, no, no.

843
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:39,050
And drag and drag race. They're,
they're changing the engine.

844
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:42,200
I thought they were just like [inaudible]
in the tires and like wiping off the

845
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:44,190
windshield.
No,

846
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,540
I'm not talking about oil
and something maybe. No, no.

847
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:53,210
In that type of racing
gentlemen. Dot. You're edging,

848
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,890
but ain't one of those little air
freshness from the rear view mirror.

849
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,400
Right. Um, you know what I'm
talking about in drag racing,

850
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,090
you know those long skinny cars
with the big fucking tires.

851
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:11,500
Then they got the parachute comes out in
the back engine, sits behind the driver,

852
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,250
finally figured out to do that. And after
years of them trying to see around it,

853
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,790
why they have a parachute though?
Don't they have breaks? They do,

854
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:21,020
but it's going 300 miles an hour.
Oh,

855
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,940
you need all the help and they don't
have flaps to put it down and you can't

856
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:26,410
reverse the engine like a plane.

857
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:31,120
And they're landing faster than a fucking
seven 47 but it doesn't weigh as much.

858
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,280
But there's other, that's all
the fucking physics. Okay.

859
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,920
And it's also probably
if they stop quicker,

860
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,460
they don't have to fucking make
as big as a track. And that saves,

861
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:41,470
the guy owns the track money,
all of this shit.

862
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:46,290
All his fucking nerdy egg
head shit. All right. Okay.

863
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,900
So this is what white people do.
They get on the fucking get off,

864
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,630
they get on a dirt bike and they've
figured out how to go off a ramp in,

865
00:51:55,631 --> 00:51:59,350
flip in the air two times over and they
landed the foam and they figure out how

866
00:51:59,351 --> 00:52:03,850
to do that and then they try to lay
it. Yeah they were, we're bored.

867
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,760
We're fucking bored.
Why people need gangs again?

868
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,560
Like if you notice like white people,

869
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,470
I thought we were in
all of this in the 20s

870
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,730
when you had the gangs in New York.
Was that the 18 hundreds of fucking book?

871
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,590
You know what it was.
I know I can really track.

872
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:27,360
Yeah, I could really trash
white people right now.

873
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,730
I can really say some mean shit about us.

874
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:35,700
Once the genocide in this country
was over and there was nothing left,

875
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,390
we just got bored and we just
started fucking with animals.

876
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:40,410
There's really something.

877
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,190
Um,

878
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,150
I mean I just feel like you're always
trying to like take over something or like

879
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:51,770
a press somebody or like hurts the one.
Like why I would say this,

880
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,670
please explain.
I don't

881
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,190
think it's a white thing.
It is an opportunity thing.

882
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,140
And most of the most opportunity
for, well, if you notice,
look at this business.

883
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,450
If you look at most
people in this business,

884
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,620
you see when they get a little something,
how it affects them.

885
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:10,020
Some people are fine with it.
A lot of people,

886
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:14,640
when they get a little bit of power, I'm
talking just getting a fucking, you know,

887
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,770
enough money to have your little personal
assistant. You know, I asked for Decaf,

888
00:53:19,771 --> 00:53:21,540
you know, and they start
doing shit like that, right?

889
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,320
And you talk and you're talking about,

890
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:29,290
it's such a fucking basic level when
you get to the upper echelon when you're

891
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,280
talking about like,

892
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:31,500
okay,

893
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,820
you're going to start a fucking war and
you're actually going to profit off of

894
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:36,654
it.

895
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,270
Yeah,

896
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:37,930
I mean,

897
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:42,420
and you go into those fucking parties
where everybody wears a mask and you sort

898
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:47,421
of walk away from your wife and come back
later and act like you didn't fuck 40

899
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:48,820
women on a pile of gold.

900
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:53,890
Like human beings can't
have to be kept in check.

901
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,440
We can handle that,
that level of power.

902
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:01,720
So it's fucked up as white people.

903
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:06,370
Look if you really read a
little bit, you know, not re,

904
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,460
I know you read all the time, but you
read about, you know, you go over to Asia,

905
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,930
you know this some characters
over there that that will uh,

906
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,130
give white people a run for
their money and I don't know.

907
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,640
Yeah, well that's a very arrogant
fucking attitude. Why don't,

908
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:25,720
why don't you read it first? Okay. I will
check out some of that stuff, you know,

909
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,200
go over there and uh, bring up Japan. Oh,

910
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:31,840
for anybody who doesn't live in Japan
about some of the shit that they did.

911
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,500
I really want to go to Japan though.
I really want to know,

912
00:54:35,501 --> 00:54:39,400
cause you saw lost in translation and
you're not going to read about it and you

913
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:43,750
got to keep that, that white people
reason why. Listen, I mean I was,

914
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,680
I mean it's definitely,

915
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:48,220
I used to do a bit in my f saying that
white people are the Jordans of evil.

916
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,390
Like every group has the most. We're
a, I dunno, we're innately good at it.

917
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:56,830
Okay.

918
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,050
Don't you want to go to Japan though?
Don't you want to see Tokyo?

919
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,400
I heard as I it, I love the food
and all that. I'm not listening.

920
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:06,100
I'm not just singling out Japan either
like there were any fucking worse than

921
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:06,671
anybody else,

922
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:11,320
but they got some characters over
there that have done some things well,

923
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:16,060
you know, between salted them a little
bit between like the stock car racing and

924
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:18,730
everything else. Like hopefully
you guys will come back from,

925
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:22,560
you know the break because
I feel like your PR rep is,

926
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,620
is asleep at the wheel.
What do you mean? Listen,

927
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,560
one of the great things about being
white is you just don't give a shit what

928
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:32,260
other people think about
you really. Clearly. Yeah.

929
00:55:32,261 --> 00:55:36,400
I don't give a fuck what you think.
Why would I give a shit?

930
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,650
You know what I mean? Where's my
question? That was supposed to be asked.

931
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,440
I'm trying to find it right now.
Yeah.

932
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:49,650
I went easy on you, by the way, with
skateboarding and stopped and stuck.

933
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:52,140
I went easy. I could've,
I could've, you know,

934
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,300
I could have bought the other
shit you bring up though.

935
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:58,740
Then it gets considered fucking racist.
Even if it happened. I say, well,

936
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:03,180
we would have done that if we
had the opportunity day, right?

937
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,780
Isn't that what all the
women say? No, no, no.

938
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:11,090
I would have bench press 600 pounds
if I was allowed to go to a gem.

939
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,760
Oh, wow. Oh Wow.

940
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,140
Oh my God. How funny. Was it last night?
We're not going to name names here. Okay,

941
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:24,150
but after the fight, when my buddy
right me, my buddy are hanging

942
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:28,500
out, I'm in my late forties he's
in his early fifties fuck you.

943
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:33,160
I'm not going to say anybody's
name. No, no, no, no.

944
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,320
Nia, Nia bell. Oh God.

945
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:40,920
You're such a fucking party pooper.
That was just the generation gap.

946
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:43,750
There was fucking hilarious.
Anyway.

947
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,850
All right. I can do some advertising here
before you fucking all right. Oh my God.

948
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,360
It's almost an hour over.
It's almost over. No,

949
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:57,780
I'm saying the hour is almost over.
I have like fucking verbal dyslexia.

950
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:58,614
Can't even talk.

951
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,580
So you're going to walk out here and just,

952
00:57:02,581 --> 00:57:04,300
you just don't think white
people have done anything.

953
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:05,890
Not like culturally.

954
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,550
Is there anything that we get credit for
artistically that it's that spike Lee

955
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,080
or some other grumpy guy with black frame
glasses isn't going to come along and

956
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:18,690
say, well actually a fucking, uh,

957
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:20,390
okay.

958
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,330
Pine top Johnson fucking did that right?

959
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:27,360
Originally I feel like you guys probably
were the ones that started like using

960
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,450
like a jug,
like blowing on a Jag as an instrument.

961
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,820
Hey.
Like I feel like that was a,

962
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,410
that sounds like a white invention.
Not Invention,

963
00:57:40,411 --> 00:57:44,290
but just like blowing on it somehow.
Like we stopped with this passage.

964
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,650
Ways of drinking.
Like all the moon moonshine.

965
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:48,090
Remember you talked
about moonshine earlier.

966
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,150
I ain't drinking moonshine and then
putting it down and going, Ooh.

967
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:55,730
That was a lot of moonshine and it was
like, oh, that makes a, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

968
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,000
And then you came up with that.

969
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,150
Okay.

970
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,230
No wonder why you married.

971
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,650
Well,

972
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,900
okay, I'm going to leave
you to do advertising. Okay.

973
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,670
Why don't you go read up on some things,

974
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,410
okay.

975
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,243
Huh.

976
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:24,190
Oh, how smart was that? I did not take
the bait. Didn't take the bait. All right.

977
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:26,050
Dollar Shave Club. Everybody.
I've got to tell Ya.

978
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,480
Shaving the old way socks all la,
it hurts.

979
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:34,190
She'll lather up with cheap foam wincing.

980
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,980
His hair is scraped from your face
with those old worn out raises,

981
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,460
you won't throw away because
they cost so damn much.

982
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,110
Not Anymore.

983
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:44,510
Okay.

984
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:47,960
Dollar Shave Club's sends
amazing razors for a few bucks.

985
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:49,783
What

986
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:54,280
sounds amazing, razors to you. Where

It's completely changes the game. Forget
foam. This stuff is the real deal.

992

1125
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,260
Motley crew went there.
You Ready to party?

1126
01:07:17,261 --> 01:07:22,180
Myerscough on MTV here.
Mill hair.

1127
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:25,270
Metal scene. Oh, white people
definitely came up with that. Yeah.

1128
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,920
Dressing up like a lady in singing rock

1129
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,660
Santa Claus came up with that and
then send it. Loves it was like, uh,

1130
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:39,380
no. Not like, I dunno, it's Santa Claus
Black. No, it's from another country now.

1131
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,490
It's not going to say, that'd be the
corniest name ever for a black guy.

1132
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,860
All right. Hey Billy, come here
at first. Blah, blah, blah.

1133
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:46,180
I'm pretty sure you
never think about Russia.

1134
01:07:46,181 --> 01:07:49,040
I know it's very unlikely for an
English speaking comedian to visit,

1135
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:52,280
but Dylan Moran and Eddie Izzard did it.
A copy of any ins.

1136
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:57,040
It probably did it in Russian.
Guys like Albert Einstein telling jokes,

1137
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,650
did it, did it a couple of years
ago and it turned out great.

1138
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:03,340
Well if you decide to come here after all,
you should not, you should bring near,

1139
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,950
sorry, I just, my eyes went
to Nia and I saw the end.

1140
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:09,460
You should bring me and
visit Saint Petersburg.

1141
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:13,120
Not only because that's the second
largest city in Russia and I lived there,

1142
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:17,220
but because of the beautiful
lots of museums. I hate museums.

1143
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,950
I hate museums. Fucking
going there looking at plates
and shit. This is spoiled.

1144
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:24,900
Somebody who is in the 1500 so yeah,

1145
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:30,210
you can see the beginning of the microwave
on a structure and all that crap.

1146
01:08:30,211 --> 01:08:31,380
I think she just love it here.

1147
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:35,970
I also hope you'll get at least considered
St Pete as it's not far away from

1148
01:08:35,971 --> 01:08:39,480
Scandinavia and everything here has
become way cheaper for tourists because of

1149
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:40,314
our weak currency.

1150
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,920
Now it a Saint Petersburg then that
used to belong to Finland and they beat

1151
01:08:43,921 --> 01:08:44,940
Russia in World War II,

1152
01:08:44,941 --> 01:08:48,480
but they were down with Hitler and then
they had to give up that part or is that

1153
01:08:48,481 --> 01:08:52,170
something else? I have no idea. Oh,
that's right. Yeah. Why would you

1154
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,910
pussy riot is playing somewhere.
I'd love to check them out.

1155
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,540
Why would you do that?
Why would I do what?

1156
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,310
Okay. Go See Pussy, right? Brooklyn.

1157
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,850
Put some fucking nerdy white kid that
wants to be naked on TV for six months.

1158
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,700
That's what you do. You don't see
it in Russia where you get arrested.

1159
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,060
You're show when clam

1160
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:17,470
can't show your claim. And Russia,
uh, on the, on the unrelated note,

1161
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:21,450
I subscribed to Netflix just to
watch your show last December, uh,

1162
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,580
because you just couldn't stop
bitching about the pirating.

1163
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:26,080
Like how he turns it around on me.

1164
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:29,860
Like I'm the asshole and Netflix
is not even available in Russia.

1165
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:34,360
So I have to use the v P N and shit.
Oh, poor fucking baby. Uh, he goes,

1166
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:35,440
see how much we love you here.

1167
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:39,220
Please come to our beautiful and totally
not hostile country and see it for

1168
01:09:39,221 --> 01:09:42,550
yourself. That's not what a cab driver
told me when I was over there in Europe.

1169
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:45,730
Say, you've got to be careful in
Moscow after dark, but then again,

1170
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:48,520
you gotta be careful here. Uh,
please come to our beautiful,

1171
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:50,930
totally know how always be,
yeah. What the fuck for?

1172
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,530
I'd love to see you Saint Petersburg.
I think that'd be really cool.

1173
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,760
It'd be funny if it's a totally fucked
up city and this guy hates me and he just

1174
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:01,810
learns me over there.
Beats me over the head with my mixer.

1175
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:07,870
All right. Female coach
a Billy Butkus. Uh,

1176
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:12,790
thoughts on the cardinals hiring a
female coach? I hear she can take a hit.

1177
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,540
Thinks she's got what it takes
or is it a publicity stunt?

1178
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,600
What does that mean?
Take a hit?

1179
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:24,450
I think it's football. I had no idea that
they did it. You didn't read about this?

1180
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:29,430
I, I know I tapped out on the news during,
during Hillary Clinton, Bruce Jenner,

1181
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:31,320
and somewhere around
there. I just, I, I just,

1182
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,300
I've been too busy to
watch anything on that.

1183
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,540
I heard that there was a woman that was
hired to be an NFL coach, but I don't,

1184
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:40,600
you know, I don't follow football. So, um,

1185
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,070
that seems like a very big deal.
Why?

1186
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,320
Because they've never had
a female coach before.

1187
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,750
Yes.
But how is it like,

1188
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:53,950
how is that going to
affect wins and losses?

1189
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,170
It probably won't. I probably
won't matter what gender you are.

1190
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,350
You like to be a gold rush. Yeah.
Yeah. But it's, it's still like, um,

1191
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:07,640
it's never been done before.
So it's historical, right?
Yes, it is. It is a store.

1192
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,680
We have Alexa. We have yet to
learn any lessons, if any just yet.

1193
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,060
But it's a deal that it's happening.

1194
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:17,080
It's a publicity stunt.
It's not a publicity,

1195
01:11:17,081 --> 01:11:18,440
so I'm not saying she's not qualified,

1196
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:23,441
but this is what the NFL is a corporation
and every quarter they have to have a,

1197
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:27,230
a show,
a game.

1198
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,740
That's just how a corporation works
and they try and make more money.

1199
01:11:30,741 --> 01:11:35,570
So they have reached every possible
fucking football fan. All right.

1200
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,400
They did that years ago.

1201
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:42,800
So then they started bringing in people
like Brittany Spears to sing during the

1202
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:43,610
Superbowl,

1203
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:46,700
just trying to get people hooked on
it and then they wear pink for a whole

1204
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:48,140
fucking month now.

1205
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:50,600
That getting in with trying to get in
with the ladies to try to get more.

1206
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:51,081
It's just,
it's,

1207
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:56,081
I think it's a business move that's going
to be disguised as a forward thinking.

1208
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,640
I'm not saying she's bad and
not qualified or anything,

1209
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:01,730
but I just think that that's why
they're going to do that. Um,

1210
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,990
I don't give a shit. I don't
have, I don't give a fuck if she,

1211
01:12:05,991 --> 01:12:10,970
if she's good and they win that,
I think it's a good move if she stinks.

1212
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,320
Uh, unfortunately, uh, all the other
women behind her, we'll be judged.

1213
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:16,970
So I imagine she has a lot of pressure.

1214
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,360
It's just weird when you go into the
locker room, you know what I mean?

1215
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,050
Everybody's standing there with their
dicks out and shit. You know what I mean?

1216
01:12:24,051 --> 01:12:28,490
Now they got a cover up.
It's weird.

1217
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:29,761
Uh,

1218
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:32,910
you'd rather they just be able to stand
around with their dicks out and not have

1219
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:33,990
to worry about covering up.

1220
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,400
Well, I mean, I don't think like that.

1221
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:39,550
Does the male coach walk
into the females locker room?

1222
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:41,350
Is this sitting there taking
off their sports bras?

1223
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,500
Probably not. I go, look,

1224
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,740
we gotta get out there and the
second half and shave your clap

1225
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:50,270
prob probably not.

1226
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:54,580
Definitely not them afterwards.
Definitely not. Not In the lot.

1227
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:57,340
So she probably does the same
thing. Definitely not. Yeah.

1228
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:59,540
And they're like talking to
them like there's no way,

1229
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:03,870
but then that then that hurts her as
a coach that she can't go in there and

1230
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,130
they're standing there with their dicks
out cause she's done hurt her as a coach

1231
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,150
because they go in there and they
discuss strategy during halftime.

1232
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,790
You go into the locker room,
but talk about that. Are
they naked during halftime?

1233
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,240
No, but after the game you talk about
the next week and that type of shit.

1234
01:13:17,241 --> 01:13:19,070
But somebody got hurt.
They, it's a locker room.

1235
01:13:19,071 --> 01:13:20,930
Somebody's got their dick
out and it just happened.

1236
01:13:20,931 --> 01:13:23,690
Somebody got to take a shit at
halftime. It fuck, it happened.

1237
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,360
I guess that's what I was wondering.
Do you have to be Naked Jessica?

1238
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:29,300
You're in the locker room. Yeah.
And this is what's going to happen.

1239
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,710
This is what's going to
be all the adjustment.

1240
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:36,310
They're just going to keep
adjusting it. Okay. Yeah.

1241
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:41,210
And then a guy can't have his dick out
and I'm fucking men's locker room. Oh,

1242
01:13:41,211 --> 01:13:44,240
the justice of it. You see what
I'm saying though? You guys

1243
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:48,800
just keep encroaching, encroaching,
encroaching, encroaching, and then yeah,

1244
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:53,160
we always have to adjust to you.
You guys do not adjust to us. Well,

1245
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,480
if you're walking into
a men's locker room,

1246
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,510
there's going to be a dick out and
you're going to have to eat it.

1247
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,090
Fucking deal with it. Okay. Or You have
somebody go in there and take some notes.

1248
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:05,470
I'm sure she's prepared to deal
with aid. Dixon are out. I'm sure.

1249
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:10,400
I'm sure it'll be fine. Uh, I don't
know if she needs to worry you guys.

1250
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:13,840
You guys obsessed with
us? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1251
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:16,710
You're obsessed with keeping your dick
out in the locker rooms and know about,

1252
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,540
you know, I'm so, you guys
are obsessed with us. Yeah.

1253
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:21,760
We're totally obsessed with you gas.

1254
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,980
Why can't you guys just start your own
shit and fucking go do that? We'll start.

1255
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:30,550
I start carb company. Why? Why
do you guys always have to come?

1256
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:34,600
It's a men's football league.
There was a woman's football league.

1257
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:38,930
I wouldn't give a fuck. I got to get
in there. Stand next to some clamps,

1258
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,920
strategy.
I'd like you have your fucking deal.

1259
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,650
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
and the most loving way ever.

1260
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,633
Fuck.

1261
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:53,410
Can you fuck off for
three hours on a Sunday?

1262
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:57,820
Can we just have a minute?
Jesus Christ,

1263
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,990
the shit that said in a locker room.
[inaudible] going to get offended there.

1264
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:06,250
I love it. I love it. The NFL is doing
this. I guarantee there's going to be sub.

1265
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,630
Something fucked up happens.

1266
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,840
There's going to be a lawsuit then that
happen years ago it happened in Boston,

1267
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,380
right?
The fucking,

1268
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:18,850
the woman went in there and these guys
acted like fucking immature idiots and

1269
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:22,070
then there was a lawsuit. Then she had
to go to New York. It was a funny guy.

1270
01:15:22,071 --> 01:15:26,320
Have to sell the team was nuts.
I Dunno.

1271
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:30,280
I Dunno where I told talking about
Dick's being out in the locker room.

1272
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:35,410
Yeah. Nothing good. Very bad can happen
about that. Yeah. Jesus quite near.

1273
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:38,680
I'm uncomfortable in a fucking
locker room. I go to the Goddamn Gym.

1274
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:43,120
You fucking go in there. Okay,
you're staring at your eyelids,

1275
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,410
but eventually you're going to
walk by somebody taller than you.

1276
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,290
It's going to be hanging down.
You're in a men's locker room,

1277
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:57,220
you're going to see a dick.
It's, it's happened. I'm
don't like talk to each other,

1278
01:15:57,221 --> 01:16:00,940
like make it in the locker rooms.
Oh, the other day I went to this is,

1279
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,770
that's created guy. Well, this is not,

1280
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,440
there's also a generational thing
as far as being comfortable,

1281
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:12,670
being naked around another man in a
locker. Like the old guys don't care.

1282
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:17,140
They don't give a fuck. Yeah, they do.
They grew up in the little rascals error.

1283
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:22,260
They like the parent's bedroom and then
all the kids slept in the same fucking

1284
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:26,380
bed with the dog and like
a fucking wolverine. Right.

1285
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:31,960
Then you had my generation, I was born in
the last generations that in gym class,

1286
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,210
the guys gym class,

1287
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:38,170
you went in and when you showered it was
just this communal fucking shower and

1288
01:16:38,171 --> 01:16:39,790
you do winning there
like a bunch of cattle,

1289
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,910
no stalls or anything.
Everyone's just ends.

1290
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,910
There's way in there and there's a bunch
of like showerheads all around but no

1291
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:52,270
stalls. And then, and that's, that
started in sixth grade. I remember,

1292
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:55,810
I have never been in the first week
like that book look around like that.

1293
01:16:55,870 --> 01:17:00,400
The first week of gym class,
only like six kids had the fucking balls,

1294
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:04,120
no pun intended to take the shower and
they went into the shower and it was wide

1295
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:06,520
open. Like all the lockers
were all away around it.

1296
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:09,750
The school I went to so you could like,
they walked in that dude

1297
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,240
and me and like there
was like six other guys.

1298
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:15,180
We were laughing hysterically.

1299
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,930
These are kids I knew all the way through
grade school and they can't walk up by

1300
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:21,630
butt ass naked.
And that's the thing about a naked guy.

1301
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,940
It's either the funniest thing ever
are absolutely terrified the spending

1302
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:31,410
on the situation. And it
was fucking hilarious. But
after like two, three weeks,

1303
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,330
it was normal and no one gave a shit
and that we were part of the last

1304
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,370
generation and we thought
it was like when we,

1305
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,890
I remember we heard like the women's gym,

1306
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:45,000
they had their own little private showers,
which was weird to me.

1307
01:17:45,001 --> 01:17:47,220
You'd think the guys would
be fucking more weirded out.

1308
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:50,220
We were actually more advanced
than you guys. More mature.

1309
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,790
We could all shower together. It'd be
after the first week and be mature.

1310
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,770
I don't know if that's
what that really means.

1311
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:59,360
What does it mean that we're
all seeking that you know,

1312
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,340
you're all animals and just throw you
in there and hose it down. I know.

1313
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:06,960
That's really what it was.
Yeah. Fucking animals. Yeah.
So anyways, so there's this,

1314
01:18:06,961 --> 01:18:10,680
there's different levels of uh,
like generational,

1315
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:13,650
you know what I mean?
That guys,

1316
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:17,040
we'll just like old
guys don't give a fuck.

1317
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:18,960
They don't give a shit.
Fuck.

1318
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:22,820
And then there's the weird guy
who also doesn't give a fuck.

1319
01:18:22,821 --> 01:18:26,760
You don't know what he's doing.
That guy you come walking in, right?

1320
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:31,740
The Gym I go to like you can see like
you come walking in the lockers or to the

1321
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:36,741
right and then straight ahead is like
the sink area with the mirror and shit.

1322
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,371
And like,
you know,

1323
01:18:38,371 --> 01:18:41,730
I walked in there one time and there was
a guy standing there completely naked

1324
01:18:41,731 --> 01:18:43,290
except flip flops shaving

1325
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,810
and I just, I walked in, I just, and
I just went yesterday. He really,

1326
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:54,380
he can't fucking just
throw a towel on anyways.

1327
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,773
I'm just saying.

1328
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,513
Okay.

1329
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:03,480
Dick's be out in the locker
room. Big Green Egg. Hey Bill,

1330
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,880
congratulations on the new big green egg.

1331
01:19:05,881 --> 01:19:09,600
Actually he's had it for a couple of
years. Uh, I'm not by any means an expert,

1332
01:19:09,601 --> 01:19:13,050
but I've been experimenting since December
with my, based on your description,

1333
01:19:13,051 --> 01:19:17,520
we have about the same setup egg, the
guru with two probes and a fan rib rack,

1334
01:19:17,521 --> 01:19:21,650
et Cetera. I also have a pan that I
keep water and Yep, I've seen that. Um,

1335
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,800
made you put on the plate setter, right.
Uh, and put it in there while I'm smoking.

1336
01:19:25,801 --> 01:19:28,800
All right, so he says, I put it
on top of the smokey plate. Yes.

1337
01:19:28,801 --> 01:19:30,600
Just like I've seen in the youtube videos,
he goes,

1338
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:32,460
I'm not sure how much of
a difference it makes,

1339
01:19:32,461 --> 01:19:36,870
but it seems to keep the inside of the
big green egg pretty human and it catches

1340
01:19:36,871 --> 01:19:38,790
a lot of the drippings.
A few pointers.

1341
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:43,590
Keep the charcoals at the line.
All right, that's the Philip line.

1342
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:50,310
I think that's what they said. Um, soak
the chips, but don't soak the chunks.

1343
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,290
Um, you can soak the chunks, but
they smoke just fine without soaking.

1344
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,990
Yeah, it's Hickory. It just smokes, right?

1345
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,850
It's easy to get the big green egg hotter,

1346
01:19:59,851 --> 01:20:02,070
but really hard to get
the temperature lower.

1347
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:06,210
If you overshoot the temperature
is all about air flow.

1348
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:11,200
The top on a slow cook, two 25 ish
is cracked to about a quarter inch.

1349
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:14,170
This is what I've seen on youtube.
When you clean out the Ash,

1350
01:20:14,171 --> 01:20:15,700
make sure you have it cleaned.

1351
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,640
You've cleared all the holes
in the bottom of the grill.

1352
01:20:18,641 --> 01:20:21,700
They can usually clog up and the big
green egg won't perform like it usually

1353
01:20:21,701 --> 01:20:24,610
does. This is if you're going to
smoke something, uh, for ribs.

1354
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:28,000
I've had luck with the yellow
mustard spice rub combo. Dude,

1355
01:20:28,001 --> 01:20:30,340
you watch the same fucking youtube videos.
I,

1356
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,470
this is the video you
showed me with the mustache.

1357
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,970
Prep the ribs the night before.

1358
01:20:33,971 --> 01:20:37,580
Make sure you remove the membrane from
the ribs before you rub it down and make

1359
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:41,020
sure the ribs out of the fridge and let
them get to room temperature before you

1360
01:20:41,021 --> 01:20:41,880
slap them on the smoker.

1361
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:44,470
Usually it takes about eight
hours or so for three racks.

1362
01:20:44,471 --> 01:20:48,820
I can't wait to try this by just set the
temperature to two 25 and let them go

1363
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,470
until the ribs get to one 90.

1364
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:55,400
I wrapped them in foil and let them
rest about 20 minutes. Uh, dude, I,

1365
01:20:55,401 --> 01:20:58,210
I can't, I cannot fucking wait to do
that. I'm going to get good at that shit.

1366
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:03,760
I want to try ribs in a pork
shoulder this month, hopefully. Oh,

1367
01:21:03,761 --> 01:21:06,090
plea out. Um, all right,

1368
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,070
let's get through this because this
thing is going to take forever for me to

1369
01:21:09,071 --> 01:21:13,510
upload. All right. Uh, yeah.
You want to go? Yeah. All right.

1370
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:18,580
Good to see you. That was, that was
a fun one. I love the jug thing.

1371
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,030
That was a jug thing was good.
I felt pretty strongly about that joke.

1372
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:27,910
You got so passive aggressive
you like so like Ah,

1373
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:31,560
fuck it wanted that Ronda Rousey
fest when she could talks about, uh,

1374
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,330
you know when she talks about,
I always say everybody's name.

1375
01:21:34,331 --> 01:21:36,780
Am I saying his name right?
Rhonda Rousey? Yeah. Alright.

1376
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:40,960
But she fucking kids said fucking
dead. Look on her face like, yeah.

1377
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:46,240
Destruction is about to happen.
All right. Eating help. Oh,

1378
01:21:46,241 --> 01:21:48,700
by the way, most of those fights
kind of stuck on that one.

1379
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:52,630
Except for that one where the guy's
ended just doing the rock 'em sock.

1380
01:21:52,631 --> 01:21:56,770
'Em bleeding all over each other.
That was my wife fucking freaks out.

1381
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:58,130
Yeah.

1382
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,580
When that shit happens. Not and like
freaking out. Like, oh my God. Gross.

1383
01:22:01,581 --> 01:22:06,450
She loves it. Standing Up,
screaming at the TV. Grounded pound.

1384
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:08,860
Grounded pound. Yes. I fucking love it.

1385
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:10,570
Yeah.

1386
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:15,010
Lunatic. All right. Eating help.
Dear bill, Bill's in roses.

1387
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:18,730
Hello from Wisconsin. Ah, badges.

1388
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:22,150
I'm 22 year old factory worker and,
and guitarist.

1389
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:23,140
Yeah.

1390
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:23,973
Jesus Christ.

1391
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:28,030
I used to work in a fucking warehouse
and I played drums with a bunch of

1392
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:31,660
musicians. How do you guys always
end up in the fucking factory?

1393
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:35,230
All of their factories in a warehouse.
Bill, just read the God damn question.

1394
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,110
All right. I've been a fan of yours
for five to six years and one of first,

1395
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:40,690
thank you for everything you've
put out, right? All right.

1396
01:22:40,691 --> 01:22:45,090
Nothing looking forward toF is for family.
Got To get that plug in there. Okay. Uh,

1397
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:49,810
the reason I'm writing to you is I,
for my entire 22 years of existence of,

1398
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:52,430
had a hard, have had a hard gut. Okay.

1399
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,150
Okay.

1400
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:58,390
That I never ever been able to shake off
earning myself the nickname teapot at

1401
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:02,520
an early age for my short
and stout appearance. Oh God.

1402
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:03,780
That's hilarious.

1403
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:09,230
I'm little tea pot short and stout and
they started calling you teapot. Oh,

1404
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:12,200
you started have fantasies of
murdering all of them. Anyways,

1405
01:23:12,201 --> 01:23:13,280
I wouldn't say I'm obese,

1406
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:16,970
but I'm certainly starting to lose the
battle of the bulge while I get a bit of

1407
01:23:16,971 --> 01:23:20,810
exercise from work and hit the gym once
in a while. My Diet is complete shit.

1408
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,830
The thing is, I was raised on takeout
fast food and fried fats. Dude,

1409
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,420
the fact that you're not a big
teapot is a pretty amazing,

1410
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,460
they're so that's already a victory.
He says,

1411
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:35,330
I literally don't know how or what to
eat or where to start for that matter.

1412
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:36,921
All right,

1413
01:23:36,921 --> 01:23:39,650
well I would go on the Internet and
I would start looking up nutrition.

1414
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:44,570
All right, shocker. That this Wisconsin
native is a shitty eater, most, uh,

1415
01:23:44,571 --> 01:23:49,130
where most of the population it looks
like they could play old line for Mr.

1416
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,720
Rogers and the packers.
Uh,

1417
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,830
could you please give a few days worth of
meals to eat to lose pounds? I figured,

1418
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,620
I figured now is the time to get in shape.
Absolutely.

1419
01:23:57,621 --> 01:24:02,390
And attract acuity so I can
start to build my empire. Uh,

1420
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,300
all right. Ps, Tom Brady is innocent
and anyone who thinks otherwise,

1421
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:08,420
it's just subset cause they have to
watch their team eat shit every Sunday.

1422
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,350
Unlike our powerhouse dynasty teams,
best luck.

1423
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:14,900
Best of luck to Brady and the Patriots.
Organizations see that?

1424
01:24:14,901 --> 01:24:16,790
See that what happens when you
give respect to the packers,

1425
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:20,480
the true New York Yankees
of the fucking NFL?

1426
01:24:20,481 --> 01:24:24,020
Cause they want all they want in every
fucking error other than the 20 years

1427
01:24:24,021 --> 01:24:27,590
after a Lombardi and Bart Starr,

1428
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,560
you know, they went to
Lynn Dickey, the magic man,

1429
01:24:31,561 --> 01:24:36,180
and then they got Brett Farve and
then it's been all good. These two P,

1430
01:24:36,181 --> 01:24:39,280
they fucking won championships
in the 1930s all the way through.

1431
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:42,190
I've already read off all their
fucking champion NFL championships,

1432
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,310
super bowl championships,
whatever championship existed,

1433
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:48,850
whatever era they fucking want it and they
won more than anybody else. All right,

1434
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:53,760
here we go. Yeah. All right. Um,
well, all right. This is what I,

1435
01:24:53,761 --> 01:24:57,480
everyday what I've been doing
is I have oatmeal and a banana.

1436
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,560
I don't put anything in the OATMEAL.
No milk, no sugar, no honey,

1437
01:25:01,561 --> 01:25:04,290
none of that fucking shit.
I have that.

1438
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:07,350
And then for a snack between
that and lunch, I have an apple.

1439
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:10,770
And then for lunch I have a
sandwich with a side salad.

1440
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:15,150
Sometimes I just have the
meat and no bread. Um,

1441
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,420
and that's a fun,
you know,

1442
01:25:17,421 --> 01:25:20,480
I weigh myself every day and I try to
lose two to three pounds and if I feel

1443
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:24,430
like I'm off course I won't
have the fucking bread. MMM hmm.

1444
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,760
And I dunno between like fucking a lunch
and dinner. I don't know what I have.

1445
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:32,010
I usually try to eat something healthy.

1446
01:25:32,011 --> 01:25:35,940
If the worst thing I'll do is maybe cereal
or I'll scramble a couple of eggs and

1447
01:25:35,941 --> 01:25:39,630
then for dinner a they go totally veggie
or I do the protein the size of my hand,

1448
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:43,020
my hand, a palm of my hand I
should say. And a side salad,

1449
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:46,860
none of this shit is groundbreaking.
You can find all of that online.

1450
01:25:46,861 --> 01:25:51,480
And I tried to stop beating like
around six ish, around six o'clock.

1451
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:54,300
After that I just drink
water the whole night.

1452
01:25:54,301 --> 01:25:59,070
And if I'm hungry I have pre cut celery
sticks in the refrigerator that I will

1453
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:02,970
either just eat those or if I'm really
feeling kind of more hungry than that,

1454
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:07,430
I will have like half a
spoon or a spoonful of peanut
butter and you fucking do

1455
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:11,180
that and you add cardio. The fats
got nowhere to go, at least for me,

1456
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:14,720
and it's just been fallen off my body.
Although I'm still disgusting, man.

1457
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:18,530
I could still sit here and just grab a
nice fucking handful, but whatever, man,

1458
01:26:18,531 --> 01:26:23,180
I've lost 10.2 lbs. 10 point I'm
shaving down the ham here people.

1459
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:28,370
All right. Boston hates the Olympics.
This is the last one. Uh, Hey,

1460
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:33,140
the ability gym rat. I read Boston won
the bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games,

1461
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:35,390
but the city couldn't get
the citizen's behind it.

1462
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:38,810
Apparently Boston residents don't
want the games to be held there.

1463
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,880
I thought that was weird because Boston
always seems very proud of America to me.

1464
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:46,670
I figured they'd be stoked
about hosting the Games.

1465
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:50,180
They root for a team called the Patriots
but have little or no interest in

1466
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:52,580
watching America's
finest athletes compete.

1467
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:56,090
I would like to hear your take on this
and I'd also like to know what position

1468
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:59,300
you take on the, or if you were living
back east. Thanks and go fuck yourself.

1469
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,780
Yeah. What kind of fucking more on
once the Olympics in their town.

1470
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,960
You don't want the Olympics in your town.

1471
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:10,880
You want yet the Olympics in the city
that's close to you so you can drive to

1472
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:13,430
it. If you want to go see it,
like I wouldn't want it in Boston.

1473
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:17,270
I that put it in Hartford. I don't
want to deal with that fucking traffic.

1474
01:27:17,271 --> 01:27:18,920
The traffic's already fucked up as it is.

1475
01:27:18,921 --> 01:27:20,960
You don't need a bunch of people
coming over here and it's not,

1476
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:24,930
is it the Winter Olympics at least
Olympic hockey would be the shit,

1477
01:27:24,931 --> 01:27:29,420
but nobody gives a fuck about track.
The high jump and all of that shit.

1478
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:30,254
I don't want to see that.

1479
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,470
I like the Winter Olympics and even
then fucking put it in New Hampshire,

1480
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:35,540
there's too much traffic in Boston.

1481
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,440
They got like 40 highways and they all
fucking merge right at the TD bank,

1482
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:41,960
North Garden and there's no way to go.

1483
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:45,570
They stuck it all underground because
it's so fucking annoying to look at and

1484
01:27:45,571 --> 01:27:48,980
they put a park over the top of but on
top of the thing and they try to act like

1485
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:52,730
it isn't happening. It's a
complete fucking shit show. Yeah,

1486
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,810
it's a shit show when there isn't
the Olympics. All right? We don't,

1487
01:27:56,811 --> 01:28:00,350
we don't need that shit. We don't
need that shit. All right, fuck that.

1488
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:02,870
You want the Olympics? You take
him, we'll come and visit you.

1489
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,630
You know what I mean?
That's like that old analogy I said,

1490
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:08,540
my brother taught me about having a
boat. He's like, you don't have a boat.

1491
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,190
You want to have a friend who has a boat.

1492
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:13,670
Then you just show up with the 12 pack
and you're a hero and then you fucking

1493
01:28:13,671 --> 01:28:14,630
leave at the end of the day.

1494
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:17,360
And he's got to deal with the
barnacles and doc in the fucking thing.

1495
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,130
That's the same thing with the Olympics.

1496
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:20,690
You don't want the Olympics in your city.

1497
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:23,360
The only people want the
Olympics in the city. Uh,

1498
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:26,390
that people that make money off of
building the tents and the shit that the

1499
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:30,050
people at the tents, the fucking
stay. Those people want it there.

1500
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:33,290
Nobody else wants it fucking there.
And by the way,

1501
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,540
they're not the finest fucking athletes.
Okay?

1502
01:28:35,541 --> 01:28:38,720
The finest fucking athletes get paid.
You know what I mean?

1503
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,210
They're professional at.
These are amateurs. It's a
fight. It's sports. Open mic.

1504
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:48,700
Who the fuck wants to watch that and have
it tie up traffic? All right, everybody.

1505
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,640
That's how I feel on that shit.
Um, I hope you enjoyed that debate,

1506
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:57,380
that fun debate I just had with the,
uh, um, what was I going to say?

1507
01:28:57,381 --> 01:29:00,380
What else do I go? Am I keep saying
it's fun? So I just plead, please don't.

1508
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:03,450
If you've got to be ugly about it,
just write to somebody else's podcast.

1509
01:29:03,451 --> 01:29:05,820
Just trying to have a good sense
of humor about the shit. Okay?

1510
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:10,500
We've all contributed in their own little
way, culturally, racially, humanly,

1511
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:13,800
all of that. All right? Don't be
fucking morons. All right. So anyways,

1512
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:18,120
that's a podcast for this fucking week.
Um,

1513

doe ray me for a, you know,

1518
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,540
I don't know what for
driving traffic there.

1519
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:43,680
And then I kick a good 10% over to the
saint Jude's hospital and everybody wins.

1520
