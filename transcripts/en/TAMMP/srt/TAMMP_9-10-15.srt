1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,570
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,350
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,351 --> 00:00:10,270
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and I am

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,380
just checking in on you everybody.
Um,

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,720
Oh God, I don't know any
other way to fucking say it.

6
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:26,220
I'm just going to have a recording
of it. Um, yeah, just checking on.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,160
You look at you guys. It's
already Thursday. Thursday
is over. Tomorrow's Friday.

8
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:33,400
And then it's just a one way ticket
to fuck town. What do you care?

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,400
Quite as fucking weekend
of the year right here.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,200
They'd be getting of the NFL season.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,050
College football is already in
full fucking full gear for bold,

12
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,920
full speed.
I don't what the fuck you say.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,620
I watched another a college
game the other night.

14
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:51,450
I watched the horn and 80 Ohio state
buckeyes going to be Schwab at shut.

15
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:56,380
Pank what? The Virginia. Who gives a
fuck? Who Was it? The Virginia Cavaliers.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,180
The volunteers. I don't know what they
are, but they had some very nice helmets.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,390
They did actually had some really nice
helmets and they hung in there with the

18
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:06,920
buckeyes for about two
and a half quarters.

19
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,530
And all of a sudden Ohio
state was just like, yeah,

20
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:13,250
we've had about enough of you
guys. Buckeyes look great.
And you know, it's funny.

21
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:16,430
As much as I was singing hail
to the victors, I actually
sit there and I watched.

22
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:21,120
I go, God damn it. I love the Buckeyes,
always liked the uniform. And uh,

23
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:25,100
I've always liked Michigan is I can't help
it. I'm from Boston outside of Boston,

24
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:28,890
Massachusetts. It's not a college
town, it's a college Savile.

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,530
We don't have any good college sports.
Christ,

26
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:34,160
we had Doug Flutie for like fucking
four years. That's all we had. You know,

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,620
we do well in college hockey.
Other than that,

28
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:40,790
the whole fucking thing fell apart a
couple of times. Umass did okay. You know,

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:44,990
BC did all right. We got to the sweet
16 and the Big Dad, we got nothing.

30
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,860
We got nothing.
All we have is on a professional level.

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,960
We just want all the
fucking championships.

32
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,710
That's all that we have to hang our hats
on. So anyway, so I, as I mentioned,

33
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:59,711
I I like a lot of teams that are our
rivals of each other just because,

34
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:00,860
uh,
you know,

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,640
I've just watched him throughout the
years because they've always been good and

36
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:09,020
who doesn't want to watch quality
football over there? So anyways,

37
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:13,990
tonight the NFL season starts,
uh,

38
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,500
du Du, Du, Du, Du.

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,033
Ooh,

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,630
right?
And I'll tell you,

41
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:29,720
it's a goddamn shame that the two teams
tonight have collectively one 10 super

42
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:34,721
bowl championships and they're going
to fucking deal with the all that Jim,

43
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,850
Jim Hearsay.

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,170
How did I not fucking come
up with that until now?

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,730
Jim and hearsay out and fucking
all of his can't fucking prove it.

46
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:51,970
But we definitely probably
think that may be new shop too.

47
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,580
Unbelievable for fucking games
and draft picks. It's unreal.

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,520
That's what happens when
you're top everybody,

49
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,740
all you guys out there are you fat.
Fuck winging it and fucking jerk offs.

50
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,020
You know what you are.
You guys are all just jelly.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,080
The same shit you put
on your fucking donuts.

52
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,800
That's what you got going on with
the Patriots. Fuck all of you.

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,430
I can't hear any of you.
I'm done with it.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,460
Dealt with a custody. I
got into it with this, uh,

55
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,880
with a good friend of mine who was a
Pittsburgh Fan and he explained a way.

56
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,580
Terry Bradshaw's,
we use steroids comment,

57
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
but was convinced [inaudible] cell phone.

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,770
You know,
why did he destroy his cell phone?

59
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,950
Why didn't Terry Bradshaw's
say you use steroids,

60
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,160
Carrie?
I love sports fans.

61
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,570
Absolutely love them.

62
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,510
They can not see anything wrong
that their own fucking team did.

63
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,500
And I'm going to pause now as a way for
you guys go. Well, what about you bill a,

64
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,060
we cheated in 2007 for one game,
for one game.

65
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:01,600
We cheated. That was a brand
new rule. We ignored it.

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,990
A fucking man genie fucking site.

67
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,280
He called us on it and we were 100%
guilty of cheating one fucking time.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,900
It was a brand new role.
So all you dump concert go well,

69
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,960
what about three to five years early
when you went to know Superbowls? Well,

70
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:21,670
it wasn't illegal to do that.
You dumb fuck. By the way,

71
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:24,190
if you ever go to a game,
if you ever go to a game,

72
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,090
watch the guys sending in the signals.
And when I say guys, it's plural.

73
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,780
There's always like three or four people
fucking sending signals because they

74
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:35,170
don't want you to figure it out who?
Because everybody does it now.

75
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,470
Whatever. Suck a dick. Um,

76
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,680
so we're coming out tonight and I'm
hoping that we're going to ask rape the

77
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:49,180
fucking Steelers and the rest of the
League and win another championship this

78
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,181
year.

79
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,870
Cause I would just love to hear what
Jim Hearsay's going to say or some other

80
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,010
fucking team.
Um,

81
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,380
start some rumor that ESPN then picks
up without even researching and then

82
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:04,000
apologizes at two in the fucking
morning. Those spineless cunts. Um,

83
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,090
but anyways, who gives a fuck about
all that? It's football season.

84
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,010
The dog days of baseball are behind us.
Baseball's gonna matter.

85
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,110
Football always matters.

86
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,460
Basketball and baseball and hockey
or right around the fucking corner.

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,940
This is one of those, one of the
great months of the year, you know,

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,430
when the great months a year. And you
know what, there's no bunny rabbit.

89
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,310
There's no fat guy coming
down the fucking thing, right?

90
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,970
Jesus didn't do anything this month.
Jesus didn't do shit.

91
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,190
And September's whole 33 fucking years,

92
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,850
never did a goddamn thing that I have
to pay attention to. Pay attention to.

93
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,320
All you got is like those 19
Jewish holidays of which, you know,

94
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,200
people who aren't even Jewish
get like eight of those days off.

95
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,030
So God bless the Jewish people,

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,060
the Jews over the air here in September.
Um, it's a great fucking month.

97
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,560
Hey, you know, the last time I talked
to you guys, I mentioned that I was uh,

98
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,400
using big green egg to finally go and
try and attempt to smoke something.

99
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,060
And I don't think I've ever been so
excited in my life when I got that,

100
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,960
that fire going on at Hickory, wished I
was smoking and all of that stuff. But,

101
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:16,610
uh, unfortunately my fire
ended up going out about,

102
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,490
um,
about two hours into it.

103
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,390
So my question to other
people who smoke with the egg,

104
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,910
how do you layer your fire?

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,110
Cause like I obviously need more charcoal
but I can't have the temperature go

106
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:36,770
higher than a certain, um, you know,

107
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,560
I want to keep it around like 200,
180 to two 20.

108
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,950
I just put it right at 200 cause
everybody was saying I do it at two 20.

109
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:47,210
I do a one 80. I do two 10.
I said fuck it. Split the
difference. I have it at 200.

110
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:52,211
So how do you build that fire where
it's not going to go out in two hours,

111
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:57,701
but it's not hotter than like 200 degrees
to I like I just don't know how to do

112
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,700
that yet.
And it's,

113
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,150
it's a lot easier with the smoker
because I would think that, you know,

114
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,300
you just keep adding to it.
Although with the smoker,

115
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:12,170
I heard you start with charcoal and
then the wood starts burning and then he

116
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:15,620
keep it at that. Well maybe just
add more wood. I don't know.

117
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,390
I'm a complete novice. So
what happened was when I took,

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,400
um, you know, when I took the
ribs off after like three hours,

119
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,260
um, and everybody's all three hours.
I do it five hours, I do it 19 hours.

120
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:32,210
I do it for an hour and a half.
Everybody's got a different,

121
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,390
no fucking idea how to do this shit.
So three hours,

122
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:38,440
I take it off cause my fire was dying
all the way down and it took them out and

123
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,340
had this,
it looked like they'd been smoked.

124
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,270
So it was already really excited
about that. And then, you know,

125
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,710
I ate one of the small ones and it seemed
to be done and then I cut to the next

126
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,980
one and it looked like a
burger that was medium rare.

127
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,730
So like a fucking asshole.
I was so hungry.

128
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,290
I said to hell with that.

129
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,720
And I bit into it and I chewed
three times and I'm like, Bill,

130
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,990
what the fuck are you doing?
You're eating an under cooked pig,

131
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,460
are you out of your mind?

132
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:09,410
So I spit it out on the plate and then
I just took all of the ribs and uh,

133
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,420
I put them in like casserole dish.
I put some water in there and a,

134
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:17,750
I just baked them in the oven to
finish them. And they were delicious.

135
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:19,640
They definitely had a
smoky flavor, but, uh,

136
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,220
I wanted to finish the
whole thing on the egg.

137
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:26,930
So if anybody has the big green egg and
you know how to do it, how I maintain a,

138
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,050
a fire, you know, when
they talk about, you know,

139
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,200
if someday I do a brisket or
pork butt or something like that,

140
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,560
how do I maintain that temperature
and that fire for that long?

141
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,540
Do you have a system? Make me a
video for the love of Christ. Um,

142
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,030
but anyways, um, so it
didn't quite work out,

143
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,800
but I knew that that was
going to happen anyways.

144
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:53,420
I knew I was going to fuck it up the first
time through. Um, but other than that,

145
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:57,200
everything else was working. And
I'll also, do you guys prefer the,

146
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:00,280
the hickory chunks or having
those little chips that you soak?

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,100
That was another thing because I felt
like the hickory chunks just really just,

148
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,730
just burned right the fuck up. When I
opened it, it was nothing but ashes. So,

149
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,270
uh, I dunno, I got a lot of
questions, but I ain't going to quit.

150
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,190
I'm just going to keep going with it.
So anyways,

151
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,380
another thing in sports that I
forgot to mention is the u s open.

152
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,240
Alright.
And Serena Williams is trying to become,

153
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,790
let's see, actually look this up.
She's trying to become the one,

154
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,890
okay.

155
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,723
Two,

156
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,880
three fourth tennis player all
time to have a season slam,

157
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,060
which is winning all in the same
calendar year. The Australian Open,

158
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,900
the French Open,
Wimbledon and the u s open.

159
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,463
MMM.

160
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,040
I mean there's a shortlist of people that
through their career have won all four.

161
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,840
But um, there's only four people. Three
people. I'm sorry that I've ever done it.

162
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,890
Uh,
Margaret Court did it in 1970.

163
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,570
This is so not the Monday morning podcast.
I actually have information here.

164
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,990
Steffi Graf did it in
1988 and rod fucking away

165
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,170
did it twice,

166
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,890
1962 and 1969 and that is why a lot of
people still consider him arguably the

167
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:29,800
greatest tennis male tennis
player, I should say, of all time.

168
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,530
MMM.

169
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,180
He won 11 overall end.
He had a,

170
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,950
he had a career and seat career slam.
Obviously he had this season's slam twice.

171
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:44,120
Nobody's ever done it twice. Um,
so I actually started looking up,

172
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:47,420
cause I'm like a fucking numbers
nerd when it comes to sports.

173
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,990
So as far as the top ladies,
and granted,

174
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:54,470
I couldn't find a fucking website
that just listed all of them.

175
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:58,700
So I just went on Wikipedia and just
started going through all the top, uh,

176
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,610
women that I could remember that I
watched and all that shit. So here,

177
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:05,930
here's the top women's
tennis champions of all time.

178
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,600
As far as I,
my Wikipedia research,

179
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,910
Margaret Margaret fucking caught
over there. She's one the most.

180
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:18,100
She won 24. Uh, she won them, uh,

181
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,220
before the open era, which I believe
started in [inaudible] 67 or 68.

182
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,720
I don't even know what the fuck that,
I forget what that means. The Open era.

183
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,040
What does that mean? After the summer of
love, people started whoring it up there.

184
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,000
Uh, sorry. Let me see
what I got here. Close.

185
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,370
Close this window.

186
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,920
Open era tennis. All right,
what the fuck does this mean?

187
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,090
The Open era Wikipedia.

188
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,190
This is where I get all my information.

189
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,270
The period since 1968 where can compete
in a grand slam and grand slams.

190
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,470
Oh, so it wasn't professionals. Well,

191
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:02,800
that kind of takes a little luster
off of fucking rod laver for me.

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,980
We're not in 69, though, but he also
done, I it doesn't because you know what,

193
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,460
he did it in 1969 he did it when
there weren't professionals.

194
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,920
And when there were,
uh,

195
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:15,400
the open era began in 1968 when the
Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow

196
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:20,110
professional players to compete with
amateurs before 1968 only amateurs who are

197
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:23,770
allowed to compete in the Grand Slam
tournaments and other events organized or

198
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:28,240
sanctions by the I l t f
including the Davis Cup.

199
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:28,900
Uh,

200
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,820
the move is made because the English
are tired of the hypocrisy in the sport.

201
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,510
Uh, well that probably means like, you
know, like back in the day when, uh,

202
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,530
the US Olympic team was all amateurs
and so was so was the Russian team,

203
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,360
but they didn't have any
professional fucking sports.

204
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:51,361
So we were playing against their
Gretzky's with like a r a w.

205
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,883
What's that guy's name?

206
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,990
Six kills six killer was
that Oregon quarterback

207
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,370
or Washington quarterback from way back
in the day, one of the great names ever.

208
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,400
Six killer, right? 76 killer.

209
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,790
I swear to God, that's an actual
name of a quarterback that I learnt.

210
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,250
Sunny fucking six.

211
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:23,600
Kyla is a former American football
player in sports commentator.

212
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:27,170
That is the greatest sunny six killer.

213
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,050
Who the fuck would want that guy?
He's a quarterback

214
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,970
born in Oklahoma and is a
member of the Cherokee nation.

215
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,080
Jesus Christ.
If that guy came around today,

216
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:44,500
it would be marketing gold. Hi. Hey.

217
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,780
Sat a six candidates taking enough failed.
Actually Keith Jackson was, was uh,

218
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,290
was around back there. Sonny
six killer that, I mean,

219
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,290
Quintin Tarantino couldn't come up
with a better fucking name than that.

220
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,550
All right, let's continue
here. So Margaret Court one 24,

221
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,350
um,

222
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,920
mostly during pre open era
in through the last few, uh,

223
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,900
after the opener. Steffi Graf, 22,

224
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:13,710
a lot of people put her above Margaret
Court because all of hers were during the

225
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:17,970
Open era when it was all professionals.
Serena, Steffi Graf one 22.

226
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,340
So Margaret Court 24.
Steffi Graf 20 to Serena Williams 21.

227
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,790
Um,
she wins obviously the u s open.

228
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:30,990
That'll be 22 when she will become
the fourth woman woman of all time.

229
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:35,940
And the fifth person collectively
ever to have a seasoned slam. Um,

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,530
Martina Navratilova,
uh, 18 Chris Everett 18,

231
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,570
Billie Jean King 12. Um,
and then on the men's side,

232
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,570
Roger Federer has one 17
Pete San Fran and has, uh,

233
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,230
uh, uh, uh, career slam.

234
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,683
Uh,

235
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,490
all those women that I just mentioned,
they all have the career slam.

236
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,960
Pete San Francis one 14, but he
never wanted the French. Rafi l made.

237
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:05,660
Dell has one 14,
but he never went Australia.

238
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,610
But Raphael Nadal has the record since
the open era of winning the most,

239
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,650
a single grand slam event he
won than anybody else. Uh,

240
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:19,910
he won the French Open.
He wanted nine times in 10 years,

241
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,170
four years in a row,

242
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,130
Mr Year when federal one and 2009.

243
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:28,490
Then he ran it for another five.
Um,

244
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,530
Rod Laver has 11. Bjorn Borg has 11
never won the u s so the Australian Open,

245
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,940
Andre Agassi has eight, has the
career slam. Avant Lendl has eight.

246
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:42,830
Never won Wimbledon. Mcenroe has
seven. Never one Roland Garros or uh,

247
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,690
the French or Australian Boris Becker six.
Then I had to look up Stan Smith,

248
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,950
you know, he's got that sneaker like
Jordan that they never retired. I'm like,

249
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,010
I got to see what this guy did.
Stan Smith one too.

250
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,570
Yeah.

251
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,090
He never won the Australian or the
U Open this mother Fucker, man.

252
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:04,080
How the hell did you get a sneaker?
Let's see when he won it.

253
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,950
Now that I know what the open
Arrow means. Stan Smith. Yeah.

254
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:12,400
He wanted the open air and he went
72 we won Wimbledon and the US Open.

255
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:15,490
He wanted 71 I know, I sound
like the fucking rain man, but I,

256
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:16,780
I get into this type of shit.

257
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,433
MMM.

258
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,290
So anyways, let's go, let's
get back to the podcast here.

259
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,340
So I'm looking forward to it.
You know,

260
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:27,210
if you don't watch tennis but you want
to pop in when you can see something that

261
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:30,510
net that rarely ever happens. You got
to watch Serena Williams this weekend.

262
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,950
You don't have to,
but she can.

263
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,660
MMM.

264
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,430
All right, let's plow ahead here. Uh Oh.

265
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,910
Let's talk about fucking
working out old Billy fat tits.

266
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,553
Huh?

267
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,330
Oh Billy fucking baby
bump. I'm back on it, man.

268
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,270
I went on a hike the other day and
I worked out did all of that shit.

269
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:51,200
I woke up in the morning,

270
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:54,770
but I do buy dope and I weighed
myself before working out,

271
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:58,430
which I've now learned is your
most accurate weight of the day.

272
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,880
And I was one 65.8 so that means I am in
striking distance of getting down to my

273
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:11,090
bucks. 62 I'm going to, I might have to
fucking skip a rope. Yeah, skip a rope,

274
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,260
skip rope for a couple of rounds to get
down to it. But uh, I think I can do it.

275
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,750
And then I start back out on the road.
I'm going back east,

276
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:22,580
I'm going to a wedding and a then
I do my run through Texas. So, uh,

277
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,560
this is going to be the
tough thing. And also my, uh,

278
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,590
my boos fast is going to end at
some point over the next week.

279
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,140
I am up to a, what's today? Thursday?

280
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,020
Sunday was 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 days.

281
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,230
And I wanted to go like 70, 72 days.
So I've got like five more days.

282
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,043
MMM.

283
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,030
But I got to tell you tonight,
I might

284
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,510
actually fuck it up tonight all
depending on what happens. Actually.

285
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:57,890
Got a great gig tonight, um, through
a friend of a friend of a friend.

286
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:00,100
Somehow I am.
Okay.

287
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,260
I am going to,
I'll tell you later who I'm open at for.

288
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,190
I'll tell you the next time, cause I
don't know if it's a secret fucking Gig,

289
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,070
but um,
I'm opening for uh,

290
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,820
a bunch of um,
oh,

291
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,030
a bunch of young lads that like
to go to the library and uh,

292
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,760
they might want to go to the library
tonight and who am I to say no,

293
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,690
at least got to read one book
with them, right? Anyways,

294
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,880
so all I gotta do is, uh, just eat right.

295
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,050
Do a little bit of cardio.
I think I can get down there and um,

296
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,070
but what I'm really finding is all I'm
going to do is lose a little more muscle

297
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,530
and I'm still going to have
this fucking God damn baby bump.

298
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,330
I can't get rid of the fucking thing.
However,

299
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,570
however I actually have started the
transformation of my garage not being a

300
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:56,560
place to dump shit off
at. I am now going, it's,

301
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:59,020
it's making is trans transformation.
All right.

302
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,970
I had three cabinets sitting on the floor,

303
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:05,350
pieces of absolute fucking shit cabinets,

304
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,640
but they still work. So I had somebody
come over, he fucking, you know,

305
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,230
did the whole stud finder thing.

306
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,230
I wasn't going to do it because I'm
putting my tools in there and a bunch of

307
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:17,200
shit from my big green egg.
It's going to be heavy.

308
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,920
And I don't need to pull out a bunch of
dry wall cause I fucking miss the stud.

309
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:24,040
I don't give a fuck. I'm a
comedian. I understand it.

310
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,210
I don't want somebody who's
in construction to tell me
jokes and I don't want to

311
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:32,740
be fucking hanging cabinets. All right,
question my manhood. I don't give a fuck.

312
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:35,200
So this dude, he put up the, um,

313
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,060
he put up the cabinets,
had a ladder, hung up,

314
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,090
and I had bolt bicycles hung up and a,

315
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,360
I came downstairs with an apron and
you know, gave him some muffins.

316
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,700
They good little housewife and a,
so that's the beginning of it.

317
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,650
And then I'm going to,
on craigslist,

318
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,710
I'm going to get rid of my pull
up and dip station, then I,

319
00:19:56,711 --> 00:20:01,000
that I bought and I'm going to, uh, get
a pull up bar that mounts to the wall.

320
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,850
And then I'm going to go to that,

321
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:08,590
those atomic grips website and a,

322
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,160
I'm getting all those, those fucking,
uh, those little cannon ball things,

323
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,280
whatever you call them,
the fucking missiles and all those things,

324
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,880
all those different grip things.
And I'm going to get, and um,

325
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,030
I'm going to have my own little,
uh,

326
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,620
American Ninja fuck an obstacle course
hanging from the ceiling of my, uh,

327
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,050
my garage.
And that's going to be my workout.

328
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:32,110
And I figure if I do that throughout
the years, skip a little rope,

329
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,020
take my dog for a hike.
And as long as I don't eat like a cunt,

330
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,900
I think I should be all right.
You know,

331
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,020
cause I fucking hate going to the gym
even though I like going to the gym.

332
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:41,854
You know,

333
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,770
what was the last time you went to the
gym and you wanted to go and use the

334
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:48,300
bench press? And there wasn't fucking
12 people waiting for it, right?

335
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,380
Or even worse, even worse,
the fucking chick who's there,

336
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,460
who's not even bench pressing and
is using it to sit on the end of it.

337
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,710
It fucking, uh, uh, Jesus.
Hang on a second. Let me,

338
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:04,980
let me call you right back. I'm finishing
up my up, my podcast. All right,

339
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,920
no problem. All right. Um,

340
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,230
the chick that's sitting on the end of
the bench to do some fucking ab work or

341
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,790
do some like, you know, those,

342
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:17,860
those tricep exercises and you
got what you want to be like, hey,

343
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,310
why didn't you go over to
the the mat area and do that?

344
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,010
But you can't do that because if you ever,
you could say that to a guy,

345
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,590
but if you say it's a woman
than your acts sexist work,

346
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,180
you wait your turn, you
fucking pig. Um, so you,

347
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:38,220
you want to avoid that, right? So, um,

348
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,010
and what I like about the way I'm
going to do my garage is everything's,

349
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,060
everything that I'm working out with is
hanging up on the wall or hanging from

350
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:48,540
the ceiling. Do you know a long time
ago I bought the rings, you know,

351
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,300
this gymnastic rings when I
had a one bedroom apartment,

352
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:52,320
which is fucking hilarious.

353
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,210
I Dunno where I thought it
was going to hang on for me.

354
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:58,650
That was going to hanging from my chin up
bar and uh, and it just, nothing worked.

355
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,640
It was just too, it was too,
I was too low to the ground.

356
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,590
And,
uh,

357
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,640
also I put up the chin up bar so I never
truly trusted that that thing wasn't

358
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:12,540
going to give way. And I had, I had
to have my legs bent when I used them,

359
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,171
so I was like,

360
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:17,550
I'm either going to fucking land on my
knee caps or I'm going to land on my

361
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:21,840
tailbone and either way it's going to
suck. So, uh, I'm going to get though,

362
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,770
I'm just going to have these hook things
up there so I could just, you know,

363
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:28,830
put shit up and take stuff down and uh,

364
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,670
she could tell him I'm fucking
beyond excited about it and

365
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,650
I can take my useless termite
infested fucking hunk of shit.

366
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:40,850
Cock sucking mother fucking garage.
Yeah.

367
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,550
That's shaped like an ice cream cone that
was made out of wax and was stuffed in

368
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:48,340
an oven for 20 minutes and
then pulled out not 20 minutes,

369
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,620
whatever it first starts
to melt. Um, even the, uh,

370
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,101
the guy,

371
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:57,230
the construction dude who was helping
me put that up with saying that the,

372
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,760
the garage itself was an
optical illusion as far as like,

373
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:04,420
I was telling him like he saw on the wall,
thank God it's just shitty drywall.

374
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,800
Like I've scraped,
you know,

375
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,970
my bumper's hit the side of it a couple
of times cause it's, it's coming in,

376
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,470
I'm looking onto the left because
that's like cinder blocks and concrete.

377
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:19,190
So I mean this thing was built for a
model t Ford. I'm getting a 68, uh,

378
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,990
f 100 in there, so it gets a little tight,
you know, hey, it gets a little rough,

379
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:27,130
you know, so I'm, I'm paying attention
to the fucking concrete. And uh,

380
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,140
on the other side it comes in at like a
15 degree angle and then all of a sudden

381
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:37,141
it just increases to like 18 or 19
degrees and the wall is all white.

382
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:41,860
See just, you can't even fucking see
it. And, uh, you know, it's a truck.

383
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:46,310
Nothing happens to the truck. It just puts
a hack mark in the fucking wall. And a,

384
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:49,310
I'm actually tempted to talk to
my neighbor and be like, dude,

385
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,550
how much would it cost for
me to buy one foot your way?

386
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,080
The length of my garage?

387
00:23:57,081 --> 00:24:01,910
Can I buy that property off of you and
build a garage that's fucking square?

388
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,670
Can you do that for me? I wonder
what he would say. He probably said,

389
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:10,880
well, you know what? Go Fuck Yourself.
And I'd be like, you know what?

390
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,250
That's probably exactly what I would say.

391
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,470
Why do I give a fuck about your garage
and your problem? I don't give a shit. Um,

392
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,320
so anyways, uh, last night I worked
out some material. Jesus Christ was,

393
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:25,154
I fucking

394
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,100
just rusty last night was a lot
of work. It's all I can say. Oh,

395
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:35,320
by the way. So the big college game
that I'm going to this year is, uh,

396
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,171
well I'm going to one,

397
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:41,171
I'm going to Texas and Osu and because
I'm getting ready for that Madison Square

398
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,940
Garden show.
Um,

399
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm doing another big tour in
October and that one starts off,

400
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,020
we're going to go to a Notre Dame USC,

401
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:56,021
and that is the entire Rosebowl Kuru
Kuru crew is going to that game.

402
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:00,890
Bart, nick lie ahead and myself and,
um, that's how we start to tore off.

403
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,310
We just got some nosebleed seats
up at the top of the stadium.

404
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:07,070
So if you're going to the
game, look for the, uh,

405
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,840
me and five other people
that come stumbling in, um,

406
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,580
to watch that game.

407
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm actually not going to get too ripped
for that famous last words, but, uh,

408
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,130
I think,
you know,

409
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,280
I want to watch that game because I think
Notre Dame and is going to be really

410
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:24,890
good this year. I don't know
about USC. I know that they won,

411
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:29,510
but I don't know that they've
played yet. Um, but it's, you know,

412
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,860
like I said, I hope Michigan
gets good. It's good to see
Notre Dame good again. Uh,

413
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,780
you know, it's good for college football
even though, you know, it's like I said,

414
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:41,510
it was a red sox fan. It's good when the
fucking red sox and Yankees are good. Um,

415
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,420
speaking of which, we suck that
Dick this year. All right, let's,

416
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,060
let's read some of the advertising here
and so I can wrap this up. All right.

417
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:51,880
The Zip recruiter,
a business owners,

418
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:56,710
did you know that summer is a grand
time to hire the best people with,

419
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,230
uh,
with your competitors on vacation?

420
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:02,110
There's less competition
for quality candidates,

421
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:05,350
but posting your job in one
place isn't enough to find them.

422
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,090
And when you're short staffed,

423
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:10,310
there's no time to deal with the
dozens of different job sites on

424
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,973

Alright, next. Lastly,

437
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,940
but not leastly Uber.

438
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,700
Okay.

439
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,660
How great is Uber? If the booze, that's
one thing that they won't bring up.

440
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,800
I mean the amount of lives that they must
save every year because you could just

441
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,910
get yourself a designated driver
because it designated driver thing.

442
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:15,350
Never really worked did it?

443
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,070
It's really hard to be hanging around a
bunch of people drinking and then you're

444
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:22,130
not going to drink, you know,
cause they're going to get
hammered and be like, who?

445
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,300
I, hey you guys. Right?
The next thing you know,

446
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,560
next thing you know. Yeah.
Hammered sitting in the
drive through at Mcdonald's.

447
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Woo. Uh, Uber. Hey, you
like making great money,

448
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,040
right? Sure. We all do.

449
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:42,070
Here's a really cool opportunity I have
to share with you driving with Uber or

450
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,820
driving with Uber.
Yeah.

451
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,820
Uber's that popular smart phone APP
that connects writers with drivers.

452
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,800
Uh, people take Uber a bunch.
People love them by the way.

453
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,970
And in chatting with the
different drivers. Some of
them have really interesting,

454
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,170
really interesting stories
as why they drive with Uber.

455
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,430
Here's some right here. They love being
their own boss. They earned great money.

456
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:12,290
It's easy to say that all you need is
a car and a license and a little bit of

457
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:17,060
motivation. Driving with Uber is great
for anyone who needs flexibility.

458
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,140
Parents, this is a really easy way to work
around your family schedule. Students.

459
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,350
You can make some extra money between
classes, no more stripping the,

460
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,280
that was the prime time to catch a,
to cash in driving with Uber.

461
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,460
You'll thank me for telling
you how to get paid every week.

462
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,730
I could be getting into your
car when you drive with Uber.

463
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,510
I'll tell you right now, I won't be
sober. Uh, you got a car and a license.

464
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,240
Put a boat to work for you and
start earning serious money,

465
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,110
serious life changing money today.

466

468

469
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:01,930
okay,

470
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,980
let's try and wrap this up.

471
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:06,160
What the fuck was I just going to tell
you guys about something dumb that I did?

472
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,643
Okay.

473
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,420
Something dumb that I didn't know
what happened right before this, uh,

474
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,950
my doorbell rang and the guy came over
with the samples of the different stayed

475
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,500
because my front gate is about ready to
fall down as are the driveway gates. Uh,

476
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,250
cause they're, you know, absolute piece of
shit, cock suck and motherfucking gates.

477
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,630
You know,

478
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,380
not to be confused with my cock sucking
mother fucking piece of shit garage or

479
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:33,410
the cock sucking mother
fucking conti plumbing in, in,

480
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,690
in cloth wiring in the walls.
But slowly but surely, you know,

481
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:42,290
we're getting this thing together
fucking unreal.

482
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,410
Ah, whenever I think about this house,
how long it's been around in all that,

483
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,160
I just think of like, remember
that game, the wonderful though.

484
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,400
Wander ball goes round and round.

485
00:29:55,401 --> 00:30:00,401
Bapapapapa you are bound to Turo too
when you are last and you are out o u t

486
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:01,730
out.
That's what it feels like.

487
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,620
Everybody just kept passing the
buck and by the time I got it,

488
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,430
the fucking shit hit the fan.
But um,

489
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I take some perverse pleasure in being
the one that fixes up this fucking house.

490
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,180
You don't just to know whoever I sell
this to isn't going to, you know,

491
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,840
isn't going to inherit a
bunch of fucking problems.

492
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,750
Okay.

493
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,910
Do you know they went up on the
roof and they told me, once again,

494
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:29,150
we're having an El Nino when these
guys fucking put the drains too high.

495
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,230
It's just a never ending.

496
00:30:30,231 --> 00:30:33,320
This would be the third time I
have to get my fucking roof fixed.

497
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:36,170
And I know what you guys
are thinking. Well Bill, why
don't you just sue somebody?

498
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,210
I'll tell you why.
Cause I don't want to go to court.

499
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,580
I don't want to fucking sit there and
have those guys string it out for three

500
00:30:43,581 --> 00:30:46,640
years. This was is, it continues to
rain down into my fucking living room,

501
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,420
whatever. I picked a couple
of dopes. I'm all for two.

502
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,470
I think I finally found somebody fucking
reputable and they'll do the thing

503
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:57,770
right. I don't even want to
talk about it. So anyways, um,

504
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,980
my, uh, prediction tonight is it's
got to be a tough game as always.

505
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,860
Uh, I have no idea what the Patriots
are going to be like. As always,

506
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:11,120
whenever you win a championship, a
bunch of people jump ship. And, um,

507
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,780
I definitely think not having
Reavis is really going to affect us.

508
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,640
Um, Rothfuss burgers to time winning
champions, Superbowl champion.

509
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:24,290
And I think a Steelers always have a
good defense. Who the fuck knows? Man?

510
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,540
It's the first God damn week.
But I got to tell you, I'm,

511
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:30,710
I'm really excited that I'm celebrating
how long Spanish fantasy football been

512
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:33,980
around. I love that. I
still don't play that shit.

513
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,590
I got a, I got asked to join another
league, you know what I mean?

514
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,700
Uh, this year and I just wrote, I
don't play pan is fantasy football.

515
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,990
You guys are all a bunch of
pussies and I didn't write pussies,

516
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,710
if you know what I mean. And then the
dude just wrote back, he wrote, Lol,

517
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,900
I really wish I could argue
that. Um, Oh, speaking of which,

518
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:03,090
you know what Rappaport he's fucking
told me about this thing that he did. Um,

519
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,300
okay.

520
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,740
I got to find it meant,
uh,

521
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,040
did anybody listened to Michael Rappaport
when he was on the Howard Stern show?

522
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,590
Yeah,

523
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,000
when he played fantasy football against
the fantasy football guy and he won,

524
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,330
he had his son pick out the fucking teams
and evidently he was shit talking and

525
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,100
this guy wasn't good at shit-talking any,

526
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,600
absolutely buried him on the
fucking Howard stern show.

527
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,180
I'm trying to find the clip.
If anybody has the clip,

528
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:32,290
please send it to me and
then I will retweet it. Um,

529
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,480
I'll retweet it. Uh, you know,

530
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,230
on the podcasts Twitter account and
by saying I've been trying to do it,

531
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:43,050
my fucking died. I got a new hard
drive put into an it shit the bed.

532
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:46,890
So, uh, I just said fuck it. And I went
out and I bought like an $800 laptop,

533
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,120
laptop. Fucking, I'm done
buying expensive ones,

534
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,950
not like 800 bucks. That's, that's, you
know, that's cheap for a fucking laptop.

535
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:59,640
So, uh, I'm not, and this is a great
thing about this one, this laptop,

536
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:01,350
I'm not putting any information on it.

537
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm not putting any of my fucking music
on it. I'm not putting anything on it.

538
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:09,590
So when it inevitably shits the bed,
you know, did you save it to the iCloud?

539
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,160
Fuck the ICLOUD.

540
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,330
Fuck the ICLOUD and fuck
Disneyland and Fuck Disney world.

541
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,920
I read up on that Shit, dude. That
is so God damn creepy how they're,

542
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:23,610
they're going to going to microchip you
when you go in and out of that park the

543
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:24,840
entire fucking time.

544
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,840
And the only way to fight it is to
just not go because you can't have an

545
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:34,220
intelligent conversation with most
people because most people are morons.

546
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,063
Most people be like,

547
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,360
why do I give a fuck if they know
where I bought a fucking slurpee?

548
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:42,750
I don't give a shit as long as
it's up on space mountain, right.

549
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,890
They don't give a shit.

550
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,420
And it's so perfect because eventually
when the government microchips, everybody,

551
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,650
one of the arguments is
going to be like, well, you,

552
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:52,830
they microchip you when
you go to Disneyland.

553
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,290
Do you think that Mickey mouse is evil?
Dude,

554
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,700
I was reading this thing
where they literally,

555
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,000
you're going to go in there and the people
dressed up as the characters are just

556
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:03,870
going to come up to you and be like,
hey bill, how's it going? I'm sorry.

557
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,270
I almost said it's Pluto. That's when
you know you're doing a bad impression.

558
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:13,800
We have to say who the fuck it is. Hello?
Low. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Um,

559
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,970
like those characters are going to come
walking up and saying hello to you.

560
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,110
All right.

561
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,140
So if you're walking in there with that
wristband that is tracking you from a

562
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:26,820
fucking satellite in outer space and
Pluto comes up to you and knows your name

563
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:31,260
before you introduce yourself, and in the
meantime in the background is singing.

564
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,590
It's a small world.
After all, if the, the,

565
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:39,780
that Trifecta of Shit doesn't
creep you out, then uh,

566
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,520
I think you're a robot. Either that or
you deserve whatever happens to you,

567
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:46,560
what you're in there.
You know what I mean?

568
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,030
Those fucking creeps over a Disney.
What do they not going to be crepes.

569
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,210
Arthur Ashe award.
The Caitlyn Jenner.

570
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:59,860
So you get the fucking exclusive
interview with Diane Sawyer.

571
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,850
Okay.

572
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,800
Ah, shameless. Absolutely
fucking shameless. All alleged.

573
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,830
But I feel after that whole deflate
gate thing, it doesn't matter.

574
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,610
All you gotta do is you just say
shit and then it becomes true.

575
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,990
All right everybody, that's the
Thursday afternoon podcast. Uh,

576
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,580
hope you guys have a great weekend.
[inaudible] and joy,

577
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:23,840
some throwback Monday morning podcast
stuff. And I'm hoping for a great game.

578
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:26,780
Obviously hoping the
Patriots win tonight and um,

579
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,430
but I got no beef with the
fucking Steelers or anything
that they've ever done,

580
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,300
including what Terry said. I don't
give a shit. Congratulations.

581
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,560
You've won six Superbowls
as far as I'm all right.

582
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:41,100
Go fuck yourself and a Seattle.
I hope you made you stadium even louder.

583
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,940
God knows your lame ass fans
need all the help they can get.

584
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,290
Come on, man. I had to start
shit with somebody. Um,

585
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,100
I actually think Seattle is probably
going to be good this year. Oh. Oh.

586
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,460
Pete Carroll. Oh, Pete
Carroll. There's another,

587
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,770
there's an upstanding individual
bill Bella checks a piece of shit.

588
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:01,860
But I'll tell you that Pete Carroll.
Oh pistol Pete.

589
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,610
You know what the genius of Pistol
Pete sees his filthy as anybody,

590
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,160
but he dresses like
Flanders on the Simpsons.

591
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,860
That's what Bella check
should be doing. Oh, hoodies.

592
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:14,370
Just evil people don't trust you,
but you put on a pair of dockers,

593
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,740
you know what I mean?
Keep you stomach down

594
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,660
and go woo.

595
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,880
After every fucked up play. God dammit.
People will love you. All right,

596
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:27,560
go fuck yourselves. Uh, I have a
great weekend and enjoy the throwback

597
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,980
Monday morning podcast.

598
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,310
Wait

599
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,143
the

600
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,783
car

601
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,790
with us.

602
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,510
Oh two eight. Bill, maybe you
can help me out with this thing.

603
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,060
I haven't read any of these things
people. So, uh, bear with me here. Uh,

604
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,630
this sounds ridiculous,
but hear me out.

605
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:15,260
I met this girl a couple of weeks ago
and I've been talking to her and hanging

606
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:16,730
out with her nonstop.

607
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,190
We is pretty what? I
guess it's, she is pretty,

608
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:23,570
she's pretty funny,

609
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:27,560
intelligent and one of the most upfront
and upfront and honest people I've ever

610
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:30,590
met in my life. In fact,
maybe a little too honest,

611
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:34,910
cause she tells me every day how
great, cute, honest and honest I am.

612
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,760
And it's a little much sometimes.
Anyways,

613
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:41,090
we've been hitting it off like crazy and
on Saturday she spent the night and we

614
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:46,040
hung out all day Sunday about nine
around 9:00 PM we got on the topic of old

615
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:49,130
jobs. Uh, fuck is she a dancer?

616
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,960
And she told me that a few years
ago she worked in a pet store. Okay.

617
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:54,794
I guess wrong.

618
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:00,010
There was a hamster there that would
bite her everyday drawing blood and what?

619
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:05,201
Attack coworkers and customers generally
the hamster was a crazy douche.

620
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,530
One day her,

621
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:11,530
her and a coworker decided they had to
do something about this thing to put the

622
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:16,400
hamster in a bag and
smashed it against the wall.

623
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,120
Whoa.
What?

624
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,110
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking left turn that was.

625
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:30,700
They put it in a bag

626
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,730
and smashed it against the wall.

627
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,260
Needless to say,

628
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,130
I was shocked.
The first thing I said was,

629
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,150
Holy Shit Lady.
That's kind of crazy.

630
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,890
That makes
wait.

631
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:52,340
That's the kind of crazy that makes
a wife cut her husband's Dick off.

632
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,670
I'm sorry dude.
That was a hilarious line and I blew it.

633
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,800
The first thing I said was,
Holy Shit Lady.

634
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:01,390
That's the kind of crazy that makes
it wife cut her husband's Dick off.

635
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,670
She said she still feels horrible about
it and that she killed it that way

636
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,690
because she couldn't think of any
other way to make it quick. But Jeez,

637
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,850
I mean, I never been in that situation,
but that seems kind of crazy. Lol.

638
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,750
This seems like something straight
out of a Seinfeld episode,

639
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,680
but I just keep thinking about it.
Every time me and this chick's are,

640
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,790
are getting together,

641
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:31,270
should I just accept this is a crazy
story or is this a sign that she has

642
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:34,010
serious issues?
Remember,

643
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:38,990
this happened years ago and she
seems absolutely sane. Otherwise,

644
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,680
please help potential murder
victim question mark through.

645
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,290
Some of you guys are really fucking funny,
man. The way you guys write this shit.

646
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,770
I, I you, but you got to admit I
haven't proved with my reading.

647
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:55,580
I feel so bad that I butchered
that God damn line. Um,

648
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,360
okay.

649
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,270
Okay. Jesus Christ. What
do you do with this one?

650
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,860
This is fucked up on so
many different levels. Okay,

651
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,220
let's start with the first thing.
The cruelty to animals.

652
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,653
Okay.

653
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,890
Not only cruelty to animals
like I could what she did,

654
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:18,010
I could do that to an aunt.
I won't even do it to a spider.

655
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:20,140
I could do it to a fucking mosquito.

656
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,820
That's what she basically treated
a hamster like a fucking mosquito.

657
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,760
Now granted a hamster. Okay, let's
try to be a little empathetic here.

658
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,810
Empathetic.
Let me try to put myself in her situation.

659
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,220
If I was younger,

660
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:42,820
20 years younger and a hamster bit me
every day at work and I met working at a

661
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:46,330
fucking pet store, uh, what?

662
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:50,230
I smashed it against the wall and
a bag. No, I wouldn't. However,

663
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,220
I would do something to it.

664
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,560
I would do something. Do you know
what I would do? I would take a ruler.

665
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,353
I would wait.

666
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,690
I would wait till it was a fallen asleep
and I would just write on it's fucking

667
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:17,650
hamster ass and it woke up.
Fuck it did.

668
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:21,340
I would just take the ruler and I
would pin it against the fucking cage.

669
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,780
It just watch you get all
upset. I just, I would bully it.

670
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:28,780
That's what basically what I would do.
Hey, you liked that. You liked that?

671
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:32,920
Your little fucking Hamster, Huh? I
wouldn't hurt it. I just keep it pinned.

672
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,240
I was frustrated. I would frustrate
the living shit out of it.

673
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,510
That's what I would do.
I would do something like that.

674
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:40,680
I that I think I would do that,

675
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:45,260
but I would not smash it against the
fucking wall. They put it in a bat.

676
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,240
Now did,
was it repeated strikes?

677
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,830
Jesus Christ, you know some of this
shit kids used to do in my neighborhood.

678
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,230
Do you know I had a friend of mine,

679
00:41:56,231 --> 00:42:00,820
he's take his house cat and he put in
an empty Pellis pillowcase and he would

680
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:03,970
fucking spin it over his head like
someone like it was at a Steelers game,

681
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,960
you know,
that's what the fuck you would do.

682
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,230
And then sometimes he'd
put it in the dryer.

683
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,090
They used to tell me these stories and
I used to laugh my fucking ass off for

684
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:23,890
some reason.
I found it funny back then.

685
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:28,300
Now I find it absolutely horrific and uh,
I would never do it,

686
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,700
but if I had to do it
either or a dog or a cat,

687
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:34,960
I would definitely do it to a cat.
But it have to be a real douche of a cat.

688
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,000
All right,
so we're getting off the subject here.

689
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,790
So it's cruelty to animals
and she works at a pet store.

690
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:43,090
So that's bizarre because he
figured if you work at a pet store,

691
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,860
that means you either you
love animals or use you.

692
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:52,540
Like I had a low level deal pot. You, you,

693
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,530
you're dealing weed on a low level.
You know what I mean? You're that guy.

694
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:00,610
You like the burnout, Matthew mcconaughey.
At least that's how they used to be.

695
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,190
But then there's the other option
that serial killers, you know,

696
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:08,410
they start off with small animals.
You know,

697
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,620
they watch a ton of porn and they start
torturing small animals and then they

698
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:15,220
gradually work their way up, uh, you know,

699
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,570
to a fucking human being.
So yeah, you could possibly,

700
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,210
you could possibly be dealing with
that right now. Then also, you know,

701
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:26,670
you're looking at it like this is,
that's the mother. Your children

702
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,010
put a hamster in a fucking,

703
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,160
I could see if it was
fucking 1911 rather than 2011

704
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,820
people back then. They kill
an animal. They didn't give
a fuck. They just walk out.

705
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,760
What do you guys want for
dinner? Yeah, yeah. It's,

706
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:47,170
has some goose in the
fucking mom would walk out.

707
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,130
They grabbed the goose by the neck and
then they'd fucking act like they were

708
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:54,850
trying to start up a model t
and they'd go, ah, fucking body.

709
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,870
Then they would just break
its neck nice and quick. Um,

710
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,870
and then they'd pluck it, Nick Cook
it and that was it. And that was,

711
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:08,840
that was dinner 1911. Do you like that
little piece? A piece of history? Uh,

712
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,770
attitude. I don't know what
to tell you. This is like, um,

713
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,820
that's really fucking
insane and at the very least

714
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,890
if you get into a fight with her eye,
she's at the very least,

715
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:27,340
I think she's going to throw something
at you. She might be one of those.

716
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,250
I have no idea. Dude.
How hard is this girl?

717
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,680
I think some of these people I need like
a picture to see if it's like worth it.

718
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,280
You guys seem to be connecting
on like a personality level,

719
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:39,660
but I really got to tell you,

720
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:42,363
you know,

721
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,910
that's just like something
Roger Clemens would do.

722
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:47,740
I could picture him doing that.
You know,

723
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,030
he is that pose posey from the
fucking dirty dozen sort of vibe.

724
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,813
Yes.

725
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,960
All right, here we go. All right, Bill.

726
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:31,870
One of my best friends has been going to
church for years and previously it has

727
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:34,870
never bothered me at all.
Well, Gigi, I grew up,

728
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,730
I grew up Catholic and like so many
Catholics I got raped. No kidding.

729
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,200
I no longer, I no longer attend church,
but it doesn't bother me in the least.

730
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:48,400
If someone else wants to go,

731
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:52,540
this guy is the exact mindset than I am
except by make fun of people who go to

732
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,210
church a little bit, little
bit. A few months ago,

733
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:59,230
my friends started asking me if I would
like to go to church with him gay.

734
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,440
Uh, I plight. I politely declared that's,

735
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:05,500
that's a gay thing to do and I don't mean,
I don't mean nick.

736
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,580
How is it gay to ask someone to go to
church with you because you're both going

737
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:10,570
to be wearing sweaters.

738
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,700
You're going to be singing songs.
You are

739
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,240
oh, lay Lou. Yah.

740
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,880
You'll just sit there and sing with it.

741
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:30,610
You have fucking friend wearing a sweater
and then, then the priest up there,

742
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,910
God knows what he did.

743
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:36,860
It's going to be like he had a beard
and some long hair. Really? He cared.

744
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:40,850
A leper.
Not of you guys can do that.

745
00:46:40,851 --> 00:46:43,400
So you better give us some money.

746
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,430
Yeah. Who are not making fun of mass right
now. It's great to you. It's nothing.

747
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:54,330
Yes. Granted, there are
some things that are not,

748
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,140
none of that horse shit
that overly boodley

749
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,940
hopefully bullied to him. Well, it's like
a call and response. I'll tell you what,

750
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,030
I'll tell you what's fucking sacred.
Meaning the rest of question.

751
00:47:07,031 --> 00:47:09,460
Now you're getting the answer.
Touch. I'll tell you what's sacred.

752
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,000
What's sacred is how you go out in the
playoffs. The Celtics went out with heart.

753
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:17,110
We still lost the fucking, we still
got our ass. We still got arrested.

754
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:21,970
We still got our asses kicked. All right?
But there was no quit in that team.

755
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,440
All right? Okay. That's
fucking sacred. What?

756
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:28,810
Sac religious is what the fucking Lakers
Dick. And I'm like disrespect in the,

757
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,590
I'm saying what? The couple of those
and it wasn't all of them. What? Uh,

758
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,230
it was really what buying him did.
I didn't think but Odom did was bad.

759
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,310
Can you just finish reading Jesus Christ?
Really?

760
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:41,560
All of a sudden you're dictating it.
You asked me why.

761
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:45,580
So he wants to go to church
with me. With him. I repeat gay.

762
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,460
I politely decline. Dude,
I'm not doing that shit.

763
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,390
You're all commentary.

764
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:56,110
That's not a part of the letter because
you're presenting it and then a biased

765
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:59,320
fashion. This, read it and then give
your opinion. You see this shit.

766
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,990
This is a classic fucking broad.

767
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,410
It's like I've been doing this shit for
four years and you're telling me how to

768
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:09,280
run it yet you have no idea how many
more on guys are going to send him hate

769
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:13,720
mail because of that, because not because
you're a jerk, because some other, well,

770
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:17,860
they're morons.
Fucking elitist attitude.

771
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,000
Um,

772
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
since then my friend has told me he feels
it's his mission to spread the word of

773
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,800
God.
Stop saying it like that

774
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,720
and continues to ask me to go. They
got, he drank the fucking cool light.

775
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,850
Now he's a Zombie and as time pass is,

776
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,920
he's getting more aggressive
with his sales pitch.

777
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,790
That means he's probably reaching
out and touching his hand. Uh,

778
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,760
what started off with him just slipping
it into casual conversation is loud now

779
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:55,720
led me to receiving text
messages that say the following,

780
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,580
this means more to you.
This means more to me than you know.

781
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,730
God has poured out love to me and he is
reaching out to you also ignore a few

782
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,050
months, but there is a lot
at stake here. Wow. Yeah,

783
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,990
no, he has a little ones.
He's buying into that.

784
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,250
Jesus is coming back and this
time he's not fucking around.

785
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,700
It's personnel. Yeah. Okay, so
he's buying into the rapture.

786
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:30,160
This hippie is going to come back on
a stegosaurus and just start killing

787
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:34,210
people, killing people. What they
say, what they say is fucking wrong.

788
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,660
He's going to come back wrath.
One of the deadly sins,

789
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,220
Judge's judgment is mine set at the Lord.
He's the son.

790
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,850
He's the Donald Trump. He's got the fuck
he's got to call him over at this point,

791
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,800
coming out of heaven. He didn't make that
money. He didn't make the fucking world.

792
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:54,280
He's just this loud jackass a
fucking fuck. You know, whatever.

793
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,600
Cast me into the fucking pits.
I don't give a shit. You know,

794
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,470
you think I want to hang out with
you in heaven forever. Just go it.

795
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:06,010
Isn't this awesome?
It is awesome.

796
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,780
Can you please finish the
letter? All right. What started
off? Okay, so here we go.

797
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:15,880
Uh, to be to this. I replied,
honestly, it's it, if it's my choice,

798
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,250
I don't want to go.
Please stop asking me about it.

799
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,370
I don't know how many more ways
I can request that they go. Okay.

800
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,550
He responded with, I'll
hold off, but know this,

801
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,070
God loves you and will not quit if I do.

802
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,290
Okay, well then there's no
reason to hit me two times.

803
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,790
Let's just let God do it. All right.
Anyways, here. Cause my question, Bill,

804
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,800
why does this fucking Piss me off so much?
Why did these, why did these cults do,

805
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,320
uh,
what do these cults do to these people?

806
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,240
He's involved with the Church that people
do joke around with and call a cult.

807
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,700
What would you do if you
were me at this point?

808
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:56,210
I don't even want to talk to this guy
cause he's conversations are infuriating

809
00:50:56,211 --> 00:51:00,560
me. Um, yeah, I would, I would
cut this guy out of your life.

810
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,240
It's annoying. This is what it
is. Why you feel that way? No,

811
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,440
but this is his friend Fred.

812
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,280
It's his friend and he and he wa he
wants to get them out of the cult.

813
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:14,300
So the thing is is if you go to him
and you try to get them out of it,

814
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,400
you just going to drive
them further into it.

815
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:21,140
So what you do is just say he just
stopped being friends with them, you know,

816
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,800
and hope that that'll help because they're
not going to go out of that then he's

817
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:29,720
not going to leave it if you ask them to
leave it. Yeah. You never, you never know.

818
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:32,620
But yeah, he needs to just kind of
mouth cause yeah, there's no, you can't,

819
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,950
unless he wants to spend the rest
of his time with his guide debating

820
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:40,250
Catholicism or whatever, which I'm sure
he doesn't want to do. And then yeah,

821
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,460
he should just kinda mom personally,
I would still hang out with them.

822
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,130
And you would just so you could
get into debates with him? No,

823
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:51,190
and I would just do unbelievably
say titanic been annoying shit.

824
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,390
That good idea. I would, I
would list, he should do that.

825
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:58,280
I would always have like shout
at the devil playing, you know,

826
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,110
or maybe just that beginning cheesy thing.

827
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:04,580
She didn't invite women to a restaurant
and it turns out to be like a strip club

828
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,410
and see what he does.
Yeah,

829
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:10,520
but you're going to see the titties on
the outside gentleman's club. That's true.

830
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,320
No, I wouldn't do that shit. I would just,

831
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,660
I would hang out with
him and hang out with,

832
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,020
I would keep saying that I want to get
involved in the church and I would keep

833
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:20,600
going to events and as they were going,
you know,

834
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:24,880
I just feel so filled up with God's love.
I would then be a,

835
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:28,280
you want to talk about filled
up? I fucking jerked off
into this chick's mouth.

836
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:33,250
Like I'm telling you, William Byrd,
she had a big bass miles and I dunno,

837
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,710
maybe it was a couple of days since
the last time I fucking, you know,

838
00:52:36,711 --> 00:52:41,120
let them loose. But I right up to the
brim. She was a champion. She swallowed,

839
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,310
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
This is why you're going there now.

840
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,530
Oh,
why don't you pray for me?

841
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,283
Yes.

842
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:13,903
Yeah.

843
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,150
Um, there was a lot of shit
this, that fucking annoyed

844
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,080
me.
Um,

845
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:32,140
on the gas mileage thing I brought up
last week how I was watching the good bye

846
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:36,200
girl and she was standing at
the corner of the characters,

847
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:39,470
was standing in front of
a fucking Subaru and uh,

848
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:44,471
it got 39 miles per gallon and here it
is 36 years later and my car only gets

849
00:53:45,981 --> 00:53:50,330
fucking enough.
A hybrid only gets 41 miles per gallon.

850
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:56,170
So this brilliant guy writes in and he
goes and he starts talking about leaded

851
00:53:56,171 --> 00:54:00,610
gas and all this fucking Ho
how cars today are heavier.

852
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:06,330
This fucking Moron thought cars today
were heavier than cars back in the day.

853
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,160
You know,
like the 1959 Cadillac,

854
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,900
I'm sure that that car was lighter
than your average Toyota Camry.

855
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,700
Okay.

856
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,030
So anyways, this, somebody sent me, let
me, let me actually read this guy's,

857
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:26,460
this guy's response here. One
of the many that I got. Um,

858
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,420
on the gas mileage thing, it always blows
my mind what people fucking respond to.

859
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,340
So this guy ends up writing me a,
he goes, there are two reasons.

860
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,530
Wait a minute,
it's loading.

861
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,250
Okay,

862
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,230
loading.
I don't know.

863
00:54:42,231 --> 00:54:45,980
He gave me all these fucking reasons
and I basically responded with so basic,

864
00:54:45,981 --> 00:54:49,220
you're telling me, he basically said
that it had nothing to do with money.

865
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:52,280
It had to do with the way
to the cars and somehow the,

866
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:55,310
the mixture of the gasoline
that we use nowadays.

867
00:54:55,311 --> 00:55:00,311
That's why they just can't figure out a
fucking way to get more than like better

868
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,300
than what's the highest you've seen?

869
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:07,050
Like 40 45 this guy tried to say,
well actually there,

870
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:10,760
there are things that get a hundred
miles to gallon their scooters. Uh,

871
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:12,950
what a more rod he goes.

872
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:17,450
It's true reason why old cars have
such highly high published gas mileage.

873
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:22,160
For one, the EPA test simply
used to provide higher numbers.

874
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:26,420
Sir, they've been doing
that right up until the last
couple of years ago. In fact,

875
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:28,400
the year before I bought my Prius,

876
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:33,401
they were legally able to claim that it
got like 55th I actually almost 60 miles

877
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:38,801
per gallon before they cracked down on
the hybrid and made him say actually 40

878
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:43,820
ones.
I'm aware of the EPA test.

879
00:55:43,821 --> 00:55:46,640
I'm aware that they do it
when there's no headwind.

880
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,560
I'm aware that most of the test is when
they're fucking going 25 miles an hour

881
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:55,880
and they only drive the car 55 miles
an hour for about fucking 30 seconds.

882
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,960
I realize that the numbers are skewed.
Okay.

883
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,910
He said it's been revised several times
over the decade. Yeah, so my Prius,

884
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:08,650
you're Prius would get like 70 miles
per gallon on the old test. No,

885
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,950
it wasn't sir. No, it wouldn't. It would
get more like 60 that's what it did look.

886
00:56:12,951 --> 00:56:17,720
So let's just say that it would
get 70 who gives a shit? He goes,

887
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,830
wait, where am I? The second
reason is safety features.

888
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:25,910
Check out the weight of your cars
have gotten heavier. No, they have it.

889
00:56:25,911 --> 00:56:29,720
My Prius is not heavier
than a fucking Subaru.

890
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:30,990
Yeah.

891
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,970
In the 1970s it isn't.

892
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:34,590
Okay,

893
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:39,030
dude, I'm old enough to remember when cars
actually had metal on their dashboard.

894
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,030
They're all plastics hunks of shit now.

895
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,410
Yeah.

896
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,570
He goes, cars, if even 15 years ago,

897
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,470
feature death traps when compared
to the modern cars. No, they didn't.

898
00:56:49,471 --> 00:56:52,920
They've had the crumple free zones.
Those, those little crumpled freak,

899
00:56:52,921 --> 00:56:55,750
they've had those crumple zones for years,
sir.

900
00:56:55,751 --> 00:57:00,751
In 19 fucking 88 I was coming home from
a Christmas party drunk off my ass,

901
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,870
sitting in the fucking passenger
seat of a Pontiac Grand Prix.

902
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,360
We pulled up to a red light.

903
00:57:09,361 --> 00:57:13,800
There was a fucking jeep CJ seven
the old school ones sitting there.

904
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,350
All right. We saw it. I saw
it. The driver's saw it,

905
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:22,140
but the alcohol didn't quite
see it and we just sorta went.

906
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,920
We were slowing down,
but we didn't come to us.

907
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:29,640
Complete slow stop and just
completely rear ended. This guy.

908
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,870
All right. There wasn't a
scratch on the fucking jeep.

909
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,680
This goddamn carp folded up
like a fucking accordion.

910
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,760
The engine dropped down
underneath us and I, I got,

911
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:44,010
I didn't even get a booboo.
I just Sorta, you know,

912
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,230
I didn't have a seatbelt on or nothing.

913
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:51,360
The car was designed to take
80% of the fucking impact.

914
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:55,230
All right. You're sitting in your cubicle.
Just toss in these fucking numbers out.

915
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,080
All right,
so basically my response is,

916
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,410
I'm saying it has nothing to do
with money in the oil companies.

917
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,880
So basically what you're telling me
is that nowadays I can have a video

918
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:10,230
conference with somebody in Brazil while
my entire music collection is in my

919
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:13,920
pocket on a phone that is also
a camera and a video recorder.

920
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,580
I can upload the content onto the
Internet and potentially have it viewed by

921
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,110
every person in the fucking world.

922
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,290
But we can't make a car that does
any better than 40 miles per gallon.

923
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,920
So fortunately, you know, everything
else has fucking progressed

924
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,730
except for gas mileage.
Dude, I'm telling you,

925
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:33,630
they have the technology to
get like 500 miles per gallon.

926
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,420
They're just not going
to fucking put it out,

927
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:37,640
okay.

928
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,090
Because that's how powerful the
God damn oil companies are there.

929
00:58:41,091 --> 00:58:42,530
Right up there with the banks.

930
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,930
You got the banks and then
you've got the oil company.

931
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:48,650
The banks control the money supply,
and then the oil companies,

932
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,270
they control energy.

933
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:51,560
Okay.

934
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,330
Okay. You control energy. You can control
the fucking population. Do you know that?

935
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:57,800
They're actually out here.
This people,

936
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,190
this selling kits out here to have your
own fucking windmill so you can get

937
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:05,000
yourself off the grid. So then they
immediately pass the fucking law,

938
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,200
General Electric,

939
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,280
that General Electric had to come around
and make sure that everything was safe.

940
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,220
They had to get their
fucking noses back in there.

941
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,180
So cause they can't have people
disappearing off the fucking grid.

942
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,570
Okay?

943
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:23,410
You can't have people getting free
energy other than the cost of the fucking

944
00:59:23,411 --> 00:59:24,940
windmill.
You can't have them sitting there.

945
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,090
And every time the God damn wind blows,

946
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,680
it recharges a generator and now I don't
have to work as much if I don't have to

947
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:34,990
work as much.
I don't have to go into debt.

948
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,800
You're getting yourself off of the fucking
treadmill and they can't have that.

949
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:40,470
All right.
God dammit.

950
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,690
I wish I was more intelligent so I could
explain this better. But you know what,

951
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,010
this is a great documentary.
I'm actually going to email this guy back.

952
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,800
It's called the gas
whole full documentary.

953
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:54,310
And there's the they and
they have everything from,

954
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:55,530
okay.

955
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,330
They have everything from the,
the,

956
00:59:57,331 --> 01:00:02,060
the urban myth of the
watered powered carburetor,

957
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,180
which this guy who are brought
to me completely dismissed.

958
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:09,170
He completely dismissed any sort
of a that, that, that, that,

959
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:12,560
that exists because he sits in a cubicle
and I sit in the fucking bedroom,

960
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,000
all right? And he tries to
just say, that's just another
media hoax. All, you know,

961
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:21,050
they said, do we beat Eisenhower?
A fucking like dumb shit like that.

962
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:23,503
Okay.

963
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,990
This guy,
so this documentary,

964
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:28,750
I have everything from like the
urban myths that the, that these, uh,

965
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,540
water powered cars existed,
um,

966
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,260
all the way up to actual, uh, retired, um,

967
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,400
scientists who worked for Shell,

968
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,110
who you just have to watch this
documentary. They were showing,

969
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,650
there was a book out that claimed that
they could get a 149 miles per gallon in

970
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:52,160
the 1950s on like a Packard or de Soto.

971
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:58,170
And by the 70s this scientist who worked
for Shell said they had gotten it up to

972
01:00:58,171 --> 01:00:59,790
a thousand miles per gallon.

973
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:01,643
All right.

974
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:03,670
I don't know why people think

975
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,050
that it's,
it's

976
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:11,240
absolutely impossible to improve the
gas mileage. Some people feel that.

977
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:16,040
I don't know why people feel like we can't
come up with anything better than the

978
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:19,580
gas combustion engine.
It's complete fucking book.

979
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,070
It's the same level of bullshit as that.

980
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:25,250
There's an actual difference
between a Democrat and a Republican.

981
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,950
Watch this documentary,
the gas hole.

982
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,970
We're going to have the link up
on the Monday morning podcast.

983
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,860
Just watch this shit and I don't know
what to tell you. Some of it looks like,

984
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,050
okay, they have this
old guy going, you know,

985
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:43,010
and this guy showed up and he heard it
was a contraption made auto, you know,

986
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:48,050
it was powered on water and then he
claimed that Shell bought the patent,

987
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,340
gave him $1 million and then he
could never fucking, you know,

988
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,180
make another one now.
That's the kind of Shit,

989
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:58,770
some old guy saying that he saw it on
a salt flat in the 1950s I'm not going

990
01:01:58,771 --> 01:02:02,190
with that. All right? I'm not
that much of a fucking whack job,

991
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:06,360
but when a guy who worked used to work
for Shell is coming out saying that type

992
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:10,560
of stuff, it's just, it gets to the
point like, are all of these people nuts?

993
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,933
You know what I mean?

994
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:17,650
There's no fucking way. I don't give
a shit whether there's led and gas,

995
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:21,830
whether there's not led and how much
the car fucking ways or any of that

996
01:02:21,831 --> 01:02:24,050
bullshit.
There's no fucking way.

997
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:25,650
Okay.

998
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:27,960
That in, in, in almost 40 years,

999
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:30,330
you can't do better than
two more miles per gallon.

1000
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,670
I absolutely fucking refuse to believe it.

1001
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:37,500
I fucking refuse to believe it.
I think it's complete fucking horseshit.

1002
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,070
It's just another way to, to
keep control of the herd. Now,

1003
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:44,460
if you want to argue that you need to
keep control to her or this is going to be

1004
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:47,190
absolute chaos,
so we have to keep cars down like that.

1005
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,720
I will listen to that argument.

1006
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,100
But if you're going to come at me
and tell me that in 2000 fucking 11

1007
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,560
okay,

1008
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,230
okay. When I'm reading shit
that in the medical field,

1009
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:03,790
they can now grow a fucking a new
colon for somebody outside of the body.

1010
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,321
I read this,

1011
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:10,130
this thing on their ted.com this
woman had a completely ulcerated large

1012
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:13,820
intestine, so they took some
sort of tissue, CARF culture,

1013
01:03:13,821 --> 01:03:16,850
whatever the fuck that means
out of her of diseased colon.

1014
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:22,730
Use that to then grow another one
outside of a body where they would done

1015
01:03:22,731 --> 01:03:23,270
growing it.

1016
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:27,500
They took the old one out and put the
new one in like she went down to midas

1017
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:31,280
muffler and it totally
fucking worked okay.

1018
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:35,600
Up until like five years ago,
you will looking at a colostomy bag,

1019
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:40,280
you would have a bag of shit right under
her fucking right titty for the rest of

1020
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:44,510
her goddamn life. Her social
life would have been over. Okay.

1021
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,970
If they can do that,

1022
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,100
you're telling me you're still going to
tell me they can't do any better than

1023
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:55,650
about 40 fucking 45 miles a gallon.

1024
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:59,940
You're really going to sit there and
believe that in your Goddamn cubicle that

1025
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:04,260
they just can't fucking,
just can't fucking figure it out.

1026
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:08,940
The only way I can get like a hundred
miles a gallon is if I ride on a fucking

1027
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:13,500
scooter. You sir, believe in Santa Claus.

1028
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,190
Yeah.

1029
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,740
I remember one time I have this
old piece of shit truck, right?

1030
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:22,300
That I drove for like 10 years because
I knew I wanted to be a comedian and I

1031
01:04:22,301 --> 01:04:26,290
didn't want to go into debt.
So when the engine finally died,

1032
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:29,650
I threw a new engine in there and the
guy told me he needed to rebuild the

1033
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:30,700
carburetor.
I'm like,

1034
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:34,330
you don't need to rebuild the carburetor
so you know what this cunt did.

1035
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,830
He fucking adjusted the carburetors.
So I would just get shitty gas mileage

1036
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:44,440
hoping I would be an absolute fucking
moron and then drive back and be like,

1037
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:48,580
Whoa, I guess you're right. I'm just,
I'm just chowing through gas here.

1038
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,580
That's what this mother fucker did.

1039
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,300
Okay.

1040
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,710
At his little garage.

1041
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,280
This little piece of shit did that because
it wasn't enough that he fucking made

1042
01:05:00,441 --> 01:05:05,270
1600 fucking bucks off me.
He wanted to make like fucking 1900 bucks.

1043
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,240
So he did that just as
a fucking individual.

1044
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,660
And you're going to try and tell me that
a corporation that basically controls

1045
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:16,490
the world fucking energy.
He's not going to buy up patents

1046
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,110
by people that, that are,
that are, that are are,

1047
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:25,111
are making or coming up with a
carburetors and stuff like carburetors.

1048
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,550
But both coming up with,
with,

1049
01:05:26,551 --> 01:05:30,960
with alternate ways of powering
a car more efficiently.

1050
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:33,960
They're not going to buy that up. Do
they have that whole Stanley mayor thing?

1051
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,000
And that's not a conspiracy theory either.
We actually,

1052
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:43,470
we actually played the news clip
on the opie and Anthony Show.

1053
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,650
Stanley mayor,
great news for individuals,

1054
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:50,460
but bad news for oil companies claims
he's come up with an engine that can run

1055
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:54,780
on any type of water,
fresh water, salt water,

1056
01:05:54,781 --> 01:05:58,080
rainwater doesn't make a difference in
he claims he can drive across the country

1057
01:05:58,081 --> 01:06:03,030
on 28 gallons of water. Um,
this is of such interest.

1058
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:05,700
The Pentagon is sending a
lieutenant colonel out there.

1059
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,750
That was the actual news clip
from the opiate Anthony show.

1060
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,550
It was an actual news clip.

1061
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:15,900
It's not some bullshit I read
on a fucking website. Okay.

1062
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,060
Now what happened after that? Nobody
knows. But basically within 10 years,

1063
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,240
Stanley was dead in his car disappeared.

1064
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,720
And his brother right now is trying to
get the car back and nobody knows where

1065
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:32,150
the fuck it is. All right? Um, I,

1066
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:37,170
I truly believe that the quickest death
sentence you could possibly have is to

1067
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:42,471
go on the news and claim that you've come
out with an alternate source of energy

1068
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,900
that's going to put a corporation
out of business that is making,

1069
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,740
that is projected to make
$350 billion next year.

1070
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,630
How much do you think your life is worth?
And if you have $350 billion,

1071
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,700
how easy is it do you think,
to get somebody to solve this problem?
