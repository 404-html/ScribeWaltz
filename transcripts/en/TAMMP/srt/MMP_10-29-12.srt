1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,410
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,710
It's the Monday morning
podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,270
October 29th,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,440
2012 how's it going? How are you?
You know, I said a really weird,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,870
really weird fucking thought.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,050
As I was sitting down here
getting ready to do this podcast,

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,560
looking at my new mixer, I had
to buy a new mixer. By the way.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,090
There was the one bad thing that happened
to me when I went to Australia was, uh,

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,130
you know, had this piece of shit mixer
that I brought that was like, you know,

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,260
99 bucks and I plugged it into the wall
and there was some sort of surge in the

11
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:41,100
fucking thing died as I told you
last week. So I finally had to, uh,

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,740
had to go out and buy a new one.
Does it sound any different?

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,420
I don't know why I bought one that was
cost me twice as much money to do the

14
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:52,260
exact same fucking podcast that nobody
ever bitched about other than the fact

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,740
that they say it's never out on Monday
morning despite the fact they explain

16
00:00:55,741 --> 00:01:00,210
every fucking week that it's my Monday
morning. I do it on Monday morning. Okay.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,400
It's not about you. It's about me. This
is all about me. You understand me?

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,730
Well, um, anyway,

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,130
has had this really fucked up thought
that I've been doing this podcast since

20
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,940
like June or July of 2007 every,

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,890
basically every Monday. I remember one
year, it took two weeks off for Christmas.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,050
That was nice. Back before this
became a corporate entity. Um,

23
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,760
I, uh, I just realized
I got, I got, you know,

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,990
I keep forgetting the hype,
our new podcast page, the
a all things comedy page.

25
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:43,220
Why don't you fucking go to that every
once in a while? Oh, I'm the worst.

26
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,830
Why do I drink before I do these things?
Whenever I do this,

27
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:50,630
it never fucking goes, well, let's stay
on track, Bill. Stay on track. Okay.

28
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:54,530
You're freckled cunt. All right, here
we go. So I had this thought, you know,

29
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,060
I basically let me doing this podcast
every Monday since June or July of 2007.

30
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,810
Right?

31
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,760
Every fucking Monday on
basically documenting every
Monday of my fucking life,

32
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:08,240
give or take. Sometimes a Tuesday
is Sunday, whatever. All right.

33
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,620
Don't split hairs with me. I'm not in the
fucking mood. And I was just wondering,

34
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:15,500
you know, when is going to be
the last Monday of my life?

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,070
One of these is going to be the,
it's going to be the last Monday.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,930
How far away is that?

37
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:25,910
Monday you start thinking about
like the ever even think of,

38
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:29,510
but just about like Diane, you
know, I know it's a Monday.

39
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,760
You don't need to hear this will fuck you.
I'm thinking about it.

40
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,860
Okay.

41
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,610
I mean hopefully it's going to be a long
ways off, but what if I died tragically,

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,190
you know, one of those fucking,
what's a good tragic death, you know,

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,980
how'd he get you replaced
the light over the garage?

44
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,611
Yeah,

45
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:54,230
it's been out for like the last two
weeks and I get out of the car and I just

46
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:58,440
hear things. I don't know what
it is. I don't know. Leaves,

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,250
I dunno if it's a bird or like a,
some sort of bugs are right.

48
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,030
I'll fucking change it.
You don't have to yell.

49
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,040
Right. And then you go out there after
you had a couple of beers, right.

50
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,970
You go up where on that fucking step
ladder that's supposed to be for your

51
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,150
mother in law so she can get up there
and get her fucking favorite ball,

52
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:23,800
the Pura God damn fucking or
uh, cheerio's into, right.

53
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,700
You grabbed that one instead instead
of dragging out the silver one because

54
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,390
you're fucking lazy and he'd take that
little step ladder out and you get all

55
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,480
the way up to the top and it's only
three steps and you can't quite reach it.

56
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,240
Right. See fucking get on
your little tippy toes. Right.

57
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,780
And you start reaching up for the fucker.
All of a sudden you hear that rattling.

58
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,330
You look like dad, you pull a nerve
in your neck and there you go.

59
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:47,350
Fucking reverse lawn,
dark fucking inverted like that plane.

60
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,270
And that Denzel movie where he's like,

61
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,410
I'm sorry I was drunk and my
Afro wasn't picked out correctly,

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,950
but did I or did I not land
the fucking plane safely?

63
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,620
That's what it's going to be.
90 minutes of that,

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,560
90 minutes of that.
All right.

65
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,640
Yes, but she would drunk. Yeah, but he's
still alive. Well that's not the point.

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,630
Yeah, it is. Go Fuck Yourself.
Did you know fucking mad?

67
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,040
I would be if I landed a plane,

68
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:17,240
shit faced and somebody gave
me a rough time about it. Well,

69
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:21,620
why were you drunk?
I don't know cause it's fucking boring

70
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,500
cause that's where I take off.

71
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,310
I just throw it on fucking autopilot and
then I'm basically just sitting in this

72
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,110
fucking uncomfortable,

73
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:34,640
lazy boy that I cannot get out
of for the next four to six hours

74
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,150
till I talked to some other Douche
bag. Okay. I flew in fucking, I flew,

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,850
I had fucking combat missions.

76
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,040
I'm used to getting shot at and now
I'm doing this driving a fucking bus.

77
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,910
It's not going to drink.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,833
Okay.

79
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,130
When it came down to it,

80
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,200
that motherfucker was upside down and
I still landed it and you'll giving me

81
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,270
shit. Do you know much
fucking money? I saved you,

82
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,533
right?

83
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,390
Isn't that what's going to be? That'd
be an owl. That's if I wrote that movie,

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,313
that's what it would be.

85
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,250
It would be the first 10 minutes
is him getting shit faced. Right.

86
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,020
The next fucking five to seven
minutes is all the holy fuck.

87
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:20,021
We're upside down a bunch of fat cows
hanging from their fucking seat belts is

88
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:24,020
the hero. The movies such a bad ass.
His hat doesn't even come off right,

89
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
and he's just slurring.
I got it, I got it right.

90
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,210
And everybody's screaming like
a bunch of bitches. Any of that.

91
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:41,940
I go fuck yourselves. Right? And then he
lands it. And when he lands and everybody,

92
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,130
high fives, a man, when he's
standing there going, hey,

93
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:48,090
thank you for flying fucking twa or
whatever. He takes a little flask out,

94
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,500
takes another hit,

95
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,220
slapped some fucking stewardess on her
ass and he gets off the plane and then he

96
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:57,650
falls down the stairs, right? That's the
left. That's the left turn for the comedy.

97
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,280
And then everybody starts
breaking his fucking balls.

98
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,080
That'll be the next two pages. It's what?
What are we up to now? Page 19 all right,

99
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:11,081
so from page 19 to page 120 is going to
be him screaming at all the fucking pee

100
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:17,300
on instead of yelling at him
for being drunk. You know,

101
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,110
would you rather have me be stoned,

102
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:23,150
sober and actually contemplate
my own fucking mortality?

103
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,730
You know, I would have ended
up in the fucking Goddamn Lake.

104
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:31,931
You know something.

105
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:35,560
You always like believe the movie and
then Hollywood always has to Hollywood it

106
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,190
up.

107
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,970
Did he really have to be completely upside
down like he was in the fucking blue

108
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:43,210
angels? I mean, I guess those planes,
they can actually do that shit,

109
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:44,530
but give me a fucking break.

110
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:45,880
Okay.

111
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,580
Okay. Do you know how much work
that's going to be for the fucking,

112
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,540
the props people where every fucking take,

113
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,190
they got a fucking clean coffee

114
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,410
it trail mix off the ceiling
of this fucking plane,

115
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,890
this fake half a fucking play it out.
Gives a shit.

116
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,680
Let's plow ahead. At least you know we
actually were coming along way though.

117
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:11,380
I feel that could affect that
Denzel was a pilot and it,

118
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:15,040
there's no racial issue there. It's
just that he's a drunk. That's great.

119
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,930
That's actually a good thing
and I'm not even being funny.

120
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:20,770
Like that's actually a good thing because
the second I saw it I was expecting

121
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:23,960
like my old joke, you know, whether
it was good, be some like, all right,

122
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,870
fine with that son.
Of a bitch.

123
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,420
I thought it was going to be one
of those movies and it wasn't.

124
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,770
It was just like he did a great thing,
but he was drunk. Now what do we do bill?

125
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,910
We've seen trailer. How long are
you going to milk it? We got it.

126
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,940
You got to fill a fucking hour.
How about changing the topic?

127
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:43,240
Once every 19 minutes. Alright, fine.

128
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,611
All right,

129
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:50,530
let's get back to talking to my about
my death or is my fun or is this podcast

130
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:53,770
just going to go on way
longer than it should?

131
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,560
Way past the time that it's fucking
relevant and fuck all you can to send me

132
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:02,770
emails that said stop being relevant
the day I started doing it. All right.

133
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,420
Could go on for the easy jokes.

134
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,380
Step up your game if you're going to be
fucking mean. Let's try to be creative.

135
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,050
You know where I'm at? Um, at at
Paul Versey, that's my Twitter handle

136
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,410
anyways. Yeah. What if I go way
too long and I'm like 87 years old,

137
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:22,360
like approach approaching
like that Bob Hope Age,

138
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,460
right? Sitting here wheezing, you
know, with some 22 year old girl,

139
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,440
works over the varicose veins in my
fucking legs so I can just keep podcasting

140
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,940
or I could go out classy.

141
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,200
I could go out at about 59 right?

142
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,260
And 15 fucking years I could go out like
Johnny Carson actually if I went left

143
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:51,890
at 59, I go out like Jay Leno and then
I would give to my podcast to some other

144
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,750
redheaded guy and then
come back and take it.

145
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,560
So I'll go out like Carson at about 65
66 and that's how I'm going to do it.

146
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,670
I would wear a Tuxedo and I'm
gonna sit here quietly and uh,

147
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,170
I'll pay the greatest hits of the podcast
from the previous week cause I'm too

148
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,040
fucking lazy. There's no fucker web
going through. What would that be?

149
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,120
20 years of a podcast. It
ain't happening. All right.

150
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,100
So do you guys just get
that out of your heads?

151
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,910
There will be no farewell
show on this podcast,

152
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,840
this podcast. I've started like fucking
four times, cause I swear to God,

153
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,990
I'm still buzzing a little bit so I can't
even remember what the Hell I talked

154
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:31,530
about. Um, I don't know.

155
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:35,460
Did I talk about football yet? Have I
talked about it? I don't give a shit.

156
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,980
They didn't talk about, I talked about the
Patriots. Right? Did I? It gives a fuck.

157
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:41,311
You know what,

158
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm just going to go forward and if I
feel like I already talked about it then,

159
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
then that's just what it's going to be.
You're like that.

160
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,470
I got a little philosophical there. I've
got a little hippy on you, didn't I? Um,

161
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,010
I didn't really talk about it last
week, by the way. Uh, I can't even,

162
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,990
I started to touch on it, but I was
a little out of sorts because my, uh,

163
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,810
I didn't have my mix up on my
fucking headphones last week,

164
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:07,310
so I was just really just felt
weird to just sit there, be talking

165
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,020
to a goddamn laptop top us,

166
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:16,021
speaking of which I want to
do that ted.com just look
up robots and try to find

167
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:20,780
the one where the, with this,
this, this lady is sitting there,

168
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,210
she's fucking talking about,
you know,

169
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,450
having robots around the house.

170
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,100
Okay.

171
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,580
You know what I mean? It is the
stupidest thing. Okay. First of all,

172
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,020
she's whoring it up for no
particular reason in the beginning.

173
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:38,300
I don't know why she's wearing
like these hooker boots.

174
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,620
She sitting there talking about robots
to a bunch of Egghead nerds and she's

175
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,110
still got a horror it up.
It's like,

176
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,140
can't you just stand on the merit of
the fucking speech that you wrote?

177
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,440
Do you really got to get
people's Dicks half full?

178
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:56,290
Just so they'll keep listening to you?
How fucking insecure are you?

179
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,530
You're talking about robots in the house.

180
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,490
Okay.

181
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,560
Walking down the hallway.
What's up?

182
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,380
Fucking high five and a
God damn robot that right.

183
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,080
And it's not like it's a movie.
It's fucking real.

184
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,900
That's not compelling enough of a subject.

185
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,910
You can't hold the audience's interest.

186
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,570
You still have to put on
your street walker boots.

187
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,160
It's weird. She has on street walker
boots, but she has on a modest skirt.

188
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,760
It comes down a little maybe cause
the boots go up so fucking high.

189
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,420
You know what I mean? I mean there
isn't that basically the rule,

190
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,400
if you're going to wear the
fucking thigh high boots,

191
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,490
you basically have to
have on a mini skirt.

192
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,840
Okay.

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,170
Um, by the way, how great, how
our holidays Halloween become?

194
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,440
It's just the fucking greatest thing ever.
You know what I mean?

195
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,840
It's just girls just go
out dress like horse.

196
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,130
Even girls who aren't horse dress like
whores is fucking great, you know?

197
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,863
Phenomenal.

198
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,680
I took me to lunch and there was some
girls standing there in basically,

199
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,550
who's kidding?

200
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,400
Who was something David Lee Roth would
a warrant except it was on a woman,

201
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,360
so it was fucking great.

202
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,220
It was just black and white.
Striped,

203
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:11,221
basically spandex suit and then she was
standing there with these grain pumps on

204
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,750
and then some sort of ears and
evidently that was a costume.

205
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,640
I don't know what it was. I'll tell you,
I don't know what it was, but I locked it.

206
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:25,990
Shit. Um, you know, I was
sitting there the other night,

207
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,490
last night actually,

208
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,200
he says through the cloud of alcohol and
I was on this sportsmans channel and I

209
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:35,200
was watching rednecks shooting wild pigs.

210
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,760
Okay.

211
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,930
From a helicopter. This was a
sport. I mean, who's kidding, who?

212
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,930
It's a fucking skill.
The pigs are running,

213
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,200
the helicopter is moving,
but they fly the helicopter,

214
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,920
they try to fly as close to
the same speed as the pig.

215
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,880
And it's just such a fucking joke.
After awhile dead.

216
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,930
It's just like you just start rooting
for the pigs. Stupid ass fucking pig.

217
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,820
Just stay under the trees.
He can't see you.

218
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,800
And they just fucking shoot
one God damn pig after another.

219
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,650
And I'm sitting there going like,
Jesus Christ to fucking pigs.

220
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,780
He's gotta be 600 pounds worth the meat.
You know,

221
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,130
kind of fucking barbecue.
You haven't stopped shooting
these God damn wild boars,

222
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,730
right. And they keep
cutting to the guy go, well,

223
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:24,400
what are the difficulties when you're,
uh,

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
when you are in a helicopter trying to
hew to peg is when we try and do a lead

225
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,800
them how far you're supposed to lead them.

226
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:35,950
It's basically the scene from full
metal jacket. Yes sir. Yes sir.

227
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Get some except it's pigs rather
than children in Vietnam and women,

228
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,600
you know. So anyways, so they cut to the
whole thing like it's fucking hilarious.

229
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:51,601
The Guy who is teaching you how to do
it is some retired special forces guy.

230
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:56,890
He had this Australian accent and I'm
just thinking of all the fucking shit that

231
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:57,790
this guy's done.

232
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,260
Okay.

233
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,150
You know what I mean? It's almost like
seeing like a retired athlete who,

234
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,970
you know it like the ground round,
who like won a super bowl.

235
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,480
Now he is in the fucking corner booth
sitting there eating fish and chips.

236
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,243
You know what I'm saying?

237
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,120
And literally the hottest girl in the
place can walk over and just show him his

238
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:20,050
clamp, her clam, and he's not
even going to fucking bat an eye.

239
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,910
You know why? Because he
walked on the moon. It's over.

240
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,750
He's been to outer space does,

241
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,920
you can't get the guy's
fucking heart rate going again.

242
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,480
So I'm fucking sitting there looking
at the special forces guy just go,

243
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:38,220
and this is, this is, this is the end.

244
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,300
You know, you're sneaking around
Saddam's fucking Cabana, snapping necks,

245
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,333
you know,

246
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,480
dressed like Tom Cruise at the beginning
of fucking mission impossible doing all

247
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,960
that shit I want. It's over
honorable discharge. Where are you?

248
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,480
You're in the middle of fucking
Texas teaching rednecks,

249
00:14:56,481 --> 00:15:01,340
how to shoot fucking pigs
from a helicopter. And the
guys just sit and they go,

250
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:04,670
yeah, you know, uh, you know, got to
leave him that far. Just basically,

251
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:09,050
if you aim just a little in front of their
nose with how fast the helicopters go

252
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,490
on,
you're going to get a body shot.

253
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,200
And with the caliber of
bullet that you're shooting,

254
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:16,460
it's going to be a kill
shot. Ah, Jesus Christ.

255
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,970
I got to get a divorce. Um, so anyways,

256
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,991
this is the great thing.

257
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:28,490
So they cut to the fucking guy whose ranch
they're basically hunting on and he's

258
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:29,780
sitting down,
cause I'm sitting there going,

259
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:31,430
why are they killing
all these God damn pigs?

260
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,660
And this fucking guy on the ranch
is just sitting there going like,

261
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,300
he's like, oh, they layer multiplied.
Uh, it's, they're, they're,

262
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:45,290
they ate all the grass in the front yard.
They ate the grass in the backyard.

263
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,140
I mean, they're, they're a
plague. Wait, we have to,

264
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,170
we have to do this viral moving
400 pigs from the population.

265
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,560
It's actually a good thing that
he kept calling him a plague.

266
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,420
They're a plague.
Wild pigs are a fucking plague.

267
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,470
Okay.

268
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,810
You know, that's the one thing, like,

269
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,740
I'm fascinated with stereotypical
conservative and liberal thought.

270
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,240
You know, people just sort of
think one way all the fucking time.

271
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,490
Like the genius of Conservative thought
is it holds people responsible for their

272
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,960
actions. You know what I mean?
You don't get to be like, well,

273
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,770
that's because my mom left when
I was at kick out. Fuck yourself.

274
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:31,490
Get stabbed someone, you're going
to jail, you can't. All right.

275
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,600
That's when it totally makes sense.
Right?

276
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,320
But those guys like that,

277
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:43,220
the thing about them is they have a
complete inability to ever step outside

278
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:47,330
themselves and see it from
another perspective. Okay.

279
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,070
If 400 fucking

280
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,720
okay,

281
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,450
wild boar on your property or a plague,

282
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,860
what are 7 billion human beings?
What are we classified as?

283
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,050
I don't understand what you mean.
God said go forth and multiply.

284
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,700
Go out and take a shit in the
fucking ocean. I'm an that. Now.

285
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:13,380
What did he put all this here for us?
Like that fucking thought.

286
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,440
You know, like no matter what
you do, you're fucking right.

287
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,990
You just see shit.

288
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,880
They just looking out their own fucking
heads would be one thing. If he said,

289
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:28,200
listen, I get it. They got
a right to be here too,

290
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:31,410
but I make my living off my fucking
ranch and I can't have these fat cats

291
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:35,850
running around eating everything that
I'm growing. Then I'd be like, all right,

292
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:40,340
I see that. But to call them
a fucking plague, you know?

293
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,330
Does that make any sense to you guys?
Did I add?

294
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,710
And I actually say it in a way that
made sense after booze and all day,

295
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,100
once cleos asleep

296
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,300
on the floor.
Anyways,

297
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,840
let's get to some advertising
here for this week. Uh,

298
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,190
Jesus and I talk too fucking long.
I got to answer the phone.

299
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,590
I got to enter the password.
Who the hell told me to do this?

300
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,100
You've got to make sure your
computer's locked down for what?

301
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,180
Yeah,

302
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,550
like I have the codes to
launch the fucking missiles.

303
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,610
I was trying to say launch the missile,
Sarah. Um, stamps.com everybody. Hey,

304
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,730
do you like going to the post
office? Well, keep going buddy.

305
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,740
Cause that part of my life is over
because I have stamps.com everyone.

306
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,910
I have the post office in my house.
What do you mean literally?

307
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,440
Not Literally stupid.

308
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,860
I mean I have all the components I need
that I never have to go to the post

309
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:39,861

driver's seat a week ago or whenever the

310
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:43,560
hell I started doing this a year ago.
Whenever the hell it was.

311
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,180
Okay.

312
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,490
It wasn't my choice. I had to go down
there. They had me by the short hairs.

313
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,810
Now I got dumb. Now I don't
need them. I broke up with them.

314
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,190
They're calling me wanting to get back
together. Okay. Ain't happening. Why?

315
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,660
Because with stamps.com,

annoying after awhile.

319
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,280
I'm no more wasting time with the
post office. What a hassle. Um,

320
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,740
it's written right there in
the copy. What a hassle. Oh,

321
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:22,390
how old was the person who wrote this?
What a hassle man.

322
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,320
The pigs came down were
hassling us at the protest, man.

333

of the homepage and type in burpee.

334
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,920
You are our, that's stamps.com
enter [inaudible]. All right,

335
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,130
back to the podcast here. Um, so anyways,

336
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,310
as I was mentioning, uh, traveling
to Australia, I can't remember,

337
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:18,400
did I already talk about this?
That's the theme of this.

338
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:22,460
Did I or did I already say this?
Stop me if I've repeated this. Um,

339
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,670
if you never traveled
outside of the country,

340
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm talking to Americans here
and stop rolling your eyes.

341
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:31,380
You can't see fucking Europeans.
All right? Goddamn assholes.

342
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,730
You trip over a fucking broom stick.
You fall into another country over there.

343
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:35,660
Okay.

344
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,330
It's fucking ridiculous.
Literally you can from England,

345
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,070
there's like people who can swim to
France. That's how fucking close it is.

346
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,000
Literally swim to France before the
sharks get them. It doesn't make any,

347
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,040
but they can

348
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,330
do it.
That's how close it is.

349
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,210
It's like when the Bruins used
to play the fucking whalers,

350
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,690
you could decide at five o'clock
you want to go to the game,

351
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,210
fucking jump on the mass
pike and you would get out,

352
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,630
make a left and you were there.
Um,

353
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,410
Australia is a great one to start
with. It really is. First of all,

354
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:11,250
their customers is great. It was
fucking awesome. They just say, hey,

355
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:14,130
how's it go and get in there yet coop,
they toss your hair,

356
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,670
none of that nine 11 shit. Slap your on
your ass and you're fucking in there.

357
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,290
You're in the country.

358
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,950
Then everybody speaks English
already and if you're from Boston,

359
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,190
it's going to sound familiar because
they basically have a Boston accent.

360
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,310
They just stretch it out a
little bit more. We say beer,

361
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,330
they say [inaudible] we say blockbuster.
They say blockbuster,

362
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,360
it's terrible accent. Go Fuck Yourself.
It's basically what it is. All right.

363
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:40,194
The good people,

364
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,460
they're fun people and they like to
booze and they don't bring up our foreign

365
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:49,260
policy. I don't know why, but
they don't. So there you go.

366
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,570
There's my ringing
endorsement for Australia. Um,

367
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,620
oh, you know what he did when I get
on the way back, I actually, uh,

368
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:01,830
you know that duty free shit,
I don't even get it.

369
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,550
Everybody goes fucking nuts when they
go in there and they got like chocolate

370
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:09,180
bars the size of a fucking
log you'd thrown in a fire

371
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,380
that Toblerone they live.

372
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,870
It was the size of a fucking pillow
and not one of those ones that you just

373
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:19,990
throw on a fucking sofa to dress it up,
but you couldn't put your head on it.

374
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,050
It's useless actually. Makes you hurt
your neck even more. Not One of those,

375
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:27,880
I mean one of those, I'm going to
bed, right. Full-Size fucking pillow.

376
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,390
All right guys.
I'm having a different way.

377
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,770
They've got to fucking explain it
to you all made out of chocolate,

378
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,840
right? They got, they got, I took a
picture of it. They had a fucking,

379
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,400
it was Johnny Walker blue
or Johnny Walker black.

380
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,510
This thing,
it was decided.

381
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,940
You ever see those gas cans they use
in racing like Nascar where they just

382
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:51,160
fucking tip that thing up?
It was like the size of that.

383
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,560
I literally put my fucking
ghost white hand next to it,

384
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:56,620
just to give you a little
bit of perspective how big
it was. And it was like,

385
00:22:56,621 --> 00:23:00,190
I dunno. I Dunno. It was like,
and like 200 bucks. I can't even,

386
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,370
I can't tell if it's a deal or not because
everything is gigantic and it's still

387
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:04,720
costs a couple hundred bucks.

388
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,740
So I'm walking through there and
it's all kinds of fucking Cologne,

389
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,230
like 10 years worth of Cologne,
perfumes, all kinds of booze.

390
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,380
So I finally say to this law,

391
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:19,780
okay,

392
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,830
I go, Hey, do you got any? You got any
cigars? And she's like, yeah we do.

393
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:24,641
You gotta go in here.

394
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:29,170
So I walked through this whole fucking
little maze to this back room and I walk

395
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:32,470
in and I go, you got any Cubans? You got
some Cuban cigars? And they're like, yeah,

396
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,270
we don't have a problem with Fidel Castro.
That's fucking you guys. All right.

397
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:38,081
So I say,
cool.

398
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:42,460
So I go and I buy a box of fucking
25 of them and it's cool, man.

399
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:43,780
They got like the actual,

400
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,730
like I bought Cuban cigars but like two
or three and they put them in a little

401
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:48,110
fucking baggies here,
you know?

402
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,580
But this actually had the fucking cigar
box with the little nail in it and shit.

403
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,030
But what sucks is over
there they have like,

404
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,980
they put these warning labels that
are just beyond warning labels.

405
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,540
Like the first one I look,
hey,

406
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,550
I'll bump bumper stick APP is they say
bumper sticker across the fucking top of

407
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:08,624
it.

408
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,480
Okay.

409
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,240
And it was a picture of
a guy's cancerous mouth,

410
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,050
like lesions on his lips and like he
had all kinds of periodontal issues and

411
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:22,980
fucking write it out teeth. It's
like, I don't need to see that.

412
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,330
Okay.

413
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,150
When I buy a case of beer,
they don't show a picture of a fucking,

414
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,610
how'd he say there was cirrhosis, liver
cirrhosis sized cirrhosis of the liver,

415
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,230
liver cirrhosis scenes. What do they
not show me a fucking picture of that.

416
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:38,910
Some fatty fucking liver they don't.

417
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,860
So I actually had to go between the
lesser of two evils and other one had like

418
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,540
literally the skull and bones with some
sort of like not a graduated cylinder.

419
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,940
The one that Kinda looks like a beer mug,
but there's no handle on it.

420
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,670
All you nerds out there, I know
what the fuck it is. Right? Um,

421
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,430
they had that on there.
That was like the best I could fucking do.

422
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,030
And I brought it back to the country and

423
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,310
okay,

424
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,740
I dunno, I've kind of picked up a
cigar habit. I have to break it.

425
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:11,120
So now I got fucking, I got 24
left and someone was like, dude,

426
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,490
you got to get a human door.
He can't let those things go bad.

427
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,270
So now I bought a humidor.
So now I'm a fucking smoker.

428
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:21,560
I guess I can't give into this habit.
I just bought a fucking is a humidor.

429
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,670
So we call it, they teach
me all the fuck off. Fuck.

430
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:29,420
I was supposed to put this scars today.
Now that they seasoned it.

431
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,990
Oh Gee, she, what the
Fuck's wrong with me?

432
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,090
How bored are you that you start
smoking cigars? At 44 I'm a dumb cunt.

433
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,230
Um, oh, so I didn't get
back to the fucking,

434
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:43,970
the horror talking about the robots.

435
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah.

436
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,480
All right. So she starts to speech, right?
Not a whore, just dressed like a whore.

437
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,260
Like she put on half of our call and Wean
Costa when then to, Oh wait a minute,

438
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,560
I have to give a speech. So she
goes down there and she's just like,

439
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,330
she actually sounds,
what she's talking about is smart,

440
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:01,740
but she doesn't sound that smart.

441
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,240
So I don't know if some nerd wrote the
fucking speech for and got like, I dunno

442
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,220
fucking broke out in hives right before
the speech. So they sent her out instead,

443
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,840
but she's just sucked everything.
Like you know what,

444
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:18,841
I was allowed Darl I remember just seeing
star wars and seeing c three Po going,

445
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:24,690
wouldn't that just be awesome to
have like a robot and that's it.

446
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:28,330
Like do jobs that just to like kind
of talk to and like joke around with.

447
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,130
And she starts talking about how she
feels that robots should be in the fucking

448
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:39,200
house because she wants
her own [inaudible].

449
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,800
Oh my saying that right. Am I pausing at
the wrong time? I go into the three Po

450
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,850
c three Po c three P O or whatever.

451
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,190
There's such a stupid fucking movie
because one of the most overrated fucking

452
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,290
Gad, damn motherfucking movies, a vault.

453
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,720
I would rather watch
muppets take Manhattan.

454
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,830
I think that that holds up better because
at least there's adult humor in there.

455
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,380
You know, you know, totally
ripped off. Use the force.

456
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,540
Joel Olsteen,

457
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,880
they'd fucking squinty dad gay when
you were in a tee shirt cheese.

458
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,040
Won't she a have a key here? Just
think about it. It's going to happen.

459
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,550
He totally stole that whole vibe.
I don't even know if that makes sense.

460
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:20,830
So you're not, furthermore, I don't care.

461
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,560
Plowing ahead to this lady sitting there,

462
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,050
lady sitting there talking
about these fucking robots.

463
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:29,600
You got to watch the video and about,
I don't know, 10 11 minutes in,

464
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:30,890
I can't remember where the fuck it is.

465
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,100
They cut to somebody shooting the shit
with a robot and it looks like it's

466
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:40,370
basically a head coming out of a giant VCR

467
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,660
and he's like sitting there like,

468
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,190
it's be like if you had a VCR,
their head coming out of it,

469
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,460
but like a robot head like
bolts for eyes and shit,

470
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,570
but it has like eyelashes for
some stupid reason, like blinking,

471
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,660
like it needs to blink.
Right.

472
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,420
And he's sitting at it
like he's at his desk,

473
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:03,850
like almost face to face with the thing.
He's just like,

474
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,090
Hey fucking r two d two look up.

475
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:10,030
My girlfriend bought me and he
showed some sort of fucking,

476
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,000
I dunno what the hell.
At some macho chain of a watch.

477
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,810
I can't remember what the fuck it was.
And then the robots just like, oh my God,

478
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:20,980
that's real. A actress thing, dead shape
and it's movement. It's fucking head.

479
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,273
Can I ask,

480
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,540
okay.

481
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,380
Either this might be the dumbest
question ever or just painfully obvious.

482
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,690
Why the fuck would I need that?
Well, why would I need that?

483
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,030
Like why?
Why won't I just talked to my friend?

484
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,590
You know what I'm saying? It's like the
baseball kid from way back in the day.

485
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,570
Remember that shit? I talked about it
here on the podcast. One of these Mondays,

486
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,950
they have the baseball kid. It's
called baseball kid, the baseball kid.

487
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:55,080
A baseball's work. You won't
to do baseball, kibble, Phd,

488
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:00,250
and it was a cardboard cutout of a friend
basically that you don't have throwing

489
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:05,270
a fucking baseball to you. You know? It
was basically for the kid with no friends.

490
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,470
So now they've upgraded it to the
person who has no fucking friends.

491
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,620
You. What's great is that I bet that
guy didn't even have a girlfriend.

492
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:19,270
I bet he bought the watch for himself
and now he's now part of the sickness is

493
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,420
he just fucking lies to this robot
about this life that he doesn't have.

494
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:28,030
And you know, once you start
doing that, it's an inevitable,

495
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,920
it's an inevitability.

496
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,230
It's a fucking a cirrhosis of the liver
that that guy's eventually going to

497
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:39,340
stick his fucking human dick and that
robot mouth and the second that fucking

498
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:43,760
happens, that's it. It's the
end of the fucking human race.

499
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:44,750
I'll tell you right now,
this fucking,

500
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,850
this scientist out there
fucking robots right now,

501
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,260
they're out there banging robots,
you know,

502
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,650
under the whole platform
of fucking research.

503
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,580
It's really scary.
Like go go watch this shit on ted.com.

504
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:02,130
They got another one showing
how we're fighting wars now.

505
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,300
And like these guys sit in Arizona,
they go to basically go to work,

506
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:10,950
they go to war and then they come home
after fucking blowing up some bad guys.

507
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,350
Uh, hopefully bad guys, right?

508
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:18,240
And then they fucking go and they sit
down and hang out with their kids and

509
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:22,300
they're sitting there talking
about how, uh, you know,

510
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,170
now the bad guys are getting the
robots and blah blah. It's just,

511
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,380
it's fucking inevitable.

512
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,600
All those drones that basically,
eventually all this shit,
they use it over there.

513
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:36,050
I think eventually they're going
to use over here. You know,

514
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,400
in the future there'll be
no more skipping jury duty.

515
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,760
The second you skip it,
you're going to wake up in the morning,

516
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,260
peek out the window, and there's going to
be a fucking drone just hovering there.

517
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,080
You have seven minutes to get to
court or you will be vaporized.

518
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,520
It's going to be one of
those fucking things.

519
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,690
Is this the least interesting
thing you ever heard in your life?

520
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,630
I mean it didn't. I just basically
do every science fiction movie.

521
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,720
Has there ever been a science fiction
movie where they predict something great?

522
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,583
That's what I'm going to do.

523
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,710
I want to be original here for once in
my fucking life. Let's go the other way.

524
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,780
It's going to be a friendly drown.
It's going to be outside that window.

525
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,510
Go back to sleep.
It's okay.

526
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,640
We set your cloud to go
down to the Jerry Dory

527
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,010
hit now we don't need you
so you will be vaporized.

528
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,770
You will be vaporized. That's the
way to do it. I think that that's,

529
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:35,910
that's going to be the,
the the,

530
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,920
that's going to be the funeral in 2020
I think by 2020 we're going to know

531
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,770
definitely where you go when you die
and if it's anywhere other than here,

532
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,650
people are just going to
choose to tap out. You know?

533
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:52,950
It's going to be like getting a vasectomy.
Just getting fucking vaporized.

534
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:58,010
Still an intense fucking procedure that
that needs a serious talking before you

535
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:02,730
do it. But you know. Yeah. You know,
I'm just getting set, need to change.

536
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,590
You know,

537
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,730
like when people on the east coast moved
to like Minnesota or fucking San Diego

538
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,160
just needed a change.
That's what's going to happen.

539
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:14,100
People just going to get vaporized
here in the future. It's fucking true.

540
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,730
You know? I know you guys are
rolling your eyes right now,

541
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:20,670
but you don't have access to
the information that I do. Okay.

542
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:25,110
So please reserve your
judgment or whatever, whatever.

543
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,320
Temper your judgment.
Don't be hasty with you.

544
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,180
Just whatever that fucking expression is.

545
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,593
MMM.

546
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,660
Are you know what though?
You know what the,

547
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,440
one of the dumbest things I fucking
did in the 80s is I never watch talking

548
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:41,390
heads. Stop making sense.
That concert movie,

549
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,890
I finally for some fucking reason sat
down and watched it. Why did I watch? Oh,

550
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:48,880
I know.
I watched it because this,

551
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,470
there was this song that
was in a lot of movies,

552
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,560
like risky business in
those coming of age movies,

553
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,980
all the movies that I saw when I first
got cable and first went to the movies.

554
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:01,880
And, uh, no, at first when I first
got cable and I went to the movies,

555
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,550
oh Geesh.
And uh,

556
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,170
whenever there was a party going on and
they wanted to show everybody go nuts,

557
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,810
like three or four of those
movies played this song where the,

558
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:18,050
there was like no lyrics.
The song just went

559
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,620
hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hey.

560
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:23,454
Hi.

561
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,150
And the whole fucking
place was going nuts.

562
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,330
That's just a great song to sing
when you're drunk. The whole house.

563
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,920
Aye.

564
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,910
And I never knew what the song was,
so it was just in my fucking head going,

565
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:42,870
what the fuck was that song that was
played, that song and that song? Oh yeah.

566
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:47,600
By yellow. Um, that, Ooh, I remember that.

567
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,840
Which I always felt someone should
have done a remix of me saying,

568
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,610
oh Jesus to that I would do it,

569
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:55,640
but then I'd have some sort of fucking
copyright infringement and because I have

570
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:59,240
advertising on here at some point some
point somebody's going to try to come at

571
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:02,060
me and get a couple of
nickels. Right. But anyway,

572
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:06,860
so I finally looked up that song.
I just wrote googled song.

573
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. That's all
I did. And then I looked it up.

574
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:12,530
Find out what's a talking
heads song called swamp.

575
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,550
And then that led me to youtube
next Sinoma I'll stop making sense.

576
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:20,120
And I watched just that clip of it. Just
watched that, that song go on Youtube,

577
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:24,500
that's youtube video the week
talking heads. Stop making sense.

578
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,783
Swamp.

579
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,350
Just watch how that fucking thing is shot
and go back and watch the beginning of

580
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:34,220
the concert. How they come out is one
of the coolest fucking things I've seen.

581
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,840
And to think that there was that quality
of music going on and the shit that I

582
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:43,100
was fucking listening to, Ya know?
And I'm not saying it's all shit.

583
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:47,470
I actually owe appetite for destruction
and apology because I went back and

584
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,180
actually that was another
one that I watched when they
were alive at the fucking

585
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:51,590
rights and I'm like,
I'm an asshole.

586
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,420
I judge that album because I watched
some shit, fucking quiet riot video,

587
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,860
whatever. That's that's how you do comedy.
You just, you just speak in absolutes.

588
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,550
Then you piss people off. If
I, it was actually even handed,

589
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:07,130
no one would fucking listen
to this. Right. But anyways,

590
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,320
that's one of the dumbest things
I did in the eighties is uh,

591
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,760
I remember when it came out
and Siskel and Ebert were,

592
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:16,280
were like freaking out saying this is
like the best fucking concert movie I've

593
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,670
seen in a decade and Yada Yada
Yada and all this type of shit.

594
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:22,250
And I was just like, cause the only
thing I knew was burning down the house.

595
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:22,491
I'm like,

596
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:26,390
Oh that weird guy with the white lines
going through his head on the road at the

597
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:30,930
end of it. Watch out. Um,

598
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,450
all right,
Delta curing breast cancer bill.

599
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,070
I just got an email from
delta sky miles with

600
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,360
my monthly up account update all
the texts and links were pink.

601
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,770
Thank Christ at Delta is finally putting
forth a serious effort towards fighting

602
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,200
breast cancer.
Yeah.

603
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Isn't it weird that you can
actually get angry at a fucking,

604
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,090
okay.

605
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,230
Something so good.

606
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,690
Yeah.

607
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,920
Never underestimate overexposure.
You know what that pink shit is right now.

608
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:03,890
It's Ben Affleck when he
was dating Jennifer Lopez.

609
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:08,000
Remember that point and then all of a
sudden the red sox were doing well and

610
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,700
they'd be in the playoffs and then he'd
be sitting right next to the dugout and

611
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,520
you're like, oh my God, if I see
this guy one more fucking time,

612
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,460
that's what life dealt that.
That pink ribbon shit is

613
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,933
okay.

614
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,860
Fucking eye on. Unbelievable.
This is just, it's just, you know,

615
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,740
I got it. I'm aware. You
know, who do I give to?

616
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,490
Let's fucking curate. Okay. Letting,

617
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,920
letting get Gulf right. All right.
Divorce Law. Fucking army, dude.

618
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,580
That's what this next one's called.
Hey Bill.

619
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:48,430
My name is John A and I'm an
active active duty military.

620
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,150
Okay.

621
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:55,070
Is that, is that how you say it? Like he's
good police. I am active duty military.

622
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,091
Uh,

623
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:59,450
I just listened to your comments about
divorce laws and how the wife gets half

624
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:03,050
of the money and I felt compelled
to write you about my situation. No,

625
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:05,580
I'm saying whoever is
making more money part,

626
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,590
if it makes more money gets fucked in
the divorce because Brittany Spears got

627
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:12,770
fucked. All right. That's my
point. And generally speaking,

628
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:13,820
the guy makes more money,

629
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,090
which I'm not allowed to say some
reason I guess that's sexist,

630
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:18,590
but women can bitch about it all the time.

631
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,690
How can they do?

632
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,770
But if I actually acknowledge it,
it's, it's just one of those deals.

633
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,070
I'm not allowed to say,
well, I can say it,

634
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,560
but then I have to listen
to people bitch at me. Um,

635
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,270
I currently serve in the U s army.

636
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,020
I recently filed for divorce
in North Caca Lackey,

637
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,430
North Carolina from my wife
because she wasn't working.

638
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,300
This guy's definitely military
getting right to the point. Uh,

639
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:51,270
we were only married a year and a half.
As soon as she walked out the door,

640
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,930
I had to pay or $820 a month for a year.

641
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,860
Uh,
the army told me it was mandatory.

642
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,160
So on top of paying her her that shit,

643
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,900
I now have to cover my mortgage. I
have served in Afghanistan, Germany,

644
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:09,420
Romania,
and even state side for this country.

645
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,540
And because my ex wife
decided to walk out,

646
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,920
I was entitled to pay her $820 a month.

647
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,640
Isn't that unbelievable? Why is
that? You don't have any kids.

648
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,740
She's an adult. Go get a fucking job
anyways. The whole time we were married,

649
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:30,100
she didn't have a job. Well there you go.
I provided everything, paid the bills,

650
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:33,760
took her to nice places, bought her
a dog, put a roof over our heads.

651
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,990
I guess what I'm trying to is that I
support your cause to find justification

652
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:42,620
for this shit. Um, yeah. Did,

653
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,680
did the two biggest things that bug me
are our divorce settlements where the

654
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:54,310
person who makes more money has to
fucking just pay for the other person.

655
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:55,480
Like they don't have two arms,

656
00:38:55,481 --> 00:39:00,370
the legs and fucking brains to
arm two arms or legs. That's,

657
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:04,120
yeah, I did just say that.
That's bugging me. And um,

658
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,330
and all these pass interference
calls in the NHL, Nhl, the NFL,

659
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,810
Jesus, Oh gee. Um,

660
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,390
this is how bad the calls are on the
NFL or how lopsided that shit is.

661
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,890
I'm watching the Patriots today
and even when we're on offense,

662
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:27,360
the second as a flag and the secondary,
even if I don't see the play, I just go,

663
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:29,250
I'll give me a fucking break.

664
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,110
I thought that, I thought that that
that fucking corner that got three, uh,

665
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,480
pass interference calls.
I thought one of them,

666
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,950
one of them, the one
where you just, you know,

667
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:43,580
it was literally Yank and on his fucking
Jersey and other that when he's just

668
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,890
yanking on it a little bit.
That's football.

669
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,510
All right. I know I've talked
about it too much anyway.

670
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,950
And on top of having a stressful job,

671
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,100
I now go home and try to
scrape up money just to put,

672
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,890
just to put gas in the tank of the car.

673
00:39:56,891 --> 00:40:01,120
But she is because she is taking money
that she hasn't done shit to earn.

674
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,480
I'm paying for her apartment so that she
can get banged and it probably and I to

675
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,460
get banged in it probably and live
a simple free life. It's bullshit.

676
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,850
Uh, well bill, I hope to hear back
from you and I appreciate your work.

677
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,170
Yeah, it is bullshit. But you
know what? You got off easy.

678
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:22,960
You only got a year of that. I just
wish I was a judge and it just be like,

679
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:27,280
Hey lady. Yeah, as far as I can tell
you a healthy go get a fucking job.

680
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,640
And I could see if she took a year off
from work and she's at home, you know,

681
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,470
washing your fucking undies and that
type of thing and you gotta you gotta

682
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:38,120
support her until she gets a fucking
job. Couple, two or three months.

683
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,420
What a world,
what a world to live in.

684
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,490
What do you do all day? Because he said
somebody as somebody who listens to this,

685
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:49,170
has to be in that situation.

686
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,760
All right? You don't have to leave your
name. You don't have to leave your number.

687
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,290
I just want to hear from you.

688
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,340
What is that like to just sit in a fucking
house that you don't have to pay for?

689
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,530
Is it kind of scary
cause you gotta be like,

690
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:10,400
well what if he stops paying then I'm out
of my ass. What if he decides, Fuck you,

691
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,080
I'm going to jail.
He or she,

692
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,893
you know,

693
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,730
do you ever just sit there and just
like not get up one day and just,

694
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,930
just going to sit in bed and eat fruit
loops all day? Why not? I can do it,

695
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,223
you know?

696
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,340
And then do you ever watch like Oprah and
see people doing shit with their lives

697
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:32,190
and get that sort of weird
feeling in your head like, hey,

698
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,700
shouldn't I do something with my life?

699
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,110
Yeah.

700
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,080
Instead of fucking sucking the
life out of another human being,

701
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,180
the honestly I would love to hear
from you. What do you do all day?

702
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,050
Do you get enjoyment out of that?
Going to the mall,

703
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,370
walking around where
everybody else's at work.

704
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:53,840
Can you just sit there and walking around
trying to find another pair of horse

705
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:56,990
shoes before you walk into a cheesecake
factory. I'll just have a salad.

706
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,281
All right.

707
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:02,120
So you can track to another deck in your
life that can pay for another couple of

708
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,953
years.

709
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,270
That's the game plan that's going to get
you to the playoffs. I don't think so.

710
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:12,140
Play offs. You kidding
me? Playoffs. Uh, alright.

711
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,980
Skeletons in our Facebook.
Hey Billy boy.

712
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,240
I'm a big fan and new
listener. Thank you. Ah,

713
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:21,380
[inaudible] I am in a
little bit of a predicament.

714
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,080
I got onto my laptop the other day when
I woke up around one in the afternoon.

715
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,980
I worked the night shift.

716
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,420
I looked through my history and I see
some fucked up conversations that my

717
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:35,540
girlfriend is having on
Facebook with another guy.

718
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,900
Oh,

719
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,230
Dj.

720
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,600
Uh, they were old emails, but
it was obvious that she would,

721
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,170
she's still thinking about this guy.
Wait a minute,

722
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,260
I've got to go back and do the math on
this. I got into the laptop the other day.

723
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,380
I woke up around one in the
afternoon and worked the night shift.

724
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,400
I looked through my history and I see
some fucked up conversations that my

725
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:02,930
girlfriend is having on Facebook with
another guy. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

726
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:07,390
You're on your laptop,
dude.

727
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,460
Fuck all this shit.
Just be honest.

728
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,050
You got a weird vibe off your
girlfriend or your fucking,

729
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:18,700
you don't trust. You don't trust her
or you don't trust people in general

730
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,960
and you went on her Facebook account.

731
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:22,890
Okay?

732
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:23,790
Isn't that what you did?

733
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:24,850
Okay.

734
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,870
Okay.
Now we're caught up here.

735
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,910
They were old emails,

736
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,420
but it's obvious that she's
still thinking about this guy.

737
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:35,640
How was it still obvious
if they're old emails,

738
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:38,040
if she hasn't emailed the
guy since she got with you?

739
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,470
Okay.

740
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,800
She says, the one that caught me
was from around two years ago.

741
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,370
It said something about having
a sleep over with this guy.

742
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,890
The only problem is that we
were dating at the time. Uh Oh.

743
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,860
Then a few months later, she emails
him again saying she misses him.

744
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,030
What the fuck? I've been nothing but good
to this girl. That doesn't mean Shit,

745
00:43:59,031 --> 00:44:03,200
dude. If our hearts with this other
guy, uh, she lives in my house,

746
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:08,120
doesn't pay bills or even tries or
even tries to keep food in the house.

747
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,870
I'm always the one keeping the house
straight. I'm the one who does everything.

748
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:14,480
I'm too nice a guy.
I guess everything I say,

749
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,910
she freaks out and starts to cry and shit.

750
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:21,170
I been with her for almost three years.
I don't know what to do.

751
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,840
Should I confront her about the other guy?

752
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:27,560
I was kind of snooping on her shit
when I found this stuff. There it is.

753
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,070
There it is. Yeah. Dude. You know what?

754
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,450
You know why you're snooping and you
knew what you were going to find that you

755
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:40,440
didn't want to find.

756
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,310
You probably had one eye closed cause
you knew what you were going to find and

757
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:48,090
you found it. Anyways. He goes,
I mean, don't get me wrong.

758
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:52,920
She snooped on my Facebook too at times
and caught me talking to other girls,

759
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,340
but all my life I've never
been unfaithful to her.

760
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:03,630
And this kid that she used to know looks
like slots from the Goonies fucked up

761
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,690
brother. Any advice would be great.
Yeah. You guys, what are you doing?

762
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:10,370
You're just calling it to each
other. Break up. Ah, yeah.

763
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:12,883
Yeah.

764
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:16,490
What are you doing? All
right. First of all,

765
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:18,680
I don't believe that you've
never been unfaithful to her.

766
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,820
I don't believe that because it took
your fucking two paragraphs to admit that

767
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:25,850
you actually went into her
fucking Facebook. So I'd be,

768
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:28,130
I think if this email was another
two paragraphs would be like,

769
00:45:28,131 --> 00:45:33,131
except this one time when I let this
girl blow me 12 fucking times on seven

770
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:37,150
different dates, you know? Um,

771
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,653
okay.

772
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,930
I Dunno. First of all, forget the
fact that she's fucking around or,

773
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,770
or whether or not she's fucking around
or whether she has feelings with somebody

774
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:50,560
else. How can you be in a relationship
with somebody that every time you bring

775
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,960
something up,
I want to talk to about something heavy.

776
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:57,340
She freaks out and cries about
it. She's not an adult, you know,

777
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,900
she's a child. She's acting
like a little kid. All right?

778
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,910
There's no reason to fucking
cry when you're an adult.

779
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,650
There's no reason to
fucking cry unless somebody,

780
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:15,320
something tragic has happened to
somebody you love. Other than that,

781
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,430
if I'm bringing up the fact
that I feel like you, you know,

782
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:24,350
you haven't done the dishes as many
times have, I've done it lately or a,

783
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,193
you know,

784
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,790
I go to bed earlier than you do when
you come into bed with your fucking iPad

785
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:31,290
and it's lightened up the goddamn room,

786
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:34,940
like a flying saucers coming down and
you have a little consideration. This,

787
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,610
if you start crying during that,
you're an asshole.

788
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,200
All right?
You're a fucking child.

789
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,510
You know what he should do?
He should just get a fucking pacifier.

790
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,353
That's what I would do.

791
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:48,530
Yeah.

792
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,090
The next time you go to bring
something up, she starts crying.

793
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:52,210
You just pull it out and be like,
okay,

794
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,540
Ooh.

795
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,530
And you wave it in her face and you just
throw it against the wall and you go,

796
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,310
Yep,

797
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,860
yeah. Fucking baby. All right.

798
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:06,661
Right,
right there.

799
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:09,230
You're not going to have to worry about
what to do when the relationship because

800
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:10,310
it's going to be all

801
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,010
okay.

802
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:15,470
Uh,
my right plowing ahead.

803
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,060
What do we got here? Any more advertising,
amazon.com you know what to dope.

804
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,690
You want to donate to this podcast and
then now also be dealt donating to the

805
00:47:23,691 --> 00:47:25,970
troops, which I have not sent
them a check in like two months.

806
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,410
I got to send them a fatty.

807
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:28,820
Yeah,

808
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,070
whatever.
Been on the road for fucking

809
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,750
seven weeks.
Just being honest.

810
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:36,640
I got to send them or else the fucking
piano is going to fall on my head. Uh,

811
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,400
just go to [inaudible] dot
com click on the podcast page,

812
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,570
click on the Amazon link.

813
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:44,320
Go ahead and buy something if you want
and they'll kick me a little something.

814
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,520
It doesn't cost you anything extra,

815
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:47,050
and then I kicked something
through the fucking troops,

816
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,650
which I'm overdue on doing,
which I'm going to do. All right.

817
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,220
gamefly.com you know you
want 8,000 games at your,

818
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,020
your fingertips for 15
day free fucking trial.

819
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,510
Go to www dot [inaudible] game
fly.com/bill burp baby. No,

820
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:06,490

fly.com/bill burr,

821
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,790
two weeks of video games and
then you got it and it's over.

822
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,140
Then your life is great. All
right. From a lady in the lab,

823
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,590
I'm a lady in my late twenties.

824
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,090
I'm very lucky because I'm happily
married and I'm getting a phd at a large

825
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:26,080
research institution. My Phd, uh,

826
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:30,520
is mostly paid for by the university
in exchange for working as a research

827
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:34,220
assistant under a professor
in my department. Uh,

828
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,320
that sounds like the beginning of a porno.
Uh,

829
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,000
my tuition is greatly reduced and
I pay for my education with cash.

830
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:43,570
It's a good deal. Good for
you. See person before,

831
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,620
this is the kind of girl you
want to be with right here.

832
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,690
Although you kind of seem
like you got some issues too.

833
00:48:48,691 --> 00:48:52,230
You got to work out your own issues
before you deserve a lady like this.

834
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,990
A lady in the lab,

835
00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:00,470
she's got that white coat
and those smart glasses,

836
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,200
she looks like a nerd.
And one day you'd take out your cock,

837
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:09,180
she undoes her hair, takes off the
glasses, does that fucking flip.

838
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,020
And next thing you know you're having
a kid that's called the lady in the lab

839
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:17,100
love Song. Um, here's my problem.

840
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:20,910
I work on a large large research
team with several other students,

841
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,250
one of whom is a much older man.

842
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,520
I know this is going to go into
sexual direction at some point.

843
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:31,500
Is he some dirty pervert fucking
hair coming out of his ears? Um,

844
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,340
anyways, he's probably in his late
fifties, early sixties. I am regularly.

845
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,680
And why is he doing this so late in life?

846
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,830
Cause he probably has some fear
of commitment. I'm telling you.

847
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:44,130
He's taken his dick out. I'm calling
it right now. Paul Versey moment.

848
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:49,020
He takes his fucking Dick out by the end
of this story. All right, here we go.

849
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,240
I'm regularly assigned to work with
him and he always treats me like uh,

850
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,690
like gum stuck to the bottom of his
shoe. Yeah, he's breaking it down.

851
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,560
His Treatment of me varies from
inpatient to crew, but there's never any,

852
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,170
never any evidence of his
meanness or an email trail of it.

853
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,750
He's too careful for that
up. All right. I was wrong.

854
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,270
He's just a mean son of a bitch.

855
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,220
My method for at least the last three
years was to kill them with kindness.

856
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,580
It has never worked.
I tried to be a few Civ,

857
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:23,160
I don't even know what that
means and personable and sweet,

858
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,260
but the only response I get from him,

859
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:29,570
his disdain I've given up on this method
now because it makes me feel like a

860
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:33,230
doormat. Yeah, absolutely.
And frankly, I'm too angry.

861
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,910
I only speak to him when I'm required
to and I've been trying to keep my head

862
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:42,830
down and graduate and get out soon.
I will be moving on and out too.

863
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,090
I'll be moving on and out
of the research team, but I,

864
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,000
but I hate to think about
what my replacement faces.

865
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:54,410
She's a lovely person and she's already
noted how mean this guy is to me and

866
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:57,140
she's confided that he
has been rude to her too.

867
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,580
I feel so angry that I can't
help or protect her in any way.

868
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:05,390
She even said to me, I would just
try to kill them with kindness. Oh,

869
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:08,750
I'll just try to kill them with kindness.
Hear her saying that. Broke my heart.

870
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:13,700
I know it won't work.
Why can't you just say to the guy,

871
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,110
hey, just out of curiosity,
it's been, I've been with
you for three years and you,

872
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,820
you're one of the meanest human
beings I've ever met in my life is,

873
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,420
is there a reason for this?
You know,

874
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,790
do I have halitosis do I remind you of
some woman that took you for all you got

875
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:30,860
and divorce court?
What exactly is your problem?

876
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:35,420
You old can't leave out
the last part. Um, anyways,

877
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,080
she says, I don't want to complain about
him to any higher up in our department.

878
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:44,150
I'm certain no administrator would listen
to me or care and I'd only make myself

879
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:47,810
look like a whiner. Yeah, I don't,
you, you, you know what it is.

880
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:50,570
You know why you've sat here for three
years taking shit from this guy cause

881
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:53,960
you're, you're putting no value on
yourself. No one's going to listen to me.

882
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:57,790
No one wants to hear it. They'll
just think I'm a whiner. Um,

883
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,970
I think in a very nice way,

884
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:02,150
if you haven't been a jerk to anybody
and you've been there for three years,

885
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:05,170
you've never demonstrated
any sort of poor behavior.

886
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,810
Why wouldn't they listen to you?
Like that's all Becky.

887
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:14,550
Kill them with Karen. Kill them with
kindness. Oh my God. If she's complaining,

888
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:19,230
something's gotta be wrong with
this guy. Right. Anyway, she says,

889
00:52:19,231 --> 00:52:23,340
and while I know he's a bastard
to all of all of our other peers,

890
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,040
the younger students and the secretary,

891
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,640
he's a kiss ass to the director
and other tenured professors.

892
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:31,500
Is this a real person or a cartoon?

893
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,970
This sounds like the asshole fucking
boyfriend of the hot chicken every coming

894
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:39,150
of age movie, you know, the hot Chicco
eventually ends up with the nerd,

895
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,960
which never happens in real life.
Not until your thirties. Um,

896
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,920
lodging a formal complaint wouldn't
resonate with anyone who has the power to

897
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:48,060
fix the situation.

898
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:49,360
Okay.

899
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,120
On the other hand,
I want to tell this guy off,

900
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:56,110
or the very least let him know that
he can't bully people like this.

901
00:52:56,410 --> 00:53:00,700
He's a mean fat, miserable. Fuck.
You really are angry. I love it.

902
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,200
Who has made my professional life hell
and I want him to know exactly what I

903
00:53:05,201 --> 00:53:08,860
think of him. How do you think I show go
about this without getting into trouble?

904
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,511
Uh,
by the way,

905
00:53:10,511 --> 00:53:13,810
even though this man has a semipermanent
position in our department,

906
00:53:13,811 --> 00:53:17,320
I still have more graduate
degrees than he does,

907
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:21,290
even though I'm probably
half his age feels good. Um,

908
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,890
all right. You know what?
You're almost graduating.

909
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,270
You saying, you know, this guy's a kiss
ass. It's not going to do anything.

910
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,700
I think this calls for
a good practical joke.

911
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,030
Just make his life a living hell.
I know in the past I said,

912
00:53:37,031 --> 00:53:40,330
don't fuck with somebody's car, but
this might be the perfect time to do it.

913
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,040
You know, it's a good thing to do. Go to
mcdonalds. This just, this is what you do.

914
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:46,940
You just make his life a living hell.

915
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,530
Just go to Mcdonald's or to
some French fries and say, Hey,

916
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:53,740
can I get a couple of weeks to those
ketchup packs, you know, thank you.

917
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,970
And then you just go out to his car and
you'd take the ketchup and you put it

918
00:53:57,971 --> 00:53:59,080
underneath this door handle.

919
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,280
Just a little country, things
like that. And then need,

920
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,030
just stay on the other
side of the parking lot.

921
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:12,370
And you giggle as you watch this miserable
motherfucker walking over to the car.

922
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:16,780
Can you please do this and send a video
so I can show it to all my listeners and

923
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:20,110
listeners if you have other logis
little nothing where he gets hurt.

924
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:24,180
Just little messes that he
has to keep cleaning up.

925
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,690
You know, just put a little bit
of catchup underneath there.

926
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,760
And I actually did that to someone
one time and I swear to God,

927
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:38,800
by the time the person got to the car,
I was in the exact same situation.

928
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,310
By the time the person got to the car,
I was laughing so hard.

929
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:47,260
I almost passed out. Just the
anticipation of this fucking cunt.

930
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,320
You know who I was basically in the
same situation you were in, you know,

931
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,030
just do that. It's, it's
fucking hilarious. Um,

932
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,190
and then the next time he goes
out to his car, he's going to,

933
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,380
he's going to have to like,
you know,

934
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:05,380
do it with one finger to just see
if there's anything underneath it.

935
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:09,190
Just do shit like that. What else can you
do? I need to know more about this guy.

936
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,860
All right. Where does he
live? What does he do?

937
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,960
I would even go old school now. He
probably know the, the, the, the,

938
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,000
you take a shit in a bag,
ring the doorbell.

939
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:21,880
You light it on fire and then the guy
comes out and stomped it out and steps on

940
00:55:21,881 --> 00:55:26,470
shit. That's one of the oldest ones
in the book. I would just do two silly

941
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,810
to our,
just too silly shit like that to them.

942
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,650
Just something that's gonna make you
laugh, get it on video and send it to me.

943
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:38,310
We'll put it up on the fucking Internet,
but then you'll get in trouble.

944
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,050
I don't know, Dude. I don't
know what to tell you.

945
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:43,570
If you're not going to go to your
higher ups or confront this guy,

946
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,500
I don't know how other way you're going
to get this person back other than to

947
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:49,900
just do little fucking silly
things like that. I Dunno.

948
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,860
I feel like I let you down,
but you kind of walled me off.

949
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,960
Why don't you take off your smart glasses
and undo the fucking bar at and your

950
00:55:58,961 --> 00:56:03,610
hair, shake it out and just be like,
can I have a word with you? You know,

951
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:09,580
talk to the higher ups like that. Use
the power of sex. I'm the fucking worst.

952
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:11,050
Why do you guys ask me advice?

953
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,710
Is it because you want me to realize
how dumb I am? Cause if that's the,

954
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:19,630
if that's the end game here, it's working
a bill. How to find a chick like Nia.

955
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,500
Ah, isn't that nice? Hi Bill. I was
listening to some of your podcasts, Nia,

956
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,070
and it just hit

957
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:29,070
me how much both of you are so fucking
aware of what's going on underneath

958
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:33,940
whatever the fuck you are rambling on
about at the moment. No. What I mean?

959
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,900
Uh, sort of, she knows what you're talk,

960
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,620
she knows when you're talking out your
ass or acting like an idiot and she plays

961
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:41,951
with it.

962
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:46,951
She seems to understand just like you
understand that when someone says bitches

963
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:51,940
ain't shit, it probably just means that
the guy is afraid of commitment. Oh, okay.

964
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,940
I see what you're saying. And he goes,
I'm talking about the Greek Green Room,

965
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,920
the green room episode where you get
in an argument with that lady and you

966
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:04,000
quickly talk about that. Um, anyway, shit,

967
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:08,590
that seems so fucking obvious to some,
especially Comedians,

968
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:14,070
uh, yet it never yet never even
considered by the majority of people.

969
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,000
Ah, no, that's not really a
comedian thing. That's just,
I took a psychology class.

970
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,480
We really wish I could take credit for
the fact that I can make fun of somebody

971
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:24,270
big head,
that I somehow understand their childhood.

972
00:57:24,271 --> 00:57:25,680
Now that that's like psych one on one,

973
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:28,110
but I'll take the credit if
you'll give it to me anyways,

974
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,740
my question is how the fuck
do you meet a girl like that?

975
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:34,410
I'm 29 and although I
know I'm still young,

976
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,280
I can't figure out how the fuck to meet
someone who's not some other clueless

977
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:42,150
fucking cunt waiting for some Douche
bag to make them feel better about them.

978
00:57:42,151 --> 00:57:47,040
Days is okay. I'm, before you even go
through the rest of that tirade, dude,

979
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:53,430
you know what it is. You keep fucking
drop an anchor in the same poison Pont.

980
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,200
All right? You keep fishing
in the same water and haul.

981
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:02,750
You keep making meeting the same fucking
girl. I'm not going to lie to you.

982
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:07,540
It took a while to meet a girl
like Nia, but like a, you know,

983
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,860
I did keep meeting the same types of
women over and over and over and over and

984
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:14,470
over again cause I kept going
to like meet market bars.

985
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,610
Where would I always meet women? I
mean, I always met women at the gym.

986
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,400
You know,
I don't know how.

987
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,030
I always say how I always,

988
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:30,060
I always had game at the gym and I sucked.
I sucked in the meat market.

989
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,310
I was the fucking worst. The, at the,

990
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,580
the few times I tried
to go to the dance club,

991
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,820
nobody wants a fucking pasty freckled
face jackass screaming over usher in their

992
00:58:41,941 --> 00:58:44,010
ear. They just don't
want it. They don't want,

993
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:45,540
I didn't have any fucking luck over that.

994
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:50,541
But you get me in a Goddamn gym and
you've got survivor on the fucking goddamn

995
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,980
speaker. I, I got a little game.

996
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:58,230
Not a lot, but I got a little, the gym,

997
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,180
the gym is a great place to meet a psycho,

998
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,063
you know what I mean?

999
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,120
Either somebody who has an unbelievable
body issues or then you get the married

1000
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:10,710
chick who's, who's fucking not
happy in a relationship. You know,

1001
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:14,850
she's going to the gym dressed in these
ridiculous fucking outfits. You know,

1002
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,530
those fucking hoary outfits.
So like,

1003
00:59:16,531 --> 00:59:19,740
do you really need to have that
much fuck that little clothing on?

1004
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,913
You know,

1005
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,340
I do. They're always doing
those bend over, you know,

1006
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,590
those fucking chicks that actually go
in the weight room but don't really lift

1007
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:29,720
weights.
You know,

1008
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,440
they're always working on their
fucking ham strings or whatever.

1009
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,320
I don't know.
I'm sure there's the guy version of that.

1010
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,420
But I don't pay attention to it.
Right.

1011
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,260
The big creepy guy walking around with
this fucking half a ball hanging out,

1012
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,300
hanging around the fucking,
I was going to say lunch room.

1013
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,540
There's no lunch from there.
Is there,

1014
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,550
I guess there were always is that little
area with the fucking power bars. Um,

1015
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:53,181
here's funny,

1016
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:56,180
they actually did a story on the local
news out here about how those energy

1017
00:59:56,181 --> 01:00:00,170
drinks that they have
actually have surprisingly,

1018
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,910
if not dangerously high levels of
caffeine. Isn't that a stunner?

1019
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,000
Can you believe that?
Isn't that unbelievable?

1020
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,390
That you could sit there and be like,
oh my God, I need 10 hours of sleep.

1021
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,110
Take a fucking drink of this shit
and be like, oh no, wait a minute.

1022
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,990
I think I'll go paint the house.
You know,

1023
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:21,200
you don't think that there's something
in there. If it's not caffeine,

1024
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,850
it's basically liquid coke. You know, I,

1025
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:30,560
uh, you know, I know somebody who I am
convinced they were fucking overweight,

1026
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:34,910
but I'm convinced that, uh, it's not,

1027
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:35,900
it's not who you think it is.

1028
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:40,130
Somebody outside of the fucking comedy
world was drinking those fucking five

1029
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:42,650
hour energy things.
From what I heard,

1030
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,640
like they were going out of style.
This fucking things that, that crazy.

1031
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,990
Can I actually say that they were
allegedly right, allegedly. Crazy.

1032
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:55,640
Crazy. He, they're fucking
crazy for feeling so low.

1033
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,240
Um, I think that's a podcast for this
week. Everybody. I gradually sobered up,

1034
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,920
gradually worked off the buzz.
I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

1035
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,660
Um, the fucking, you know,
it's funny about the jets.

1036
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:15,170
The jets don't try against anybody in
the AFC east unless they're playing the

1037
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,710
patriots. Well, they play the
Patriots. They just fucking show up.

1038
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,630
Anytime I see him play the
dolphins, they're just like, eh,

1039
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,470
it's just the dolphins.
Fuck it. Hoses the bills.

1040
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,860
Uh, get over here yet. Fucking
knucklehead. Maybe that's just me.

1041
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:33,310
Okay.

1042
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,320
Probably is right.

1043
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,430
Is there anything else that
I wanted to talk about? Hey,

1044
01:01:39,431 --> 01:01:42,970
can you explain to me how a fucking
king snake can fucking eat a rattlesnake

1045
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:45,040
when the rattlesnake clearly
looks like it's biting it?

1046
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,710
Evidently it has some sort of like,

1047
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:48,783
yeah,

1048
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,470
a little bit of immunity to the poisoned
unless it gets bit in the fucking head.

1049
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,420
But then I went on
youtube and I was looking,

1050
01:01:55,421 --> 01:02:00,421
I was trying to find a sanction loss
between a king snake in a fucking

1051
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:03,091
rattlesnake.

1052
01:02:03,091 --> 01:02:05,700
Do you believe the level of free time I
have in my life that this is something

1053
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:10,230
that I actually do? I imagine a lot
of you guys do it too. Um, all right.

1054
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:15,060
Youtube king snake. There's a sick one
of like a cotton mouth eating a fucking,

1055
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,730
I always root for the animals.
That's, and I hate fucking snakes.

1056
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,560
And when I see what snake
attack another snake,

1057
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:24,740
I actually start to feel bad
for the snake that's dying.

1058
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:31,100
It doesn't make any oh king be John
Belushi. You guys ever see this?

1059
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,220
Did you guys ever see that?
That clip from SNL?

1060
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,870
I'll fucking tight as a band
that's playing with them.

1061
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,380
That drummer is insane on that. I can't,
does anybody know who the drummer is on?

1062
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:45,710
It's an SNL one. I'll bill.
Who gives a shit? All right,

1063
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,370
that's the podcast for this
week. Listen, listen to me.

1064
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:53,990
I'm going to be in a knowledge, listen
to this shit. This is my weekend.

1065
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,900
I want to be in New Orleans
this weekend at a casino.

1066
01:02:56,901 --> 01:03:00,770
Let me see if I can get
you the actual shows.

1067
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,360
Harris in new,
a New Orleans Harris

1068
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,330
Casino in New Orleans,
Louisiana.

1069
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,780
I got two shows Friday night show time,

1070
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:17,150
7:00 PM and 9:00 PM and I'm
going to be with New Jersey Zone.

1071
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:22,340
Paul Dude, I called it Versie.
It's going to be great.

1072
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,660
It's going to be great. Oh, by the way,
just to warn you, I shaved my beard off.

1073
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,550
Just am I going to be,

1074
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm gonna look like I did when I did
let it go except not as fucking booze

1075
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:32,834
headed.

1076
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:39,050
So Friday night I'm
doing that show and then

1077
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:42,200
as they say in Boston,

1078
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:48,060
Saturday sachet or you're really
Bostonian, if you don't even know.

1079
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:52,700
It's just all vowels between the s
and the why. Why aren't you come over,

1080
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,930
come over on Saturday.
Um,

1081
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:02,170
Saturday I am going to
the fucking Lsu Alabama

1082
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,180
fucking SCC football game. That
was one of my bucket list. I said,

1083
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:13,020
one of these days, I'm got one
of these days, I'm going to what?

1084
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,930
That l a to an Lsu home game
and it's finally happening.

1085
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,880
This is my little bucket list thing.
So if this is my last Monday, no,

1086
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,220
that I died doing what I wanted to do.
Um,

1087
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,460
you know it's funny as I actually do die
between this Monday and another Monday,

1088
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:33,480
do you understand the amount of Douche
bags who believe in wizardry and all

1089
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,610
that's going to be like,
do you know why he died?

1090
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,780
He died because he said he
would get a day. Rarely.

1091
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:45,740
Then all I have to say is this time
next week I will be worth $100 million.

1092
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:51,660
Now see that doesn't work because that's
something good. Oh go fuck yourself.

1093
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,470
And um, and then on Sunday I'm
just fucking hanging around.

1094
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:01,540
I'm not doing nothing other than going
down Bourbon street, getting drunk,

1095
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:05,620
seeing some titties and trying
not to get stabbed. Okay.

1096
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,450
Cause that's what Bourbon Street,
Bourbon Street.

1097
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:10,780
Basically when you get on Bourbon Street,
you stay on Bourbon Street.

1098
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:15,370
Do not make a right. Do not
make a left. Do not pass go.

1099
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,330
You stay on Bourbon on Bourbon Street.

1100
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:21,850
You are within the herd.
You make a right. Uh,

1101
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:26,851
you make a left and you are that lonely
zebra drinking at the watering hole out

1102
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:28,600
on the fucking Serengeti.

1103
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,470
And there's somethings gonna reach up
and grab you and they're going to find,

1104
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,453
you know,

1105
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:38,710
your foot's going to be used in some sort
of Voodoo fucking ceremony. All right?

1106
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,250
And that's New Orleans.
That's New Orleans.

1107
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:47,470
Stay on Bourbon Street. Oh,
tourist. But Friends of mine.

1108
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,850
Um, and I'm hanging around.
Why? Cause Monday Bop Bop, bop,

1109
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:56,400
bop. Boda Boda do, I'm
going to the Monday thing.

1110
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:00,880
Such a Douche. I've gone to a, the
Sates Eagles game on Monday night. See,

1111
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:04,080
that's what I'm doing. All you guys,
you got married, had kids and go,

1112
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,070
I gotta go buy a new rake. Why'd you
do it? I know cause it's awesome,

1113
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:12,640
right? You get to dress him up this
time a year. What are you going on?

1114
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:16,600
I want to go out. Is this all right?
We'll get you a little fucking mask.

1115
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,220
Do you know I haven't made my
pumpkin bread yet? Cleo. Cleo,

1116
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:24,220
what the fuck is wrong with you?
You've been itching like a goddamn maniac.

1117
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:29,500
Do I have to give you a bath?
Does anybody know the dogs?

1118
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:32,320
How are you?
I love you too.

1119
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:36,850
The dogs like I know they don't,
my dog does not like getting a bath,

1120
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,610
but to do,
do they feel better after a bath?

1121
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:40,820
Okay.

1122
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:44,120
I can't tell if it's flipping out
because it feels good or it's absolutely

1123
01:06:44,121 --> 01:06:48,690
ecstatic that it's over.
This dog goes absolutely ballistic.

1124
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:51,570
The second it's over, you dry it
off and then it just sits there.

1125
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:56,040
It's almost like it literally
has a fucking smile on its face.

1126
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,420
That's my dog question. Um, all right,
so that's the podcast this week.

1127
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:04,970
Youtube videos of the week. Once again

1128
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,690
is that that Ted robot video,
the talking heads swamp.

1129
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,350
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi

1130
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,720

making sense. Swamp. And uh,

1131
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,840
and please give that woman just some
fucking practical joke shits you can do.

1132
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,740
Why don't you just go old
school and literally put a
bucket of water over a door

1133
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,590
and just get them totally
like three stooges style,

1134
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,253
you know?

1135
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,540
Is there a way to make somebody feel you
can't make them fall down the stairs?

1136
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,833
That's bad.

1137
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,060
Would it be great if he did? All right.
That's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves.

1138
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:41,680
We'll talk to you next week. Um,
my condolences to the Ryan family,

1139
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,280
the one on the jets and the cowboys.

1140
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,010
I still can't believe the
fucking giants won that game.

1141
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:52,710
Those fucking God damn Lucky Kahn's great
football team. But Jesus, what is it?

1142
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,090
When is there luck going to run out?
Touchdown.

1143
01:07:56,850 --> 01:08:01,450
I have to further Rubio.
Unbelievable. What was it like?

1144
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:05,080
Just the side of his pinky was out
of bounds. Unfucking believable.

1145
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,280
When is Tony Romo going to have some
luck? All right, that's it. See you.
