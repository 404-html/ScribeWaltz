1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,480
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:09,340
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast data.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,810
Just checking in on you. I can't yell at,
I am in New York City right now and I'm,

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,920
it's late. I forgot, you know, today
was Thursday and I had to do the Po,

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,950
the podcast. So I apologize for
being late. I, um, I dunno. I,

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,890
I, uh, I don't know. I wasn't
thinking the fuck do you want from me?

7
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:33,500
And all of a sudden I landed and I got
a bunch of tweets from people going into

8
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,300
it. I thought you were going to
check in on me. I was like, God,

9
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:39,590
I'm letting people down. I'm letting you
down. So here I am. I'm checking into,

10
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:40,970
so now you're gonna hear it on Friday,

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,970
but she some lonely bastard
on the west coast, you know,

12
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:48,110
still up or some lonely lady.
Um,

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,651
anyways,

14
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:54,350
so I just got here to New York because
I'm doing Foxwoods this weekend.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,740
And, um, since I left New York,

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,160
my neighborhood has become extremely gay.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,240
And I don't mean it in a way that
all the gay people don't like.

18
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,590
When you say that neighborhood's gay,
like it stinks. I mean like literally gay.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,690
I mean men are attracted to men,

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,280
you know there's Gig eyes up and down,

21
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,750
this tripping over each other.
And let me tell you something.

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,750
Nobody's complaining honey,
right? So here's the deal.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,820
When gays move into your neighborhood,

24
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:30,500
this three stereotypes that
everybody says, you know what?

25
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:31,670
Gay people moving into neighborhoods,
this is,

26
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:35,540
these are the three things everybody says,
right? They say number one, all right,

27
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,090
what do they say? They say the
neighborhood's going to become safer.

28
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,230
Yeah,

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,180
right?
Number two,

30
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,350
they say property values are
going to go up. And number three,

31
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,910
they say there's going to be all these
great new fucking restaurants and Holy

32
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,110
Shit, the cuisines going
to be fucking unbelievable.
Thank God that gay showed up.

33
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,830
Now this neighborhood can fuck in,
you know,

34
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,360
live up to its potential.
Well, they showed up.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,560
Definitely got safer. Definitely
less shady. All right,

36
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:11,400
so check on the first one.
Stereotype number two.

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,230
Uh, the fuck did I say it was still
property value would go up? Yeah it did.

38
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:19,200
But I miss New York. It
goes up everywhere. But you
know what? You know what?

39
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:23,520
It's an election year. I don't want
to derail the podcast campaign.

40
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,650
I'll give you credit on that one.
Gay People,

41
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,560
it got safer and the property
values went up. And then lastly,

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,730
all this great cuisine was going
to come here. And you know what?

43
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:37,230
It's still hasn't shown up.

44
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,000
The food in my neighborhood
absolutely fucking sucks.

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,340
And I am so sick of it.
Okay. The God damn it.

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,080
I was told when these gay showed up at
the fucking food was going to get better.

47
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,510
And I think it not only
has it not gotten better,

48
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:53,160
it's actually taken a nose dive.

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,540
I just went out and got a Burrito.
Right.

50
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,540
What kind of asshole leaves Angeles and
then tries to get a Burrito in New York.

51
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,180
You're listening to them, this
asshole. All right. The Brita was fine.

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,390
Okay.

53
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,430
You know, chicken Burrito, whatever. It's
funny, you know, I looked at the menu,

54
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,250
it was all this fucking shit. I
just looked at the, the waiter,

55
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,800
I felt like I disappointed them.
I was like,

56
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,830
can I just get some chips
with guacamole salsa?

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,120
And like it just like a chicken burrito
and I just saw it in his eyes like, oh,

58
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,540
you want white people Mexican
food? And I was like, exactly.

59
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,030
I am as white as it gets and I will
have my Mexican food as white as I am,

60
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,820
please. Right. Um, and
before, you know, Mexico,

61
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:40,990
people write in and tell me that's not
real Mexican food. I understand. I get it.

62
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,020
Alright, whatever it, this is what the
fuck I want it. Here's my question.

63
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,080
How do you have all these gay people
walking up down the street and you can't

64
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,540
even make decent guacamole?
How the fuck does that happen?

65
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:50,930
Okay.

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,340
You know, who do I blame in
this gay people slipping?

67
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,150
Is it because these are the millennial
gays and they're just Emoji and each

68
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:02,990
other? You know, I don't
know what's going on.

69
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,930
Um, I'm blaming the gates. I'm blaming
you guys on this one. All right.

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,450
Whatever pressure used to put
on a fucking neighborhood.

71
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,810
You're not doing it anymore. Oh, what? You
decided not to do it in my neighborhood?

72
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,160
I was so fucking,

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,070
you know the anticipation.

74
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,350
Oh, once you guys to send it on this
one straight shady fucking neighborhood,

75
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,000
you know, and the rainbow flags
came out and all this shit.

76
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,240
When the fuck is the food truck get
in here. That's what I want to know.

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,100
Fucking pizza sucks.
The fucking guacamole sucks.

78
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,320
Okay.

79
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,140
The Middle Eastern food sucks. The
whole fucking, they just sucks.

80
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,730
Everything is just like, it's you.

81
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,400
How much I drink when
I'm in my neighborhood.

82
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,250
It's just still the fucking food or tea.
It's all like,

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,890
just get shit faced and didn't make
it fill up that hole in your stomach.

84
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,450
Maybe that's why I'll buy all these gay
guys are in such great shape around here.

85
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,670
They're cooking it all. Ah, fuck Nah,

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,580
that pisses me off.

87
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:11,230
I just had a fucking God damn chicken
Burrito and Guacamole this late at night.

88
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,370
So at my age, I, you know,

89
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,400
I'll probably have a heart attack around
eight 30 in the morning, you know,

90
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,320
at least it could have tasted good,
right?

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,290
Why is it fucking button on
it now? It's off. I want,

92
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,030
if you guys can hear this shit,
whatever the fuck you going to do.

93
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,160
I don't know why the fuck I bring my
mixer and all this stuff. God Damn.

94
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,590
And I'm in a grumpy mood and
I was in such a great mood.

95
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,250
It's nothing worse than when you're
starving and you go out and you'll order a

96
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,780
fucking meal,
right

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,820
in a neighborhood that's now a gay
neighborhood and it sucks. I mean,

98
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:43,060
I'm talking literally like the two dudes
next to me at the end of their fucking

99
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:46,450
meal, right? They fucking like
kissed each other tenderly.

100
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,940
Can I at least get some
fucking decent guacamole?

101
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,460
How much greater is it going to be
around here? So to get a decent burrito?

102
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,130
So I learned that stereotype is not true.
Just can say show up.

103
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:03,590
Doesn't mean the chefs are going
to start fucking throwing down.

104
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,540
They're dropping the fucking ball.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

105
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,930
When the two went to kiss. Okay. Is as
open minded as I am. I have to admit,

106
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,020
I was wearing a baseball cap and I
tilted it down so I didn't see their lips

107
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:19,880
meet. You know, does that make me
a bad person? If you're judging me,

108
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,760
can I just tell you that
one of them look like that,

109
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:25,130
that fucking scrawny little
dude that j Lo married.

110
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,650
Just imagine that Guy
Kissing Lenny Kravitz.

111
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,030
You know, forgive me, I didn't
want to see it. You know,

112
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,650
we made that makes me a bad person,
but whatever.

113
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:41,330
I am a work in progress just like
everybody else and I will have a decent

114
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:46,270
bullet. Fucking guacamole. You sons of
bitches. All right, let's plow ahead here.

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,113
So,
um,

116
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,950
I flew out this morning and I actually
have this app on my phone where I can

117
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,910
listen to the control tower and I'm
just totally nerding out, you know,

118
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,160
every time he had the tower talking
about our plane, I'm sitting,

119
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,270
he's talking about us.

120
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,910
He just told us to go onto this little
fucking taxi way or whatever, you know.

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,550
And, um, so I'm flying up front,
right? Cause at this point I,

122
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,730
I spent 20 years in the back of the
plane. I'm not flying. I'm not fucking,

123
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,130
I'm not doing that anymore.
I'm done.

124
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,710
I don't give a shit if I lose money
on the gigs, I am flying up front.

125
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,840
And for all you guys,
for 20 years,

126
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,350
I sat in the back of the plane looking
what goes on on the other side of that

127
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:28,790
curtain. What happens up there? What is
that like? You know what happens up there?

128
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,180
People, spoiler alert,
you know what happens?

129
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,170
They treat you like a human
being. I sweat. They do,

130
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,780
they treat you the way they treat
everybody in the commercials about their

131
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:43,040
airline. Right? Everybody's smiling,
having a good fucking time. You know,

132
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,060
he got a seat that's actually comfortable.
There's nobody leaning on yet.

133
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,910
Nobody breathing on you. You're hungry,
they bring your food, you're thirsty,

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,110
they bring you a drink,

135
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,090
they treat you like a fucking
person posted in the back. Right?

136
00:07:56,091 --> 00:08:00,470
Just jamming in there,
stuffing in there. Right?

137
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,953
So anyways,

138
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,850
so I poured first because you know
I'm a fancy fucking guy, right?

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,990
So I fucking I board, right? I can't say
fancy guy. Jim Norton says that fancy man,

140
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,480
I'm a, I don't know what I am but
fucking jerk off, right? So I cannot,

141
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,710
I can't underplay right.
And um,

142
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,240
this fucking lady behind me.
All right,

143
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,040
the second she gets to a chair
and she just starts yelling
going, sir, sir, stare,

144
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,590
stare.
You know,

145
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,540
just yelling at this foot that the fucking
male stewardess. And he turns around,

146
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,060
he's like, Hey, what's the
problem? She goes, there's
something wrong with my chair.

147
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,400
Is this broken? Is it broken?
Like freaking the fuck out.
And the guy's like, no.

148
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,410
The other person just,
you know,

149
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,830
whoever was sat in this on the last
flight didn't bring it all the way to the

150
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:56,050
upright position. Oh. Because I
thought it was broken, you know,

151
00:08:56,051 --> 00:09:00,800
and write down immediately. Just fucking
hated this woman fucking be dementia.

152
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:03,440
This,
the sniffles just kept sniffing and shit.

153
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:05,350
Didn't give a fuck about anybody and just,

154
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,470
I swear to God the shit that I thought
about her because she sat up in the front

155
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:09,891
of the plane,

156
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:12,680
I immediately judged to that she was
some rich caught me while I'm sitting up

157
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:16,970
there. Right. I know what
she was thinking about me.

158
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,840
It was Baldwin. Redheaded fucking,
oh he used as miles to get up here.

159
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,080
Um, anyways. Oh Jesus. I can,

160
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:31,350
I apologize early for the fucking
horrible fucking mood I'm in right now.

161
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,540
I was in such a great fucking mood. You
don't, and I was actually, you know,

162
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,320
walking down the street here in Manhattan.
It just laughing,

163
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:41,070
looking at these people,
so excited that I left this fucking place.

164
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,510
People in their twenties look.
Okay, all right. In Manhattan,

165
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,780
they just got here. It's still
exciting. Okay. But see this, this,

166
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:53,100
this city beat stuff. Fuck out of you.
All right. I've always said, you know,

167
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:56,720
if you can do it, if you have a desire
to do it, at some point you left.

168
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,710
You got to come here and
live here just to do it.

169
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:03,510
Cause it really is one of the most amazing
cities you're ever going to live in.

170
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,800
But you don't. What else is amazing about
after you let you owe it to yourself,

171
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:12,000
to Olivia, and you also owe it to
yourself at some point to fucking leave.

172
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,190
I swear to God,
Dude,

173
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:16,970
the amount of people that you see walking
down the street that looked like shut

174
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:21,270
ins, that finally just fucking came out
of the Cave of a God damn apartment.

175
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,190
Jesus Christ. I fucking walk into my
building and this lady standing there,

176
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,440
she looks like one of the
patients on shutter island.

177
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,950
Fucking dark circles under her eyes,
her hat,

178
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,030
Yag down like one of those people
that's like ageless. It's like,

179
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,230
are you 70 or 26 I don't even
know what you just, just,

180
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,050
your skin is gray,
right?

181
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:44,900
And she's with this older dude kind of
look like make it, to be honest with you,

182
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,250
a little chunk here, you know,
probably a lot more jollier.

183
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,110
He's probably not bitching
about the guacamole. Right?
And I'm fucking like, hey,

184
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,610
excuse me. As I go, hey, how are you?

185
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,210
And excuse me as I got to walk by and
she does like this weird like, Eh,

186
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,850
to get out of the fucking way.
Like, oh my God, another human big.

187
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,590
And then as I go to walk away,

188
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,990
she starts singing in this
beautiful voice is she walked out,

189
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:09,110
she had an amazing,
beautiful fucking voice.

190
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,420
Okay.

191
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,000
Assist. Why? What happened?
Jesus fucking Christ.

192
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,020
What's like the way she looked and then
the sound that came out of it was like

193
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:22,650
haunting. Then I felt like I was
in one of those horror movies.

194
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,770
You know that now I'm in and now I
can't get out. You know what I mean?

195
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,910
She's actually a vampire is going
to come by later to feed, you know?

196
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,440
Then I become her boyfriend forever
cause we're both vampires until she gets

197
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:39,420
sick of me and find a fucking, I
dunno, a younger version of me.

198
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,400
That doesn't happen. Right. The fucking
redheaded mail is never a love interest.

199
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,870
That doesn't happen in movies, you
know? Do you hear us bitching about it?

200
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,550
Ah, we boycott in anything. I
don't think so. We just trudge on

201
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,150
trying to stay out of the sun.

202
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,510
That's what it feels like when it
comes to New York. Everybody here,

203
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,540
did she just go, can you get some
sun in your fucking face? Something?

204
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,990
What's that vitamin you get when the,
when the sun shines on you?

205
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,820
It's what I was fucking things. And
everybody just says in a bar, Oh Yay Vita,

206
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:15,670
me son's good for you via
many, you know, not too much,

207
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,430
but you know it's good for you. You know
what they say? You know what they say?

208
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,250
It raises your levels of, oh is that
what they say? So what they say,

209
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:25,230
they're a guy with his fucking name on
his shirt. And what do you do? Well,

210
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:28,930
what do you for you fucking unclog
during the course of the day?

211
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:33,780
What are you talking medical here for me?
For me or to me? Why are you doing that?

212
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,460
All right,
fucking plumber.

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
I'd say they would. Extreme
prejudice. You know,

214
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,790
that's the one train I don't
respect to plumbing. You know,

215
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,910
cause I go to home depot and I swear
to God I can almost figure it out.

216
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,550
Electrical. That's like wizardry.
You're a fucking wizard. I pluck him.

217
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,580
He teases me. Me. He
just opened the doors.

218
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,360
It's everything's right there in the
sink. You know, once it goes in the wall,

219
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,800
then I give it to you. You know
what I mean? Then you're a closer.

220
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,850
All right? But if you just find
that we to hit it with a wrench,

221
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:11,800
he antique shut off the main fucking water
and you're,

222
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,870
you're, you're fucking, he, I don't
know what you're doing. You're your gun.

223
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:18,590
Screw it. Right. If you can,
you can fucking open and cold.

224
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,970
Or if you could take the lid off the jar.

225
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,850
Do you remember what the thing
is that's on top of a jar? Right.

226
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,820
You're smart enough to
be a fucking plumber.

227
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,700
I just don't respect that
trait. You know? Look, the the,

228
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,900
they really are, they're like welders
are the shit. Electricians have the shit.

229
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,200
People can fabricate stuff.
People will build hot rods. Those,

230
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,140
that's the upper echelon.
Those are the one they have like the,

231
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:48,730
I work with my hand awards, my hands,
I should say. They're not jerking off.

232
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:52,120
I work with my hands when
they have those awards. Right.

233
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,010
They got to have those at some point.
The, well these right, there's some shit.

234
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:58,570
Whatever the fuck it is.
You know,

235
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,090
those are the people that bring
home the fucking hardware.

236
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,790
Nobody gives it to a plumber. Plumber.
Yeah. Once you go on [inaudible]

237
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,050
what trade did you really
want to be good at? You know,

238
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,550
it's funny right now
there's a plumber out there.

239
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:15,880
It's actually getting upset by this

240
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,770
and someone will present it on another
website is if I was fucking serious.

241
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,990
Hang on, I'm trying to get to my
fucking password here. Plumber.

242
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,940
Jesus Christ. I mean, the whole fucking
state doesn't even sound respectable,

243
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:35,240
does it? Um, oh my God. To
the other night I fucking met.

244
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:40,240
Lie ahead for a drink. Okay. I was just
like, dude, I've been trying not to booze,

245
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:43,150
but I, I gotta I gotta have a couple, two
or three, right? So he goes, all right.

246
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,180
He goes, you know, I'm doing a spot.
I'll meet you over at this bar.

247
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:48,160
So we go to the bar and sitting there
with shooting the shit would have a great

248
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:52,690
time. And uh, this is plumber
thing, this is what reminded me.

249
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,680
So this big guy comes in and
by big I mean fat, all right,

250
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,410
big mother and hips to puts
it on like Oprah Fi's and ass.

251
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,840
And then he also puts it on like a dude
and he puts it on like a chick and a

252
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:09,400
dude. This was just a fat man
and you know, he, he was obese,

253
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:13,180
but he wasn't even biggest loser
fat. He just was, he was just tall.

254
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,070
He was a mountain of a fucking man.
So he sits down at the bar stool

255
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,660
just off to off of the,
you know, La heads,

256
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:27,160
right shoulder and it's a
really not a well lit bar.

257
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,590
And I'm just sitting there and I'm looking

258
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,130
and he's got this weird design
on his pants and I'm just like,

259
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:39,430
what the fuck is that? That's weird.
Is that a new style at genium,

260
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:44,431
those bedazzled jeans and everybody
was wearing like 10 15 years ago.

261
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:49,000
It looked like he had a horse shoe
on, on your pockets. You know,

262
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,720
the big thing was to
have the stitching it,

263
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,290
the blue jeans were blue and then
you had the, there was all white.

264
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,080
I never bought those.
I'm so fucking glad I never bought those.

265
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,560
There's not one picture of me and those,
it's already pictures of me and Z.

266
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,430
Cavariccis okay. I don't need,
I don't need to, you know,
jump on that trend either,

267
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,790
you know. So, um,

268
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,700
I'm sitting there going,
what is that design?

269
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:14,000
It looked like a like almost like he
ordered custom pants and they just,

270
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,460
they put this design right
and I looked a little closer,

271
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,150
my eyes adjusted and I realized
it was his Harry. Yeah, ass crack.

272
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,460
I couldn't fucking believe
it. Okay. This guy sat down,

273
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,290
he was so big, dude, I am telling you
there was the top of his ass crack.

274
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,950
He was so fat. It was like twice
the size of my whole ass crack.

275
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,860
That's why I didn't take her was that,
and it was fucking Harry,

276
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:42,100
I apologize for putting this image in you,
but it was Harry.

277
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,510
So it looked like it was a design and it,
I just can't fucking,

278
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,700
and head was caught my eyes when I
realize what I was looking at and he was

279
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:57,070
like, dude, what the fuck? And when
I told him what had just happened,

280
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:59,500
I don't think I've ever made
lie had laugh like that.

281
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,700
He was fucking howling
in this bar to the point.

282
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:08,110
I think even the guy looked over at us.
Oh my God,

283
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,270
I kept saying that. I said that you
could measure I was going to do it.

284
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:16,570
How can that be? How can
that be more ass? Correct?

285
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,930
Like this is weird. Like
when you lose weight, do,

286
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,090
like if you become a fat fuck
you have a giant s so yeah. This,

287
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,410
I never thought about this.
You have this giant fucking ass crack.

288
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,880
So when you lose the weight,
like the crack goes away too.

289
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,163
Right?

290
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,620
That doesn't seem like it doesn't make
sense to me cause it seems like it's a

291
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:42,340
hole in your body Kinda.
You know, I don't,

292
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,200
I don't know what I was trying
to figure it out. I was,

293
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,100
I was riffing about this
dog discussing this was a,

294
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,460
what the fuck did I say?
I would say,

295
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:55,461
and you remember that home run Mark
McGuire hitting the king dome off to Randy

296
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:55,950
Johnson.

297
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,430
I was saying you could measure that home
run with the amount of ass crack this

298
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:02,130
guy had coming out of the top of
his pants. And that was just his,

299
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,050
that was just as plumber crack.
Oh Jesus Christ.

300
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:11,760
What a fucking image they'd gone already
ate before I did this. Huh? Um, all right,

301
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:15,600

videos that just fucking seat.

Um, you know, you should have tapped
out by now. You want another gross one.

309

You know, I got to read the
advertising, I promise. I'll tell you I,

I'll tell you another one of like the,

313

that ever happened to me on.

314
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,620
There's another one, Jason. He was funny.
They're all like fucking 15 years apart.

315
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:10,880
Like every 15 years. Like just something
fucking gross happens. Twosie Amy,

316
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:14,250
if you get lucky as a human
being. All right, here we go.

317
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:18,720
Let's get the reeds going here. All
right. Oh Shit. Here we go. Club Debbie,

318
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,010
clump Gabby for Jim Club. Debbie. Um,

319
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,090
if you're anything like me,

320
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,740
then you know exactly what you
like and how you like it. Well,

321
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,230
don't fucking talk shit for me.
If you're anything like me,

322
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:34,230
you question everything you do. And then
the next day, like, why did I say that?

323
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,910
All right. If you're anything like
the people that they think that I am,

324
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,630
you know what you like and how you like
it, except when you're in the wine aisle,

325
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,740
tannins in Ontario,
our hours mean nothing to you.

326
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,810
I got to know what the fuck those and
those, the types of wine, I guess,

327
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,940
unless you happen to be a fancy pants,
professional sommelier,

328
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,040
you know, there's no reason to shit on
people in wine just because you know,

329
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,100
they know something that you don't,
right.

330
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,020
It's not wizardry than making booze
that just into it. You know what I mean?

331
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:09,150
It's like listening to
somebody who's into star wars.

332
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:11,970
Really talk about star wars.
That's like, yeah, I saw it once.

333
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,020
What are you talking about? I don't
understand what you're in. They can like,

334
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,240
you know, they know the rock
that the fucking little,

335
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,140
what are those little chihuahuas?
I still remember that.

336
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,390
My brother collected the action
figure. Such a jealous, right?

337
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,330
Those little fucking secret
society looking fuckers. Right.

338
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:32,120
And then we're going to sacrifice a
virgin. Um, what was under that robe?

339
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,050
All right. Club W uh, please
include all of falling shit.

340
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,600
You read very well with
club Debbie full for champ.

341
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,600
Comops can't be Trump. Uh, the
guessing game is over club Daddy,

342
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,520
but daddy still loves me. Is the
world's most personalized wine club.

343
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,680
And your wines sent directly to your door.

344

come to my ranch, I'll make
you some burgers, sent what?

345
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,690
Send you wine. They send you wine
that you'll love drinking. Uh,

346
00:20:56,691 --> 00:21:01,220
that's because club Dabi Club Gavagan
nothing happened on my watch except when

347
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,610
it did. Uh, easy six questions.

348
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,580
Quiz figures out your palate.

349
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:10,340
So I got to stop doing the club w
shit cause I can't read the fucking,

350
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,130
that's because club W's easy.

Okay.

411
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,070
Um, I was living, I have roommates,
I was living in this place.

412
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,531
And,
uh,

413
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:45,531
I got up early and I went
into the bathroom to take
a shower and I looked down

414
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:51,420
and what looked to be a brown wash cloth,
you know, that was all twisted up. Uh,

415
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
the bottom of the shower, I
think, you know, what's his going,

416
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,520
I reached down to pick it
up and if somebody had,

417
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,200
one of my roommates
had shit in the shower,

418
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,423
I never got over that.

419
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
I walk them all up,
they will all awoken by who?

420
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,830
Shit in the shower.

421
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,820
And they were laughing because I have
think laughing because it was hilarious.

422
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:18,300
And then also I started laughing
because it'd be literation later. I did,

423
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,901
but like,

424
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:23,901
I literally could not eat with that hand
for like fucking a month and thinking

425
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:28,410
now I actually, I don't remember which
hand it was, just fucking disgusting.

426
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,150
It's the, it's the closest thing. That's
the study. It funny. Is it the United,

427
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:35,690
if you laugh at that right now, you're
a sick fuck. Um, and who am I if I,

428
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,410
I told you about it, right? So
anyways, I was on the plane and um,

429
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,140
I started watching this
space movie and um, you know,

430
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,380
it's just another one of those space
movies where it's just like, you know,

431
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,550
everybody dies or people leave.

432
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,420
There's always just like the
one person left out in space.

433
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,860
How are they going to survive?
And I started to watch it.

434
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:59,520
It's like I already saw this
fucking movie two years ago.

435
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Sandra Bullock did this
movie, right? She could go,

436
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:07,761
I left alone when Richard Gere fucking
floated off into sweat out his fucking

437
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:10,800
guys name is the guy with the
motorcycles, right? Married the lady,

438
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:15,300
finally guy from Ocean's 11, one of
those guys. He has so much charisma.

439
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:18,030
All he has to do is just say
the fucking line, you know,

440
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,380
is that the throw is and it's dirty
mustard on it. That Guy George Clooney,

441
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,670
George Clooney, he just says the
fucking line and yet believe them.

442
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,830
Right? Fucking guys fearless. You'd see
him in that movie. You didn't give a fuck.

443
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,340
Yeah, I'm just going to float off into
space. He's still cracking jokes and shit.

444
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,650
She going to go over here and
suffocate. Take it easy, Sandy. Right?

445
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,140
That's it, man. That's all man goes out.

446
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,950
I bet once she floated out of her
fucking ear shot, he started crying

447
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,180
as you sit there and
fucking floating around, um,

448
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,140
you gotta love Scifi. You know
I gotta Love Psi. You know,

449
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,060
I said I hate watching real shit about
space because all they do is just tell

450
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:14,010
you how infinite it is and
how insignificant we are.
It's like I get it. I got it.

451
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,870
Do you have anything else?

452
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,760
Have you filed one fucking living
thing out there? You have it.

453
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,650
So there's really nothing to report
other than it's so fucking immense.

454
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,490
And where we still don't have
the technology to meet anybody.

455
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,430
That's why if you really want
to see something about space,

456
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:35,700
she got to watch a Scifi movie,
you know,

457
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,940
say what you want a bottom
at least a fine shit.

458
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,640
You know there's car chases and
people, you know, a hot chick aliens,

459
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,450
right?
Space bars and stuff like that.

460
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,050
You fucking put on one
of those bravo shows.

461
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,990
Would that black guy there who fucking
knows everything. What's his name?

462
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,430
He's like that. He's like the guy
from the matrix, Laurence Fishburne,

463
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:03,900
except it's just fish board Fishburn
whatever. He's like that guy,

464
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:07,680
except he's real. It's a Lawrence is
real. I'm talking about his character.

465
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,380
I fucking watch that guy. I've watched
that guy like three times and I just was,

466
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,780
he had me believe in that.
We came from the trees. I'm
like, this guy is. Yeah, we,

467
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,970
and I was like, I thought we
came from the ocean, a mud.

468
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,250
I was going with that and this guy
was like, no, we're from the trees.

469
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,680
We've got the same fucking, I don't
know what he said, but I mean,

470
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,280
there was nothing between my ears.
I could argue with anything that he said.

471
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:33,640
You just have to fucking listen to it.
I'm not,

472
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,520
but just sitting there watching
the guy just going like,

473
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,890
this has gotta be what it's
like when you joined a cult.

474
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,390
Like how dumb I feel right now.
This is what you have to do.

475
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:44,130
Like I was reading this,
this fucking thing,

476
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,500
who's getting who I was browsing and
I don't really read anything. Um,

477
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,660
I saw this picture and I just
put words to it, my brain,

478
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:56,490
and now I'm telling it to you.
There's some fucking guy I know.

479
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:00,120
He had like 80 wives, one of those
fucking Weirdos out in fucking Utah.

480
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,380
You know what I mean? Did I? Oh,
either that or he's just like,

481
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,720
how come rappers don't
talk about those guys?

482
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:09,150
They're always talking about fucking
pimps. How could a guy, that's key.

483
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,100
The guy's got 80 fucking women.

484
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,410
They all know about each other and they're
all smiling in the fucking picture.

485
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:17,850
Huh?

486
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,870
I want to see somebody else pull that
off and not live in the middle of fucking

487
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:24,060
Utah. I don't know what
the fuck it is about Utah,

488
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,820
but you could talk a woman
into anything out there.

489
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,040
You're the a one for me. Hi. Yeah,

490
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,640
you and they'll 79 other bitches.
Okay.

491
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,100
But God, man, bitch. MMM.

492
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,280
Okay.

493
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,920
This guy is in prison and he's
still running. That's this Harem.

494
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,570
They don't know any better.

495
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:51,970
You know when you're walking around with
a little house in the prairie close,

496
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:55,120
I mean, he could fucking tell
people anything. That's the key.

497
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,930
You know what I mean?
It's like if you want to start a cult,

498
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:04,450
it's very difficult to start
it with people that have
gone to a department store

499
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:07,210
and bought their clothes,
you know? But if you,

500
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:10,780
if there is a group of people that are
standing there and close that they made

501
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:14,380
themselves you, that that's where
you start. You know what I mean?

502
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,940
It's like when you got a shit team, all
right, and you got the number one draft,

503
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,220
pick the, the t, the guy,

504
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:24,610
the person you're going
to build your fucking team
around. That franchise player.

505
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,960
When it comes to cult,

506
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,130
those still to franchise tag is on all
those people with those little house in

507
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:33,990
the prairie close, those
Quaker close, right. The QC,

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,150
you know, you ever think about start? I'd
start at cult. I would do it, you know,

509
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,180
I would definitely start a fucking cult,
but then I,

510
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:45,720
after a while I wouldn't want to do
the work and I would just sort of,

511
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,850
I'd start like a,
what do they call that?

512
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:50,240
When you fucking don't want to do
your job and you have other people do

513
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,970
delegating. I'd start delegating all the
fucking things and granted one point.

514
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:57,560
So people are going to be like,
whoa, hey shit was Jason's,

515
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,340
how come he's not doing anything?

516
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,720
I don't remember reading anything
about change being be lazy.

517
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,330
Yeah,

518
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,770
let,
he just sits around and fucks everybody.

519
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,970
I'm going to check it is no
shit.

520
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,920
Maybe I'm Jesus.
Right?

521
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:21,520
And then he takes over and then all
of a sudden they all show up one day.

522
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,120
You know,
is there anything scarier than angry,

523
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:28,750
stupid people standing in clothes
that they made themselves?

524
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,370
Just picture what that would look like.

525
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,010
You know the amount of Mano Browse
staring back at you and you just have to

526
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:38,170
relinquish your power
and just at some point,

527
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,500
easy way out the back door and let them
know that you're not the son of God.

528
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,760
There's a fucking afternoon
for you. Huh? Jesus Christ.

529
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:49,570
Tommy deadbolts would you
have on your bedroom door? Um,

530
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,570
speaking of which,
by the way,

531
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,390
I got all the fucking interior
door locks fixed on my house.

532
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,310
They all have fucking skeleton keys.

533
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,760
And then I found this fucking
person on the Internet,

534
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,950
on the interweb is Richard Rollins
says from fast and loud. Uh,

535
00:32:04,951 --> 00:32:06,630
another great shell.
Um,

536
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:07,890
okay.

537
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,980
I got some of that's going to line
it up with the door jam. You know,

538
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:13,410
the little fucking latch thing there.
And then I'm going to be good to go.

539
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,710
It's going to be, fuck. I can't
wait. Very excited about that.

540
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,520
And speaking of great shows, I'm
finally caught up with better call Saul.

541
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,570
I feel like such a, not only a
bad fan considering, you know,

542
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:29,010
Vince hooked me up to be in.
I'll have a small part in breaking bad.

543
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,270
I should have been watching right along.

544
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:34,440
But what happened was those of you
who listened to the podcast last year,

545
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:36,150
I fucking was taping the thing.

546
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:39,930
If for some reason I didn't get episode
three and then I suck computers and the

547
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,970
Internet, I couldn't figure out
where else I could watch it.

548
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,010
So I've been stuck on episode two.

549
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,330
So finally they came on Netflix
right before season two started.

550
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,400
And I just binge watched the entire
first season and it was fucking

551
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,390
unbelievable.

552
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,540
Yeah.

553
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,700
Who's fucking amazing
starts. It just, it's,

554
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,450
I don't want to ruin anything for you,
but I gotta tell you something like a,

555
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,180
the level of acting that,
that, uh, everybody's doing,
but like Bob owned Kirk, man,

556
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,800
you don't, it's very rare that someone
does, is as great a comic as he is,

557
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,300
is equally as great a fucking actor.
He was,

558
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,480
I want you guys to watch it
just because you got to see,

559
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:25,500
he has just blowout fight. I can't
ruin this for you. What's the relative?

560
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,200
Any now you just say
mean shit to each other.

561
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,460
Yeah.

562
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,200
Haze brothers says something to him.

563
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,460
I've been thinking about that line
for like the last five fucking days.

564
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,060
It was just, I don't know.
It's one of those lines.

565
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,490
Yeah.

566
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,540
That in real life usually get set around
the holidays after you've been sitting

567
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,780
on something for 20 fucking
years and when it comes out,

568
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,030
it's needle off the fucking record and
the relationship is over. It's just like,

569
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,890
yeah, dude, I'll see you when you're
on your deathbed or I'm on my deathbed,

570
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,480
or maybe never again. I mean, it's,
it's a fucking rap. It's over.

571
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,083
Um,

572
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,190
okay.

573
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,980
Oh Man. Though the writing was just,
it was just fucking outstanding.

574
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:13,730
And I'm the can't say enough good things
about it and I am totally caught up and,

575
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:16,330
uh, I can't wait for next week's
fucking episode. There you go.

576
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,650
There's my little plug there for
better call Saul. Um, and with debt,

577
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,330
that's it for this, uh, checking in on
your podcast. Once again, I apologize for,

578
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,970
you know, for not doing the
podcast on a timely fashion,

579
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,990
a timely fashion.

580
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:34,630
I where the fuck you said and I
realized that I brought up that APP.

581
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,260
Sorry about the shit in the shower story.
The ass crack one was funny.

582
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:40,810
I don't give a fuck
who you are by the way.

583
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,220
That APP is three 99 that I, when you,
if you want to listen to the towers,

584
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:50,170
anywhere where you're at, it's a
called live a t c. Dot. Net App.

585
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,340
Just do that ATC air traffic control.
Um,

586
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,541
and it's really cool.

587
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,730
Like I just thought you could
listen to the towers and near you,

588
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:02,290
but you can actually, um,
I was at lax today, Dan.

589
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,850
I was listening to,
uh,

590
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,560
Logan Airport in Boston and it's really
cool cause you, you're basically like,

591
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:12,240
I'll click on California, they got
Burbank, camera, real Concorde,

592
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,560
any place in El Monte,
any place you want to go to.

593
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,790
And when you click on it
as I'm doing right now,

594
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,080
okay, this one has ground and
tower and then you click on that.

595
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,143
Um,

596
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,080
and then there's what's really cool is
they have like a diagram of the airport.

597
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,350
So like you can actually, you know,
I like to listen to what, whatever,

598
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:39,560
whatever airport I'm at as
we're taxing to the, um,

599
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,210
to whatever the fucking runway,
Jesus Christ bells, you know,

600
00:35:43,211 --> 00:35:46,030
you'd think you'd know that.
Um, go out to the runway.

601
00:35:46,031 --> 00:35:50,620
I just like listening to it and it's
fucking cool as shit. And um, you know,

602
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,420
watching the,
um,

603
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,500
Jason Spill all the taxi ways going by,
sorry, I'm trying to multitask here.

604
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,840
Answering a text message. I apologize.
Let me just put the fucking phone down.

605
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,490
See that, see that, pick it up.
And all of a sudden I thought,

606
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:09,340
I'm just starts clicking on other stuff
and we'll start fucking looking at

607
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:11,570
Twitter when I'm trying to
do a podcast here. Anyway,

608
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:15,310
she got the whole layout of the airport
and as you're going down he can tell

609
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,360
what taxi way you're on. And then, uh,

610
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,243
right

611
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,890
there you go see that.
You just listened to that shit.

612
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,850
So that guy just obviously was cleared
to land and that was the runway and he

613
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:31,960
said his tail number.
That's it.

614
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:34,960
So I just listened to that shit because
that's one of the hard things when you

615
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:37,940
first get a pilot's license, when you
get up there and I'll just sounds like,

616
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:42,420
yeah, join it down. We're,

617
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm gonna Plant Plant, plant. They
don't even have southern accents,

618
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:46,640
but that's what the fuck
it sounds like to me. Um,

619
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,870
you know what's funny is when
this shit happens, when I, uh,

620
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,500
when I'm just like walking around, like
I'll accidentally set up pocket dialing,

621
00:36:56,501 --> 00:37:00,610
I'll hit this fucking APP.
And, uh, if you're in the mob,

622
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,190
do not get this fucking app because
they'll think it's a bunch of fucking feds

623
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,910
in a,
in a van down the street.

624
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,840
You know,

625
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,070
if you fucking sitting there in a mob
meeting and all of a sudden you got this

626
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:19,480
fucking thing going and you're talking
about some bullshit and out of nowhere

627
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:22,800
this thing comes on. Come on. Just do it
one time. One more time for me. Come on.

628
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,130
This is Lex. Oh, it's a
quiet night out there.

629
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,580
Okay.

630
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,061
You know what I mean?

631
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:32,910
All of a sudden you just hear some fucking
guys voice in there talking to some

632
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:36,400
official,
hey,

633
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,200
who the fuck up their fucking,

634
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:41,440
next thing you know the Yan can get
tongue through your throat. Um, all right,

635
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:45,640
so that was a long way to go. Why would
it go? Who uses a prop and a podcast?

636
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,940
All freckles does. Hey, go
fuck yourself. She can't.

637
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:50,290
So I hope you have a great weekend.

638
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:55,291
And I a little music from Andrew Samela
sat a little throwback podcast from a

639
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,150
Monday or Thursday gone by,

640
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,770
you know, a few weeks ago somebody
was asking me, Ah, you know,

641
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:41,350
they wanted to break up with somebody and
I was saying, listen, you gotta listen,

642
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,800
you know,

643
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,800
the person who has it down how to do
the breakup was minivan men podcast,

644
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,340
own celebrity star Al Madrigal.

645
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,520
But if you don't have
time to email Al Madrigal

646
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,380
just listened to ll cool j a big old,
but

647
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:07,390
I don't know why. I never really listened
to him when I was growing up. You know,

648
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:10,600
Mama said knock you out. Oh, did
shake, is that what she said?

649
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:14,020
Ll Cool J I don't care. You
know, I just wasn't into it.

650
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:18,460
And his deodorant and his armpits when
he was jamming with those white guys.

651
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,230
I just,
I never got into it.

652
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,600
But lately like I dunno, I
dunno what happened. I, Geez,

653
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:29,770
just come onto my youtube
shit. I don't know what it is,

654
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:33,190
but I was listening to some of his
stuff. Oh, I know why. Yesterday.

655
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:37,660
I was trying to remember like what was
that song he used to have that I'm the

656
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:42,280
type of guy and you're the type of guy
get put back, but what the fuck was that?

657
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,180
And then I listened to it and I kind
of liked it, but I hated that. Oh,

658
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:49,480
we owe part of it really
annoyed me. I'm like, oh,

659
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,130
that's why I never downloaded this shit.

660
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,790
But then on the side they
had a ll cool j big old,

661
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,820
but you know I played drums at Michael.

662
00:39:57,821 --> 00:39:59,830
Let me hear what this tracks track
sounds like. Can I put it on?

663
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,860
And he basically teaches you how to
break up with a girl and that song,

664
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,910
but that rap or that, uh, that rhyme,
whatever, however you supposed to say it,

665
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,560
he breaks it down and just
in like fucking 11 seconds,

666
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,990
he sits his girls down.

667
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,640
He's basically hanging out and like some
sunglass hut or some shit and some girl

668
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:26,641
comes in with an insane ass and
he does what every guy does.

669
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:31,090
He stares at it. He thinks I want to fuck
that, but oh shit, I have a girlfriend.

670
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,670
So what does he do? Does
he sneak around on her? No,

671
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,620
he goes home and he sits her
down and he says, listen,

672
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,650
I met this girl named Tina.
Okay, Tina's got a big old,

673
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:49,651
but I know that I said I'd
be true really whiteness up,

674
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,770
but Tina got a big old butt
so I'm leaving you. It's,

675
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,830
I mean that's just fucking airtight.
You can't fuck with that.

676
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,130
He was 100% I don't even
know if she could get mad.

677
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:09,450
I think that I think women's show expect
guys to be lion weasely pieces of shit

678
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,770
that if you actually hit him
with that level of honesty,

679
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,500
I think they would just be stunned.
Just like the chicken, the video,

680
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,210
like I didn't think that
that was bad acting.

681
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,150
I think that they would absolutely be
stunned if you just came home and said,

682
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:29,530
listen, I met this girl. I know that.

683
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:32,290
I said it'd be faithful to you,
but she's better looking than you,

684
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,740
so I'm breaking up with you.

685
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,750
What is the combat?

686
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,300
There's nothing that'd be like if
your girl came home and said, listen,

687
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,140
I know we're together,
but this guy, you know,

688
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:51,860
I met him at the mall is Dick is twice
the size of yours and he's got a better

689
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,980
car. So, uh, it's kind
of a no brainer. Amati

690
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,770
what are you going to do?

691
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
What are you gonna do with your little
dick in your fucking Domino's pizza?

692
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,440
It's over. You just got to fucking be
like, you know, you only go around once.

693
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,400
So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it.

694
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,980
So anyway, so if you don't have
time to a email Al Madrigal,

695
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:17,030
which you should,

696
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,370
which you should just listen
to a ll cool j big old bud.

697
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,330
You got to see his face. He
goes, so I'm leaving you. It's,

698
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,660
it's, I don't, can't explain it.
It's way meaner than it has to be.

699
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,130
That's what it makes it funny

700
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,960
cause there's a way to read that where
you kind of letting them down easily,

701
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,100
you know, but he didn't,
he just did it like, yeah,

702
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,600
this is how it works. So there
you go. Look at that on a holiday.

703
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:56,720
Um, anyway, so this is the Monday morning
podcast. It is the end of May. Everybody.

704
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,210
All right, how many days are
in May? 30 days has September.

705
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:04,490
His throat is April and November.

706
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,530
All the rest have a bunch of other
dates except for stabby wary Yag.

707
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:12,140
Go Fuck yourself with your song.
Um,

708
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,210
she got 30 31 fuck, what is it?

709
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,560
April has 30. June has 30 maze.
31 I got the little thing.

710
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:25,010
I can click right here. Oh, I have a
computer. I don't need to think right.

711
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,210
It has.
Why is it in September?

712
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,700
Oh for Christ sake, do I have to
click another button? It has 31 days.

713
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,330
All right,
so you had till have,

714
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,440
do you guys have until Thursday
midnight to make something of May,

715
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,600
2012. All right. Are you in a fucking
relationship? You don't want to be in?

716
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,430
Do you want to be in this relationship?
You don't want to be in, in June?

717
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,360
Why don't you celebrate the end of
May by getting out of your fucking

718
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:58,820
relationship and sitting down

719
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,870
and basically just go
with the ll cool j vibe.

720
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,120
Hold her hand and just go straight up
honesty and then w w what's she gonna do?

721
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,520
What's he going to do if they're
going to flip the fuck out,

722
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,440
but the the die has been
cast to ship is set sail.

723
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,730
The ball is already rolling. The
Sun is setting, the rain has fallen.

724
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,620
Wherever the fuck you want to call it.
It's out there. Just put it out there,

725
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,340
let him scream and yell and
then you had as much as he suck,

726
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,270
you're going to be like,
okay, I did it. I did it.

727
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,810
Now I just got to sit here
and get yelled at. And uh,

728
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,720
how long could somebody really yell
before they lose their voice and hour,

729
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,140
90 minutes and an hour and a half.

730
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,120
I'm going to be in the car listening to
ll cool j driving away from that thing I

731
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:50,850
didn't want to be in. All right then.
I know I talk about this shit a lot,

732
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:54,390
but I think a lot of people
are in situations like this
and they don't know how

733
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,960
to sit somebody down. It
just say, so I'm leaving you.

734
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,170
You know, if I was ll cool
J and I stop, you know,

735
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,090
selling tickets and all that type of shit,

736
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:12,060
that would be a side business
that I would have. I would take,

737
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:13,280
okay,

738
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,780
that little fucking rhyme that he had
and I would custom do it for everybody in

739
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:21,650
their life and just, and then
people who just write you all right,

740
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,120
I need to charge it. You charge them 100
bucks and he would write you a, you know,

741
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,790
four bars. It all rhymes and
you just get out. Exactly.

742
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:33,480
Okay.

743
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,160
What you say it,
you know?

744
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,140
Okay.

745
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,670
Just be like you eat with your mouth open.
I know I said that I'd be true.

746
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,420
Yeah,

747
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,950
but you eat with your mouth open
so I'm leaving. You just get right.

748
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,840
Get right down to it.
Your mom is a fucking con.

749
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,690
I know I said that I'd be true,

750
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,350
but she's fucking always
coming over here and,

751
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:04,140
and something that rhymes with
[inaudible] you I, you got the,

752
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:06,730
you got the idea right? Jesus
Christ. What do I have to be yellow?

753
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,123
Okay,

754
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,770
let's get back into this. Mark from a
dozen a fury. Yeah, I guess so. All right.

755
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,430
Hi. What's up? [inaudible] standing
here with the guys from a theories,

756
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,710
I think. How do you guys
think you sound one today? No,

757
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,140
I think it went really well man.

758
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:55,740
I mean it's probably that then the
hottest day so far and the whole tour.

759
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:58,530
But you know, we're Texas boys. Where
do you see the hate? So I get up there.

760
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:01,200
Let's do our thing man.
So you guys are like brand new.

761
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,240
You guys have won a contest or something
to get on this? Um, yeah, I mean we,

762
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:09,210
we won a contest to be on the show.
I mean to, you know, be on the tour.

763
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:11,560
But you know,
we've been a band for about two years now.

764
00:47:11,561 --> 00:47:13,860
I've been torn on her own and
doing her own thing and you know,

765
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:16,900
this was pretty much just a blessing
and a big step forward for us.

766
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,340
Definitely a blessing. How, well

767
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,750
this is what I'm trying to get these guys
to say some fucked up like what you do

768
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:25,450
on tour and these guys,
we still have to cover it in tattoos.

769
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,170
They all look like Mick Mars.
Yeah, Motley Crue and they just,

770
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,870
I'd like the nicest guy.
Like everything's a blessing.

771
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,500
Everything blessing to be here. I know
what I said at the last days. God willing,

772
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:37,200
we'll go on for the next tour.

773
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,830
I'll try to angle it towards some sort
of smart and they just keep going back to

774
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:44,390
the church. Remember that when we
did the Oz fest thing and they're,

775
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:48,490
they're eating vegetarian meals backstage
tofu and drinking a little green tea.

776
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,740
It's like, what's your old,
you're going to help set it up.

777
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,220
They and watch behind the
music they saw not happens.

778
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,840
Meanwhile you listen to behind them to
say a contract soundtrack to hell is

779
00:47:58,841 --> 00:47:59,680
playing.
Right.

780
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,210
I know there's something going on in the
background that just listen to music.

781
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,980
How well, how well do people know
you're here? Um, so far it's been great.

782
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:12,210
I think we've done two signings and
they've been tagged it tons. A kid.

783
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,650
What's the, what's the biggest asshole
crowd you guys have been in front of him?

784
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,710
Just been like, fuck you. You're
the open advance. None yet man.

785
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:18,610
They've all been really cool.

786
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:22,630
I think like not expecting us to
do what we actually do. You know,

787
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,630
everybody thought we were still be
some MTV show man and stuff like that,

788
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:27,250
but it turns out, you know,
everybody's like, man,

789
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:29,410
you guys blew us away
and it's really cool.

790
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:33,670
Like there's lots of boards from the fans
and shit. So I mean that's cool. Hey,

791
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:34,750
you have the other drama,
right?

792
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,610
Have you ever like went to throw the drum
sticks in the crowd and some dude was

793
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:41,950
pissing you off so you can
kind of rather than tossed it,

794
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:45,350
just fucking throw it at him?
Not really that. It's just not,

795
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,630
could put an eye out.

796
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,170
We wouldn't do things like that.

797
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,190
That makes sure a rubber tips and I guess
we have special styrofoam drum sticks

798
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:59,790
that we throw out. So it was not to injure
any of our loving fans. Wow. They'd,

799
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,610
we're not biting. Even these hardcore
fans have become PC. It gets even better.

800
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,220
I sat out,
it starts like

801
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,780
see again. So many people talk
really called so long person

802
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:15,380
who gets the most puzzling. None
of us. We're all, we're all,

803
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,510
we're all taking man.

804
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,910
Ah, we're in loving
relationships with lovely women.

805
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,950
It's just, it's just the
most anti rock and roll. Wow.

806
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,793
Can Roll band.

807
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:33,850
Yeah, we're rolling. You
guys are the tattoos.

808
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:36,880
I'm thinking is this going to be maniac
going back there? You guys all committed.

809
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,970
Oh, rock mineral. Everybody got a baby
on the way. You went to one house.

810
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,830
Got a daughter already. The rest
of, what's her name? Madison.

811
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:45,880
Madison pass and that's it.

812
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,940
Oh,
and then the names of their kids.

813
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,280
Safe Madison destined for a polo.
I couldn't Madison,

814
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,150
you know exact names. His son, right?

815
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,320
Hendrix handed her Jimi
Hendrix got a fucking animal.

816
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:03,180
It's still the real deal is an animal.
But these newer bands, you know Billy,

817
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:08,580
just try beautiful Ryan. I got, I got
them to do a PSA though in the end.

818
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,780
What's her name? Um, Madison Madison
Pass. That's a beautiful name and went.

819
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,800
No one is skin cancer awareness thing
here right now. Opie and Anthony.

820
00:50:15,801 --> 00:50:18,050
So if you guys could just say
something to make, you know,

821
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:20,310
the kids are wearing about skin cancer.
Just swing at anything.

822
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:23,210
Throw a couple of bucks in there. So
the kids will listen to it. You know,

823
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,120
we are out in the sun all day long,
every day,

824
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:30,290
and we put on probably like five times
throughout the day, man. You know,

825
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,230
you gotta take care of yourself,
got take care of you start over again.

826
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:37,840
Just throw a couple of flux
in there. Seriously? Yeah,
yeah. Over there. All right.

827
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,450
Just say, you know, skin
cancer awareness. I man,

828
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,510
we're fucking caught facts and
we put on a lot of sunblock.

829
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:49,250
Fuck yeah, we're out of the
fucking sun all day long, man.

830
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:52,550
It's just fucking beat down
on you. And you know, dude,

831
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,840
you got to fucking take care of him dude.

832
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:56,180
You gotta wear sunblock and
away and over and over again.

833
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,790
Especially you want to keep in touch with
fresh shoes. You need to tighten it up.

834
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,450
Just just tightened it up real quick.
Where are your fucking sunblock?

835
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,713
Right?
Listen,

836
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:14,340
you can do
each with each band.

837
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,980
Cause I had no idea what they were.

838
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:19,190
So with each band I just made
whatever the PSA was more ridiculous,

839
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,490
just always had them like throw it. Just
throw a couple of fucks in there. Yeah,

840
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:23,821
the kid,

841
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:27,740
you know the crazy something with a
little rock and roll attitude going into

842
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:31,370
that. I was like, ah, audio from a band
called it doesn't furious. Who Cares?

843
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,670
That was really interesting on
a lot of levels. Oh, they just,

844
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,420
the job bill burr boarded me. You
ever have an orgy? Ah. You know,

845
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,680
I'm more just like one on one connection
with somebody, you know, feelings,

846
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,010
very monogamous and our relationships,

847
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,790
they're just not living that rock and
roll lifestyle. But at the last name,

848
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:53,320
whole arms. No, I understand.
I understand. They got
all the luck in the park.

849
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:57,080
You've got the piercings and tattoos.
Mixed messages, yes. All right.

850
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:01,730
What about this band? Shadows
fall? Yeah, same shit.

851
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:05,480
I just would ask them questions and we'd
go nowhere and then I just had them do

852
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:08,780
a PSA. I did. Well we got to
listen to until we get to the PSA.

853
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:10,850
It's Brian from shadows fall.

854
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,050
No, it's up still bar
opening. Anthony show.

855
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:15,540
I'm talking to Brian Pfaff and
satisfying. Great. That man.

856
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,810
How'd you feel about it? Oh, it's
what else? Man? The whole hospice.

857
00:52:17,811 --> 00:52:19,050
This is incredible, man. You know,

858
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:21,570
sharing a stage with me and Sabbath
does doesn't get better than that.

859
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,240
How to help me sing like that for so long.

860
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:28,750
And I yelled at my dad like that about
20 minutes. I'm used to it for you.

861
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:30,870
Hold on my girlfriend, how much,
you know, you know, builds it up.

862
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:32,800
You've got to build the strength,
you know, like, you know what,

863
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,700
I'm going to do that drop
right now. You know, it's good.

864
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:36,780
I'm glad you brought that up.
We had a open,

865
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,610
Anthony's doing like a thing for like
domestic violence awareness. Yes.

866
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:42,810
Somebody kicked the shit out of their
girlfriend and like Newark or something.

867
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,830
So yeah. So just, just ad Lib,

868
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,680
some sort of dropped and not to domestic
violence to your girlfriend or whatever.

869
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:50,690
Not, and you know, it's kind of weird,

870
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:53,600
but toss a couple f bombs and
that I listened to as a retarded,

871
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,450
but just try to keep the good message.
So just describe shells fall.

872
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,990
Oh,
it's such a great gag.

873
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:06,540
Rockville.

874
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,460
You're gonna have to come back and
Redo this, uh, this new Gig, right?

875
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,833
This is your thing,

876
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,530
girlfriend, you know, fucking don't beat.

877
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:23,190
If you grow this bribe
and shadows fall man,

878
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,720
you gotta stop punching
your girlfriend out there.

879
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,890
Save that shit for the bedroom. You
know that's where it's at. But you know,

880
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:29,920
don't take it to the streets.
Okay.

881
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,080
Do it again is just throw like
one fucking got their idiots.

882
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,100
What's those five shadows fall? Just say
stop hitting your fucking girlfriend.

883
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:41,910
You Idiots. All right. Saved to
violence for the bedroom. Cool. So uh,

884
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,820
what do you guys call from him? Uh, after
this? Uh, where the hell are we doing?

885
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:49,850
Well we're two days here and then we
got yo, I don't even know where we go.

886
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,530
Dust and they bring me where I got
to be. That's hilarious. What do you,

887
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,680
what did you think about playing out
here in the eye? The parking lot.

888
00:53:57,681 --> 00:53:59,750
Do you think it was, give me one like
a seated area cause I know I did.

889
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:00,860
I was thinking like we're actually,

890
00:54:00,861 --> 00:54:03,030
we're all on the main stage
so you know that's it.

891
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,960
I like the parking lot by it actually
better cause there's no seats in a way.

892
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:07,640
Cause he can go crazy.
Let's stay,

893
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:09,440
you know we're going to be
played with where their seats.

894
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:11,900
So it's a little different,
but you know it works out.

895
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,950
How long you guys been a band full? Oh,
almost 10 years. X amount. Well good deal.

896
00:54:15,951 --> 00:54:17,980
You got to, you've got a new album
or anything coming out the war.

897
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,460
What with it's been
out for a little while.

898
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:22,610
We're going to be doing one more tour
after all semester and then working on new

899
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:25,330
records. So keep an eye out for
that. Well that's awesome. Well,

900
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:28,720
always keep us post event. Thanks. Thanks
for that. Domestic violence, right?

901
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,210
Already. Not should have that funny. Don't
beat up your fucking girlfriend. Bombs.

902
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,000
They're idiots. Sacred for the
bedroom. Save it for the bedroom.

903
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,860
Once it punch her in the bedroom.
Oh God damn. Is that funny?

904
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,610
That's really good. We got one
more here from Peter from inflames.

905
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:52,570
Hey, what's up? Hoping Anthony Shell.
You know that you listen to this shit.

906
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,350
I'm with the bass player from
installation speed. I was, hey,

907
00:54:56,351 --> 00:55:00,930
how was your set today man? Uh,
it's going to be fine. All right,

908
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,280
we need to start that again.
So I don't look

909
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,230
like a retarded
assessing.

910
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,610
Do you said going to go tonight
looking forward? You on the main stage?

911
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,670
I think it's going to go great.
We always put in 150% know

912
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,940
sitting down crowd,

913
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:28,850
but so far the oldest shows has been
nice and so I'm pretty sure today will be

914
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:32,000
as well. So you guys don't like Yo
vibe, you come home mellow, melodic.

915
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,030
Does that like how you guys are? I
think we're metal. It's, you know,

916
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:40,440
it's hard to categorize us.
It's basically all right.

917
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:44,990
So you're not like, I had made me watch
movies and stuff. You're like, I made me.

918
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:46,730
I guess we could say that,

919
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:50,200
but it wouldn't be unfair probably
to just categorize it into, you know,

920
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,100
we're metal bat. That's cool man. That's
cool. How long have you guys been playing?

921
00:55:55,860 --> 00:56:00,510
A long time.
I think it's like 12 years.

922
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,000
Something like five years. Everybody in
the band. If you had to kill someone,

923
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:09,580
who would you kill myself?
The road sign and gets you?

924
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,900
No, no, but I mean it wouldn't be fair.

925
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,560
God, there's just no one would go
with it. No one wants to come next.

926
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,980
Fair to the others.

927
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:24,930
Wouldn't be fair.
Otherwise. I like this guy.

928
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:27,240
This guy can tell you like the
peacekeeper in the band, right?

929
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,870
You're like the mellow one. Unless
the man, what else is doing now,

930
00:56:29,871 --> 00:56:32,700
this is kind of a side name,
but kind of doing this so there's benefit.

931
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,800
Somebody beat up a special
needs kid and like, no. And uh,

932
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,700
so we just want you to just say,
you know,

933
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,500
just give a shout out to the kids so they
know not to beat up somebody with like,

934
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:46,320
you know, special needs, you know,
so just, you know, say like a,

935
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:47,910
you know, hey guys, you know,

936
00:56:47,911 --> 00:56:50,820
it's not cool to beat up on somebody just
because they're different or whatever.

937
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:53,700
You know, just, you know, just
like a quick kind of like, uh,

938
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:55,280
like a soundbite and it's kind of weird,

939
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:58,350
but throw a couple of puffs in there
just cause I find the kind of retarded,

940
00:56:58,351 --> 00:57:01,640
you know what I mean? So
you didn't like, you know,

941
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,490
just winging it goes,
it was the spirit of room place.

942
00:57:05,491 --> 00:57:07,500
She shouldn't treat
everybody equally and uh,

943
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,870
don't beat anybody up or
do something bad to them.

944
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:12,630
Just feel so different and
everybody is the same way. Okay.

945
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:14,070
That's totally the perfect vibe.

946
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,250
Just throw in special needs and
throw in like one or two fucks.

947
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,080
They have the awkward, it's kind
of like I said, they're retarded.

948
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,030
Same thing again or sorry,
the spit of blue flame.

949
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,370
Treat everybody the same way. It'll be
people still special needs to reflect us.

950
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Go and fucking go on to and do any which
would cause a different Truett ever go

951
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,000
to the same. That's beautiful.
And the kid's name is Russell.

952
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:42,940
Just give him a shout out to Sam Fox and
a big metal fan. So it means a lot to,

953
00:57:42,941 --> 00:57:46,440
unless the kid has got beat up, Russell
from newer Russell, the fuck you doing

954
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:52,740
six hours of do. That's beautiful. Matt,
thanks so much and good luck tonight.

955
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:00,060
Holy Shit. You are insane. I
love it. All in the same breath.

956
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,040
I wish you could see the
looks on their faces.

957
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,430
They're trying to wrap them fucking head
around the concept. I don't doubt it.

958
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:09,550
I love how the same breath you saying
this poor special needs kid. Yeah,

959
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:14,250
I'll listen as a fucking retarded.
They use this archaic term like retarded.

960
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:21,210
Oh, oh wow. Bill. That's
great. That was great.

961
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:26,130
Just to add special needs and throw a
fucking there and they just do it to say

962
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:30,480
how to Russell obnoxious drown
the clown guy. What's this? Oh,

963
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,930
this guy was one of the funniest
acts that I've ever seen. He was a,

964
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,090
what's it called?
Drown the clown.

965
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,380
He basically get all the
Dunkin stool at dunking.

966
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:42,540
So some guy is sitting there on this
clown masks and he's just trashing these

967
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:46,140
people. Half of them are fucking like
totally old jokes, but he says, Hey,

968
00:58:46,141 --> 00:58:49,050
look at the white trash
people add you fucking loser.

969
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,710
And then he just had this
maniacal laugh like the clown Lou,

970
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:59,190
and then he'd just go, at the end
of it, it was so fucking of Nazis.

971
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,170
He got some skinny kid.

972
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:05,250
He kept calling him a crackhead and this
dude is literally walking behind what

973
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:08,790
you throw the balls that go,
come on down, come on down.

974
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,190
He wanted to kick is a kick his ass.
He would get these people so mad in,

975
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:14,640
there'll be like 20 of them
and he'd get him so mad,

976
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:17,340
but by the time that they
actually like dumped him,

977
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,990
they would all start giving the
finger go, fuck you. Fuck you.

978
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,610
You might need video on this one. I
don't know. I was taking a lesson.

979
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,920
It's obnoxious.
Drown the clown guy.

980
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,540
You want to know?
Quick to say on

981
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,500
what do you want to be when you get older.

982
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,570
All right,
and then he's taunting him.

983
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,070
All pissed.
Here's a noxious drown the clown guy.

984
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,910
I guess a chick with no boobs
was in the area. Huh? Hey Mommy.

985
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,190
I know you love me. You just
don't know. We get babies.

986
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,980
You visit CBGBS before.
Yeah.

987
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:26,540
You know why I can read your shirt if
you're a clock of the dream for this group

988
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,980
back then a pound
time.

989
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,650
Kibbles offense. I was going to
get me some tables. Let's face

990
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:47,263
I,

991
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:54,630
I've got one more drug for
you. Hey Gee, I can look at me.

992
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,020
You got to have,
yeah,

993
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,500
it was just all jokes.

994
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,650
Just fucking the most horrendous jokes.
And you said,

995
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,350
ah,

996
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:18,060
and it sounds like Keith Robinson,
I love this guy,

997
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,940
knocks his ass asshole.

998
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,650
You could have seen these fucking
people standing around how they are all,

999
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,650
there was one dude,
he had like a,

1000
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,880
he was like completely bald on top and
he had a hat on and he took, he just,

1001
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:35,130
I don't get lost. This happened. His face
was like, like Puerto Rican Brown. Right.

1002
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,900
And then his fucking head
was totally waiting. Lose up.

1003
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,810
Well your fucking head.

1004
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,733
Yes.

1005
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,020
Screaming at Adam and this fucking guy,
he's just losing. Yeah. I look at my head

1006
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,870
and then they would try to throw the
balls even fucking harder and they're like

1007
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:56,420
missing by like 20:00 PM and every ball.

1008
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,140
Oh, what an asshole. It was actually,

1009
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:06,600
it was literally like a better
job than stand up in a way. Yeah.

1010
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:08,950
He didn't have to just fucking sit
there like God damn parking lot.

1011
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:12,610
You're able to do an act. You just
fucking irritated people's time. People.

1012
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,890
And it doesn't matter how bad
they try to heckle you back.

1013
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,350
We've got more from the
obnoxious drown the clown guy.

1014
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,830
What are you talking about?
Hey,

1015
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,790
I know you ain't got a green card.

1016
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,070
It was like Mexican.

1017
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:36,110
Do we isolate that? He the
worst. Get that on my machine.

1018
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:41,350
All right. Another loser that he was
making fun of him. Ron, Ron, Ron,

1019
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,200
what are you going to do lose out?

1020
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:55,740
We were standing up there for like six
hours and you heard that last like every

1021
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:58,680
three seconds. People like,
I'm going to fucking kill it.

1022
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:01,730
I put my head on the pillow and that's
all I hear. Is that guy laughing.

1023
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:03,643
What are you doing?

1024
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:06,863
I

1025
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,420
mean the second part of it done.

1026
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,030
Oh, he wouldn't do the light. He could
only do the laugh when he was there.

1027
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:24,000
He probably doesn't even know what
you're talking about. The APP part.

1028
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,050
You look like what?
That red shirt on.

1029
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,560
Oh my gosh, I gotta do that all day.
That lasts. Just knocks down the street.

1030
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:05,670
We've got to get that guy on the show.
How we get a hold of that guy has,

1031
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:09,230
we need him on the show. I'm the clown.
We need him. At the next road show, man,

1032
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:13,880
starting to put together
our first anniversary show.

1033
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,730
Someone says it's Nice a lot,
Colin Quinn getting worse.

1034
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:23,750
You wouldn't have understood the tonsil.
Something ironic

1035
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,710
on many years ago.

1036
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,900
It's probably three years in the business
and some guy was heckling me and he

1037
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:33,734
just

1038
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,370
talked to him after the show and he's
really a cool guy and it was one of those

1039
01:04:37,371 --> 01:04:40,130
guys. He's one of those fucking
balls to really have. Yeah,

1040
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,110
some of them like that guy.
Pretty good at.

1041
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,240
It doesn't matter how old the
jokes are. Not. Doesn't matter.

1042
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,550
You got to see you say with the right
attitude, it's going to work. You know,

1043
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,990
piss people off. It's fence. See,

1044
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,300
just like if you're completely uninhibited
and you're not going to shut up,

1045
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,920
you'll win every time. Yeah.
Very funny stuff. Build.

1046
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:59,260
You've got to leave or I can hang
out a little bit after 10 all right,

1047
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:00,650
cool.
We'll take a little wacky.

1048
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:07,060
[inaudible]

1049
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,433
yeah.

1050
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,750
What am I talking about here?

1051
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:59,210
Can they show that fucking John Malcovich
talking to his phone and just having

1052
01:05:59,211 --> 01:06:01,610
the time of his life commercial.
One more fucking time.

1053
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:07,070
What's more annoying that one or
where that weird family does the, uh,

1054
01:06:07,071 --> 01:06:10,270
the acapella version of
Ozzy Osborne's crazy trade.

1055
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:15,140
Would that random black kid in the back?
Like where did they get that kid? Like,

1056
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:16,940
you know,
it was he an exchange student.

1057
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,100
Okay.

1058
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,160
And he just seems like he's over all of
it and not enjoying hanging out with the

1059
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:25,180
other white people as he fucking shakes
the ice in his, in his great drink,

1060
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:26,643
you know,

1061
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,970
and then they gotta end that great song
with the parents singing like they're on

1062
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:31,804
Broadway.
Right.

1063
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:37,603
You know,

1064
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:43,040
anybody else with me on that? John fucking
Malcovich sitting there or you know,

1065
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,060
if that,
if that commercial was 30 seconds longer,

1066
01:06:48,061 --> 01:06:52,530
he'd have the phone like blowing him.
Tell me the joke.

1067
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,580
Do I have anything coming up tonight now?
Oh,

1068
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:00,270
lobster souffle or whenever.
Pretentious fucking foodie orders.

1069
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,150
Was it pretentious, Bill, or
are you just not cultured in,

1070
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:06,000
in his order made you feel dumb.
All right, you got me on that one.

1071
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:09,310
You got me on that one.
Um,

1072
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,600
I'm the only one who's creeped out that
there's a fucking robot in my phone.

1073
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,200
Okay.

1074
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,390
Oh, whatever it is, it's that
they try to make it human.

1075
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Why did they do that? Just
make it sound like a robot. No.

1076
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:27,420
Can I have him massage Parlor Tyra?

1077
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,410
Just do it like that. So I,
it still keeps that like,

1078
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:32,650
yeah,

1079
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,640
we keep that distance.

1080
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:36,820
I don't need intimacy with this
thing that isn't fucking alive.

1081
01:07:36,821 --> 01:07:39,790
I don't need that 2001
space odyssey experience.

1082
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,250
That's all I'm trying to say here. People,
oh, he's bill burr. He's mad at phones.

1083
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,810
Get outta his way. Everybody.
This guy's got shoved to say,

1084
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,363
what's the deal?

1085
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,590
Oh,

1086
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:51,730
[inaudible].
