1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,100
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,390
It is time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,550
September 26th,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,390
2016 what's going on? Oh Wow. Yesterday,

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:19,050
September 25th was the 36th anniversary
of the death of John Bonham.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,420
Why do I know that? Because
I'm a nerd. Um, all right,

7
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,100
let's get into the podcast this week.
Now.

8
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:30,580
I don't have a lot of time to fucking
sit here and try and brighten up you God

9
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:33,090
damn Monday.
Okay.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,960
I've been doing these
podcasts for since 2007.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,550
All right.

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,360
At some point I have to kick you people
out of the nest and you have to learn

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,120
how to find your own chuckles,
your own happiness on a Monday.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,670
Um, I don't know. I'm talking about
anyways, let's just get right into it.

15
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,410
People last Thursday evening,

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,820
if you owned a television
and you had it on, okay.

17
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:03,300
If you're not one of those annoying
readers, you know what I mean?

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,570
You know annoying readers are,
they can't just go and do it.

19
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:11,040
They got to let everybody know. You know,
I don't watch TV. Oh, good. Good. Well,

20
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:11,521
guess what,

21
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:16,520
now we have nothing to talk about
because I don't give a fuck about, uh,

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,000
you know, this, I this a little, I read,

23
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,300
I can't even name an author other than
like Stephen King and I know he's not one

24
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:25,290
of the classics, you know.
Well, maybe he will be someday.

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,650
Maybe the dead zone will
be right up there with a,

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,840
who's the guys fuck Crispus addicts set
the guy who started the revolutionary

27
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:38,010
war. Was he the first guy who was
killed or did he write scrooge?

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,790
Now what the fuck was that guy's name?

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:44,700
And now I know it was Christopher
Christopher something.
I read the fucking book.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,540
I read it,
you know something.

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,390
I read a bunch of classics as I was sick
of people bringing them up and I didn't

32
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:51,780
know what they will, you know, the,
the, the, the prince and the pauper.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,520
I read that one. I read, uh,
the Count of Monte Cristo,

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,650
which was like a fucking 600 page book.

35
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,150
I read the whole fucking thing
with my add. I mean, it took,

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,230
it took forever. Um, great book. Uh,

37
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:09,630
I give it a thumbs up Moby Dick.

38
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,360
I couldn't get through the fucking
thing cause they kept breaking down,

39
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,790
wailing like I had nothing better to do.
Right?

40
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:18,510
Like there was no TV and internet
and all that shit in my life.

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Like back the books from back then if you
get like the original like copy of it,

42
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:24,990
like how it was actually written.

43
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:28,650
You understand the astounding
level of fucking boredom.

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,360
You know, you just, you had no, you didn't
have a car, you didn't have any money.

45
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,760
You'd be lucky if you had fucking shoes.
Okay.

46
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:39,990
And if somebody was nice enough
to actually teach you how to read,

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,100
you had a book like your
heart was fucking racing.

48
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,250
Oh my God. If I have a
book right and you fucking,

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,140
you get excited. You know, you always that
book, one of those Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer,

50
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,010
things they give you whitewash the
whole fence. We'll give you an apple.

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,140
And he was excited.
There weren't any,

52
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:07,100
snickers is a fucking apple nature.

53
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,610
Sugar is a sake. Right? And he
was all fucking independent.

54
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,850
All fucking fence for an apple.
I love the apples are free.

55
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,940
Just walk up to the God damn
train. You take it. Right.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,880
So I got this country was taken right.
We just walked wide up. We just talk it.

57
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:25,080
Hey, you guys were already here.
Yeah, move out. Clear, clear it out.

58
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,400
Keep Bobot back it up.
Back it up. White people,

59
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,003
right?

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,980
It's probably the nicest way
genocide was ever described.

61
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,970
Hey, could you guys just back it
up a little bit? Um, yeah, but now,

62
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,030
now you know,

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,310
now there's no reason to read and pretty
soon there's going to be no reason to

64
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:55,040
even interact with other human beings.
Now when they make these not only these,

65
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,950
these sex suits that they're
working on so vigorously,

66
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,840
I believe in Asia. As far as the
video said, I've seen no, no.

67
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:07,650
None of this believer it or not.
It's really been researched.

68
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:11,640
I can't remember who the fuck that was
one of you lunatics who sent me the thing,

69
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:15,060
or if I saw it on TV,
I never remember how I get information,

70
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:20,061
but I distinctly remember seeing
somebody laying down in his suit.

71
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,060
It actually, it might've been the writer's
room and F is for family. I don't know.

72
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,170
I don't have any fucking short
term memory anymore. Right.

73
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:30,780
It's probably all the
fucking Gmos in my food.

74
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:35,580
According to the Hippie people down
there at the farmer's market who go,

75
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:39,150
look man, this is, this is how
big a chicken supposed to be, man.

76
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,770
It was fucking Gmos, man. Um,

77
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,750
I dunno if this GMOs in my food or not.
You know why? Cause they're flavorless.

78
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,990
You can't taste them. You'd
think if somebody was putting
something in your food,

79
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:58,690
you'd be like, oh, well what is that? What
is that? I don't know how their flavors,

80
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,470
it's kind of weird.

81
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,483
Anyways,

82
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,470
the fuck was I talking about?
Oh yeah.

83
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,960
So this fucking guy was laying down
in s it looked like he was, uh,

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,970
he was wearing one of those, remember
that gimp from at Tarantino movie, right?

85
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,320
Fast Times at Ridgemont high with the
fuck is a pulp fiction right there.

86
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:23,010
The gimp. And we had a gimp suit
on, except it was like white.

87
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,230
And I don't know if they just
covered up his face so you,

88
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,430
he wouldn't know his identity.
But he was like, he had this,

89
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,110
this fucking mummy thing on.

90
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,320
He had the virtual reality glasses and
then there was something on his dick.

91
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,430
I Dunno what I was doing.

92
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,610
It was like the fleshlight except
there was the automatic version. No,

93
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,960
be a flashlight is automatic.
That's battery powered. Right.

94
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,820
That is the creepiest God damn
fucking thing in the, in the,

95
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:54,290
in the history of man,
I'm a Thomas doing a podcast.

96
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,000
This person had one and he goes, look at
this, check this account. It was like,

97
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,020
it was like he put your Dick in that
anyways to do was just lay it in that when

98
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,530
I'm trying to say is they're working on
these fucking virtual reality sex suits.

99
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:10,430
Okay. So once these stakes, they
get them to a fucking level.

100
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,520
Like look how good they've
made video games. Okay.

101
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:17,600
And I haven't played since grand theft
auto three because that game was so

102
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:20,730
fucking great. It just took over
my life. I can't imagine what it's,

103
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,380
what they like now.
So what I'm saying is,

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,130
okay,

105
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,570
once they have the sexy things
going on, like the, you're going to,

106
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,960
you're going to deal with your wife.

107
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,880
Yeah.

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,050
Does she even have a wife?

109
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,570
Okay.

110
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,050
I don't wanna hear that horse shit about
companionship and Blahblahblahblahblah

111
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,921
and all of that crap.

112
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,320
You get that all out of the way
when you put on your mommy suit.

113
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,540
You know what I mean? You laid out,
you fucking dial up whatever you, yeah,

114
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,270
I want to, I want to be in, I
want to be in a pizza parlor.

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,810
I want to have fucking Mozzarella sticks,

116
00:06:55,811 --> 00:07:00,580
fright and then use chick comes over and
goes, here's your check in. And I say,

117
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:03,130
yeah, he got the money and
then for some reason she, yeah,

118
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,013
blows me,

119
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,060
but it can I dial up where I can actually
also be eating the Mozzarella sticks

120
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,260
and, and you know, Siri will
be in there and be like,

121
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,540
I don't think that'll be a problem.
Dang.

122
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,840
And then it's going to be happening when
you can fucking do that in the future.

123
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,690
It's a wrap. It's fucking
over. You know what I mean?

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,680
I wonder if he gave like a sex offender,
like one of those suits,

125
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:34,590
what he'd stop fucking trying to
snatch people, you know, be like, dude,

126
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:38,200
dial up whatever you want. You fucking
lunatic. Just stay away from us.

127
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,720
Okay.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,540
Probably wouldn't, you know what I
mean? Cause at the end of the day, oh,

129
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,350
you know, something, you know,
it'd be fucking hilarious.

130
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,970
His book readers would actually still be
fucking real. People pick. Yeah. You know,

131
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,630
I don't have a sexy when I'm
just, I like the actual, you know,

132
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:57,690
I thought the person was better.
It's like we just shut the fuck up.

133
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,510
Wow. I don't know what the hell just
happened. I don't know how I got on that.

134
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,440
What does that fucking eight minutes a
shit. All right. 52 to go. It's not bad.

135
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,700
I was saying, if you were near a
television view and Eric Goddamn TV,

136
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,140
do you have a TV in your life? Okay. If
you're not one of these fucking readers,

137
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,820
these people who are informed, these
people who know who their governor is,

138
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,220
you know what I mean? They
know all the words to the
national anthem. Uh, you know,

139
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,210
they've memorized all the flags around
the world. You know, those people,

140
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,640
they just can't get enough of
doing excrutiatingly boring things.

141
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,020
You know, they, they fucking,

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,030
they the kinds of people that when
they buy something they like read the

143
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,730
instructions, the whole
fucking book. Leanne,

144
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:49,850
they know how their whole phone works.
All of these are all,

145
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,930
these are all the people that you know,
you don't really hate them,

146
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,800
which is you really,

147
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,270
you hate yourself because you
know that doing the right thing.

148
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,990
There's nothing worse than when you're
a fucking dope like me to be near

149
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,790
somebody that is doing the right thing.

150
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,740
Cause when you see them
doing the right thing,

151
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,800
there's that voice in the back of your
head that you really try to drown out.

152
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,210
You know that saying like, Bill, that's,
that's what you should be doing. You know,

153
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:18,480
you should be doing that. Right.
You know, if you did that, you know,

154
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,250
you'd stop having these ridiculous rants
about technology and how fucking stupid

155
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,510
it is.
The reality is,

156
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,230
is you lacked the focus to get
through an eight page pamphlet,

157
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,100
most of which are pictures with arrows
pointing at the shit that the words are

158
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:35,670
talking about. You can't get through
that and this person reminds you of that.

159
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,060
So rather than being a fucking adult
and just sitting down and opening the

160
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:46,980
fucking booklet, you start yelling
at the thing like it's a person.

161
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,780
This is really just sort of therapy.

162
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:53,490
I tried to set up apple TV the
other day and uh, you know,

163
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,270
I just, I know how I am now. I just
told my wife to do it. She's like,

164
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,920
I have to do it. I said, yeah,
you have to do it right. She
goes, why I go, cause you,

165
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:05,190
you are, you're wired. No Pun intended,

166
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,250
better than I am for these types of
situations. Right? So she fucking, uh,

167
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,190
I'll, I'll break down right here. The
difference between me and my wife, right?

168
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,610
She fucking got in there. So I'm
sitting out in the backyard, right?

169
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,160
Drinking a Miller and she's in
there and I'm just listening to her,

170
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:25,560
sort of talking out loud,
figuring it out.

171
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,430
And then she got to one point
and it fucked up. And then she,

172
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:33,240
she laughed and went, oh no, oh.
Or something like that. And I said,

173
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,340
I would never ever emotionally be there.
I would,

174
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,700
that right there is where I'd be like, Oh,
what the fuck? Fuck this. Fuck. You know,

175
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,900
I would flip out, she just left. Okay,

176
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,020
now here's the difference between us.

177
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,500
So the last night I'm at a
buddy's my house house, right?

178
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,030
It was like eight of us and we'll
fucking smoking a cigar and a,

179
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,700
or cigars. I say we're not
passing around like a joint,

180
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,510
which is why I never got into
smoking weed. It's like I,

181
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,340
it was the most disgusting thing is
I think gets passed around and Shit,

182
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,460
you know, I was always sitting
there like, is, can I have my own,

183
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,000
no offense fellas, you know,
I really like you guys,

184
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,290
but could I have my own that
they'll only my mouth touches?

185
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,860
Um, it's fucking dirty. Hippy,
fucking Putz. Smoking sons a BS. Um,

186
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,860
so we're over there and we're fucking
smoking and somebody just points,

187
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,750
he's got this big window and his house.

188
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,580
And His light is on and somebody points
to the window and he's like, dude,

189
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,414
what the fuck?

190
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,230
And we look and this is mouse like
climbing up the fucking window.

191
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,640
And ironically enough we were just
talking about working with monkeys,

192
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,913
you know,

193
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,830
in movies and shit and like in a wild
animals and stuff and I was talking about

194
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,410
I would never fight. That's
a deal breaker. I don't
give a fuck how much money,

195
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,220
there's no fucking way I'm working
with the monkey because those things

196
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,940
routinely fucking just stay snap. You
know what I mean? Everybody looks at,

197
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:04,241
Oh look,

198
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:08,200
he's got a little hat on and a vest
somehow it's not a chimpanzee anymore.

199
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,220
That is the ability to rip my
foot off my body. Fuck that thing.

200
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,890
Fuck that thing. All right,
I'm not working with it.

201
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,970
I just got done saying that and then
when we saw the mouse it all went out the

202
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,804
fucking window.

203
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,200
Okay.

204
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,830
You saying, you know we're trying
to corner this thing, right?

205
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,670
This is when you really realize what
people are like when you get into like a

206
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:31,520
crisis like this.
So I got this Tupperware thing.

207
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:33,410
I don't know why I didn't grab
like a mock panel or something,

208
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,940
but I'm in shorts and shit.

209
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:36,890
And all I'm thinking is that
this fucking thing bites me.

210
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,740
Do I got to get those 70
rabies shots to the stomach?

211
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,343
MMM.

212
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,010
And I'm sitting there,
right?

213
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:46,820
The fucking liberal trying to capture
this thing and shoot out the window.

214
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:50,240
And then my buddy, that conservative
is fucking goes. He literally,

215
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:54,460
the things went up to, uh, the
curtain and was way up on the car.

216
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,930
And this guy's got this fucking,
it was like 12 foot fucking ceilings,

217
00:12:56,931 --> 00:13:00,010
this old house, you know? And uh,

218
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,860
it's all the way up there on the
curtain and the conservative dude goes,

219
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,470
get some wd 40 in a match.

220
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,410
It's like any serious, it's like, dude,

221
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:15,860
you want to burn these? Do you want to
hear the sound of a mouse burning alive?

222
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,880
You want that on your fucking hard drive.
Not to mention it's on curtains.

223
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,051
You know,

224
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,380
W I don't know what sort of sniper
you think I am with this fucking shit.

225
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,300
I'm not doing that. So anyways, so
the thing fucking like lightning quit,

226
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:32,750
like I threw the Tupperware, added it
to get it to crawl back down the car.

227
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,540
And we're like, where is it? Where is
it dude in like fucking Barry Sanders,

228
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,620
Zig zags between all of us takes off
down the hall and goes through the only

229
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:42,980
open door into the bathroom. So they're
my buddies in there. He's got it,

230
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,660
he's got like the fucking Tupperware
thing and I'm going and I'm going to close

231
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,460
the door, close the door. But
it's, he doesn't want to be,

232
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,460
I don't close the door and be in there
with the fucking vows cause it's still

233
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:57,080
creepy. So I'm going shut the fucking
door, shut the fucking door and

234
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,760
he won't shut the door and all of a
sudden the thing starts running out and I

235
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:08,530
gave it the old fucking right pad.
Save, kicked it back into the room,

236
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,440
right. It was like kicking a soc two
you could bucket, barely feel it.

237
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I'm sure it felt different to the mouse
and it was hilarious and fucking fucking

238
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:20,770
head. My buddy right in his knee
and he was wearing fucking shorts.

239
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:25,150
And he fucking dad jumps up in the air
and then the fucking thing ran out again.

240
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,270
Got down on the stairs and
I'm fucking good. Like what?

241
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:30,280
This Tupperware thing going,
bump, bump, bump, bump, bump,

242
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:33,460
trying to get the fucking thing. And
then finally like, and where it ran,

243
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,580
like there wasn't a good amount
of light and I fucking had it.

244
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I heard it's squealed and they turned
the light on and I got the thing down and

245
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,480
the things on its back looking up on me,
it's whole body is in the top where,

246
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:50,980
and I'm right down on its neck and it's
just looking up at me and I gotta tell

247
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,590
something right now. The thing was
fucking adorable. Fucking adorable.

248
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,990
So I was able to,
you know,

249
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,670
quickly get his fucking head in there
and then the things in there like making

250
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:05,930
this squealing noise and I'm like, uh,

251
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,900
I'm, I'm sorry buddy. Sorry
Buddy. We're almost there.

252
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:13,950
And I just slid it across the floor.
It was freaking out.

253
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,040
So I get it all the way to the
door. And then there's, you know,

254
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,370
that that piece of wood there
between the door and outside.

255
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:23,100
Now I've got a fucking lifted up.
I start to lift it up immediately.

256
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:27,960
It's fucking gross tail was
sticking out and I'm like, fuck,

257
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,570
if this thing runs back in the house, then
we got to do this shit all over again.

258
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:34,500
Oh, now what if I get bit?
So I just held it down, uh,

259
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,640
the Tupperware thing down and I sort
of stood up with my hand still on it,

260
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,770
brought my foot back,

261
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:44,880
close the door as much as I could and
I just fucking booted the thing and it

262
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:49,110
just took off like a maniac down
the driveway and the mouse lived,

263
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,580
lived to tell another fucking tail.
And um,

264
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,900
that's what I'm good at. You get a
fucking mouse in the house. I'll fucking,

265
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,480
I'll get out some top of where and
I'll fucking get rid of it. All right.

266
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:04,270
But if you want me to set up apple TV,
like,

267
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,490
okay.

268
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,030
I actually enjoyed catching the mouse.
I was never like,

269
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,190
even when I was running around,
I wasn't frustrated.

270
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,340
I never felt that he anger
when I saw the mouse there,

271
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,250
I didn't have any urge to kill it.
I thought it was fucking adorable.

272
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,020
And then I just let it go.

273
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,000
And the mindset I was in that entire
time during that dead, you know,

274
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,490
moderately challenging point in my life.

275
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:29,940
If I could just be in that mindset when,
you know,

276
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:34,050
I'm trying to fucking download something
or anything like that, I, I feel like,

277
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,450
I feel like my wife would have like
70% less shit to complain about when it

278
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:40,470
comes to me.
You know what I mean?

279
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,220
That could just somehow
getting that mindset was fun.

280
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,340
Run around you get the blood going.
Like when we all went back,

281
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,300
we all went back to smoking cigars were
all laughing our balls off, you know,

282
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,750
afterwards guys going are you fucking did
this, uh, you were scared and blah, blah,

283
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:01,700
blah. And then we were like, what
the fuck said, get wd 40 and a match.

284
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,560
And we all just started
laughing. We're like, dude,

285
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:08,270
you're definitely vote for Trump. Get his
coat, get his coat, take his coat. Right.

286
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,630
Um,
so anyways,

287
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,770
so I've been beginning to like
delegate now, Shit like that.

288
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:19,850
I'll just like it because my wife, you
know your wife. Okay. And you know,

289
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:23,030
women in general, women in general
are just inherently fucking lazy.

290
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,820
They don't want to do shit.
It's like they're lazy.

291
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:28,820
They're just too fucking smart
to have to do most of the shit.

292
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,330
And if they have a guy in their life,
he's dumb enough to fucking do it.

293
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:36,170
So all they gotta do is a couple little
pouty face fucking things and they get

294
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:39,260
to sit on the couch. Right. And
that's why they're always saying, oh,

295
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,630
it's easier for you to lose
weight. It's like, no, cause,

296
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,140
cause every time there's a fucking
country job, yeah, I got to go do it.

297
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,010
Can you take the recycling
out? That's cardio, sweetie.

298
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,840
Why am I always on the fucking elliptical
anyways?

299
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,320
Um, that was not, none of this was
what the fuck I wanted to talk about.

300
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,740
What I wanted to talk to you about is if
you are near a fucking TV on Thursday,

301
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,831
all right.

302
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:11,600
And you already sort of have any sort
of a God damn American you put on what?

303
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:16,440
Bup. Bup, Bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup, bup, bup,

304
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,513
banner.

305
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,700
Bam.
You put on a dog,

306
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,180
just started wagging its tail like what
I was doing somehow had something to do

307
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:30,710
with her. Um, do you watch Thursday
night football and what you saw,

308
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,530
what you saw,
what Patriot fans saw?

309
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,710
What Cold Fan saw?
What Jim?

310
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,330
The fucking biggest baby in NFL history.
Jimmer say.

311
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,850
Saw where's the solidification?

312
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,250
If that's even a word of a man.

313
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,140
Big like undeniably he became that night.
The greatest coach of all time.

314
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,090
Okay. That's it. It's not even debatable.

315
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:03,350
You know how it's not debatable.
Even people who hate the Patriots

316
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,010
can't criticize bill Belicheck
anymore. All they say is like, oh,

317
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:13,090
that guy could win with, don't. You could
be out there and he could win with you.

318
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,940
So they have to sort of shit on Tom Brady.

319
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,300
That's the closest you'll get a patriot
hater to say that bill Belicheck is the

320
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:22,480
greatest coach of all time.

321
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:27,481
He has to stay up to somehow take away
Tom Brady who fucking drove his team to

322
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:33,010
the go ahead score in all six Superbowls
that he was in with under two minutes

323
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:36,580
left two times.
No disrespect to Eli.

324
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,020
His defense failed them. I can have a
takeaway from me like Eli beat us, right?

325
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,510
Well the front fort beat the first time,
but you don't what I'm saying.

326
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,100
But when Tom had the fucking ball, he
didn't, he didn't kneel O'Donnell. It,

327
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,121
he,

328
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:54,000
Joe Montana does to six fucking
times six for fucking six.

329
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,130
I don't give a fuck how
great a coach you are.

330
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,140
You can't teach a guy to fucking do that.

331
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,360
And all these fucking dopes
out there who are acting like,

332
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,640
cause we beat the Texans in week three.

333
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:03,910
Okay.

334
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,080
That's the same fucking thing is uh,
you know,

335
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,010
doing it the first week in
fucking February. Um, but anyways,

336
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,400
yeah.

337
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,100
What you're really seeing
an in new England is,

338
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,210
is the greatest coach of
all time to devastation.

339
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,940
Devastating combination of the
greatest fucking coach of all time.

340
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,810
Okay.

341
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,200
To arguably top three,
four quarterback of all time.

342
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,300
Okay.

343
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,460
All right. Cause I'm open, Johnny
Unitas, Joe Montana, Joe Montana,

344
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,610
need four temps to win four
Superbowls, not six, you know,

345
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,720
so I give him the edge there and there's
always some other fucking guy and need

346
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,840
somebody that somebody can give me a
good argument for. And I say, all right,

347
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,870
the fucking thrown this at times.

348
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:44,830
Like what a four or 500 fuck you want to
say yes. Even if you put them at five,

349
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:47,980
that's still, you know,
ridiculous. All right.

350
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,490
And then our owner I think is on his way
to be in top three owner of all time.

351
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,500
And if you want to fucking argue with me,

352
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:00,790
here's his three coaching hires
since he's been there. Bill Parcells.

353
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,790
Oh Pistol Pete Carroll.

354
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,970
Before anybody knew pistol
Pete was a fucking great coach.

355
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:11,700
He hired him and bill Bellacheck.
Okay.

356
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,270
Bill Parcells, Pete
Carroll, Bill Belichick,

357
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,080
and fucking 26 years old and team,
24 fucking years old team.

358
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:24,290
That's who the fuck he's had his
quarterbacks drew Bledsoe and fucking Tom

359
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,240
Brady. All right. So,

360
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,150
so all you people that will try to make
it seem like it's just one person like

361
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:35,030
you need, you need all three components.
You got to have to have the ownership,

362
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:37,100
you've got to have the coaches,
and you got to have the fucking players.

363
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,880
All right? However, of the
three headed monster there,

364
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,150
one of them is without a doubt,
the greatest of all time.

365
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:45,100
And that is bill Bellacheck.

366
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,280
And that's why I actually tweeted that
Patriot fans are actually enjoying the

367
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:52,830
suspension more than Jim or say,
and it's fucking true because all it,

368
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,690
if we fucking somehow beat the
bills next week, all right,

369
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,680
now the pacet is fucking
fucked up his thumb.

370
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,960
And we're going to have
to Edelman at quarterback.

371
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,010
And if you looked at the highlights of
Edelman playing quarterback at Kent State,

372
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,940
you understand why he was not
drafted as an NFL quarterback?

373
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,090
Because there's no fucking
way he would've survived.

374
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:19,091
Half of the highlights are him
running all over the God damn field.

375
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,820
Um, and then the other half is
him on his fucking tippy toes,

376
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:27,170
throwing the God to both trying to see
over the fucking Leiman or whatever.

377
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,780
Like I like, I know what a quarter of
professional quarterback it looks like.

378
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,270
I'm just saying the second I see a
guy running around all over the field,

379
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:36,520
it's like, yeah, you're not going to
do that long in the NFL. Um, cause you,

380
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,300
they may, they may get,
I'll get you the first week.

381
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:41,120
They might not get you the second, they
might not get you for a couple of years,

382
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:44,030
but one of those days
they're going to get you, oh,

383
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:47,090
they're going to get you and they're
going to fuck you up when they do.

384
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,780
And all it takes is that one fucking
hit and all of a sudden you lose half a

385
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:54,920
step and then you fucked. Okay.
Because all that time, you know,

386
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,640
I feel like that all that time you've
been fucking running around just felt like

387
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,560
that guide reservoir dogs,
you know,

388
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,480
so you like to tell jokes giggling
like a bunch of school goes,

389
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,130
well I got a joke for you.

390
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,550
12 guys sitting around and Wolpert and
wonder why the fuck they got there.

391
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,520
What did we do? What should we have done?
All of a sudden they realize, you know,

392
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,210
okay,

393
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,210
all the time we joke around with,
she'd been planning this Cape Off.

394
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,280
Well then fuck it goes. So anyways,
the guy who loses a half fucking steps,

395
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:29,400
same thing, he starts taking your
oil. At time I was wanting to rob,

396
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,160
I should have been learning
the fucking position.

397
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,340
And now you don't have to think like
you don't, you don't, I don't, you know,

398
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:36,510
I fucking sit, stand up,
stand tall at pocket.

399
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,450
Your first instinct is to
front for your fucking life.

400
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,920
You've lost half a step and then boom,

401
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,760
you take the next fucking hit and
now you fucked. Now you're fucked.

402
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,510
And that's the end of your career.
And hopefully you got three years in.

403
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,120
So you got the pension, which is something
we learned last night, three years.

404
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,230
He could play three seasons and then
you get the NFL pension, you know,

405
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,850
which starts at 55 for bastards.

406
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,280
And it's right around the time
when you fucking concussion system.

407
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,700
I don't have to pay. Do you really
know that for back? No, I don't.

408
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,800
Just shut the fuck up though.
So anyways,

409
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,390
the Patriots at 3.0 and uh,
how about those bills yesterday,

410
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:13,100
how they Keyala came to life.

411
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,930
All those people in Buffalo who were
ready to say to the big flounder there,

412
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:20,150
whatever his fucking name is.
I love that.

413
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:24,530
I can't remember Rex Ryan because he's
been so fucking quiet over the years.

414
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,490
They were all ready to tell him they hit
the fucking bricks. A rich, very rich.

415
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Why don't you and your fucking
carnival ride looking brother,

416
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,050
right?
He looks like he runs like the tilt world.

417
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,240
Why don't you guys go down to Duffy's,
get yourself some wings, blood up,

418
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,210
bring your bags, bring your bags. This
is going to be a one way ticket. Okay.

419
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:49,211
Get on a fucking bus and go to Toronto
and take over the fucking argonauts cake

420
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,630
you're in when you're coaching the buffalo
bills. If you fucking lose that job,

421
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:57,080
if you get fired from that fucking job,
the next stop.

422
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,290
It's not even college football.
You're, you're in the CFL. And um,

423
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,580
I usually say no disrespect,
but I mean,

424
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:08,960
that is disrespectful as
possible towards the CFL. Okay.

425
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:12,080
And here's the deal. Nobody
in Canada gives a fuck. Okay.

426
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:14,150
They're all about the hockey. You
know, something. Speaking of that,

427
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:17,120
I missed all the world championship
hockey, like a fucking asshole.

428
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,990
Okay.

429
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,950
I heard it was amazing.

430
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,780
All right.

431
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,280
Sorry man,
I can't do my podcast.

432
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:28,160
I don't have to type in the
fucking password at the same time.

433
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,770
What was I talking about?
So about rex, right,

434
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,600
and fucking World World Cup hockey,
whatever the fuck that is.

435
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,720
I was making fun of the CFL. Hey
Bill, we all know what you were doing.

436
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:41,480
You're the one who lost his
fucking place. I right. Relax.

437
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,620
Still reason to get
hostile. So I think, um,

438
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,820
I dunno with Edelman at quarterback,
which is what it's looking like.

439
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,710
It is a home game.
I say this is my prediction,

440
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,920
knowing nothing about football on
any professional level, I say if,

441
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,330
if Jimmy Garappolo his
back, uh, we win that game.

442
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,650
I think if I don't know anybody else's
playing, I don't know, but said,

443
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:12,610
I don't know if he can play.

444
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,533
MMM.

445
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,340
I just think, I just think it's, it's,

446
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,800
that's going to be a really tough
one because what's his face?

447
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:25,801
Rex Ryan has a fucking hard on forest
and he's got a great defense and uh,

448
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,740
it looks like they, you know,
I don't really know this,

449
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,760
this year has been really fucking weird.
Like you'd see like,

450
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:35,110
like Arizona cardinals beat the
fuck out of the Seahawks, right?

451
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,393
Yeah.

452
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,320
And then you think, I'm like,
wow, they beat the Seahawks.

453
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:41,840
I know that they don't have Marshawn
lynch and all these guys are kind of a

454
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:45,570
different area then one of those weird
years and I'm not great, not fucking bad,

455
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:46,530
but they got Pete Carroll,

456
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,280
but they beat the fuck out of them and
then they go to buffalo there hasn't won

457
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:53,150
a game and then they get the shit
kicked out of them by the bill. So I, I,

458
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,500
this is too early in the season.
I don't know who's who.

459
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,230
I don't know what's what I dunno shot.
I don't know who's not,

460
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,210
but I think it's going to
be a really tough game. Um,

461
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,380
and I really hope that we
win because, uh, if we lose,

462
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,960
I know that Rex Ryan is going to
do some classless fucking, uh,

463
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,510
you know, one of his corny
as John Wayne fucking lies.

464
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:16,860
Nothing worse than a fat guy was swagger.
Um,

465
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,470
it's, I'm such a Dick Sometimes.
Oh my God. Bless him. Alright,

466
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,870
here we go. Let's do some advertising.
Lost another one. Everybody.

467
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,480
I lost another advertiser.
You know what I mean?

468
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:34,560
Date is don't fucking let those fucking
kids who were sitting there trying to go,

469
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,560
hey, did you know that 60% of
live event tickets go on sold?

470
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,770
I mean Jesus fucking Christ. It's one
of the dumbest things I've ever heard.

471
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,400
Yep.

472
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,240
What about,
Hey,

473
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,480
do you know that 60% of tickets are held
back and sold to fucking people like

474
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:56,750
you by the promoters that then get a cut
to the scalp and tickets on their own

475
00:27:56,751 --> 00:28:01,100
fucking shows? I would
believe that because I don't
understand how these kind of,

476
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:03,140
these people end up with
all the God damn tickets.

477
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,970
Yeah.

478
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,020
Does that make any sense?

479
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,800
Is that you with your tail or is there
something knocking on the door to Cleo?

480
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:11,420
Yeah.

481
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,940
Huh?
What's your deal man?

482
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,910
You got Restless Dog Syndrome.

483
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,160
Fucking love this animal.
You know what Cleo,

484
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,560
I catch you on a big Tupperware except by
wouldn't let you go. Poo who? All right,

485
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:32,110
let's do some reads here. Let's do some
reads. All right. Give me the loop.

486
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,320
A loot crate,
loot crate looking for gear,

487
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,461
collectibles,

488

pop culture franchises or we got your

cupboard.
Well we got you covered it.

490
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,300
A little crate offers a range of Geek
and Gamer items for less than 20 bucks a

491
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,490
month. Um, I want to bring
your loot to the next level.

492
00:28:55,491 --> 00:28:58,970
Get a bigger box with even
bigger lute with loot crate DX.

493
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,020
If you're more the type to where
your geeky heart on your sleeve,

494
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,730
then loop where our monthly wearables.
Are you an accessory subscription?

495
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:11,060
Is the droids you're looking
for this fucking copy?

496
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:14,330
I have no idea other
than I've read it before.

497
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,680
I would have no idea what the fuck this
shit is. This is all that comic con.

498
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,910
You're going to comic con are you
sick of having the same costume?

499
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:26,510
Is every other fucking fat
unfuckable Geek down there?

500
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:31,040
Well we got you covered with
limited edition green lantern

501

00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:37,130
this place you could actually probably
dress up like Alfred the butler.

503
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:37,761
You know what I mean?
Like,

504
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:41,560
this is the level of fucking nerd shit
that they have here that she'll up.

505
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:45,190
Your spine isn't just your imagination.
It's Lou crates.

506
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,670
October theme horror.
We're taking over.

507
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,430
We've were taken over 40 years of creepy.

508
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:55,540
Can't be bloody icons and putting
them in this month's crape channel.

509
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,560
Your best final girl.
Okay.

510
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,130
With items from the walking dead.
What is final girl mean?

511
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,150
Nightmare on elm street. I know that
I'm on Friday the 13th. Absolutely.

512
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:10,380
Texas chainsaw massacre. Nice
and Halloween. Any bad? Well,

513
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:12,090
it's been a while since they've
made a good horror movie.

514
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:14,280
How they got to go that far back?
Uh,

515
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:19,281

It was all in capitals.

520
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:39,410
I guess I was supposed to try
to scare you guys with that.

521
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,930
I have no idea what that is, but I want
to sell anybody who's into that. You. You,

522
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:46,670
you have fun with that. You have fun
with that. Whatever the fuck that is.

523
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,890
Oh, fucking excited. Oh my
God. It's, Oh my God. Jj.

524
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,780
It's Halloween's my Mavali.
I'm going to get a Mike Myers match.

525
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,780
I'm going to get Freddy Krueger.
[inaudible].

526
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,730
Should I be who you are going
to be this year? Well, can I,

527
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,190
I didn't want to be Jason.
Yeah,

528
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,820
you just put on a hockey mask and
you grab a knife in me and I just,

529
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,770
I feel like you know, I really, I want
to go all out. All right. Blue Apron,

530
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:17,600
everybody. Blue Apron. [inaudible] mission
is to make incredible home cooking.

531
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,670
Incredible home cooking accessible
to everyone. Jesus Christ.

532
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:23,810
What the fuck's going on upstairs?

533
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,250
Blue Apron achieves this by supporting
a more sustainable food system,

534
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,300
setting the highest
standards for agreements and
building a community of home

535
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:33,134
chefs.

536
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,430
Blue Apron has established
partnerships with over 150 local farms,

537
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,630
fisheries and ranchers from across the
United States. Well, that would be nice.

538
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,660
It would be nice if there was 150
farms left that the fucking oh Anthony,

539
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:51,740
Monsanto and aid took them
over as a result. Okay.

540
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:53,450
Seafood is sourced sustainably.

541
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:57,890
Understanders developed in a partnership
with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood

542
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,410
Watch. I don't know what that is.
You should look that up. Beef,

543
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:04,160
chicken and pork come from
responsibly raised animals.

544
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,870
This is all vague because blue apron
ships the exact amount of each ingredient

545
00:32:08,871 --> 00:32:13,130
required for our recipe. They are
reducing food waste. I these guys go,

546
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,240
they got their heart in the right place.

547
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:17,540
Cooking together builds a
strong family bond resort of,

548
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,910
we're not gonna bring up Jesus.
Now are we?

549
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,510
Research shows that Blue Apron families
cook nearly three times more often.

550
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,490
Some of the meals available in September.
Uh,

551
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,530
we have the eggplant and chick pea Tan
Jain with islander pepper and tomato and

552
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,280
couscous. Uh, one of our
other specials is, um,

553
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,550
the summer udon noodle
with cherry tomatoes,

554
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,170
corn and summer sweet pepper.
And of course my favorite,

555
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,390
a peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich,

556
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,800
an artisan bread cooked by little
elves inside of a termite list tree.

557
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,720
All,
all the elves are,

558
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,760
are held against their will
in a responsible way for
less than $10 per meal.

559
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:06,870
Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes

I'd love to be a fucking weight.
I just realized that.

00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,800
Just mock the menu every night.
Um,

568
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,070
we have a theremin third,
a third theremin. Thalomid

569
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,950
what do you want? Their Fucko all right,
harming one of these. I got MVMT watches.

570
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:44,100
All right. When you're in your early
twenties and thirties, money can be tight,

571
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:48,150
man. If you're not careful, dressing,
welcome quickly. Drain your bank account,

572
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,540
like spending four to 500 bucks
on a department store. Watch.

573
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,740
There's some brands out there that charge
insane prices for watches that aren't

574
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:58,890
even worth it. Well, if you want
to look great and when you go out,

575
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:01,740
but still have enough money
to buy him or her a drink,

576
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,920
people have told me that there also,
when they say him or her,

577
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,820
they mean you know if the guy is gay.
That's why they say him or her,

578
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:12,240
which is way more believable to me
that there's actually a woman out there

579
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:16,620
buying a man a drink.
Who knows?

580
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,580
I'm an old guy. Maybe. Maybe these
ladies have changed. Checkout Movement,

No, no. There's only one more. I will plow

618

Okay.

619
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:39,361
So last week I teased you guys and I
mentioned something about great white

620
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:43,850
sharks. I was supposed to
go on this fucking trip, um,

621
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,550
with a good buddy of mine, Dean del
Rey. I paid for the whole fucking trip.

622
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,020
Um, well my, my part of the
trip I should say, and it was,

623
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:57,910
I was going to go on a shark cage and
while they chummed the fucking water and I

624
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:02,230
was going to what great white sharks
swimming by me, I was all set to go.

625
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,250
Everything was a go in all of this shit.
And then this fucking business,

626
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,050
um, you know, there was this edit in this
fucking, I just couldn't get out of it.

627
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,770
And I had,

628
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,770
I couldn't fucking go
and I was devastated,

629
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:21,280
but I'm happy that I got
done what needed to get done.

630
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,330
And if you guys want to see what I
missed out on, go to Dean del Rey's.

631
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,910
I'm sure he's already uploading
pictures. He's getting back now. And um,

632
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,660
he actually,
he's the reason why I went,

633
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:35,290
cause he went years ago and do like the
pictures look like discovery channel

634
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:38,020
Shit. And I'm terrified to
fucking sharks. But I also,

635
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,950
I want to see a great white shark at
some point in my life and to the universe

636
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,720
and a safe fucking way. I don't know,
being on a sinking ship and be like, oh,

637
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,670
I finally got to say,
right.

638
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:54,540
So I wasn't able to do it. Uh, but I,

639
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,610
so not only do I not get to do this,
okay.

640
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,320
And I ended up having to edit all these
fucking episodes and shit because even

641
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,110
though the show isn't coming out
until the spring of next year,

642
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,800
we're still in crunch time because
that's how doing a show works.

643
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,730
There's never enough time. There's
never enough money. They can't fucking,

644
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,080
it's just, it's just in,
you're always behind. Some we,

645
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:19,510
we just have to fucking get this
done now or we're going to be fucked.

646
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,010
We're going to be fucked. It's just,
it's just that 24, seven. Right?

647
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,990
So I'm glad that I did that,
but, uh, uh, fucking blows.

648
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,080
So anyway, so I'm back here. All right.

649
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,570
I'm driving around Los
Angeles and at rush hour, um,

650
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,250
I pull up to this fucking stoplight and
it's like, there's two lanes of cars.

651
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,570
All right? There's like two
people in front of me. I stop
and next to me, you know,

652
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,430
there's three people and that's as far,
you know,

653
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:51,730
I don't even look in the rear view mirror
and I'm just sitting there. One, 1000,

654
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,040
two, 1000, three, 1000, four, 1000.

655
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,160
And then I hear what sounds
like a fucking explosion.

656
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,680
Just boom. And I went, whoa. And
then I get, I don't even remember it,

657
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,910
somebody hit my car, right? I
don't even remember feeling that.

658
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,940
All I know is I just saw this fucking
Prius just driving right down the fucking

659
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:19,900
middle of all of this stop cars.
Just, just went right by me.

660
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:24,280
Sorry about years right there just right
and just side view fucking mirrors.

661
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:29,281
Just flying off every car right
down the side of my car and,

662
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:32,540
and he just comes to our,
he or she comes to a stop.

663
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,620
All the airbags deployed in
this person's car on the side.

664
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:37,880
I couldn't even see who was in it.

665
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,763
Okay.

666
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,260
So all I'm thinking is like,
oh my God,

667
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:48,130
fucking obviously classic example of
texting while driving is mother fucker was

668
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:53,660
looking down and at the last second
was like fuck and just tried to shoot

669
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:56,870
through the middle. So I, you know,

670
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,740
I hate when people get into
a little fender benders
like that and then they just

671
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:03,860
get out of their car and they leave
the car where it's at. It's like,

672
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,960
well you just drive
the fucking thing over,

673
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,120
get it out of the fucking way so
people behind you can get out of there.

674
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:14,750
So what I did was I pulled, I, you
know, there was like a street, you know,

675
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:17,900
a couple of feet up and I just pulled
into that street and pulled over and the

676
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,490
person still hasn't gotten out of the car.

677
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,610
Everybody else that this person
hit is out of their cars now.

678
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,760
And we're waiting for this person to get
out. And I'm thinking like, oh my God,

679
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:29,180
like are they unconscious?
Did they hit their fucking head?

680
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,990
I mean that really soundly
impact was unbelievable. Right?

681
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,190
I get out of my car and all I have is
this on the side of my car. All he did,

682
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,870
the person God was the side view mirror,
but it's bent all the way the fuck back.

683
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,760
So like basically you could pull up
next to me and you could like brush your

684
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:49,290
teeth in the mirror because it's,
it's pointed right at right at you.

685
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:52,810
A few parallel to me. So finally
the fucking car door opens and I,

686
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,870
and I actually felt bad for the
person. I was like, oh my God,

687
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:55,880
they're going to be so embarrassed.

688
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,450
They're going to be fucking mortified or
whatever. And it was the exact opposite.

689
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:02,300
This dude gets out and he just
starts cursing everybody out.

690
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,610
He got out of the car yelling at us.
It's fucking guy just hit five people.

691
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,900
He's like, your mother fucking fucking,
he's going fuck you. You fucking bitch.

692
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,460
You people. Now of course people are
videoing videoing this person. All right?

693
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,620
And he starts, you fucking
bitch. You fucking,

694
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,020
this is the person you
should be good video of her.

695
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,660
You fucking fuck all you guys.
And while I'm like,

696
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,270
this guy was like,

697
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,320
he was so fucking committed to
yelling at us for half a second.

698
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,820
I started thinking like, yeah, what,

699
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:35,900
what did I do wrong when I was
sitting there at the time traffic,

700
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:38,600
like not hitting any but so
the funniest thing ever, right?

701
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,900
These people start to engage
this person and the argument,

702
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,400
it's like,
why would you waste your time arguing?

703
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,550
This guy just hit five people with
the car and he's yelling at us.

704
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,240
He's literally knee deep
inside view fucking mirrors.

705
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,790
Like you really think that you're gonna,

706
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,210
you're going to say anything to this
guy and he's going to stop mid screaming

707
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:03,960
and be like, ah, yeah, okay,
fair enough. That's a good point.

708
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:09,240
Then look at it that way.
Um, so I just start laughing.

709
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,240
I mean it was, it was just,
it was fucking Alinsky.

710
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,940
I just hit five fucking people and
now he's yelling at us. It was,

711
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,960
it was fucking hilarious.
Right?

712
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,210
So he gets into his car and he grabs
like three backpacks and he puts them on

713
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:26,090
himself and he goes,
get used to it.

714
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:29,420
This is what this is what La is going to
be like. And everybody's like, Whoa, hey,

715
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,300
hey,
post nine 11 what the fuck does that mean?

716
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,880
He yells at the lady more calls her
a bitch and other couple of times,

717
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:41,000
and I don't know if they were both fucking
jockeying for a position or he felt

718
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:44,390
she cut him off, but I think this guy
just went total fucking road rage.

719
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,190
He just picked a spot and he's like,

720
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,650
I'm fucking getting there before
you and I don't give a shit.

721
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,450
This guy just fucking snaps.

722
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,840
So he grabs his fucking backpacks
and then just walks away,

723
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,810
walks down the street like fucking,
I was joking.

724
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,610
My buddies like Andy Griffith when
he's taken opie to go fishing,

725
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,180
he just fucking walked away and I was
like, this guy's out of his fucking mind.

726
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,450
He just Egypt, he just fuck.

727
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,910
He hit l he kept us,

728
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,180
he's yelling at us and he walks
away like I'm done with this shit.

729
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,240
Like one of the greatest displays of
entitlement I've ever seen in my fucking

730
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:23,840
life. I mean, what if there
was a pregnant lady hit? I mean

731
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,270
this guy hit this fucking first
person so hard. I looked down,

732
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:32,760
I thought it was a hubcap.
Who's this chunk of a rim?
I said to the cop that goes,

733
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:37,210
that plastic. He goes, no, that's metal.
That's the rim. It's like Jesus Christ.

734
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:42,280
So he, by the time the cops get
there, that guy has just gone.

735
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,490
He is gone. That ball is gone. Um,

736
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,440
so I call up a buddy of mine,

737
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,990
cause now I'm like fucking
piss going like Jesus.

738
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:57,500
Fuck with the arrogance of this guy. And
then I'm thinking all that shit. I just,

739
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,980
what? What if it went up? And I just
said, no buddy, you shut the fuck up.

740
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,750
And then I knocked him out and then have,
you know,

741
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:05,640
you're going to see a hero fucking thing.
Yeah. What if I did that? Oh wait that.

742
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:08,660
Sorry. I'm a pussy. You
know. Oh wait, I've have, uh,

743
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,120
I don't like getting punched in the face.
Oh,

744
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:15,800
that's why I don't have even a
white belt in any martial art.

745
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,200
That vow. That's why, that's why I sat
there and did nothing. Oh, I forgot.

746
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,330
That's right. That's why
I did nothing. Right.

747
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,740
So I call up a buddy of
mine who was a lawyer.

748
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,010
I remember a long time ago,
I got into it, this woman.

749
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,933
Okay.

750
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:38,030
And, uh, we went up to the stoplight
and she was like, you know,

751
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,600
she beeped at me. So I beat back at her
and she beat to me, I'd be back to her.

752
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:47,190
And then she just fucking hammered
the horn all the way up to the light,

753
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,150
like 400 yards,

754
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:53,151
bay stops and holds it down and
staring at me in the rear view mirror.

755
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,890
Wow.
And the second it stopped,

756
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:03,300
she held her horn down for 30 seconds
and the second is stopped. I just went

757
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,690
and me and the woman I was with fucking
started dying laughing at her and then

758
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:13,860
she all of a sudden put her car in
reverse, backed into me really lightly,

759
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,430
and then get out at, reached into our
glove box. And I sat there like going,

760
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:19,650
oh my God, is she getting
a gun? What the fuck?

761
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,540
And she wrote down my license
plate number and then drove away.

762
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,810
And I of course thought nothing of it.
I was a young man.

763
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,120
Okay.

764
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,750
And next thing you know, I'm on the
road and I get this, I check in my bump,

765
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,540
checking my voicemail. It's like the
90s. This is a long ago. This was,

766
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,900
and it was just like, yeah. Uh, Mr. Bird,

767
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,160
this is a officer so and so from the
Elsa Gundo priest police department

768
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,690
investigating a possible
assault with a deadly weapon,

769
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,700
uh, or whatever the fuck it is. Because
basically your car is a deadly weapon.

770
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,950
Not Is it a battery?
If you actually hit somebody,

771
00:45:55,951 --> 00:46:00,480
I thought it was salt was
either threatening somebody
or making them feel like

772
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:02,540
you're going to hit him or
something like that. That salt in,

773
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:05,580
in a battery assault and battery
is actually doing it. So anyways,

774
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,560
because of that fucking thing,

775
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,873
mmm,

776
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,560
I knew that, you know, watching
this guy leave. I'm like, okay,

777
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:16,680
that's five councilman is salt off
of assault with a deadly weapon.

778
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,940
We got video of you
screaming and everybody see,

779
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,960
can't say you were texting
and listening to the radio.

780
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:26,150
You've basically admitted that what you
did, you kind of did on purpose. You,

781
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:27,270
we have you on video,

782
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,630
everyone knows what you look like and
then you left the scene of the accident.

783
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,970
So I call up a buddy of mine who was
a lawyer and I just left a message.

784
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:38,640
I just said, I just want to know what
kind of jail time is this guy looking at?

785
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,230
How long is he going to go
to jail? My buddy calls me
back and he just goes, I go,

786
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:45,660
yeah, I got to him fucking bleeding. He
goes, yeah man, it's crazy. And I go,

787
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,390
how long is this guy going to go to
jail for? Was that like three years?

788
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,060
And he goes, ah, you know,

789
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,650
he's a first offender. I
mean, the jails are crowded,

790
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:02,590
you know, he doesn't have any
other priors or anything like that.

791
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,690
He just has like a rage issue.

792
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,760
They probably just suspend his license
and definitely they send him some anger

793
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:13,690
management things in. And I
was just like, no jail time.

794
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,590
And he was like, when he got out of
the car, like what was he saying?

795
00:47:18,591 --> 00:47:22,850
And maybe this, I couldn't wait. I was
like, you can, you can fucking hit people.

796
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,300
Five people,
five different people in a car,

797
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,320
no concern for that. Their wellbeing
whatsoever. Get out, curse everybody out.

798
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,020
Leave and not fucking go to jail.

799
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,530
It's unbelief. What the fuck do
you have to do to go to jail?

800
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,330
And he was just like,
well,

801
00:47:41,331 --> 00:47:45,020
you're going to put him in jail and nobody
becomes a better person when they go

802
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:48,110
to jail. He's going to be in there
with a bunch of fucking maniac.

803
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:52,460
So I actually feel irresponsible to
let people know out there that you can

804
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:55,390
basically do what this guy just did.
And you're not going to go to jail. I'm,

805
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,610
I mean, I'm sure he's going to
get arrested when they find them.

806
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,790
I Dunno. I was, I was
pretty blown away by that.

807
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,530
So there you go. Instead of looking at
sharks, I got rear ended by this guy.

808
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:12,710
But uh, I to admit, every time
I think about that guy yelling,

809
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,240
it was fucking hilarious.
And I start thinking like,

810
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:19,700
was that just like a strategy for
him to get the fuck out of there?

811
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,820
And everybody goes like he boobs a
probably a stolen car. It's like,

812
00:48:22,821 --> 00:48:25,790
who the fuck steals a Prius?
How do you start a Prius?

813
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,730
How do you steal what you can you
hot wire the fucking thing. I,

814
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,770
I dunno.
I have no idea.

815
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:38,000
So I love it becomes like a
fucking sleuth, you know? Well,

816
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:41,690
we have probably what you, what was,
what was the circumstances? Oh, okay.

817
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:44,570
Let me listen to you with
your complete lack of fucking,

818
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,280
that's why I called the lawyer was like,

819
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:49,050
I don't want to talk to
other people's every,

820
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,060
you'd probably get like shoving years,
you know,

821
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,820
I never even took a a lawyer class.
Lower class. I never went to law school.

822
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,040
I'm a moron.
All right.

823
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,890
I'm also trying to type in my password
so I immediately become extra fucking

824
00:49:01,891 --> 00:49:06,570
stupid. Did I type it in right?
Did I type it in right? Yes. Okay.

825
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,720
Let's do some questions here for the week,
or by the way,

826
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:12,930
congratulations to the Tennessee
volunteers, man. Jesus Christ.

827
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:17,850
What a fucking game versus
Florida SCC football ad.

828
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:21,240
It's fucking best.
They hadn't beat Florida in 11 years.

829
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,990
They can't close a couple of times
only to come up short, right?

830
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,770
So Tennessee got their asses,
what? In the first fucking half,

831
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:33,600
they get booed off the field
by their own fan base, right?

832
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,130
They come out,

833
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,850
they make their halftime adjustments and
all of a sudden the scoring in the game

834
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:39,684
stops.

835
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,860
It's like 21 to three Tennessee couldn't
do a fucking thing with the ball.

836
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,610
But now all of a sudden Florida can't,
you know,

837
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,520
they're still up 21 three but then at
scorn anymore and they're getting stops

838
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,560
and all of a sudden Tennessee
starts moving the fucking bomb.

839
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:58,410
They score 2110 the crowd starts coming
to life. All right? They get another stop.

840
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,470
Florida's defense goes back out in
the field. They're getting tired,

841
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:08,970
right? The next thing you know, fucking
Bam, Bam, Bam, like Mister Blonde,

842
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:12,150
a lot of reservoir dogs
references this week fucking,

843
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,520
they just went on this fucking run and
they like 506 drives still last drives,

844
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:22,080
they scored touchdowns and next thing
you know it's fucking like 38 to 21 or

845
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:23,160
something like that.

846
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,120
And there's like a minute and a
half left and one of the coolest,

847
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,180
I said they went up into Tennessee's like
the coach's box when they're up there,

848
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:36,020
you know the guys down there, the
fucking the generals up there, right.

849
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:41,090
And um, they, they circled this
one guy, Gary Danielson circles.

850
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:42,920
This one guy goes,
you see this guy right here?

851
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:45,350
And they had this total intense
look on his face. He goes,

852
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:49,790
that guy was brought to Tennessee
for one reason to beat Florida.

853
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,910
And it's just like,
that's the fucking shit.

854
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,330
That's like one of the bad aesthetic.
Like what are you doing here?

855
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,930
What are you doing here in Knoxville?
And you can,

856
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,150
you can actually legitimately
sit at a bar and be like,

857
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,770
I came to Knoxville for one reason
and that's to be Florida. Um,

858
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,080
and not be totally, it wouldn't
be, it wouldn't be as cheesy said,

859
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:12,410
you could actually fucking be
telling the truth so that you guys,

860
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,490
we brought in for one reason
and that was to beat Florida.

861
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,450
And the fucking guy did it and he
showed no emotion until three, two,

862
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,780
one and then resolve. He jumped up and
hugged the guy next to him. That's just,

863
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:24,230
you know,

864
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,220
I can't imagine how much money is getting
stuffed in the front pocket of his

865
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:32,720
fucking button down by all, by all
those boosters. The poster span,

866
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,940
um, bought a fucking game.
People were going fucking crazy.

867
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:41,070
It was just a,
it was just one of the,

868
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,020
Joe was every Verne Lundquist said,
he said, if, you know, if you,

869
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,310
if you don't lock that you
don't like college football.

870
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:50,590
He didn't have a southern accent, but I
just, I dunno, it was Tennessee man. Um,

871
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:55,580
and once again, bucket list, you know, I
want to go to a Florida gator home game,

872
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:59,390
which I'm fucking going to in
a couple of weeks against Lsu,

873
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,730
I'm speaking of which,
uh,

874
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,760
happy trails as they say
on a PTI to a less Myers,

875
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,250
had a great fucking run there. I
mean, that's how it always ends.

876
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,280
It always ends with you
getting fired. So, uh,

877
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,380
as much as people bitch Moan
and complain about the guy,

878
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:22,110
he did win a championship and l people
who there was Nick Saban's team, oh,

879
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,870
go fuck yourself. You know? Okay. So it
was Nick Saban's team and you know what?

880
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:31,070
He didn't drive it into a fucking tree
and they missed the playoffs. You know,

881
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,280
like a certain guy who went 11 and five
with the Patriots the year after the

882
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:38,480
fucking super bowl. Um,
the Matt Cassel debate,

883
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:43,350
holy fucking shit. That, that
will never end. Dude met castle

884
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,060
or what about when he went
to Kansas City and they,

885
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,480
he was so bad that they cheered
when he fucking got hurt. Well,

886
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:52,340
that was because that was Kansas City.
Well,

887
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:56,120
Joe Montana went to Kansas City
and all of a sudden, Kansas City,

888
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:58,520
he went to the playoffs.
Playoffs. All right.

889
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,660
I just don't know how fucking more
basic it could be, but now you're right,

890
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,160
Matt Cassel, Tom Brady, Qantas. There's
no difference. Oh, Jesus. Alright.

891
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,260
Hypodermics hydro phonics.
Um, dear Billy Baldo,

892
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:16,710
the bollock brain bullet,
brain bolt pro football wall.

893
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,540
Uh, I'm having a real problem
in a startup I'm launching.

894
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,320
I'm pitching that about hydro phonics
to people who have no idea about it.

895
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,980
Is this like a commercial that's
disguised as a fucking question?

896
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,370
How can I make it relatable
to the common man?

897
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:37,860
It's the best way to grow plants using
the leased land and water with much less

898
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:41,770
chemicals. Oh Dude, you fucking
with blue blood money here.

899
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:44,460
If you better keep this under wraps
do or you'll just let her know,

900
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,230
commit suicide somehow.

901
00:53:47,231 --> 00:53:52,231
Conveniently I made an invention that's
slashes the cost to less than half of

902
00:53:52,571 --> 00:53:53,530
the current system,

903
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,490
but pitching it and getting people
interested is a big challenge. Any advice?

904
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,530
Um,
yeah,

905
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:02,980
I would do what the guide the Tesla guy
did you just do it yourself because you

906
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:07,981
like the best case scenario is if what
you're doing is true is you'll pitch it

907
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:12,490
to a corporation, they will buy
it and they will never use it,

908
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,860
but they will own it and
then no one else can use it.

909
00:54:14,861 --> 00:54:17,170
Like that's what they would do.
Um,

910
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:18,590
okay.

911
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,550
So anyways, he said, uh, a Duh.

912
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:27,900
Any advice the hydro phonics can really
change the global farming for the

913
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:31,890
better. Saw your show in Bristol with
my team and really enjoyed it. Thanks.

914
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:34,140
And Go fuck yourself.
Um, yeah, I would try.

915
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,410
You need to find for something like that,

916
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:41,340
I would say that you need to find people
that are, you need to find the rebels.

917
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,813
All right?

918
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,620
Those rare people who
actually have money and um,

919
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,710
aren't giving it to politicians,

920
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:54,420
aren't best friends with all the fucking
cops and just totally in the system.

921
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,870
You got to find people outside of
that who want to be like, yeah,

922
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:01,440
this is bullshit. Uh, coming here with
an idea and mind, let's try to fucking,

923
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,340
but the book I'm gonna,

924
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:05,940
you're probably gonna have to
give up part ownership of it. Um,

925
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,000
there's all of that, but uh, you know,

926
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,690
if what you're saying is
actually real and it does work,

927
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,730
I would save and if you
owned a piece of that,

928
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,940
you're going to be fine
financially. But, um,

929
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,270
now how you find those types of people?
I have no idea.

930
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,800
But what I would try to do,
I mean,

931
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:30,801
can you literally Google the top 10
fucking people with money that you know,

932
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,600
ah, Jesus Christ, this is all going off
the rails. You know what I'm saying?

933
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:35,550
I would not go the corporate
route cause like I said there,

934
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:37,830
you're either going to fucking,
you know,

935
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:42,270
they'll put something in your eggs and
you'll have a fucking coronary, um,

936
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,170
or, uh, they're just going to buy
the idea and take it. So I, you need,

937
00:55:46,171 --> 00:55:50,860
you need to find some rebels, man.
People with some fucking balls.

938
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,020
Eh, uh, then I would try to
go directly to local farmers,

939
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,730
show them how it works.
Uh,

940
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,740
you might have to give it
away at first and then he,

941
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:05,290
that guy will spread the word
to other farmers and you know,

942
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:08,260
this could be a way that they can compete,
compete with big time farming.

943
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:09,730
Okay.

944
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,370
You know, like, I would try
to sell it that way. Uh,

945
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,340
that's one of those things you
gotta do it. Like, you know,

946
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:17,770
like how the other rappers
would make it back in the day,

947
00:56:17,771 --> 00:56:20,140
they'd make mix tapes and sell
them out of the trunk of their car.

948
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:23,950
Like you have to do it that way. This
is a, this is going to the long road.

949
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:28,330
You know what I mean? This is the
comic who doesn't have a catch phrase,

950
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,000
who doesn't wear the same silly fucking
shirt every time. Who fucking isn't like,

951
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,380
Oh, you know the Hague. I Dunno,

952
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:40,800
it doesn't wrap their fucking
act around a cause. Um,

953
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,490
you just going to be,
try to just be funny.

954
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,840
You're going to have to take
the long road with this, but um,

955
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:47,970
okay.

956
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,560
Yeah, I think in the, in there
I want something somewhere.

957
00:56:49,561 --> 00:56:50,610
I gave you some good advice.
Yeah.

958
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:54,390
I would try to get to local farmers
and have one of them use it and say how

959
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:58,290
great it is and how much, how much
money they saved. I would go that way.

960
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:02,340
And then you get enough of those
farmers doing that shit. Okay.

961
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,270
Using your system and
then you get them to,

962
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:09,990
to show their results and what they were
able to do and how much more money they

963
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:14,010
made using less. And then
Dan, you go to the guy,

964
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,730
then you start asking around,
then you find the guy, then
you get the money. Okay.

965
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:22,070
Now you've got a little bit of momentum
because you did some of the legwork.

966
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:25,280
You can own more of it and then you
can create that feel like, hey man,

967
00:57:25,281 --> 00:57:27,020
I got another guy coming
down to check this out.

968
00:57:27,021 --> 00:57:30,020
You want to get business with me?
What? Then you get a better percentage.

969
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,610
I would go that route nine.
You know, I basically,

970
00:57:34,611 --> 00:57:38,270
I just described like a Julia Roberts
movie, but I think you could do it.

971
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,890
All right. Anyways, good luck to you sir.

972
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,800
I hope what you're saying is true and I
hope you can make a difference because

973
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:50,150
that would be tremendous.
All right. Bay or cons. Hey,

974
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,280
coppertop was wa wondering if
you heard about these cons? Bear?

975
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,930
Yeah, the aspirin. Oh yeah, I heard about
this. These fuckers are buying, oh, Annie,

976
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:03,940
Monsanto and changing their name to bear
to avoid the negativity that comes with

977
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,540
the Monsanto name,

978
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:10,070
but not changing any of the fucked up
practices like GMO seeds and hiding from

979
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:13,880
the public how they are poisoning
our food supply, et cetera. Yeah.

980
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,510
How come this never comes up in the
political debates they'd have a talk about

981
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,210
because these guys have so much they have,

982
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:24,780
we will fucking murder you money if you
talk to talk to us, talk about us. Um,

983
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,150
as this,
this wasn't bad enough.

984
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:29,150
I read up on bear and come
to find out a few years ago,

985
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:34,151
these bastards supplied
blood to hemophiliacs who
needed blood transfusions and

986
00:58:35,421 --> 00:58:40,130
their products and had the aids
virus ended and continue to sell it.

987
00:58:40,131 --> 00:58:44,090
After they knew about it, they
even admitted to it. Come on.

988
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,490
What did you read this?
What? What in the fuck?

989
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,940
How are these corporate fuckheads
always allowed to get away with this

990
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,480
unbelievable level of greed
and solace in human behavior?

991
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:55,550
These kids should be tried and executed.

992
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,020
Here's the link in case you wanted
to read up on this bare admits,

993
00:59:00,021 --> 00:59:04,760
it paid millions in HIV
infected infection cases just,

994
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,710
just not in English.
Well,

995
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,910
thanks for the last after reading shit
like this, I can use a few. All right,

996
00:59:13,911 --> 00:59:14,571
I'll look that up.

997
00:59:14,571 --> 00:59:17,390
I hope that's a legitimate website
and that's some fucking lunatic.

998
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:20,900
But that just says that they admitted
that they fucked up and paid out,

999
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,320
but God knows that
corporations, they, you know,

1000
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,540
they had those fucking police cruisers.

1001
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,030
That way if you got rear ended,

1002
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:33,780
like there was a major problem with
the gas tank igniting in these state

1003
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:35,430
troopers were fucking burning to death.

1004
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,990
And I heard they knew about that and they
weighed the whole, well, the lawsuit,

1005
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:44,370
the class action suit versus changing the
design and the class action suit would

1006
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:46,650
be less. So they chose that
and they let these guys,

1007
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:50,130
these fucking cops burned to death.
So it wouldn't surprise me.

1008
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,680
This is getting really dark people.
All right.

1009
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:54,090
Okay.

1010
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,320
Hillary health, dear Billy Bilderberg, um,

1011
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:02,560
I've always known you to be an o
on openminded and unbiased. Really?

1012
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,260
Uh, I, that's not how I described myself
and also an empathizer with conspiracy

1013
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,480
theories. Oh yeah, I'll
fucking all this a toy,

1014
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,520
which is why I was somewhat upset about
your unawareness last week when asked

1015
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:19,170
about Hillary's health unawareness.
Is that a word?

1016
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,500
Uh, I'm not some guy. And, well
it didn't get underlined in red.

1017
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:23,910
So obviously it's got to be a word,
right?

1018
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:28,680
I'm not some guy in support
of either campaign or party.
Yes you are. We all are.

1019
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,490
But when I saw the shit
I'm going to show you,

1020
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:37,350
I slowly became more unhinged.
All I'm hoping for here is,

1021
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:38,873
uh,

1022
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:44,370
is to react to a few videos that have
received as limited media attention as

1023
01:00:44,371 --> 01:00:45,204
possible.

1024
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,950
And I'll just try to give quick on
bias descriptions before each one.

1025
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,010
But I want, uh, you to
give your honest opinion.

1026
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,480
I'm sure you might have the same first
thought that I had after seeing these

1027
01:00:57,481 --> 01:01:02,220
things, but eventually the only reaction
is I had a, what the fuck is happening?

1028
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,850
Just put them in a URL.
Click on him. All right.

1029
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,373
Yeah.

1030
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,830
Okay. And what he's describing all
this stuff. All right. Seizure faces.

1031
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:14,430
Okay.

1032
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:17,610
Phlegm faints in green screen.
All right,

1033
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:19,710
so I watched these videos.

1034
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:20,950
Yeah.

1035
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,300
Let me see if I can find these things.

1036
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:26,430
These are all clips of
Hillary Clinton allegedly, uh,

1037
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:28,953
you know,

1038
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,090
having major medical issues and, and
nobody's talking about. All right.

1039
01:01:33,091 --> 01:01:34,470
Did Hillary have a seizure?

1040
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:35,943
All right.

1041
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,780
You guys have got a tribe and cold.

1042
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,970
I don't, I don't think she had
a seizure in this first one.

1043
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,500
I think she is that uncomfortable in her
own fucking skin and that's her trying

1044
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:58,280
to act like she's fucking playful and
this is what all politicians do and this

1045
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:02,270
is why Trump is killing it. Because
Trump would have looked over and be like,

1046
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:05,360
where the fuck did you come from? She did
not just have it. That's not a seizure.

1047
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,430
Okay,

1048
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:08,900
that's not what a seizure looks like.

1049
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:15,090
You don't have a seizure like fucking,

1050
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,203
yeah,

1051
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,910
they will jump on anything.

1052
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,260
There's no fucking way like
the media is going to cover up.

1053
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:23,940
She had a fucking seizure.
Gimme a thug.

1054
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:27,810
How much they made out of her having
pneumonia. That's not a seizure.

1055
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,370
That's just an incredibly uncomfortable
person in their own fucking skin trying

1056
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:36,330
to act like they're playful. All
right, this next one's my favorite one.

1057
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:40,080
Close up of Hillary's feet showing
she was dragged into event.

1058
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:43,890
Now this one's completely eliminated
because you never show me who's head

1059
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:47,530
belongs to those feet.
It's somebody getting dragged,

1060
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:53,910
like I don't understand.
Like I don't even see her get,

1061
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,810
I don't even see that person's for me.
Look at this again. See the, she's,

1062
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,820
they're getting dragged here.

1063
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,170
Yeah. I don't see anything there. And
I don't even know that that's Hillary.

1064
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,950
This is why you can't, we can't
present this as fucking news. Um,

1065
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:15,700
then Hillary disappearing. This looks
like a fifth grade Photoshop to me.

1066
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,040
Yeah. I don't know this, this is fucking
hilarious. This looks like an Atari from,

1067
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:23,770
this is why this is not on national
news, Dude. This shit is ridiculous.

1068
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,720
And then the last one is simply her with
her weird eyes. Normally in slow motion

1069
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:31,870
with some silly music underneath it.

1070
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,720
Yeah. No, this is, you put anybody in slow
motion. They're going to look demonic.

1071
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:47,490
This is why I haven't talked
about it. Okay. Uh, yeah,
she's on the campaign trail.

1072
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,410
She's worked herself to
death and she got pneumonia.

1073
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:53,220
Like most people when
they work themselves, that
heart, you catch pneumonia.

1074
01:03:53,221 --> 01:03:56,850
It's completely fucking normal. Do I
agree with their politics? Do I like her?

1075
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,030
Am I going to vote for her now?
Am I going to vote for Donald Trump?

1076
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,620
Now is the other person that I'm going
to fucking vote for going to win now.

1077
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,251
All right.

1078
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:09,770
But I don't think that Hillary is like
literally having seizures on TV and uh,

1079
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,750
people are just completely
fucking ignoring it. All right?

1080
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:16,500
There's plenty of fucking dopes that they
can put in office that will do exactly

1081
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:19,440
what they say that don't have seizures.
So why would they have her?

1082
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,400
Cause it's too late, man. That too far
down the thing. Yeah. I don't buy it.

1083
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,560
I am all about the conspiracies.

1084
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,900
I'm all fuck him about them. I, you know,
but I, I don't, I just don't buy into it.

1085
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:35,550
So what I think you have
there, sir, is, um, basically,

1086
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:38,520
you know those shows where people
find old shit in their house.

1087
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:41,400
Like this has been in our family
for like five generations.

1088
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:45,240
I was wondering is it worth anything?
And sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.

1089
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,300
You're a,

1090
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,170
you're that person who came in with
something that you thought it was real,

1091
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:52,860
but it's a fake and you thought it was
worth thousands and thousands of dollars.

1092
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:55,290
But it's, sorry, it's only worth 15 bucks.

1093
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:56,860
Yeah.

1094
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,730
And then you just,

1095
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,600
and the awkward silence that follows you
just slowly pack up your shit and then

1096
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:06,250
you leave. I'm sorry sir. I wanted to
believe it's so bad I can't stand Hillary.

1097
01:05:06,251 --> 01:05:10,480
I think she is one of the most dishonest
people that has come along since her

1098
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:14,710
husband or the last Bush administration.
Um,

1099
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:18,830
I hate the Clintons. I hate the bushes.
I don't mind the George Bush senior.

1100
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:22,750
All right. George Bush senior
was a fucking bad ass. Okay.

1101
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:26,290
I don't know what the fuck the Warren
Commission and being part of the CIA,

1102
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,400
I don't know what the fuck he did there.

1103
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:32,401
All I knew is that guy at like 19 years
old fucking bombed an island where he

1104
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:39,001
had this fucking fly in and what he was
trying to take out was below the highest

1105
01:05:39,491 --> 01:05:42,730
points. It was like he's flying
into an old football stadium,

1106
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:43,690
shaped like a horse shoe.

1107
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,710
And he flew in below the highest level
of the mountains and the side of him.

1108
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:52,711
And there was people shooting at
him down at his fucking plane.

1109
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,560
You got it. You got? What the
fuck was the flags of our fathers?

1110
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:01,030
You gotta read that book now, that
book I read. Um, anyways. All right,

1111
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:03,710
that is the podcast,
ladies and gentlemen. Uh,

1112
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,540
thank you so much for listening and uh,

1113
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,530
that is all checkout Dean del Ray's
pictures of the shark and counter that I

1114
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:16,370
missed, but next year I'm
definitely fucking going. I
delayed it for a year. Um,

1115
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,200
what happened? He can't fucking
do everything, but uh, you know,

1116
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:24,390
I'm glad I was here and I got to edit
the shows and to get rear ended by a

1117
01:06:24,391 --> 01:06:28,590
psycho and watched the guy just walk
away. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boo.

1118
01:06:28,591 --> 01:06:30,480
Right down the fucking
streets. There you go, people.

1119
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,690
She's now that you can do that.
If you're having a bad day of a Deli,

1120
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:36,170
you can plow into five people,

1121
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,690
tell them to all go fuck
themselves and you just walk away.

1122
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,810
But they will take your license forever.
Possibly if they find you.

1123
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:46,780
I have no idea. All right. Go
fuck yourselves and I'll check on,

1124
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,790
on Thursday. As always, if you
want to donate to the podcast,

1125
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:52,580
the easiest way to do it as you go to
the [inaudible] dot com you click on the
