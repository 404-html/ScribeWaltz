1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,430
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,460
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Byrd

3
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:07,060

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,540

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,760
checking in on you.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,420
I'm just checking out how the holiday
season is fucking go and for you.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,710
Did she get some toys for
fucking girls in boys?

8
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:26,090
That sounded really creepy.
Um, hey, what's going on?

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,050
I have been running around all day.
Podcast is a little bit late.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,840
I was actually doing Joe Rogan's
monster podcast. Um, and uh,

11
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:36,500
we had a great time.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,460
Talked a little bit about flying in a
helicopter earlier this week and uh,

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,310
and then he got me all sold on buying
a fucking sauna. Yeah. Joe, Joe,

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,890
Joe. Fuck. It tells you something
like, all right, this guy, you know,

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,920
he's probably read up on
it, whatever. He was like,

16
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:54,920
people who do this four times
a fucking week, you know,

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,530
live a long time or some shit.
And I'm just thinking like,
well, I'm an old dad. Oh,

18
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,110
I don't care.

19
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,890
Oh Man.
Old Dad Joe,

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,980
make me come too far away.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
It's going to be me in five
years. Oh yeah, you can

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,520
job doing to cad.

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,750
Um, so I have to, uh, make
sure I take care of myself. So,

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,300
uh, Billy's got some
growing up to do. All right.

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,040
Been abusing alcohol for a while.
Now I take the bottle out,

26
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,930
I slept around a let them know who's boss.
Um,

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,360
and I got to fucking grow up.
You need, you need to call up.

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,820
He had to take a little bit spanky Philly,

29
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,620
they fucking say that all the time.
You and sneaky,

30
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,640
a little bit of responsibility.
Uh,

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,080
I've never in my life

32
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,330
understood that expression.
You need a little bit of responsibility.

33
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,790
They'll pick like the most immature
fucking person ever and tell them you need

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,940
some responsibility and you're
like this fucking guy. No,

35
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:11,900
this guy does not need to be in charge
of anything. He's a fucking moron.

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,120
Because they had that
whole idea of, oh, well,

37
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:17,900
once you have a kid and then you have,
you know, you're, you're gonna have to,

38
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,450
you know, change your ways. Yeah.

39
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,230
Unless you're a fucking idiot and
everything this person is doing is

40
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:28,160
demonstrating that they're a fucking
moron and you're telling them to go out

41
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,690
there,
procreate with somebody.

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,880
You know what you need
is no responsibility.

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,260
You need a fucking playpen
is what you need there.

44
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:42,580
Bucko my new year's resolution
is I'm going to, um,

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,110
I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix
this little phone, a headphone Jack.

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,780
I literally sit here with my thumb
on the button like a terrorist.

47
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,870
You know what I mean? Like I
lift it off it, you know, my mom,

48
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:56,920
my way to fucking Evan
70 broads in my life.

49
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,420
I know it's a hacky joke. The more you're
married that just you just like, Oh God.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,700
Um, anyway, um,

51
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,460
all beeble oh, bill burr is fucking
slowing down, man. In a good way.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,350
You know, I'm off the
sauce. Who knows? File log,

53
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:20,320
but I'm off the fucking sauce
and I'm actually reading a book.

54
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,700
I swear to God. I mean, granted, it's
a sports book. Does that even count?

55
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,360
It's about, uh, Bob Cousy and
Bill Russell's relationship.

56
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,170
When I did the heard somebody over there
gave it to me believe this is where I

57
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,400
got it. And um, you know, one of
the things that always bothered me,

58
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,451
you know,

59
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,780
something I always got meant to get
around to was to know all the Celtics

60
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:45,040
retired numbers. And now that
I've read the book, I finally,
I think I am, I'm down.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,520
I swear to God I'm not looking
at anything. All right.

62
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,050
Number one is Walter Brown.
He was the original owner of the Celtics.

63
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:57,790
Number two is red are back. The great
coach. They consider a number two,

64
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,720
he got number two because he's the second
most important person in the Celtics

65
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:06,610
history I guess. Cause number one is the
original owner. Then it's Dennis Johnson.

66
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:10,270
Number three, Bill Russell, number six.
Why do I, why do I need to know this?

67
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,880
Jo Jo white on the great basketball names?
No,

68
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:16,870
but 10 and then it's Bob Cousy at 14.

69
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,590
Tommy Heinsohn is 15 some guys,

70
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,410
Tom Sanders is 1617.

71
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,640
Okay.

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,260
Eighteens Dave Cowens 19
is fucking Don Nelson.

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,110
21 is Bill Sharman.

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,480
22 was Ed Mccauley 20
three's Frank Ramsey.

75
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,050
24, Sam Jones, 25. Casey
Jones. All right, now it's not,

76
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,560
now it's easy.
31 said Vic cornbread,

77
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:54,370
Maxwell 32 is Mikael 33 bird 35.
Reggie Lewis,

78
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:57,220
double zero is fucking Robert Parish.

79
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,700
Then there's another guy just says his
name cause he also wore the number at 18

80
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,770
and didn't want to retire it.
And the Dave Collins got it.

81
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:07,400
So I don't know his fucking name. So
that's not bad. That's not bad. Um,

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,460
so now my know that and
what does that get me?

83
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,560
Next time I get into an argument with
my wife now, but watch Walter Brown now,

84
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:15,520
but two's red are back.
Can you do this?

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,910
Oh Dad,

86
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm an old dad. I said, get off
of that now I need a nap. Um,

87
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,270
anyways, so after I did
Joe's podcast, he's like,

88
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,330
he's got like did that flotation salt
tank thing in there. And I'm like,

89
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:38,680
dude, I don't know if like if I went
in that fucking thing for like an hour,

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,263
like

91
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,760
I always wondered what those things
will like those isolation tanks.

92
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,990
I mean that looks fucking wild.
They just closed that door.

93
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:51,120
And you're in there
floating in pitch black,

94
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,350
like you're floating through space like
Sandra Bullock in that movie. Right.

95
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,070
Where the other guy there was never going
to get married and then he did George

96
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,903
Clooney.
Right.

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,580
May just sort of floated off into space
that I could never get my shit together.

98
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:12,140
You go back to the bucket spacecraft,
I'm just going to float away that movie.

99
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,780
I feel like you'd feel like that,
you know,

100
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,900
if I ever get a role where I get
to play an astronaut, that that's,

101
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:20,630
that's to be how I'm going
to prepare for the role.

102
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,190
But what did you do to prepare for
a role to play an astronaut? Well,

103
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:30,191
I kept my Boston accent and I just went
to an isolation tank and just laid there

104
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,310
in a bathing suit. Do you
think it helped? You know,

105
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,290
but it gave me something to say
in this interview. Um, anyway,

106
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:43,070
so he had a sauna there, which I'm
totally sold on now. We went there,

107
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,800
we tried to be in there for like a fucking
half hour. He could do it. I couldn't,

108
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,750
I, I made like there
was eight minutes left,

109
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,770
10 minutes left. I made 20 minutes. It
was like 200 fucking degrees in there.

110
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,440
That's what he was saying. Like,
how the fuck is it? 200 degrees now.

111
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,420
It doesn't water boil at like
212 degrees or some shit,

112
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,170
a hundred degrees Celsius.
Um,

113
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,070
I guess those scientists can get harder
cause it's not like it because it's a

114
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:14,840
dry heat. I have no idea on all. I know. I
was just like, all right, 10 minutes left.

115
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,580
He goes, come on and tough
it out. I'm like, all right.

116
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,460
And then 10 minutes later I'm like,
how much time's left?

117
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,320
And he's like eight
minutes. And I'm like, fuck.

118
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,220
And it at like five minutes I laid down

119
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,210
and he's like,
all right dude.

120
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,000
He knew I was too stubborn so he fucking
opened the door and then I was fine.

121
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,420
He goes, you almost made it. It's
like, I think I did all right.

122
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,350
I don't think I need to go any further
than that, but uh, I felt fucking great.

123
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,660
I felt peaceful.
I felt calm.

124
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,260
Okay.

125
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,620
I didn't feel like yelling at anybody
or walking around being a fucking

126
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,720
emotional lunatic that's
just wears people out. Um,

127
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,530
so whatever. I'll see. They
makes little two person ones.

128
00:07:55,531 --> 00:08:00,530
I want to make it fit it in my
fucking little ass garage. Yeah, no,

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,393
that would be great.

130
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,460
Okay.

131
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,130
You know, anytime you have a
disagreement with your spouse, right?

132
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,690
You just go into the sauna at the rule
is you go in there for half hour and then

133
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,590
when you come up then you talk about it.
Hey Man,

134
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,060
like you left your shoes in the
hall, man. Oh, I'm sorry man.

135
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,500
It's okay. It's not, it doesn't really,

136
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:26,410
but I didn't know why it bothered me
31 minutes ago, but it did. But that's,

137
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,430
you know what, you can put your shoes
wherever you want. Ah, thank you.

138
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:31,264
I appreciate that.

139
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,510
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. So anyways, um,

140
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,450
I get not only do I have all my
Christmas shopping done, I got, um,

141
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,250
I got it all wrapped except for when I
bought my, my daughter this book, uh,

142
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,480
the Grinch stole Christmas. I
bought that on the road. And I just,

143
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,810
I forgot I had it,

144
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,790
I tucked it away in the drawer because
I knew if she saw it and she'd be like,

145
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,930
book, book, read, read. Yeah. Um,

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,720
so I just have to wrap that. Then I
think I'm done. I'm think I'm done.

147
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,460
And I think for once my super smart wife
hasn't figured out what anything that

148
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm going to get her,

149
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,013
you know,

150
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,930
that was really covert about the
shit. Snuck it around. I just,

151
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,170
I brought everything into the
garage this year. Right. Sorry.

152
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,250
What the fuck was that?

153
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,770
You don't shit where you open your
mouth and you just make a fucking noise.

154
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you just hear that? Sounded like
there was a ferret that was like some,

155
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,610
something in the back of my
throat while I continued to talk.

156
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,440
Sound like a little cat. Did you hit
her? You know, do you realize like bag,

157
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,290
if I did that back in like
the fucking 1700 state,

158
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:45,210
they'd be like drowning me thinking I was
a witch. I was like possessed or right.

159
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:49,350
A fucking tapeworm or something.
Jesus Christ.

160
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,780
Some of these fucking broads on,
on social media.

161
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,920
Thinking they're not being heard.

162
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,740
How do you think the the fucking
people felt back then? Well,

163
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:58,710
if you have to compare ourselves
to the Salem witch trial,

164
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,420
aren't you really proving our point?

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,870
That was the hedge clippers
trim in the bush there. Um,

166
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,110
they broke.
Anyways,

167
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,570
I'm plowing ahead here. Uh, by the way,

168
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:27,770
I've keep promoted this on, on Joe Rogan
to I the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.

169
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,160
It's still promoting.
That is February, Tuesday,

170
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:34,700
February 19th, 2019. Get
your ass to the fucking city.

171
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,040
All right, come on down. Great
benefit. Big J. Oh, Chris.

172
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,650
Michelle Wealth Rich Vos.

173
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,710
Good cipher sounds myself has going.
It's going to be a cavalcade of comedy,

174
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,440
but the best stand up
comedian I ever saw my life,

175
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:57,250
all proceeds go to benefit all the people
that he's taken care of, his family.

176
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,380
Well, you know, all that and it's
been a very successful thing.

177
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,670
We keep his name alive and whatnot.
Um,

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,180
okay.

179
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,140
All right with that.
You know what?

180
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:10,160
I actually got to watch a Bruins game the
other night by can't watch most of it.

181
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,210
I watch most of it. And then, uh, being
a dad comes in, you know, I saw, uh,

182
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,120
the first two periods of the Bruins,
four to nothing win over the Canadians.

183
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:23,330
You know, we were up two to nothing and
I missed the fourth period. Third period.

184
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:27,330
Sorry. And uh, you know, one of my friends

185
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,160
from Montreal comedy festival texts me,
cause you watching this game,

186
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,250
and I knew it was the third
period and I was like, well, I go,

187
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,170
I'm assuming you guys tied it up if you
fucking called me. And to his credit,

188
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,090
he didn't. He texted me, he, to his
credit, he didn't. The man did not.

189
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,830
We played fucking great.
Then I saw the highlights at last fucker,

190
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:52,490
Marshawn golden number for, they're
little big bank bull all around the horn.

191
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,380
Everybody it,

192
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,410
all those little frenchies with Dave
fucking crying into their little handcuff

193
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,500
chest with this silly
socks. Oh, I love it.

194
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,410
Going into their building,
four to nothing.

195
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,470
So the private plane tonight,
I have no idea, but I gotta go,

196
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,720
I gotta go on site for fucking supper.

197
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,990
I still call it supper back in the day.

198
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,410
That's what we call
sit down for September.

199
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,150
Your mother would ring the fucking dinner
bell and everybody would come running

200
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,920
in like cattle, right? I'll fucking
filthy for being outside there.

201
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,220
It was chipped beef on toast.
Uh, chicken, Alec. Kig.

202
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,200
You know, I don't think a
king eats like this. Um,

203
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,690
so let's plow ahead here. Uh,
it's Liverpool. My fucking,

204
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:43,980
my fucking adopted God damn team.
My almost fucking miss this game.

205
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:48,480
They're playing all my God. They're
playing the wolves. Jesus fucking Christ,

206
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:52,350
not the wolves. How the fuck is
that a professional franchise?

207
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,000
You've got some stupid Jersey with
like a w on it. We get it. You know,

208
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,930
you couldn't write the whole thing.

209
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:00,660
They can't afford to have the
o l v e s on there, right?

210
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:04,590
Does that he spelled or
was it w o l. F s. Wolf's.

211
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,240
I Dunno. They'd say everything different
over the old Oregano oil. Oregano.

212
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,090
You know, what else do they
say? Tomato over a Gyno.

213
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,830
Uh, all the spices they
say differently. What's it?

214
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,890
Rose Marie? No, that's not
the one with the flex time.

215
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:26,530
They see the same way.
There's another one.

216
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,590
There's another one that was just the
ones Basel or Rogano Basel two mottoes.

217
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,150
And you just want to be like, stop doing
that. You want to say that they're wrong,

218
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,820
but they did it first. So they were
right. Why the fuck did we switch?

219
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,821
We switched all the accents on everything
and I believe that was a fuck you

220
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,860
right to England

221
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,370
after we kicked their fucking red coated
asses all the way back to their island,

222
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,170
all the way back.

223
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,673
Right.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,570
And I just think that our little rebellion
was not only are we kicking you out

225
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:06,260
of the country that you first
fucking occupied and took over.

226
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,300
Not only will we can send you the
genocide that you started, right.

227
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,490
We're gonna, we're gonna change
the accent on the English language.

228
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,633
Right.

229
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,850
Do you say, uh, automobile?
We're going to say automobile.

230
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,860
I don't know if we do that.
I have no idea. Um, anyways,

231
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,610
uh,
fuck was that

232
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,080
I am up. Goddamn noise is not, I
don't know if I'm going crazy or what.

233
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,200
I will tell you what's driving me fucking
crazy is this year I thought it was

234
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:47,230
being a smart guy. Oh, who's just to, as
a tough guy, he was a smart guy, right?

235
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,150
I went out and I bought a Christmas
tree like when was still November.

236
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,040
Okay.

237
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,401
You know,

238
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:59,020
so now I'm watering this thing and I got
a missed it every God damn morning to

239
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:01,030
make sure it,
it's not all brown and dead.

240
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:05,080
By the time fucking Christmas comes along,
our wreath is on the,

241
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:09,730
on the front door is already dying.
You know that my wife went all out.

242
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:13,150
You know what I mean? Like great
mothers do. She went all out,

243
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:17,560
but I got more goddamn shit. I'm running
around, you know I, I'm the water boy.

244
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,530
I've got a water rate. I missed it.
I'm talking to it. No, you look good.

245
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:20,981
You look good.

246
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:23,380
Now you're going to be one of the
trees that lives after Christmas.

247
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,400
You don't just lying to them
like a fucking dirt bag. Right?

248
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,150
So I didn't have a lot of time the other
day and I'm running around the fucking

249
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:36,151
kitchen table and we got this stupid
fucking potted plant that literally has a

250
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:40,960
concrete plant plant or whatever the,
the fucking house that the roots are in,

251
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:41,860
whatever you call it.
Right.

252
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,190
And that was on the floor because of
the Christmas decorations on the table.

253
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,250
And I ran around the table
and just punted that thing,

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,060
concrete fucking block with my,

255
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,260
my pinky toe on my left foot
and Jesus fucking Christ.

256
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,350
It was like Barney the dinosaur purple
within two hours and it was like a half

257
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:08,310
of my foot by foot look like I got
run over by a car. Now, you know,

258
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,050
obviously I did some damage,
but most of it has to be my, it,

259
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,470
most of it is my complexion,
you know, being uh,

260
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,540
a a fucking, you know, redhead,

261
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,080
I'm borderline like transparent.

262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,370
Like I'm always getting marks on
my body and like late at night,

263
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:32,460
like I go to bed and my wife would be
like, what does that, what does that on?

264
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,020
Yeah. What is, you know,
fucking kilohm mark on my side.

265
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:39,780
Did you get into a fight with an
alley cat? Huh? No, I think I uh,

266
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,520
think I leaned up against
the refrigerator. I Dunno.
What the fuck happened.

267
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,091
And then when,

268
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,550
you know what's weird is if you hurt
yourself and you don't remember what

269
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,890
happened, you press down on
it and then you're like, oh,

270
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:54,450
and he takes you right back
to that moment. Oh, that's
right. That's fucking ride.

271
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,560
Yeah, it was, I was at the, the
fucking poster. Oh, by the way,

272
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,250
Jesus Christ,
I went to the post office.

273
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,460
I was trying to get all my
fucking gifts out and uh,

274
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,590
you can not fucking go there.

275
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,110
The only way you can fucking go
there is if you have everything done.

276
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,340
I went there,
I needed a box and I needed to,

277
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,100
and then I need the fucking, the
peanuts or whatever to put it in there.

278
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:19,670
So what I was,

279
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,970
whatever I was going to put in there was
going to slide around and break and I

280
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,310
need to tape to close the box.
It should just like,

281
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:30,311
it's just that last chopper out of Vietnam
I in and I was happy that I went down

282
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:35,660
there. I found somebody to help
me out. You know, I got the box,

283
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,411
I got the tape,

284
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:40,100
and then they said they had nothing to
put in there to make sure my gifts to my

285
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:45,050
nephews and nieces wouldn't fucking
slide around. And I, I just, I just,

286
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,600
I said, fuck it. I said,
all right, thank you.

287
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,190
I sent the tape down and put
the box where it belonged.

288
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,100
I walked out like a
gentleman while I fucking,

289
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,930
I went a little Tourette's
underneath God damn fucking well,

290
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,870
what the fuck do you have? Fucking
boxes and tape, but you don't have the,

291
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
the last inquiry,
the most important ingredient.

292
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,660
Well, the last piece of
the puzzle, I should say,

293
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,050
the box is probably the most important.
Agree. Well then you have to tape. I mean,

294
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:15,320
they work together like a great
comedy team, dare I say, right?

295
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,470
Like Bob hope and bing Crosby.
They,

296
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,490
the guys who evidently created
the fucking the buddy movie,

297
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,253
you know,

298
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
which has now been hijacked by all these
females and all these movies and acting

299
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,780
like they're breaking ground.
It's like you just doing the shit.

300
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:32,830
We already did this. Nothing
new here ladies. You know,

301
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,750
why don't you reinvent the buddy fucking
movie before I got to listen to your

302
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,060
call on each other. A bunch of fucking
heroes. What do you think about that? Hey,

303
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:40,420
uh,

304
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,420
this is the thing that fascinated me
because I was reading the Celtics Book and

305
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,940
some of the fucking teams that
they were playing, like, you know,

306
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:52,960
playing Syracuse and Rochester
stuff I had heard about before.

307
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,000
But um,

308
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,580
okay.

309
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,650
When they were talking,
what the fuck is this?

310
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,000
They were talking about playing like the,
uh,

311
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,480
what are now the Atlanta Hawks and I
knew that they were in Saint Louis,

312
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,200
but I didn't realize that they
were in Milwaukee before that.

313
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,560
All right, let's see here. At Atlanta
Hawks. Yeah, they were, it, this is,

314
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:22,740
this is their, their history.
They were the buffalo bisons

315
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,090
yeah.

316
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,630
Then for one season and then they moved,
or maybe a half a season.

317
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,670
Then they moved to the tri cities in Iowa,
which are now the quad cities,

318
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,480
I believe.
And they became the Tri city black hawks.

319
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,910
Then they may move to Milwaukee in
1951 and became the Milwaukee Hawks.

320
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,070
Then in 1955, they moved to St Louis
and became the Saint Louis Hawks.

321
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,840
And then in 1968 they moved to uh,

322
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,680
Atlanta and became the Atlanta Hawks.
And they'd been there for 50 years.

323
00:19:57,681 --> 00:20:01,820
But they've moved five times.
And I always thought the Sacramento Kings,

324
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,470
which I can't remember if they were the
Cincinnati royals and then the Kansas

325
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:10,880
City kings and then the Sacramento Kings.
I couldn't remember. Hang on a second.

326
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:11,880
Let me get to this,
cause I got,

327
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:15,500
I got this fucking website here that
has all the franchises that moved,

328
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,860
if I can get it to work here,
please, please. Is People listening?

329
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,490
National Hockey League,
where the fuck is the NBA?

330
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,670
Oh Jesus Christ. Come on national
basketball. So she, the Tri city hawks,

331
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Blackhawks played their home
games in Moline and rock island,

332
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:41,900
Illinois and Davenport, Iowa moved
to Milwaukee, became the hawks,

333
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,230
then in 55 then we'll just St Louis.
Okay.

334
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:50,231
And then the Detroit Pistons with Fort
Wayne Pistons till 1957 Rochester royals

335
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,710
moved to Cincinnati.

336
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:54,870
Okay.

337
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,730
And then where the fuck
did they go from there?

338
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,070
Okay.

339
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,460
Cause this goes year by year. So all
day became the Sacramento Kings. Yeah,

340
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,050
they were the raw Rochester's Seagram's.
What the fuck is that?

341
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:07,980
Yeah.

342
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,280
Anyways, Rob Chester pros and
they became the Rochester royals,

343
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,640
then they move Cincinnati royals,
Kansas City slash Almaha kings,

344
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,790
Kansas City Kings,
Sacramento Kings.

345
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,840
And then I think the Syracuse team moved
to San Diego and became the San Diego

346
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,190
Clippers.
Where the fuck is it?

347
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,780
The Syracuse nationals moved to
Philadelphia and became the 76 is, okay.

348
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,700
So who became the La Clippers?
The San Diego Clippers.

349
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,750
Oh, the buffalo Braves moved to
San Diego and became the clippers.

350
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,830
That's what it is. Oh No, it's the
Rochester royals. I don't know.

351
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:49,720
I'm a fucking nerd.
I love that shit.

352
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,310
Then I go online and see if I can find
a tri cities black hawks tee shirt.

353
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,620
Like they ever fucking sold one of those.

354
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,850
I bet it's a minor league hockey team now.
Tri City.

355
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,493
Come on,

356
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,680
come on bill. You can
write it. Black Hawks

357
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,090
t shirt. Here we go. Somebody makes
it, you know somebody makes it.

358
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,200
Mitchell and ness. Chicago
Blackhawks, Tri city,

359
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:20,690
black hawks.
There it is.

360
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,160
Everyone would like myself would think,
oh,

361
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:27,490
is that where the Chicago
Black Hawks first played? And
they'd be like, oh no, no,

362
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:30,340
no. That's not, that's
not the case. All dead.

363
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,623
MMM.

364
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,060
Okay.

365
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,130
Damn. They got the, they got the dude.
He's just see them all the fucking kid.

366
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:41,950
If they got it where and it
was like 21 fucking years old.

367
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,590
Similar designs. Look at this. They
got all the old ones here anyways.

368
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,600
Trust the process. Yeah. Boy,

369
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,800
I didn't want to know who
the fuck said that. Uh Oh.

370
00:22:56,801 --> 00:23:00,220
There's a cool Lebron one where they make
his beard like the state of California.

371
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,740
Do you realize if the Lakers
don't win it this year,

372
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:04,850
this will be the first decade.

373
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:08,240
They haven't won a fucking
championship since the fucking 1960s

374
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,430
seventies eighties nineties two
thousands they went for decades in a row.

375
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,580
Celtics won 50 60 seventies eighties

376
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:17,860
okay.

377
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,890
Well it went for decades,
right?

378
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,440
It was seventies eighties
nineties 2004 Oh yeah.

379
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,640
No one's ever done five. No one's ever
done five. Can you see, can you tell him?

380
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,710
I'll fucking talked out
from Rogan's podcast.

381
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,300
We did like fucking two and a half hours.

382
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,350
I'm sitting here wondering what
the hell to talk about. I could,

383
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,600
I could read some advertising.

384
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:35,980
Okay.

385
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,550
I could read some advertising. By
the way, I'm not farting continually.

386
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,590
I'm just sitting in a leather chair.
I just realized

387
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:45,980
leather

388
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,360
chair, plush leather chair, one chair,

389
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,220
one chair, my little fucking podcast area
here finally, cause now we have the kid.

390
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:57,530
I can't do it the way I used to
in the fucking bedroom and shit.

391
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,750
Screaming and yelling. We can't
have that bill. We keep pill.

392
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,670
We can't have you be who you
are in your own home anymore.

393
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,260
Butcher box,
everybody butcher box delivers.

394
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,810
That's a great name for like a
fucking female wrestler. Butcher box.

395
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,353
You know,

396
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,000
or finishing move is he jumps up in the
air and it fucking puts her claim in

397
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:20,810
your face.
Yep.

398
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,160
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

399
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:30,161
organic chicken and the fucking mother
of them off the holy grail for all youth

400
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,050
carnivores out their
heritage. Bread, pork,

401
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,720
the incredible, oh my
God, do I love that stuff?

402
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,930
The incredible quality of butcher
box means start with the co,

403
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,190
the commitment starting start with the
commitment to raising animals humanely

404
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:50,480
and free of antibiotics and hormones
telling me look beautiful before they

405
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:54,290
murdered. Cooked with piece of
mind knowing you're eating healthy,

406
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,790
high quality meat.

407
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,780
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

408
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,380
which is enough for 24
individual sized meals.

409
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,210
Even for you size queens out there, you
can choose from five different box types.

410
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,680
All beef, beef and chicken,
beef and pork, mixed box,

411
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,660
custom box.

412
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,710
I feel like the mixed box
is to progressive liberal
box where custom box is more

413
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:24,560
like, you know, hardcore, right?
You know, I only want peace,

414
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,840
uh, in my neighborhood. Let's you,
let's you choose your own God damn cuts.

get together of like, you know,

424

427
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:22,510

428
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,590

party. Yeah, you have to tab one.

00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:32,230
And I just kept putting it off, putting
it off and putting it off. Right.

431
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,690
And then all of a sudden it
was the end of the night,

432
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:38,680
we'd all sit in there
smoking cigars and a,

433
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:43,560
then all of a sudden the night was over
and I didn't drink. Everybody had a time.

434
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,090
And I've almost done it.
I only have a,

435
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,230
I've got a couple more holiday
parties. Oh, I got a tough one.

436
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,200
I got a tough one coming up with
a good friend of mine, comedian.

437
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,570
I'm not going to say what the fuck it
is, but he has, he has a party coming up.

438
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,550
Oh this can be tough and no,
it's not that gutter dweller.

439
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:06,110
Joe De Rosa. Oh Joe Rosa loves
it. Gutter loves it. Gutter.

440
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,680
Yeah,

441
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,520
I know he sees a curb.
He just sees nuzzles up to it.

442
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:14,990
Like he's laying with his own
mother, his own butter. Um,

443
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,920
but anyways, I always get a little bit
sad this time of the holidays, you know,

444
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:22,190
cause I know that it's almost over.
I liked this time of year,

445
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,260
you know where everybody just kind of
sits back cause like, you know what,

446
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:29,060
I fucking love you man fucking
PCH in my life, man. You know,

447
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,200
you know they got the fucking lights.
It's just, he just look around like,

448
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:37,850
why can't it be like this all the time?
Why can't work be like, all right, relax.

449
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,241
You know,

450
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:41,210
and everybody just chills out and just
says how much they like each other.

451
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,040
Why can't we do?
You'd get bored of it,

452
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,950
I guess after a while they
can't have like, you know,

453
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,450
okay.

454
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,800
Sort of a summer, Christmas time,
holiday, Hanukkah, Kwanza fucking thing.

455
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,360
You gotta wait once a once a fucking
year that it starts all over again.

456
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,520
January 2nd or January 3rd of this
has gotta be this company's biggest

457
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,430
quarter ever. Where did you
all a buckle down and not go?

458
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,690
You will not see your children

459
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,740
when you leave for work.

460

Y'All be sleeping when you
come home and he'll be asleep.

461
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,680
You'll be a stranger and you're rolling.

462
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,450
So his share, we could sell them. I
was wet jets we've ever saw error.

463
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,130
I'll tell you right now, if you
got a problem, there's door.

464
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,330
The Internet has made this industry
more competitive than it's ever been.

465
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,890
That's rob. You got to cry, Maggie.

466
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,290
Huh? Who else? What about you?

Jewel fucking box of tampons
for the first fucking court.

469
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,910
Where did you do less last quarter?
You didn't check.

470
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,800
You know, can you imagine if
you had that fucking life?

471
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,750
Just imagine that fucking life getting
yelled at. You know, you don't have to.

472
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:17,750
That famous scene in Glengarry Glen Ross,

473
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,970
Alec Baldwin comes in and starts yelling
at people. I can't fucking hear myself.

474
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,410
God Damn it. I got to get this fixed. Um,

475
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,320

great stocking stuffer.

481
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,300
which you wouldn't know from that last
little comedy skit that I did there.

482
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,530
And by the way, that was all written
up. I memorized all those lights. Um,

483

I just feel like that just to be
a performer isn't enough for me.

546
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,850
I feel like I should be this vessel.

547
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,220
Who is it? Come on in. Oh,

556
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,960
The two most beautiful ladies in my life.
How are you?

557
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,850
I've been bitching about this
3.5 millimeter male to female,

558
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,630
a headphone Jack. And I finally got
it fixed. What did you guys do today?

559
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,463
We just

560
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:51,220
ingredients for Christmas dinner.
What are you gonna make?

561
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,050
Um, am I plugged in? Yes.
You were plugged in. Uh,

562
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,260
we're gonna make lamb. So I
got a rack of lamb. Oh, nice.

563
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,530
And I had them cut it up and we're just
going to freeze it until it's ready

564
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,620
because it's going to be a mad
house when we go on Christmas Eve.

565
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,020
Or can you say strawberry?

566

Can you say football?
Can you say hi?

567
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,770
Can't say merry Christmas.
I don't know.

568
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,790
She could say that. Wow, I'm here.

569
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,890
I know how to keep you occupied
while we're in here. All right,

570
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,220
well we're just doing something.
I didn't realize I hit all these debts,

571
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:33,770
that script I'm writing so I get
up. What's this? Oh, those are,

572
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,680
those are dad's keys.
He said Daddy's keys.

573
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,590
You say dad does car,
car

574
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,600
is getting fixed.

575
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,660
I hit an orange cone in my car and all
of a sudden the engine when I was on the

576
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:51,601
highway,

577
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:55,380
and this is random orange cone and I
couldn't swerve away from it or cause an

578
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:55,801
accident.

579
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:59,190
So I just drove over and went underneath
the car and I was getting off the

580
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:01,060
highway and it was,
I just heard it under the car.

581
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,350
Minnie mouse.
You want to go watch many mouths?

582
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:13,170
Huh? What do you say?
Oh, she does a football.

583
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,850
Football. What'd he say? You
say please? Now what he say?

584
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,790
Hey Danks please. And thanks. That's why
you're going to be a good kid. Oh. Oh,

585
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:24,810
I get a kiss. Your Mama and
Mama? Yeah, she's the best. Hey,

586
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:29,670

the best Ma. Oh my God.

587
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:38,850
Sounds about Minnie mouse.
Okay. Just don't mess.

588
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,400
That's you. That's you. Yes
it is. Yes it is. All right.

589
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:45,370
We've got to wrap this thing up
because I want to play with you, Kiddo.

590
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,150
All right.
And we're gonna Watch some football.

591
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,520
Football strawberries.
Yeah.

592
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,310
Hey, what does the dog
say? What was the duck say?

593
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,230
What does the cow say? Moo. Moo.

594
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,030
So she talks like Trump,
the biggest, uh, brain. Uh,

595

599
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,460
All right. You're a smarty. Well,

600
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:34,860
you just shrug the shoulders like
that was nothing. That was like,

601
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:38,390
give me something hard. So
we go. Should we say bye bye.

602
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,030
Say Bye Bye Daddy.
Say I love you

603
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,700
again since I always say I love
you. Is Nan, Nan, Nan, Nan,

604
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,870
you could say it. Say I
love you. There you go.

605
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,500
All right.

606
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,750
Eventually you're going to put that
together and melt my heart even more.

607
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:01,720
All right. I love Pulte guys, but
I gotta wrap this up. Hey you guys,

608
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:05,830
thank you for listening. Have a great
week and I can't say what I usually say.

609
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,770
So Merry Christmas.

610
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,300
Enjoy the music and an extra
half hour bonus of the uh,

611
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,990
Thursday afternoon just before Friday.
Thank you to Joe Rogan.

612
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,510
Sure.
Magnolia blossom.

613
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,460
Don't care.

614
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,810
Adult to hang up. Just suck

615
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,490
it up.
You fucking

616
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,830
and your bucket.

617
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,500
Christmas fucking trees all be Dolby.
See,

618
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:28,710
that's the fucking song I was trying to
remember from last week and I want to

619
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:32,970
thank all the podcast
listeners for letting me know
that that was Andy Williams.

620
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,290
Happy holiday slash the
holiday sick season.

621
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,080
It's not until the second
verse where he goes,

622
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:44,000
Whoop de Doo and Hump Day dot.
Bad.

623
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,270
Stick up a sock,

624
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,990
but buck and crazy twat and you
don't see it exactly how I said it.

625
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:53,340
And then they had those fucking
women in the background. Uber Dooby,

626
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,990
dooby Ba boom.

627
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,150
You telling me you couldn't
write a fucking song back
then? I mean, Jesus Christ.

628
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,210
Maybe because it's so simple. It sounds
so simple that you think you could do it.

629
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:10,010
I don't know. So anyways, it is. Oh fuck.

630
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:10,761
Why did I play that?

631
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:13,250
And I want to be singing at the
whole God damn podcast again.

632
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:17,480
I don't like to repeat myself least
not on purpose. What's going on?

633
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,960
It's bill burr. It is the Monday
morning podcast for Monday, uh,

634
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,860
December 20th.
Oh my God.

635
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:29,810
Only five more days till Christmas. I
only have half. Shut up. You fucking,

636
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,470
yeah. All right. I'm not
even this angry week.

637
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,470
I'm just trying to figure out how I'm
going to situate myself on the bed.

638
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,600
I don't want to put my laptop in my lap.
You know what I made? Why would you,

639
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,470
why won't you put it in your lip?
It's called the lip dupe. Um,

640
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,690
this is why, because it gives off
radiation. And I liked my balls.

641
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,740
I think the Illuminati came
up with the laptop, you know,

642
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,610
and they know we're too stupid to stick
it exactly where they want us to put it

643
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:02,010
so they can find out the fucking
heard. So they go, you know,

644
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,670
with their evil voices,
whether we just collected laptop,

645
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,420
we call it didn't let up these put
it in their lap and they fucking die.

646
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,470
The infidels, that was
half Arab, half Italian.

647
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:15,650
So make sure I get notes from both of you.
Um,

648
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,290
yes it is December 20th.

649
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:22,970
I just came off of a
fabulous week out in Bray,

650
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,130
California and I want to
tell you guys something.

651
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:30,131
If you're ever in a situation where you
have a lot of vacation time and you just

652
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:34,490
like, fuck, where the
hell can I go? You know,

653
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,320
you only go around once in this world,

654
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,920
where can I go to vacation to summer is
not one rich people say we live in the

655
00:42:43,581 --> 00:42:46,550
city and we somewhere out in the Hamptons.

656
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,770
I'd love to summer somewhere. Would
that be awesome? Jesus Christ.

657
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:54,500
How much fucking money do you
have to have? They have two homes.

658
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,920
This is where I live during the year.

659
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:02,921
And then I summer we spend a
linters down and boom Bados

660
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,960
doing what? Visiting the fucking money
that you're not paying tax taxes on.

661
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,310
You know, I don't give a fuck. I didn't
know what I'm talking about here.

662
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,050
I was on to something there and then I
completely lost it because I thought I

663
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,520
wasn't recording here. Um, oh, I know.

664
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,430
I was out in Bray California this
weekend and I got to tell you,

665
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,270
I had a miserable experience the
last couple of times that went there.

666
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,210
And the only reason why it was
miserable is because nobody showed up.

667
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,980
And Lo and behold,

668
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,910
this time I came out there and the
fucking place was packed all weekend and I

669
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:38,630
had one of the best
weekends of, uh, of 2010.

670
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:43,490
So I want to thank everybody
who came out to my shows, uh,

671
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,650
out at the Improv in Bray California.

672
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,550
Actually had some people
from La came out and a,

673
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:52,400
I had like 12 Mexicans,

674
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,740
different Mexican fans coming up saying
you have some Latino fence. Okay,

675
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,280
hang in there.
We will spread the word out to Ontario.

676
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,880
So I want to thank you guys.
Grassiness Julie word.

677
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:09,170
I know moo chose grassiness Rosetta stone.

678
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,880
I'm a Rio.
Um,

679
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,420
that's how you thank you very much. And
yellow. That's my only Spanish words.

680
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,800
Ay. Caramba yeah, Shit like
that, that I've seen in like
cartoons when I was a kid.

681
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,930
Um,
so anyways,

682
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,000
I don't know what the fuck to talk about
this week because uh, I am technically,

683
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:33,180
I'm on vacation.
Like Axel Foley had Beverly Hills Cop.

684
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:34,560
I'm not investigating anything.

685
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:38,670
I'm out here in La with my
Mumford fucking sweatshirt.

686
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,660
You know what I realized? I just
realized this podcast is going to suck.

687
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,890
You know why I have too much other
shit on my mind because as much as I'm

688
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:50,190
mocking people who haven't started
this shopping, I'm one of those people.

689
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,260
I haven't started it yet.

690
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:57,330
And it really fucked up because
I did like six weekends in a row.

691
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:02,280
So I just focused on the roadwork and
I did not deal with the fact that I

692
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:04,620
haven't done any sort of
Christmas shopping yet.

693
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,940
So now I have to go out there
today it's fucking raining.

694
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,410
I've been in this weather since I went
to Seattle right after Thanksgiving and

695
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:17,370
I'm ready to blow my fucking brains out
and went to Seattle and I also went to

696
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:20,460
San Francisco. It all those fucking
assholes would just like, oh you bring,

697
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:24,030
you bring the bed where the with you?
You know, I don't, I don't know. It was,

698
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:25,950
it was great last week.
So you know what,

699
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,990
considering I bought the droid phone.
Does anybody know how to shut that off?

700
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:36,180
[inaudible] every time you turn it on
my phone says that I brought the droid

701
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,010
incredible.
And every time I turn it on,

702
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,670
first of all it takes 10 minutes for it
to turn on. And then about, you know,

703
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,740
eight minutes in it goes drilling mud

704
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,860
and I don't think there's
a way to shut it off.

705
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,930
That's one of those
fucking advertising things.

706
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,410
Make It nice and loud and obnoxious.

707
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,970
So everyone around we'll hear it and be
like, Ooh, I want my phone to do that.

708
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,670
All right.
I'm still waiting for that.

709
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:03,960
Like I hope that phone does not take
over as much as I love it cause uh,

710
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,490
I fly too much,
you know,

711
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,880
and at the end of the flights when it's
okay to turn your cell phones back on,

712
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,590
I don't want to hear like draw, draw,
draw, draw void on the fucking plane, put,

713
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:17,850
you know, I'm going to, um,
but anyways, yeah, I haven't,

714
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:21,110
I haven't started any of my
Christmas shopping and uh,

715
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,140
I don't want to be that Douche just
goes out and gets the gift certificates.

716
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,060
You know that, you know that person, you
go out, you buy him something thoughtful.

717
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:33,540
What are they into? A, what did I hear?

718
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,820
A mention that they wanted
or something like that.

719
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:38,550
And you put a lot of thought and you
drive around now that isn't right.

720
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,810
Drive over here that isn't right. Bam. And
then you find it, they're like, ah man,

721
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:44,490
thanks a lot.
Right.

722
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,010
And they give you like a fucking,
yeah.

723
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:52,740
You waiting to see what they got you
right. Do you put some thought in?

724
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,850
Do you feel this way about me too?
And what do they do?

725
00:46:56,851 --> 00:47:00,870
They hand you a gift certificate to
the fucking olive garden. You know,

726
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,500
it's like you fucking
asshole. How, you know,

727
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,980
I drove all over fucking
town and you just, you just,

728
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,170
and not even a good restaurant. That's
an, that's another thing too. Um,

729
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,800
if somebody gives you a gift certificate
to a restaurant, don't fucking go.

730
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,140
Don't even fucking go.
All right.

731
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:22,920
What sort of respectable restaurant
gives out gift certificates?

732
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,560
You know what I mean? That's, that's
just like one step above fast food.

733
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,740
You know what Douche bag of the week is?

734
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:35,860
Anybody who goes out and does Christmas
shop and it just gets a bunch of fucking

735
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:39,070
gift certificates. Hey you go, you fucking
figure out what you want is some money.

736
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,430
Why don't you just come in and take a
fucking handful of cash and throw it on

737
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:42,881
the floor,

738
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:46,450
like have some goddamn whore and watched
me crawl around on my hands and knees

739
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:50,650
picking it up. You know, like I
just gave you a bad lap dance,

740
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,130
but you got enough money to not bitch to
management. Hey, you'll have the really,

741
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:56,050
that's what I get is have fucking hundred.

742
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,840
Don't spend it all in one place.
All right,

743
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,020
you fucking cheap bastards.

744
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:10,021
I'm talking to you and you and you just
gotta be at least three people on this

745
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:14,380
podcast that do that shit.
You fucking tight fucks.

746
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,360
Right?
And then what do you do?

747
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:20,380
You gather up all your nice gifts that
people put thought into and you just,

748
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,390
you know, walk out of the house. You
know, you don't give a fuck, right?

749
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,560
Fuck it. Right. It's
just the drinking water.

750
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,130
We can pour the shit in there.
Well that kept me the corner office.

751
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:35,741
I swear to God,

752
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:40,090
if somebody gets me a fucking
gift certificate this weekend,

753
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:43,750
I'm going to do some of the not, this is
Christmas this weekend. Five days away.

754
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:47,140
Yeah, it'd be Saturday. I'm going to take
that fucking thing. Oh, thanks a lot.

755
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:50,650
And I'm going to slice the
juggler like James Bond level,

756
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:55,570
fucking paper cut and just watch that
blood right off the side of the fucking

757
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,630
neck. All right, so you
learned something about me.

758
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,490
You already knew I was an angry son of
a bitch, but I hate gift certificates.

759
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,600
I can't stand them.

760
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:10,620
I would rather get an ugly sweater
from an older relative then.

761
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:14,110
Then, then a fucking gift certificate.
That's just, you know, he did.

762
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,970
That's just the fucking tap out.
You know shorty,

763
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:23,020
man, it'd be really busy. Oh really? Oh,
I've been laying in a hammock all year.

764
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:25,360
You Lazy. Fuck no, you don't give a shit.

765
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,620
Why am I such a fucking Dick?

766
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,540
Somebody I knew every year would get me
a fucking gift certificate and you know,

767
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,050
I should have just gave it
right back to them. I never did.

768
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:40,810
I always gave him a nice gift thinking,
Nah, you're gonna, you're going to notice,

769
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:45,070
right? Nothing. Nothing.

770
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,680
Oh, we shit. All right. There you go.
This your first ran for the week to them.

771
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:52,940
Make you feel better. I'd like
to hear the why. Why do I have,

772
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,030
why don't have a podcast
where I give thanks.

773
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:59,860
I give thanks to everyone who came
out to my shows this year. You know,

774
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:04,861
I give thanks to the universe for allowing
me to fuck up enough in my personal

775
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:08,530
life to bless me with an
a new hour of material.

776
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,470
I've got to tell you, man, my fucking act
is right where I needed to be. And, uh,

777
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,450
my next Gig is until, uh, the
weekend, I believe of January 13th.

778
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,730
Um,
I'm going to be in Atlantic city with a,

779
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:29,330
this is the show. Jim Norton put this
thing together. It's Jim Norton, myself,

780
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,410
Jim Breuer, and David tell all on
one show. All right, the Miami Heat,

781
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,520
the Mount Rushmore, if you
will, of a, of standup,

782
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,600
a standup comedy. I can't see Mount
Rushmore. That'd be all time. Great.

783
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:43,880
So let's go with Miami Heat.
All right,

784
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,460
let's go with that. How about we say
that? So anyways, that's my next show.

785
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:51,680
So I have this weird thing
where I'm off for like a month,

786
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,000
but I also have to stay sharp.

787
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:57,200
So my girls all excited that I have a
month off and I'm actually doing a show

788
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:02,180
tonight
and I was trying to tell her that I,

789
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:06,050
I have to stay sharp, you
know, I got to stay on my toes.

790
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,550
I can't just sit around
fucking roasted chestnuts.

791
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,740
Does anybody do that anymore?
That anybody ever had a chestnuts?

792
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,910
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,

793
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,170
Jack Frost nipping at your news.

794
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,460
There's no internet or
fucking cell phones,

795
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:30,110
so we have to talk to one another.
Um,

796
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,240
all right. What, you know,
something, something I mentioned,

797
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:35,060
they're actually tied into something
that somebody was talking about. Oh,

798
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:39,200
they were talking about die hard fans.
I'm talking about sports here.

799
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:41,450
Somebody said a bill,
just like the Yankees,

800
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,200
the Celtics purchased the last
championship with Kevin Garnett.

801
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,990
I love when people do half ass research.
You know,

802
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,070
didn't you forget a couple other
guys that we also bought? Um,

803
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,590
it's not, it's not even the purchasing
of Garnette that bothers me.

804
00:51:57,591 --> 00:52:02,540
It's the delusion Boston's fans have
when they cheer for Garnette that

805
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:05,240
motherfucker kissed the shamrock
in the center of the court.

806
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:08,120
Like it was his homecoming,
like he was from Boston.

807
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:13,150
Like he yearned for playing for that
team and Boston's fans ate that shit up.

808
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,910
Totally bought into that shit.
Uh,

809
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:21,080
when in actuality it was just
another purchase for a championship.

810
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,210
How do you feel knowing your
fellow Bostonians got duped? Uh,

811
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:30,020
the bowl shifts fan base I see in
Boston makes me want to puke in my soup.

812
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:35,600
And it happens in a bunch of
other cities to, uh, sorry, I,

813
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:38,270
I can't read out loud and I'm also
reading this at a fucking angle.

814
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,770
Let's get some fucking stomach cancer
here. Put the laptop here. Uh, where was,

815
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,410
where was I, I you have die
hard fans for all your teens,

816
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:50,120
but they're few and far in between few
and far between service. How you say that?

817
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:50,961
Uh,

818
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:53,780
then you have just a bunch of stragglers
who suddenly come out of the woodwork

819
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:56,330
when their teams on top.
I live in New York and now in La,

820
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:59,300
in the past eight years I've
noticed an influx influx of pats,

821
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,070
fans and both of those cities.

822
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,970
All of a sudden everyone is
proud to be a patriots fan. Uh,

823
00:53:04,971 --> 00:53:08,870
where were these fucks in the 90s?
Same goes for Laker fans.

824
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:13,150
Where would those assholes with
the flag on the car asked uh,

825
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,070
with the flag in the car?
Assholes in the 90s explained this to me,

826
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:18,860
Bill and go ahead and shit on as
many front running New Yorkers,

827
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,580
Los Angelenos in Miami, schmucks
all you like. Yeah. Yeah. Dude.

828
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:27,180
You're basically explaining uh, yeah,

829
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,300
that's how it works.
Yeah.

830
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:32,850
Where were all the Yankee
fans in the 80s exactly.

831
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,300
You can't say where were all the patriots
fans in the 90s because once we got

832
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:38,490
bill Parcells,
everybody jumped on board.

833
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:43,850
And then when Pete Carroll came in after
parcels fucked us that fat fuck that

834
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:50,031
fat fuck Egomaniac who never won a
championship without bill Belicheck as his

835
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:54,110
defensive coordinator. Who is you
will be to cook to do, do you go,

836
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:55,290
there'll be buy the groceries.

837
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,830
He says that right before our Superbowl
puts his fucking house up for sale.

838
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:02,250
What a cunt fucking were overrated bill.

839
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:06,900
Parcells if you want your uniforms
changed and you want to make it to the

840
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:11,100
playoffs, he's your guy. But if you
want to win the Super Bowl, you got,

841
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:15,440
you better have bill Bella check on
your staff. All right, yet I yeah,

842
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:19,230
you Bandwagon Fence Bandwagon fans are,
are uh,

843
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,880
the majority of the fan base.

844
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,190
There's no reason to build
stadiums as big as they are.

845
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:27,480
If they're actually talking about diehard
fans, you'd only need like a one level,

846
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,070
you know, you could have those old school
like high school stadiums, you know,

847
00:54:32,071 --> 00:54:36,750
with a wind whip through the end
zones. Uh, yeah, absolutely. That's,

848
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:40,980
everybody is guilty of
that. And, um, basketball,

849
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:45,180
I hate to say it has followed what the,
uh,

850
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,030
what baseball has been doing,
where you just sort try to buy the,

851
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,350
buy the championship every year
and it's really a free agency.

852
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,480
I guess it's kind of the player's fault.
You know what it was,

853
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,830
it was an overcorrection.
It was before free agency,

854
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,990
you know, the owners were
like the owner in, um,

855
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,350
what does that call the perfect stallion?
What the fuck's that?

856
00:55:06,351 --> 00:55:11,130
I can never mean Robert Redford movie,
the natural perfect stallion.

857
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:15,540
How the fuck did I get?
I can't remember. Shit.

858
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,150
I can never remember the names
of actors in movies. So I just,

859
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:22,050
whatever the first thing I think of,
I just fucking throw it out there. Uh,

860
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:26,280
the natural, yeah, the owners
were like that. They totally
fucking owns you. And um,

861
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,330
that's why the fucking white sox
through the world series in 1919,

862
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,690
that's what opened the door to that is
they were getting so underpaid and they

863
00:55:33,691 --> 00:55:37,380
were scumbag pieces of shit.
Those two fucking thanks. Um,

864
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,460
so that free agency came around
and now there's been like a total

865
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,980
overcorrection.
Um,

866
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:52,550
and the players are seem to be completely
in control and they can just all pile

867
00:55:53,241 --> 00:55:56,370
on one fucking team. I don't know. I
don't like it. I don't like it. Yeah.

868
00:55:56,371 --> 00:56:00,030
The Celtics bought the championship.
Abso-Fucking-Lutely uh, but you know,

869
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:01,980
it's one of those deals. What are
they supposed to do? That's what the,

870
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,960
the Lakers were buying them too. You
know, what are we supposed to do?

871
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:09,930
Sit back and watch them by all these
fucking championships and we're not

872
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:13,530
supposed to go out and purchase one.
You know,

873
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:16,020
Coby Brian sitting out
there can't win shit.

874
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:18,090
So they buy him Shaq and Phil Jackson.

875
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,010
Fucking Gary Payton,
Robert Henri fucking Malone.

876
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:29,170
Who else? I don't watch hoop. Every time
I turn it on, there's another fucking guy,

877
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:34,010
the guy who beat up the crowd,
Ron, our test, that guy. What?

878
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,240
What, what, what the fuck are the
Celtics supposed to do? You know,

879
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:42,100
it'd be nice if they all sat down and
just said, look, this is fucking stupid.

880
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,160
Let's go back to the way it was. But I
just think that that's the way it is.

881
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,440
So anyways, yeah, they just pile on.

882
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,340
I think Garnette kiss the floor because
he was sick of playing in Minnesota and

883
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,730
he knew we finally had a chance to,
uh,

884
00:56:55,090 --> 00:57:00,090
to win a championship after be in the
fucking guy for all those years out there

885
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:05,860
in Minnesota and always coming up short.
So I don't know.

886
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,550
I don't fucking, I don't know. I don't
know shit about basketball, but yeah,

887
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,190
you're basically yet diehard fans,
diehard fans hang in there. But uh,

888
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,220
I even think diehard fans of full of Shit,

889
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,850
there's a couple that will
actually sit there. Come on man.

890
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:20,350
You're going to be honest with you.
I'm a die hard fan.

891
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:25,060
Your team is going to end 14. You're
actually sitting down watching that shit.

892
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,520
You know, sometimes you such a die hard
fan, you can't go. You can't watch,

893
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,990
you know, I didn't watch the Celtics. I
went to a Celtics game the year before.

894
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:39,010
We bought all those guys
to win a championship. We
played the Toronto Raptors.

895
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:43,180
I had like court side fucking seats and
I almost fell asleep and it was just sad

896
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,380
looking at the parquet floor and looking
at the shamrock and just seeing it was,

897
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,530
it was, you know, it was hard to watch.

898
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,500
That doesn't mean I don't love
the Celtics, but you know,

899
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,680
sometimes you got to look away and
you know what, you fucking cunt,

900
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,640
you do the same thing. Stuck. Act
like you're all high and mighty.

901
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:06,760
You just hate the Patriots and
you're sick of seeing them.

902
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,580
Be honest with yourself.
All you sports fans,

903
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:14,670
who the fuck ever saw anybody in a sports
bar with the New Orleans Saints Jersey

904
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:18,700
on ever 30 years of watching football?

905
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,020
I never fucking saw it.

906
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:24,580
And then last year there's like a whole
gang of them going, who dat? Who Dat?

907
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,140
Who Dat? They going to beat
them saints. It's like,

908
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:33,940
where the fuck did you guys come from?
The sates were borderline.

909
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,110
They will like an expansion
franchise for like 40 years.

910
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,950
They couldn't even afford a
kicker with two whole feet.

911
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,700
They had a kicker with one and a
half fucking feet. That's, that's,

912
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,020
that's how fucking broke those guys were,
you know,

913
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,950
then they brought that football out there
with the helium in there so they could

914
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:57,900
have a feel good story.
Oh, by the way, um,

915
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,530
did you see how the jets,
when they got busted for cheating,

916
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,980
that fucking fag on the jets go with
the Patriots are doing it to that right

917
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:15,781
there is known as a pulling
a Coby when you do that shit.

918
00:59:16,691 --> 00:59:19,630
That's called the shack
fucks around on his wife too.

919
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,900
You know when you're down at the
police dude, you don't ever do that.

920
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,320
All right.
When you get busted for some shit,

921
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,530
you go into mister blonde mode,

922
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,440
you shut your fucking mouth and
you'd do your God damn time.

923
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:36,320
You don't start dragging other people in.
It was so passive aggressive.

924
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,450
I'm not trying to get anybody
in trouble. I've just, you know,

925
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,090
if you just look at the tape,
I mean it's all there,

926
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,490
which was such a stupid, there's no
rule against lining up people there.

927
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:48,140
You can stand on the sideline,

928
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,750
you can all stand there doing
hand stands if you want.

929
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,690
That's not what he got
busted for your green cunt.

930
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,630
He got busted for sticking
your fucking knee out

931
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,870
evidently on purpose.
How wrong was,

932
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,370
I tried to be nice last week and I
defended that Douche and it turns out, uh,

933
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,183
I dunno.

934
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,750
I like how they tried to act like that
was his decision and his decision alone.

935
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,290
That guy actually, he shut that guy.
The strength and conditioning coach.

936
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:19,280
That guy a solid guy. Cause he just, he
took, he took the blame for that one.

937
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,020
The strength and conditioning
coach. He the only guy, he's,

938
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:25,940
he's the guy like as far as moneymakers,

939
01:00:25,941 --> 01:00:30,320
he's just above a fucking cheerleader and
he's saying like, he's on the sideline.

940
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:35,270
Hey listen guys, everybody fucking
line up the private over there.

941
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:38,570
They're blaming the private, you
know, give me a fucking break.

942
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,830
But I think sticking his knee
out was definitely his decision.

943
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,090
But as far as lining up on, on, on the
side, I don't give a fuck. So I love it.

944
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:50,390
So the jets cheated and this week the
panthers had somebody get up and drills,

945
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,960
drill, someone coming down the sidelines.
See this is what it's all coming out.

946
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:54,794
I love it.

947
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,070
After all these years of people saying
the Patriots and cheaters like no one

948
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:58,904
else is doing it.

949
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,310
Like the Yankees weren't all taken
fucking roids [inaudible] along with the

950
01:01:04,311 --> 01:01:05,750
fucking red.
Everybody cheats.

951
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,960
You guys watch that 30 for 30 on Smu
and how the entire southwest conference

952
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,240
football was played.

953
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,370
I hate to say it during the week of
Christmas, but there's no Santa Claus.

954
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:24,290
Everybody fucking cheats.
Everybody Cheats Booboo, booboo.

955
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:26,510
What song is that?
Remember that from fucking sesame street.

956
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:31,640
Everybody sleeps and they'd show like
turtles sleeping and you'd sit there

957
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:35,810
almost tearing up, not even knowing what
the fuck you were crying about. You know,

958
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:36,650
cause you already knew it.

959
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:41,240
You could sense it even as a six year old
that the world was going to be full of

960
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:45,530
a bunch of selfish cons. Hey,
you know something? I have
a video for you this week.

961
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:50,480
How many fucking agonizing minutes am I
into this podcast? 22 fucking minutes.

962
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,041
Jesus Christ.

963
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,730
I gotta be honest with you
people sometimes this podcast
is easy and other times

964
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:59,000
I feel like I'm shoveling.
What snow. And uh,

965
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:02,960
this is one of these times I feel
like I'm shoveling. What fucking snow?

966
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:09,230
Uh, I'm sick of talking about football. I
can't talk about it any fucking more. Uh,

967
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,600
thank you to a Green Bay,

968
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:14,900
Wisconsin though I do want to say thank
you for that Christmas gift for allowing

969
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:17,300
us to win that game that we
shouldn't have one yesterday.

970
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,010
And do you guys realize,

971
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:24,080
actually bet the Patriots after telling
you guys all given 14 and a half fucking

972
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:27,450
points,
I bought into the hype.

973
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:32,010
You know what a moron all year. I've been
saying, I hate our fucking difference.

974
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,980
Our defense, let's up 24 to
30 points every fucking game.

975
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:38,520
We have two good weeks in a row.
I even said last week on the podcast,

976
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,070
you think I'm buying into this shit.
Like we're going to win a super bowl.

977
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,090
You don't just play two good games in
a row and fucking wipe out 11 bad ones.

978
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:49,320
And after say an all of that,
what do I do?

979
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:53,660
I fucking bet the Patriots because
they're fucking quarterback was out.

980
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,810
And I'm a fan of Lsu. I don't ever
remember that guy fucking doing anything.

981
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:02,130
You know what it was that guy played
at Lsu right before started watching

982
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:06,600
college football. But my experience of
watching Lsu is they have fucking, uh,

983
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,800
they always have two quarterbacks,
a white dude and a black dude.

984
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,730
And they should, they just sorta, I
don't know what they though. They just a,

985
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:19,110
they just switch them off and it's not
the same guys every, every fucking year.

986
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:22,980
They got a new white dude, new
black dude, and they just, uh,

987
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,720
put the white guy in there. I
used too fucking white. Look at,

988
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,630
I'm taking that sec sick. The
black guy in there. Jesus Christ.

989
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:33,420
He won't stand in the pocket.
Get the white guy back in there.

990
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,620
I'll tell you if they could somehow
Amalga just stick those two guys together.

991
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:40,890
Add it probably wouldn't work.

992
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,340
I know it worked for Paul Mccartney
and Michael Jackson when they sang that

993
01:03:45,341 --> 01:03:48,690
fucking song.
Was that one of the worst songs ever?

994
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:53,050
Wait a minute. Was that him who
sang? Ebony and ivory. Okay.

995
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,330
That was them, right. I was thinking
of Eddie Murphy and he made it.

996
01:03:57,331 --> 01:04:00,440
Stevie wonder and Frank Sinatra.
That was the sketch. Yeah.

997
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,280
Was that one of the
worst fucking songs ever?

998
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:07,800
Ebony and a movie.

999
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,320
Somebody looked at the piano and just
came up with that corn ball shit.

1000
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,260
You know what I mean? It's like, yeah,
we all want everybody to get along,

1001
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,370
but do you have to try to make
us throw up in the process?

1002
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:28,030
Okay.
Why is happy shit so nauseated?

1003
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:32,840
Can anybody explain that to me during
the week of fucking Christmas, you know?

1004
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,143
Okay.

1005
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,890
What is it about watching like a kid
trip and fall and start crying and then

1006
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:42,900
looking for his mother? What is it about
that that's so fucking funny. Okay.

1007
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:47,820
You know when they get up and they're
crying so bad that they're not even making

1008
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:52,480
any noise.
Yeah.

1009
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,520
It just fucking makes me laugh.
You know,

1010
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,690
watching my dog gets so excited
that it wants to go outside and,

1011
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,160
and it goes to make us quick.
You know,

1012
01:05:03,161 --> 01:05:07,360
fucking Barry Sanders cut and its legs
front legs go up from underneath them and

1013
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,160
I hear him hit his jaw off the floor,

1014
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:15,620
gets up and fucking does that
little Harlem shake to try to,

1015
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,820
it's just fucking funny.
I don't know what it is.

1016
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:22,750
Maybe because I grew up watching
the three stooges. I don't know why,

1017
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:26,920
but watching, uh, watching
people fuck up makes me smile.

1018
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:31,360
What is wrong with me? I really am
destined to be alone. Um, all right,

1019
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:35,800
speaking of Christmas, um, last
week I made the mistake of,

1020
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:40,801
I told you I bought a different kind of
Christmas tree for the holiday season.

1021
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:45,750
Whoop de Doo be Doo. Um, I dunno,

1022
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,690
the past couple of years just
to, just to, you know, for,

1023
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:52,090
for new listeners this week, you know,
I don't know what happened. I just,

1024
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:55,090
I at last couple of years I went there
and I looked at these Christmas trees and

1025
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:55,924
they would like,

1026
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,460
they will like symmetrical and
there would be like, you know,

1027
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:04,420
six inches a tree trunk and then they'd
have like these perfectly level branches.

1028
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:09,400
I just thought they look bad ass like
that Japanese gardens sorta zen look and

1029
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:13,840
shit. And I loved it and I thought
that, you know, I thought, you know,

1030
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,430
I knew I was going to get shit,

1031
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,480
but I thought at least a couple of
people would come out of the woodwork and

1032
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:23,560
dare to break fucking tradition.
Let's read some of these, uh,

1033
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,240
these uplifting comments here. Uh, Bill,

1034
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,360
this guy tried to write day
yum and he spelled damn yum,

1035
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:36,280
da m y u m damn yum bill.

1036
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:37,960
That is Charlie Brown's tree.

1037
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,770
Looks more like an
anorexic Lohan then thrown.

1038
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,660
All Right, Nice Tree Dick. And
he see, this is what it's like.

1039
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:49,390
You guys want to get into entertainment.
This is what you get all week.

1040
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:53,320
This is pretty much the tone. Every once
in a while, a great special. I loved it.

1041
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:57,190
But other than that, that tree makes
the peanuts crew look like ballers.

1042
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:05,310
I would rather decorate my coat rack
then that's Skank shrub Jesus Christ.

1043
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,920
Somebody wrote,
this is the soundtrack to that tree.

1044
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:11,380
I don't get Internet in this
fucking room for some reason,

1045
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:15,040
so I can't click on that. Uh,
looks like a used up toilet brush.

1046
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,020
Uh, it looks like the tree, the tree,

1047
01:07:20,021 --> 01:07:23,740
the three stooges would have thrown other
picture up when you throw the lights

1048
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:27,850
on it. Oh look at that. And I
liked that one. That's a twofer.

1049
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:33,220
Made Fun of the fucking tree and
made fun of my bare walls. Um,

1050
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:37,150
yeah. People, you got a glimpse of how I
live my life. This is why I'm debt free.

1051
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:41,590
I enjoy enjoying your credit card
debt. You can't, I know how to live.

1052
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,910
I buy a Christmas tree. I can
actually afford. All right. Uh, yeah,

1053
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:52,630
you probably should have got the other
tree. What are you a fag? I like it.

1054
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,100
I wanted a Charlie Brown tree.

1055
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:57,640
I was going to buy a real tree
and cut off half the branches.

1056
01:07:57,641 --> 01:08:02,110
So it was like Charlie Brown tree and my
girl went out and bought one herself so

1057
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,770
she could say it's hers and
I can't cut it up. Okay.

1058
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:07,630
It's like I was kind of
like kind of on my side.

1059
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:09,910
So what does that 20 against one for me?

1060
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,420
Looks like a cell phone tower in disguise.

1061
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,110
Jesus. I'm getting killed
here. All right. Uh,

1062
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,660
let me see something. Everybody's
just going, Charlie Brown on me here.

1063
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,410
What do we got? Do it. I was
generally excited to see your tree.

1064
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:32,360
Where did you pick it out? What'd you
pick it out? Champ. Fucking Afghanistan.

1065
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,170
And it actually looks like something
that would grow out of the soil in

1066
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:38,780
Hiroshima. No, seriously. I'm Grad.

1067
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,470
Glad you're going out of the ordinary with
the tree this year. Good. Good for you.

1068
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:45,590
But I had no idea trees
could get hepatitis.

1069
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,310
Merry Christmas. Oh look who's here. Nia.

1070
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,670
Everybody is agreeing with you.
You want to come on the podcast?

1071
01:08:56,510 --> 01:09:01,040
Wait a second, let me, uh, let me
get your mic up here. Here you go.

1072
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:04,340
Hi. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Let me make sure you're real good.

1073
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:08,570
Just talking Christmas, everybody. There
you go. Talk a little more. All right,

1074
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:13,310
happy holidays. All right. Um, would
you like to hear some of these comments?

1075
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:18,380
They all agree with you about the tree,
about the tree of the holiday season.

1076
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,730
Boy, uh, maybe I should have known what
to expect when you scribed the tree,

1077
01:09:22,731 --> 01:09:26,710
but I didn't expect that. No offense,
but that just looks awful, man.

1078
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,590
I have to admit that that one
hurts more than, than people who,

1079
01:09:30,591 --> 01:09:32,660
somebody said it looked
like a cell phone tower.

1080
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,570
Like those ones are actually funny.
This guy that that was,

1081
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,930
that one came from the heart.
That would really was a, well,

1082
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:44,570
I'm a fucking termite and even I wouldn't
take a shit on that fucked up tree.

1083
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:49,790
Jesus. Wow. Sweet tree.

1084
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:53,180
Not, oh yeah. No. You know what that is?

1085
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:57,350
That's like from a fucking anthrax fan
who's like fucking 48 now and has three

1086
01:09:57,351 --> 01:09:59,360
kids.
That's from like a Wayne's world.

1087
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:04,170
Then they always used to say that not
the first time I saw not was anthrax.

1088
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:08,480
That guy had it shaved into his
chest. The word, not an OT. Yeah,

1089
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:11,520
the guy who then eventually shaved his
head. You know those guys who go bald,

1090
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:15,980
they're always like Harry, like apes,
the guy, the guy who was on that,

1091
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:20,310
that VH one show where they
had the super group. Oh, uh,

1092
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,660
yeah, aunt. He had the long
beard. Yeah, the long beard,

1093
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,470
but just the long beard. Yeah,
I know who you're talking about.

1094
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:28,370
I forget what his name is.

1095
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,820
That meant when I shaved my head because
I'm losing my hair and you maybe you

1096
01:10:31,821 --> 01:10:35,580
should fucking a girl that you loved
the shame and love it when you had this

1097
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:38,030
shaved head. I say bring it back. Well,

1098
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:41,900
I think nature is going to
bring it back for me, but well,

1099
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:43,550
it's good to know that
you still look good.

1100
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:47,150
Well he knows I can't do the fucking
Rogaine Propecia shit. I just can't. I,

1101
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,780
I just know. I know how it works in
life. You don't get your cake and eat it.

1102
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,570
Nature's going to get ya. You want
to keep your fucking hair. Okay.

1103
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,390
Why don't we just fucking take
a shot to your goddamn liver.

1104
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:00,980
Those people are gonna lose their livers.
You know, they're full heads of hair.

1105
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,370
What did I walk into here?
I thought we were talking about the tree.

1106
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:09,500
The anorexic tray. Yes. So if
you've done any Christmas shopping,

1107
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:12,710
let's do quick little interview.
I get the people all caught up with you.

1108
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:17,820
Have you? Uh, look at that tree. I think
the tree looks fucking cool as hell.

1109
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,010
It's not the Charlie Brown tree.
You fucking asshole. Wait a minute.

1110
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,990
The symmetrical to Charlie Brown tree
was all brown. Look, all you guys,

1111
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:27,780
you have to take a picture of the
tree now that it's decorated though,

1112
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,300
because I think there's a debate.

1113
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:34,310
It looks like a fucking fucking Broadway
singer with aids because it's all

1114
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:39,080
glitter and skinny. What a
lot of them died of that. Oh,

1115
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:43,500
they do? They do dress flashy. You need
to stop like, well, I'm not saying that.

1116
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:44,281
I agree with that.

1117
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm saying that that's what they would
write out for everything offensive. They,

1118
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:50,910
I'm not saying I agree with it.
It's just how it is.

1119
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,160
Fucking dirt bag.
Oh,

1120
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,910
I saw that movie and the band played on.
Right.

1121
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,040
I don't remember any guys friends.

1122
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:06,270
I don't mind any guys driving garbage
trucks holding their other garbage truck

1123
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:10,800
boyfriend rocking them slowly.
It's not only gay people who can't.

1124
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:15,000
I know it's that. It's that and
truck drivers. Let's move on.

1125
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:17,700
It's Christmas so I know it is.
No,

1126
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:21,360
let's talk about aids and let's talk
[inaudible] I play now. Come on.

1127
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:25,170
This is fucking hilarious. I never
saw me. It was a long time ago.

1128
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,830
I know how the car did the song go?
I don't know. There was a song. Yeah.

1129
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:37,380
Where are you asking me about Christmas
shopping? Wasn't it about San Francisco?

1130
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:41,700
Isn't that where they basically don't
know and Harvey milk came in and then that

1131
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:45,600
other guy shot him in the head
or is that a different milk milk.

1132
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:49,020
Oh you want to Sean Penn. Can I
show you the most? I can't even,

1133
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:51,210
I won't even show this to
cause I love you too much.

1134
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,100
Somebody sent me a youtube video.

1135
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:57,840
You guys have ever stopped
you showing me horrific pain.

1136
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,220
This is why you don't get
affection. I try to be. I did.

1137
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:05,240
I tried to give it to you and you slap it
down. Look at that. What's, what do we,

1138
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,110
what do I got to replay?
What just happened there?

1139
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:11,340
I said I'd love to show this to you
and, but it hurts you to, uh, you know,

1140
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:15,210
I'd love you to whatever the fuck. Nice
thing I just said he don't even remember.

1141
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:19,380
Anyway, it's two seconds ago,
but I meant it. All right.

1142
01:13:19,381 --> 01:13:20,940
There's a movie called Feast.

1143
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:24,150
This is going to be on the [inaudible]
podcast where you guys feel free to go on

1144
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:27,450
their trash. My fucking Christmas
tree. I like it. I'm sticking.

1145
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:28,470
But you know what this is like,

1146
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:32,100
this is like the new kid who comes to
school and you guys all pick on him and I

1147
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:35,850
befriend him cause I'm stronger. I can
step outside the group. Look at me.

1148
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:40,950
I'm the hero.
It's just a tree and I'll fuck you.

1149
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,060
All right. The movie, there's
a movie called a feast. Yeah.

1150
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:49,320
Have you ever heard of that movie?
Okay. I don't know what's going on.

1151
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,540
I can't, I don't want to, oh, that's my
phone. What is your cell phone sound like?

1152
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:56,430
The tornado drill from the 50.
It's

1153
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,240
cause you know what is this? No, there's
no good ring tones. You know what? Go Go,

1154
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,560
go get the a, you know what? I'll let my
podcast listeners decide the rink. Tom,

1155
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,030
go grab my phone if you don't
mind. All right. All right.

1156
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:11,440
And I'm going to describe this fucking
thing while while you're up. Okay.

1157
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:14,680
There's this, this, this movie out there.

1158
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:19,300
Feast that I have to rent.
I don't know what's going on,

1159
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:24,301
but there is a woman tied down and this
beast that looks like a little person

1160
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:30,460
that was a skinned alive
basically comes out of nowhere.

1161
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,670
And
Fox,

1162
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:36,130
this woman in the mouth and
finishes there. I said it,

1163
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,710
I said it and it happened so fast.

1164
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:43,690
I didn't even think that it was real.
And uh,

1165
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,330
I dunno.
That's when I have to ask.

1166
01:14:46,331 --> 01:14:47,860
It's like you're not
really trying to scare me.

1167
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,590
You're just trying to either gross
me out or make me fucking laugh.

1168
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,880
But if you really want to get grossed out,
um,

1169
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:57,820
here's another youtube video of the week.
Somebody sent one in.

1170
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:00,700
I only got like two minutes into
this thing and I had to shut it off.

1171
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:05,750
Human cryogenics. All right,
so if you guys, you know,

1172
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,660
isn't that funny?
I told her to go pick up my phone.

1173
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:11,440
She goes and answers it and now I
was talking to the person, you know,

1174
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:15,220
what would you broads be doing if you
weren't running? You fucking yaps.

1175
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:20,380
You know I, it's like I
don't understand. They just,

1176
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:21,730
they just have to be talking.

1177
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,450
All right, whatever. So human
cryogenics, red sox fans,

1178
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:30,820
we're all familiar with that.
You know what I mean?

1179
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:33,520
Ted Williams head,

1180
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:37,450
I believe is upside down sitting on a
tuna can and they accidentally broke his

1181
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:42,130
nose.
I'm talking about Ted Williams.

1182
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:46,030
They froze. Do you believe in a
pick up the microphone. Oh God,

1183
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:48,530
you're going to be eaten on the podcast.
You know,

1184
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,040
I think this is good that you're on
the podcast. It's, it's, you know,

1185
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:55,060
it's the holidays. It should, it
should be family here, but some people,

1186
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:58,210
some people don't like my Christmas
tree to look. First of all,

1187
01:15:58,211 --> 01:16:01,210
the Internet is like a,
you know,

1188
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:05,080
like when you hang up those
lights to track bugs, Zap them.

1189
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:08,620
That's what the Internet is
for. [inaudible] you know
what I mean? They, yeah,

1190
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:10,150
they just gravitate towards it.

1191
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,140
All these miserable fucks who have all
the power in the world to change their

1192
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:18,610
life and live the wonderful life that
we're living on this fucking bed without a

1193
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:22,510
headboard. I've been trying, you know,

1194
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,190
somebody trashed us because we don't have,

1195
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,930
we don't have any pictures on the wall.

1196
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,880
I'm trying to teach people how to live a
minimalist debt free life. First of all,

1197
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:32,440
we don't need pictures on the wall.

1198
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:34,930
We have a picture on the
wall that bill hates.

1199
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:39,070
We have the live pictures get way
too fucking intimate but women.

1200
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:43,480
But we have a picture above the
fucking bed of it. Looks like.

1201
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,240
I thought you've talked about
this venture. You have. I
talked about it. All right,

1202
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:47,800
well I already brought it up.
Yeah.

1203
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,870
It's like every time I look
up there's another deer.

1204
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,280
Can't see it and it's staring
right into the fucking Lens.

1205
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:58,930
It's not black and white.
It's not in color. It's Sorta
in that Blair witch look.

1206
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,200
It's kind of a Sepia town. I fucking
hate it. And you know something.

1207
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:05,260
I know you hate him. Yeah. And I,
whoa. I almost fell in between seats.

1208
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,510
We need a headboard. How much
just fell off the back of the bed.

1209
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:10,880
But I'd like personally like to point
out the fact that you went out and just

1210
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:14,360
bought that fucking photo. Yup, I
did. And hung it. Right. Look at that.

1211
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:17,720
And you just hung it right over the bed?
Yeah. How can we didn't ask me about it?

1212
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,980
I don't know. I just thought
it would be nice. Really.

1213
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:24,560
What if I get a poster
of fucking Larry Bird?

1214
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,390
He played for the Celtics and he used
to do this thing where he would always

1215
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:31,970
wipe the sweat off the side of his feet.
So I'm going to get that.

1216
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:35,410
So it looks like one of his fucking
blonde balls is going to fall out of my

1217
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:38,090
shorts and I'm going to
hang that over the bed.

1218
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:41,940
I don't want to see how
fucking long that lasts. Um,

1219
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,260
I just wanted to say that we have a
mantle and there's pictures all over the

1220
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:49,160
mantle of all of our fans. Those are the
pictures we have. You know what this is?

1221
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,120
This is hilarious how innocent you are
with the Internet. What do you mean

1222
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,600
you don't defend your position?

1223
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,520
All you do doing now is prolonging the
arguments and now they'll do like really

1224
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,580
do, why don't you put a picture
up of him if you have them?

1225
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,280
Cause they just want more
material to trash you,

1226
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,270
but they haven't even seen our apartment.
Who are they to say anything? Exactly.

1227
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:14,590
I'm not, I'm just saying what
you're doing is, it's like what?

1228
01:18:14,591 --> 01:18:18,590
Someone trashes you fucking white.
You're legs are, I know. It's great.

1229
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:23,030
I just take them out in a job interview
and I get it. So He'd go, you just agree.

1230
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,960
Absolutely. Whatever. Yeah, I'm horrible.
I look like a puppet. Absolutely.

1231
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:30,770
You're 100% and it kills it. That's what
Madonna's done. You're a fucking whore.

1232
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,450
I know. You want to see my twat. Check
out my new book. I got it all over there.

1233
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,450
I got a close up.
Didn't she take an a in that book?

1234
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:42,710
She took a close up of her fucking hoo
ha. I don't think so. Yeah, she did.

1235
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:47,030
I think she was fully nude, but there
wasn't a closeup I that wasn't that book.

1236
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:49,940
No, the sex book. What book
was that? I don't know.

1237
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:51,530
I don't think he was a little red wagon.

1238
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,100
What was the last book that I
read? That book was, uh, my,

1239
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:01,520
I think was my favorite work by Madonna
and I thought it was their most honest

1240
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:06,080
work. You know who's standing out there
on the street looking like a fucking

1241
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:09,650
prostitute. Exactly.
Exactly. She looked good.

1242
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,090
She looked phenomenal.

1243
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,640
She looked really good and still
banged that fucking cougar.

1244
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,740
You know what I hate?

1245
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,350
You know what I love is that she's
gotten all their varicose veins.

1246
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:21,920
Fucking minutes stuff. I was just
going to talk about that, cause she's,

1247
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:24,710
everyone always talks about her
arms are so veiny. It's so gross.

1248
01:19:24,711 --> 01:19:25,510
But you know what?

1249
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:29,120
Madonna works out every day and that's
blood pumping through those veins.

1250
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:33,890
You can see life. That's what those
veins are. It's very inspirational.

1251
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:38,770
Yeah. She, you know, she's
like, she's like somebody who,

1252
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,660
you know, she's no, you
know what she's like,

1253
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:45,430
she's like Clint Eastwood in that
movie. Gran Torino. Torino. Yeah.

1254
01:19:45,431 --> 01:19:49,550
I'd never been named the car, the grant
and the grand jury duty year fresh.

1255
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:54,230
I know that. Oh, I forget to get off
my lawn. Is that, what's the word?

1256
01:19:54,231 --> 01:19:57,500
I can't remember. Yeah, but then
I would say all racist Shit,

1257
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,460
which people won't get that.

1258
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,970
I'm making fun of the movie and I'll
think I believe it. Well that's what he,

1259
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:04,950
that's what he did in the movie.
He was racist anyway around.

1260
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:09,510
Oh yeah. Cause it's a Hollywood movie.
Wow. Because it's a holiday movie.

1261
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:13,570
Listen. Yes. Grant Torino that, that's,

1262
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:15,840
that's how she's treated like
the way he treated that car.

1263
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:18,870
That's where she's treating a body. Her
body is like in fucking mint condition.

1264
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:21,330
It is, you know, and all the
rest of us, what do we do?

1265
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:25,290
We fucking back into a car and I'll
worry about it. Slammed into a tree.

1266
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,420
That's how we treat our bodies.
Doesn't settle for second. Yeah.

1267
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,970
She's out there wax in it.

1268
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,830
Oil Balls to the wall,

1269
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:43,320
not the whole fucking old
school shit this week.

1270
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,810
So, uh, yes. I did go Christmas
shopping to answer your
dude, go Christmas shopping.

1271
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,790
I have a little bit.
What did you get me?

1272
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,930
I'm not telling you what the surprise
you'll find out on your shirt.

1273
01:20:56,010 --> 01:21:00,060
You know what sucks about being a guy is
the last time you get a good gift is I

1274
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:03,750
think when you're 11, the second you
turn 12, you start becoming an adult.

1275
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,950
Maybe he gets to Mike Electronic Shit.
You know,

1276
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:12,690
you just go into that, that
phase. We get shirts and uh,

1277
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,120
uh, organizers. This is a place
to put your wallet, Your Keys.

1278
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,230
I actually fucking love that.
You know,

1279
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:26,250
that's really unnecessary.

1280
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:37,140
Perfect casting, getting trashed. Here's
the perfect pushups. Merry Christmas.

1281
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:43,230
I'm fucking with you. Got me great gifts.
You have first year I was with you.

1282
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,980
You got me the drum sticks with my,
my initials engraved in them.

1283
01:21:46,981 --> 01:21:51,450
That was fucking adorable as those were
great. That was cute. That was adorable.

1284
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:54,900
This was when, obviously bill and I
were first, what are we doing here?

1285
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:57,230
Too much of a life.
Let's get back to the podcast here.

1286
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:02,100
That was when we were talking about our
social security numbers that are seven,

1287
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:05,310
nine, eight, four. That
was what I thought. I

1288
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:11,070
you brought it up. I'm trying to get
you to stop talking about it. Fine.

1289
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:15,150
All right, let me see if I've got a
question here that you can actually answer

1290
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:19,560
or you can add to. I don't think
I have anything. You know what?

1291
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:22,320
This fucking podcast. Oh Shit.
Then I shut it off. I didn't,

1292
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:26,340
did I please tell me I didn't. All
right, we're up to 42 minutes. Um,

1293
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,110
so listen. Yes, I, uh,

1294
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:35,730
I got an offer for a corporate
gig on the day after Christmas

1295
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:38,610
and,
uh,

1296
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,170
Eagle Rock and I was wondering
if I can go do it. No,

1297
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:49,110
please. First of all, I have to
fucking lie. All right. Second of all.

1298
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,590
No, I'm just fucking with
you. You always get mad at me.

1299
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:56,010
You want to do fucking work?
You know what? This, this
whole fucking podcast just,

1300
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:59,100
I just forgot I was even doing the
podcast and I'm just sitting here watching

1301
01:22:59,101 --> 01:23:02,190
you eat oatmeal. You have
any closing comments? I got,

1302
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:04,470
I got to bring this home with some
funny here. Do you got anything?

1303
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,350
Anything you want to say? Oh, let's
talk about how I hurt my foot.

1304
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:12,120
Making fun of you fucking ex. I mean, oh
yeah. I made fun of her exercise tapes.

1305
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:14,230
She,
she's in there like grunting and groaning

1306
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,490
doing this fucking exercise tape.

1307
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:23,230
And I walk in there and it said to Bob
from the biggest loser with is shredded

1308
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:27,740
head. He like has like, he's,

1309
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,680
he works out too much.
Like he actually,

1310
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:32,110
you know the cuts people
want when they get abs,

1311
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:33,970
he has them on either
side of his forehead.

1312
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,250
His head is shredded,
he's in great shape.

1313
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,210
CVDS are no fucking kids.

1314
01:23:42,211 --> 01:23:46,210
So she sits there and she starts telling
me how his Biz DVDs are hard and all

1315
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:49,690
that. I was like, fuck that guy. I
can do that Goddamn DVD. I'll be fine.

1316
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:52,240
Typical man. Right. And then what happens?

1317
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:56,510
I go to stretch before I do it because
I'm 42 years old and you're like, oh,

1318
01:23:56,511 --> 01:24:00,070
you don't need to stretch you as this
whole at thing. And He fucking didn't.

1319
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,760
And I ended up screwing up my foot again.
They're stretching in the beginning.

1320
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:09,850
Yeah, that's bullshit. He didn't didn't
into any stretches for your back.

1321
01:24:09,851 --> 01:24:12,250
Nothing.
Nothing to stretch out your feet.

1322
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:14,020
And then the guy has the
fucking fucking jumping.

1323
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:17,740
I got Bill Walton feed at
this point. I can't do that.
God Damn Video. Bill Walton.

1324
01:24:17,741 --> 01:24:22,000
Bill Walton was a big fucking redhead who
smoked weed in college and hung around

1325
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:25,780
John Wooden. And then all he does
is try to, like John Wooden was,

1326
01:24:25,781 --> 01:24:30,610
was this amazing coach who gave you all
this life advice and he's trying to be

1327
01:24:30,611 --> 01:24:34,570
John Wooden junior always giving out
advice, always telling those stories.

1328
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:37,180
And he has this awful
fucking voice that's like,

1329
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:41,770
it comes from the center of his head
and goes out as fucking broken nose.

1330
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:43,003
I mean,

1331
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:53,590
ugh.
Fucking redheaded Frankenstein.

1332
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:57,160
Well in the midst of that workout when
there was all that stuff going on with

1333
01:24:57,161 --> 01:24:58,060
the back,
I was like,

1334
01:24:58,061 --> 01:25:00,940
why don't you stop and just kind of
do an alternate version of it and you

1335
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:03,530
wouldn't do it because you're a
typical man and you have to see like,

1336
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,670
I can do anything. You know what? I
just love that you say a typical man,

1337
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,900
lump us all in and then give me shit
when I talk about all the broads.

1338
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,180
You've always done that.

1339
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:16,210
I always have done that and I don't have
a problem with you saying that guys are

1340
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:19,590
hard headed because we are.
We're fucking morons and you guys goes,

1341
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:22,140
you guys are psychos.
All right.

1342
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:25,580
We're emotional but doesn't mean I don't
like you. The key buzz fucking Bandana.

1343
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,590
What do you think about that? Oh,
t buys right from that fucking,

1344
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,810
what's the name of that group
now was going to sound like,

1345
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:34,540
how long is it going to take you
to get the name of that bill?

1346
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:38,140
Never remembers the name. Crazy sexy.
Cool. Was the name of their album.

1347
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:40,870
Don't go chase.

1348
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,020
I thought they were saying
don't go Jason waterfalls.

1349
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:49,330
And I didn't know what that meant. I was
like is that some sort of hip hop slang?

1350
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,270
Who's Jason? Is that like a,
why does he like waterfall?

1351
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,560
How to he like one fucking
you fucking get the oatmeal.

1352
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:59,340
You just spit out of your mouth. Oops. Um,

1353
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:03,800
now what was the name of them? TLC. Yeah,

1354
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:08,801
you go and uh Oh left
die cause I his ride.

1355
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:13,670
Oh Shit. What is this? Oh that's why she,

1356
01:26:13,671 --> 01:26:17,480
that's why she called herself left.
Done. Cause what? Cause I is right.

1357
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,430
At least that's how she explained it.
I know what they said.

1358
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:24,890
Why do you have that thing under your uh,

1359
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,250
your left eye or so she had something
on her fucking face and she said,

1360
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:30,250
cause I is right. And I
was like, Oh put a count,

1361
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,160
you know right there or cause she's dead.
I'm not supposed to say that.

1362
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:36,980
When she was alive, she probably wasn't
difficult to be in a relationship with.

1363
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,680
Wasn't she the one who burned down
that guy's fucking house? Yes.

1364
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:44,150
She didn't go to jail because she has a
vagina. She went to jail. Are you done?

1365
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:47,170
Went to jail for that. How
long? I don't know. Exactly.

1366
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,480
Internet and look it up instead of just
one of those things where you end up

1367
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:53,240
being wrong. Well you ended up
being wrong and you're proven wrong,

1368
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:56,930
so you just fucking gorilla your way
through it like you just said. Yeah,

1369
01:26:56,931 --> 01:27:00,590
that's what I'm saying. She did
go to jail bell. Look it up.

1370
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:02,203
I'm not going to look.

1371
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,600
They forced her ass to go to Rehab
because she was an alcoholic on top of it

1372
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:10,400
anyway, with the, why are you saying
it like she's some sort of a victim?

1373
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:13,040
She burned out so he please keep
them Mike in front of your mouth.

1374
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,380
He didn't say that she was a victim.

1375
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:19,820
I did not say that he gave her the out
cause she was an alcoholic. No, I didn't.

1376
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,790
Yeah, you guys, you guys are always
every the whole, your whole fucking life.

1377
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,040
You just giving excuses.
That's why you guys,

1378
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:28,340
that's why you can't do as many pushups
as a guy has nothing to do with your

1379
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:29,270
mothering hips.

1380
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:33,560
It has to do with the fact
that you fucking get to tee
off 20 yards in front of

1381
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:35,660
me and still get the gift,
the same fucking score.

1382
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:40,130
What does the c stand
for and Tlc? Uh, let's,

1383
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,970
I don't know what to the
TL stands for. Yes, you do.

1384
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,000
Tender loving care.
Is that what it stands for?

1385
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:51,500
They're the names of the girls in the
group. All right. There was chilly.

1386
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:56,930
I got Chili. There's left die and then
this t boss. Hey Cow. Yeah. Got It.

1387
01:27:56,931 --> 01:27:58,940
There you go. Go ahead. Quiz
me on some more pop culture.

1388
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:02,420
It can be a little pop coke culture
quiz here. I'll fucking, I'll bury it.

1389
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:04,340
Go ahead. Do it. Ah.

1390
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:08,960
Can you name all the members of now
you can't go ahead. New Edition.

1391
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,480
Absolutely gone. Bobbi Brown, uh,

1392
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:16,940
Jerome Robinson, the trails. Spreewell

1393
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:24,680
and a Nipsey Russell. I was, no, he
was a manager. He was the manager.

1394
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,430
I wish that opens the group.
No, but I know here it is.

1395
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,430
Horrible. That's my, a humble ring.
I'll give me a fucking break. What the,

1396
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:38,000
would you want to hear my one here?
My options. Give me another group.

1397
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:39,890
Why don't you pick a white group
so I could actually get it?

1398
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,930
New Kids on the block. New
Kids on the, although they
had all those gay names. Joe,

1399
01:28:43,931 --> 01:28:47,420
we'd Bobby Stevie,
Mikey in pooky.

1400
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:53,270
Huh? Can you feel it
baby? I can feel it too.

1401
01:28:55,910 --> 01:29:00,740
It was Marky mark stealing the licking
the lips thing from ll cool j Marky mark

1402
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:02,610

Some of it was Kinda nice spot. Ah,
that's it. Oh, you know something. What I,

1473
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:52,541
I keep meaning to fucking talk about
on this God damn podcast is I started,

1474
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:55,490
somebody sent me something,
uh,

1475
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:00,190
about the fucking, what the hell
did I do to my damn computer?

1476
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:03,520

Let go of my fucking cord.

1477
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:07,530

1478
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:13,030
Hang on a second.
People fucking court is stuck in there.

1479
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,630
Whatever.
People keep sending me this shit about.

1480
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:21,631
A one person did send me
about the Liverpool soccer
club and the premier league

1481
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:27,370
and evidently these American dudes bought
it and said that they were going to

1482
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:30,490
buy a buy,
a brand new stadium.

1483
01:34:30,491 --> 01:34:33,070
They were going to do all this
type of shit and they didn't do it.

1484
01:34:33,071 --> 01:34:37,240
And somebody sent me this great video
of all these English people just from

1485
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:41,230
their heart's telling these American
guys to fucking sell the Goddamn team and

1486
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:43,300
to fuck off.
And it was awesome.

1487
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:47,380
And this is the same team that the owners
of the red sox then went in and bought

1488
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:51,730
and I started looking at the premiere
league and like three or four the teams

1489
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:55,840
are owned by, uh, by Americans,

1490
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:00,410
specifically from the United States.
All right.

1491
01:35:00,411 --> 01:35:03,550
Because we're all from North
America over here. Uh, and I,

1492
01:35:03,551 --> 01:35:05,450
I can't believe how fucking
annoying that would be.

1493
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,650
You don't have a bunch of English guys
came over and bought my team and said

1494
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:11,900
that they were going to do a bunch
of stuff and they fucked it up.

1495
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:16,730
I would be beyond pissed.
Um, so I don't know.

1496
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:19,160
Sorry about that. England. I don't
know why the fuck we did that.

1497
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:22,430
It's nice to know where buying something.
Consider gyp.

1498
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:23,660
Japan's come over here and they,

1499
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:27,200
they fucking bought up everything
over the last 20 years. Didn't they?

1500
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,220
Don't they own our roads? You know,
what are you going to do with them?

1501
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:35,990
Close them off. Do you have enough people
to do that? I don't think you do. Um,

1502
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:37,550
so yeah,
send me some more information on it.

1503
01:35:37,551 --> 01:35:40,490
Cause I'd like to talk about the
premier league and also I'm wondering in

1504
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:44,180
Ireland, is that a seven nation rugby
league or whatever the fuck it is?

1505
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,200
Is that starting up again?

1506
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:49,970
Cause I watched that last year in March
when I went over there and a rugby is

1507
01:35:49,971 --> 01:35:53,660
the shit and a unlike
professional football,

1508
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:56,420
which they're just turning into
the biggest pussy sport ever.

1509
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:58,250
Isn't it enough that we were,

1510
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:02,450
that they have to wear pink for the
entire fucking month of October.

1511
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:06,500
You know,
now you can't tackle people.

1512
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:10,430
The amount of quarterbacks out there
that are getting like Joe Montana fucking

1513
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:15,431
stats because they're drive was kept
alive because a defensive person had the

1514
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:20,570
audacity to tackle someone his age.
He's just fucking be on me. And uh,

1515
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:22,550
I got nothing left people.
I'm not going to lie to you.

1516
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:24,860
This podcast was fucking
over before it started.

1517
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:27,230
I have too much shit I have to do.
All right.

1518
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:30,710
I remember the first year I did this
podcast, I actually took two weeks off.

1519
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:35,900
I took two weeks off. So,
you know, whatever it was
dressed down fucking Monday.

1520
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:40,670
I came in. I did what I
could. All right. That's it.

1521
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:43,250
That's it for the, uh, for
the podcast for this year.

1522
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:47,480
Everybody right now we got one
more for this year and next weeks.

1523
01:36:47,481 --> 01:36:48,380
I promise you.

1524
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:51,620
I promise you it will be just as bad
as this one if not fucking worse.

1525
01:36:51,621 --> 01:36:54,950
Cause I'm on vacation.
I'm not required to make you laugh,

1526
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:56,870
but I want to thank everybody.
Seriously.

1527
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:01,820
Everybody who came out to
see my shows this year,

1528
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:06,560
um, I had a great time and I actually,
oh wait. You know, I know what I'm doing.

1529
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:10,550
I'm missing underrated. Overrated. How
the fuck could I do that? Underrated.

1530
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:14,300
Overrated. This week real
quick. Uh, overrated.

1531
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:18,320
Both the jets and the Patriots. Being a
dolphin fan, born and raised in Miami.

1532
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:19,571
I'm sick.

1533
01:37:19,571 --> 01:37:24,571
I'm sick and tired of these two faggot
teams dominating the AFC east for the

1534
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:26,750
past decade. Well, it's
really been the patriots.

1535
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:29,690
It was very nice of you to throw the
jets in there. I think the jets have one.

1536
01:37:29,691 --> 01:37:33,980
Like what? One division in the last
fucking 10 years. Um, so I get it.

1537
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:37,300
Were overrated because
your team sucks. Um, hey,

1538
01:37:37,301 --> 01:37:40,940
did you like how while the former Dolphin
won the game for the jets yesterday?

1539
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:44,180
Have bet you enjoyed that. Huh? I
hope you get a sunburn on your ass.

1540
01:37:44,181 --> 01:37:48,320
You fucking cunt. All right. Underrated
the bills being a dolphin fan,

1541
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:50,750
born and raised in Miami.
Like you already said,

1542
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:54,590
I love the bills for always keeping the
dolphins in the hunt for the playoffs

1543
01:37:54,591 --> 01:37:58,320
every year, the past decade and a half.
All right. That guy was just being a dick,

1544
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:01,230
so I have to respect that.
Alright. Underrated. Michael Vick.

1545
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:04,890
He does sports announcer voice,
uh, Michael Vick, Michael Vick.

1546
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:07,470
What are one of the things you have
to understand about Michael Vick?

1547
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:12,360
Is Michael Vick the MV S P of this
season? Bob, because he's my MVP.

1548
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:16,260
He's making fun of me talking about
how that's all they say. Michael via.

1549
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:20,820
What can you say about Michael
Vick? Well, well, Jim, Michael
Vick, um, you know what?

1550
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:24,390
I have to admit I was fucking
wrong about that guy. I was wrong,

1551
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:27,990
but I was also writing.
Okay. Because the same reason

1552
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,790
I fucking fell for it by the Patriots
playing good defense for two weeks in a

1553
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:35,220
row and then actually gave
up 14 and a half points,

1554
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:38,520
ignoring the fact that they only played
well for two fucking weeks in a row.

1555
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:41,220
You can't say that a guy's the best dude,
the fucking lead.

1556
01:38:41,221 --> 01:38:45,180
Cause he lights up the
Redskins and fucking three
weeks later John Kitna lights

1557
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:48,750
up the fucking Redskins.
All right. But yesterday,

1558
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,780
what happened in that game?
I mean that was unreal.

1559
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,760
I think he went back to old school,
Michael Vick,

1560
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:57,360
he just started fucking running down the
field like a God damn water bug. But uh,

1561
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:02,210
I was wrong about that guy.
Um, it's way, it's funny,

1562
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:05,370
he can't say he's in,

1563
01:39:05,371 --> 01:39:08,520
he's in like a League of his own as
far as like what the fuck he's doing.

1564
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:11,190
Cause I've never seen anybody
do that shit at his position.

1565
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:14,280
And I'd say that he's going
to change the position,

1566
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,350
but I don't know the Dilla Neb ever
been another person as talented as that

1567
01:39:19,351 --> 01:39:24,000
fucking guy at that position.
Um, I dunno. So anyways,

1568
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:25,170
he says, uh, Bill, sorry,

1569
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:27,900
you have to go through another week of
that shit of everybody saying Michael

1570
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:30,750
Vick. But every time I hear them talk
about thick after a big wing, no matter,

1571
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:34,740
no matter what I remember about your
rant against the announcers about the

1572
01:39:34,741 --> 01:39:37,560
announcer's saying his name
over and over again. Um,

1573
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:40,980
I say he's still underrated because he
broke two NFL records in the last two

1574
01:39:40,981 --> 01:39:44,700
weeks, but still can't get
any solid respect. Ah, dude.

1575
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:48,360
I think he's getting his solid respect.
The fact that they're,

1576
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:53,070
they're saying that he might be the MVP
of the league and he's coming off an 18

1577
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,790
month stint in Leavenworth
for torturing dogs to death.

1578
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:00,660
You know what I mean?
I definitely,

1579
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:04,980
for when someone plays the fucking race
card, I always listened to it because I,

1580
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:05,251
you know,

1581
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:08,790
I traveled the road and I know what
people are like having talked to them,

1582
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:13,380
there's just, people are fucking,
they're awful. The fucking awful.

1583
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:15,570
But this is the one time where
it's like, dude, you know,

1584
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:21,090
you're tortured dogs to death.
You drowned them, your shot him.

1585
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:24,510
I mean straight up, straight
across the fucking board, you know,

1586
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:29,490
you can't expect people to 100% Embracia
after you do some shit like that even

1587
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:31,470
though you more than
paid the fucking price.

1588
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:37,110
But I'd rather be you than one of
those fucking dogs. So anyways,

1589
01:40:37,111 --> 01:40:41,340
he said, I say underrated because he broke
two NFL records in the last two weeks,

1590
01:40:41,341 --> 01:40:43,920
but still can't get any solid respect.
Honestly.

1591
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:48,810
As much as I hate Tom Brady,
he is the real MVP so far.

1592
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:51,720
But people are still hesitant.
I don't know who the real MVP is,

1593
01:40:51,721 --> 01:40:55,240
but Tom Brady's having
his best fucking year. Um,

1594
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:01,480
all right, this is a good one here.
Yukon women's team, 88 win streak,

1595
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,530
overrated.

1596
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:07,150
The audacity of these media pricks to
compare the Yukon's woman's team to the

1597
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:11,050
UCLA team, by the way, which
was cheating by the way,

1598
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,270
with how they got all their prospects.

1599
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:17,050
For all you people who trashed the
Patriots and act like all you're fucking

1600
01:41:17,051 --> 01:41:20,470
winning is because you're just
such smart fucking human beings.

1601
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:22,990
I want,

1602
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,170
I'm not going to get involved and I'm
not gonna open that fucking can of worms,

1603
01:41:26,171 --> 01:41:27,490
but John wouldn't,
uh,

1604
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,840
as my buddy said yesterday was the
king of looking the other way when the

1605
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:34,630
boosters got involved. Okay, let's
leave it at that. All right. Of course,

1606
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:37,870
it's a major accomplishment,
but as is typical with everything,

1607
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:39,400
male versus female related,

1608
01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:43,180
people cannot put things into
perspective when it comes to females.

1609
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:47,410
The woman's Yukon teams,
88 wins is in no way,

1610
01:41:47,411 --> 01:41:51,010
shape or form as impressive
as the UCLA teams.

1611
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,370
88 whims wins.
I'll put it to you like this.

1612
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:59,580
I used to play little league football
and got MVP three times in a row

1613
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,700
and co MVP once,
however,

1614
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:08,080
Tom Brady has won the NFL MVP,
I think once or twice,

1615
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,800
I have a longer MVP streak than Tom Brady,

1616
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:16,450
but who's MVPs are more respectable
and impressive. That's right.

1617
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,900
Mine. Just kidding. Of course his are, um,

1618
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:25,330
all right. I get that. But,

1619
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:32,650
uh, do, but you're a guy and
you could play in the NFL,

1620
01:42:32,651 --> 01:42:36,700
but you weren't good enough.
So that's the difference I guess.

1621
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:41,830
Um, as far as, I would
say that they're the Ucla,

1622
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:45,700
the Ucla of women's basketball.
How about that?

1623
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:49,840
You got to say that because they are going
up against the best females out there

1624
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:52,660
and they have one 88 in a row.
So I would say it like that,

1625
01:42:52,661 --> 01:42:57,040
but to come to put it up there
with Uclas. Yeah, the men's,

1626
01:42:57,041 --> 01:43:00,430
I definitely think that's bullshit.
That's just the classic, uh,

1627
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:05,260
you know,
it's like them wearing pink in the NFL.

1628
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:09,640
It's just did you just
appeasing them? That's all the
fuck you're doing. You know?

1629
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:12,790
Then I really just compare breast
cancers to like appeasing somebody.

1630
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:17,230
I really should just stop talking, but I'm
just going to keep going here. Um, yeah.

1631
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:19,180
As far as sports accomplishments go,

1632
01:43:19,181 --> 01:43:22,930
I don't think females mean as much as
men's just because we're better at it than

1633
01:43:22,931 --> 01:43:24,580
you are,
you know?

1634
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,590
And we just have better hand eye
coordination. Just generally speaking,

1635
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:32,830
we're just better at, you know, the
amount of guys that if you go, hey,

1636
01:43:32,831 --> 01:43:35,800
think quick catch and you just throw him
a stapler, they're going to catch it.

1637
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:38,830
And the amount of women who would just
take it off the face and habit, Landon,

1638
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:43,030
their cleavage. It's, you can't
even compare it, you know,

1639
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,530
let's debate that next week.

1640
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:48,280
I don't think females are as good
athletes as guys are. I just don't,

1641
01:43:48,281 --> 01:43:52,480
I don't think they are. I don't think
that they have that killer instinct. No.

1642
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:53,783
Unless they're there.

1643
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:58,360
They're chemically wired like a guy
and they have as much testosterone.

1644
01:43:58,361 --> 01:43:59,800
I don't think it's going to be a problem.

1645
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,760
I'm just saying this to Piss people off
so I don't have to work hard next week.

1646
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:07,390
Uh, I think that's it. I'll do,
I got some, uh, youtube videos,

1647
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:12,040
you know, if ever I was going
to edit a fucking podcast,

1648
01:44:12,041 --> 01:44:14,950
it should be fucking this one.
This one is just Jesus, whatever.

1649
01:44:14,951 --> 01:44:17,140
Last week's was great. This
is what I am at, but you know,

1650
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:21,220
this is a let down week for me. All
right, youtube, check this one out.

1651
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:25,930
This is one of the creepiest ones I've
seen. And, uh, it's called the liar card.

1652
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:31,370
This is a card you can put in your phone
and for people, you know, so when you're,

1653
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:34,120
you're,
if people are ducking your calls,

1654
01:44:34,121 --> 01:44:36,210
that will show up as
somebody else's phone call.

1655
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:40,800
You can disguise your voice to sound
like a woman or a man. And uh, yeah,

1656
01:44:40,801 --> 01:44:44,300
I guess you could find out where they
are in case you know. I don't know what,

1657
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:46,700
there's another good one.
Our Danny Woodhead,

1658
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:50,960
you know the fucking Allpro for the
fucking New England patriots, right?

1659
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:55,050
Danny Woodhead as Modell's employees
selling his own Reebok Jersey.

1660
01:44:55,051 --> 01:44:58,410
He stands in a Modell's selling his
own Jersey in New England and nobody

1661
01:44:58,411 --> 01:45:00,780
recognizes him.
Uh,

1662
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,390
now the youtube and these will all
be up on the [inaudible] podcast.

1663
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:07,220
A the cliff Lee signing did
not make the boss happy.

1664
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:12,610
This is actually a total rip off video
of a video that a yes Canadiens fan made.

1665
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,180
Um, or someone who hated the
Canadians a year ago. Uh,

1666
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,590
they just took this footage of somebody
playing Hitler and a movie flipping out.

1667
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:25,480
Um, just know that it is a rip
off, but it's funny, I guess. Uh,

1668
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,330
what else do I have here? I think that's
it. Is that it? That is it. All right.

1669
01:45:30,331 --> 01:45:33,540
All those videos will be up there.
I apologize for the Charpie podcast.

1670
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:36,360
They can't all be great hour and
five minutes. And by the way,

1671
01:45:36,361 --> 01:45:41,190
there's some maniac out. They're
transcribing my podcasts and Mark Marin's.

1672
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:45,890
Okay.
And I think Adam Carolla's and uh,

1673
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,950
how about a round of applause for that
fucking trooper actually sat down and was

1674
01:45:49,951 --> 01:45:52,620
reading,
I read like three minutes of my podcast.

1675
01:45:52,621 --> 01:45:57,540
The guy gets like every fucking
word. God bless Ya. You, ah,

1676
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:01,280
that is it. That's the podcast for this
week. You guys all have a merry Christmas.

1677
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:06,140
Happy Kwanzaa. Happy Hanukkah.
