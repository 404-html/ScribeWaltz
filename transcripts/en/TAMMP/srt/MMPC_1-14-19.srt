1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,010
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:04,740
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:09,450
January 13th,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,350
2018 what's going on? How, why?
Yeah. How's it going? I know. I'm,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,700
I know I'm late.
I know I'm fucking late.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,070
Like your girlfriend after prom night.

7
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:23,970
All [inaudible] sorry for the bad joke.

8
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:27,140
And this is going to be a lot of bad
jokes on this. This is old Billy jet lag.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,250
All right. You know, remember buddy,

10
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:33,000
love in fucking the nutty professor.

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,860
You know, it was a cooler version of
him. Um, I'm not cool on any level,

12
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,990
so it just becomes worse versions of me.

13
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,440
And today you're going to be
listening to old Billy jet lag.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,270
It's five 41 in the morning and
I'd been up for the last two hours.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,980
Uh, you know, I don't, I'm, I'm
on. Yeah, I'm on, I'm back in La.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,540
I'm going, going back
back to Billy. Billy.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,910
I'm all American belly again.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,580
And I'm so glad to be back in a
country that likes Donald Trump.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,200
You know,
it's about time.

20
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,980
And I know there's a few Hollywood people
out here that are trying to make it

21
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:15,981
seem like there's a bunch of people out
there that don't care for Donald Trump

22
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,800
and it's just simply not the case.

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,650
The guy has the highest approval
rating of any president ever.

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,600
He has a higher approval rating then.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,060
Then I'll dictators where people are
afraid to say they don't like him.

26
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:37,240
This is all true stuff. You know, it's
funny as he will quote this podcast as a,

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,330
as a fan, as a fact to say
that shit about himself. Um,

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,130
all right. I thought I could do my podcast
with my mouth guardian. I can't do it.

29
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,250
Hang on a second. Hang on a
second. All right, I'm back.

30
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,640
I know what you guys are thinking. Like
Jesus Christ. Bill, you're 50 years old.

31
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,680
You still have a mouth guard.
You're still wearing a fucking retainer,

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,520
huh? What are you going to use
sophomore semiformal next week? Um, no,

33
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,990
I got that Invisalign and I'm actually,
Yay.

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,000
I listened to what the dentist
says, which is, you know,

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,760
all these people get Invisalign.
They go through all the fucking,

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,790
the pain in the ass shit
of having this stuff.

37
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,830
And then when the second
day I had done that,

38
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,390
give them the mouth guard
and they don't wear it,

39
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,600
and then their teeth gradually
just become trucking again. Not me,

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,310
not me.
I'm smarter than that.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,810
Okay.

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,450
I pay for this shit,
you know?

43
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,310
But it's like getting your car fixed and
you go out and you fucking sideswipe a

44
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:34,810
tree.
Why would you do that?

45
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,500
Okay.

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,140
You know,
you may not have a lot of things in life,

47
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:42,890
but if you could have nice straight teeth
that gets you through a lot of stuff,

48
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,870
cops literally show up, you know?
Why did you beat that woman?

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,420
I didn't beat her. Oh, look at his
big shiny teeth. Hey Sweetheart,

50
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:55,880
what were you wearing that made
them do that? That's what happens.

51
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,220
That's how you get out of it.
Um, anyways, I'm very, very, uh,

52
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,250
happy to come back. My, Oh my God,
my daughter gave me like four.

53
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,100
The greatest hugs I've ever gotten in
my life when I got home. It was awesome.

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,010
And it's so weird, you know, when
they're that little, they hug gear,

55
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,260
but then immediately I want to go run
and go do something else, you know,

56
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,590
and Gosh, she doesn't even care.
And then she kept coming back,

57
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,860
hugging me before she'd go run back
over to a toy. So it was pretty, uh,

58
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,420
it was pretty awesome. Uh,
we finished the tour strong.

59
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,310
Um,

60
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,090
I don't even know what the hell last day
I talked to you where the hell I was.

61
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,560
I don't know. I want to say I was
on my way to pull in, was it Warsaw?

62
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,330
Berlin? Yeah, Prague and then Vienna.

63
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,150
And um,
all of them would just,

64
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,950
they were amazing or so we went there and,
uh,

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,650
I actually talked to Versie for his,
he has a patrion page as do I.

66
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,990
And I did a little quick
half hour podcast with him.

67
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,020
The only one of the only country that
we met on this trip was in Warsaw at our

68
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:03,340
hotel was a place that kind
of looked like a restaurant,

69
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,600
kind of looked like a cafe.

70
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,510
And we went in there and
we were immediately told
by the waiter that it was a

71
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,890
chocolate factory. He kept
saying that like, we are looking,

72
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,600
we wanted to get something to eat and
they had all this chocolate shit there,

73
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,310
but they also had sandwiches and stuff
like that. So verse, he says to him,

74
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:20,530
he goes like, Hey, so uh, what
would you say is your, uh,

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,510
what would you recommend? What's the best
thing on? And he goes, what did he say?

76
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:29,860
He said, uh, chocolate to make it easy.

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,480
If I could, if I could sum it
up, chocolate, like a, all right,

78
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:38,330
we want some sandwiches. Is, is this a
good sandwich? He's like, yeah, yeah,

79
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:40,930
it's good. It's good.
It's like that. Right?

80
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,370
Then he just kept having a fucking comment
on everything that we were going to

81
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:49,270
do after we ate. He goes, you want
something else? He wants something else.

82
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,390
And I go, AH, right. You know, maybe
I'll get a hot chocolate or something.

83
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,020
Then you'd be like, you showed
you have room. It's like, well,

84
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,480
if you don't think I'm think up too
full after, what the fuck I ate,

85
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:03,070
why would you ask me you fucking
skinny con. He was such a fucking cunt.

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,340
He was such a cunt. So then
I go up to, I said, you know,

87
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,950
I'll get some hot chocolate. He
goes, well, Vince Vaughn, we have,

88
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,180
okay the [inaudible], we are a chocolate
factory. It's like, no, do not a factory.

89
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,200
You're not making the chocolate
here. You stupid skinny. Can't,

90
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,500
you know I am this upset about it
was cause I kept thinking like, oh,

91
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,290
I'm being the ugly American.
Maybe I should be even nicer to this guy.

92
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,820
And the nice dry was the more of a Canty
was. And then in the end, you know,

93
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,260
when he was such a con, Versie
got mad first. He never gets mad.

94
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,060
I'll get mad at fucking net on that.

95
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,180
Fucking Goddamn by peacock for
some reason popped in my head.

96
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:41,530
First is trying to think
pigeon. Um, oh my God,

97
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:45,800
that guy is a temper. He got mad
at a peacock, um, even verse,

98
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:48,400
he was upset by the end.
And then when I saw him getting upset,

99
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,790
I realized how ridiculous was that. I
was getting upset. I just said, Paul,

100
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,070
he works in a chocolate factory.

101
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,970
We're going to go tell jokes and a
fucking basketball arena in Warsaw.

102
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,020
And uh, so then we both laughed and were
like, all right buddy, take it easy,

103
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:05,580
you know?
And I gotta tell you though,

104
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,570
the hot chocolate was the shit they get
came over with a little trio of them.

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,040
One of them, one of the hot chocolates
was white. It's like white chocolate,

106
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,080
you know, which was,
which was, uh, you know,

107
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,020
should have been my nickname when I
played basketball, but I wasn't good.

108
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,880
So that kid from Sacramento got it.

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,130
Then there was another one
was just chocolate chocolate,

110
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:25,320
and then it was coffee chocolate
and I fucking hate coffee.

111
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:28,590
So I gave that DePaul the white
chocolate was fucking bananas.

112
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,660
So the guy comes over and I'm
still trying to be friendly

113
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,230
and uh, I got all the hot chocolate
was delicious and he's like, really?

114
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,060
And I was like, yeah, this one here. And
I pointed to the white one. That one was,

115
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:43,860
it was fucking amazing. Right. I
didn't say amazing. Fucking amazing.

116
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:48,160
I said it was amazing. And he goes, oh,
he must have a sweet tooth. Oh, sorry.

117
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,520
Okay. All right. You know,
he was like so skinny.

118
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,320
You could have beaten
him with his own body.

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,273
Yeah.

120
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,580
He was like, he was like, like a
nightstick with a fucking head.

121
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
Um, is, does a chocolate fan.
Oh, Ben versus he went up
to after his, cause he had,

122
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,470
you know, a burger, whatever
the fuck you guys can I get,

123
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:16,280
just get a piece of chocolate and the
guys, I guess you could just want one.

124
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:19,130
You're going to get, eat it so fast.
The first he's like, I just want one.

125
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,260
You know, you know, they all over
there. They fan from World War Two.

126
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:27,260
They have like the, you know, the butcher
of Baghdad or some shit like that,

127
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:31,070
which is the Middle East. You know, we
would joke and he was the kind of Warsaw,

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but as Conti as he was and is frustrated
as I was that I couldn't find a little

129
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,030
Polish flag. You know, that's what I
do. When I go on the road, I find those,

130
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,930
you know, those things that back in the
day people would, so until like a jacket,

131
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,280
I'm not doing that. I'm
going to frame him. Um,

132
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,990
I got to have some sort of framework
and open and close it where, you know,

133
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:54,770
cause it's a work in progress where I'm
going to go and I'm just want to keep

134
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,100
adding to it.
And uh,

135
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,500
I couldn't get the Polish flag because
I took a picture of the collage of them

136
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,550
and put it on Instagram.

137
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,370
A lot of people gave me shit because I
didn't have the Polish flag or the German

138
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:07,670
flag. I already have a German flag.
I'd already been to Cologne before.

139
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,940
That's why I didn't have that and I didn't
have the Polish flag because I simply

140
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:17,240
could not find a place,
a souvenir place in the time allotted.

141
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,840
I went down into the subway,
the od, the bound and um,

142
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,920
they literally had a Polish flag
and they had magnets and shit,

143
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,880
but they didn't have the other one.

144
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,590
So I'm just going to order
one off the internet today,
today, today, today, today.

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
Um,
so anyways,

146
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,660
then we went out and did the show and
it was in like this fucking basketball

147
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,930
arena and which it was,
it was fucking unbelievable.

148
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,600
The tour was great, but somewhere when
it, somewhere in Latvia and then Budapest,

149
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:47,840
it just went to another level.
Um,

150
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,230
and then the rest of the
tour, I, I, you know,

151
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,440
I was in Budapest on stage going like,
I think I would shoot a special here.

152
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,080
And when I went to a Warsaw, we were in
this little basketball arena type thing.

153
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,520
Um, and they had a stool
and that this the, you know,

154
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:07,520
the seat was all fucked up and
I just started making fun of it,

155
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:09,830
going to come out war. So come
on, you can do better than that.

156
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:13,490
And they had a great sense of humor about
themselves. I just, you know, I dunno,

157
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,680
it was just one of those things
I riffed on the stool and just,

158
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,560
just went from there.
Then I went to Berlin,

159
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,170
did a little shopping for the
ladies in my life, you know,

160
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,210
try to find them some sneakers and shit.
And it was incredible.

161
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:30,080
You went there and they had like this
whole sort of like the Saks fifth avenue

162
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,760
of Berlin in, in the middle of all that,
I should post a picture. They had, um,

163
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,670
this beautiful church that was built
before the time of World War II and it was

164
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:41,600
all bombed out.

165
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,740
Like one of the spires was busted off the
top of it and it was like bullet holes

166
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:47,280
and everything in it and they kept it,

167
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,520
it turns it into a store
or something like that.

168
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,820
But it was a reminder of World War Two
and right next to it was this ultra

169
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:54,380
modern building that they were making.

170
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:58,150
It was really a really interesting and uh,

171
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,780
I would like to go back,

172
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,400
okay,

173
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,300
there again soon. And the next time
I do Germany and I go into Warsaw,

174
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,260
as I mentioned before, that never wanted
to go to Auswitch or anything like that.

175
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:13,880
But now I kind of went down this rabbit
hole and I was looking up all of that

176
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,241
stuff.

177
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:17,390
And as much as you don't want to go
there to see that level of fucking evil,

178
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:21,770
it's kind of a good thing
to be reminded that,

179
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,060
you know, an entire nation of people can
be talked into some shit like that. Um,

180
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,240
and another thing that blew my mind
was when we were in Nuremberg. Um,

181
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,590
and I know it's still want
to make Germany. Yeah,

182
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,890
this is all that it is because the food
was fucking great. The people were great.

183
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,700
But uh, there is that fascination.
So they have a field there.

184
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,940
Zeplin field,
I believe it's called,

185
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,900
and it's not led Zepplin like literally
the guy who invented the Zipline,

186
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:51,740
I think landed there and that's where
they had those giant Nazi fucking rallies,

187
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,730
um, way back in the day.
And that place still exists.

188
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,110
They've taken down all the pillars,

189
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:01,760
but you could just walk in there and
literally stand where Hitler and all those

190
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,090
fucking lunatic stood.
And um,

191
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,450
I dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck it is over there.

192
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,730
I wanna just like the beaches of
normally do you just go there?

193
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:11,660
It's just a beach,

194
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,740
but it's a really like fucking emotional
thing when you go there like Jesus

195
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,700
Christ and then you see
like what was stopped,

196
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,310
how great that is. But now you see
where the fuck that we've ended up.

197
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,140
And it's just really a, you know, human
beings were, were extreme where uh,

198
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,990
you know, we're kind of like at the
Jaguar in the, in the uh, or the Jaguar,

199
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:40,790
however you say saying a mid
eighties Jaguar, you know,
it's a great fucking car,

200
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,010
you know, it's beautiful and all of that,
but it fucking breaks down all the time.

201
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,090
It always needs to be fixed.

202
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,390
Um, and I was teasing him over
in Germany about that shit.

203
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,110
I was quick to tell them that we've,

204
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,890
my country has done everything that
you guys have done. We just fucking,

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,030
it's just wasn't filmed.
You know what I'm saying?

206
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:06,610
Which is weird cause I go when
I go over to Germany and shit,

207
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,670
I was talking about this, how I sit there
and think like, oh my God, this is like,

208
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,403
you know,
Hitler,

209
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,400
he gave a speech here and there was a
concentration camp over there. But when,

210
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,630
you know,
I'm down south,

211
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:19,450
I don't think when I'm at a waffle
house that maybe this would used to be a

212
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:23,360
plantation and someone got fucking
beaten to death. There were,

213
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,170
they were running away from their
slave man, I never think of that shit.

214
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,650
Or this is where native Americans were
and they would just sort of hanging out.

215
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,250
We fucking came in and
murdered all of them. Oh,

216
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:37,060
isn't this a fun podcast? Um, so anyways,

217
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:40,840
after Berlin we then went down to the
Czech Republic and I performed in this

218
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:45,070
theater that was basically where
they would have all the, the uh,

219
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,870
the, uh, the communist rallies,

220
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,640
you know, in communism is yet
another thing that gets a bad rap.

221
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,510
Communism gets a bell. It does work. It
does Burger. It's like none of them work.

222
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,090
None of them work because they
work in theory, in theory. Hey man,

223
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:07,300
everybody has the same stuff man.
And everybody lives community.

224
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,900
That works if everybody buys in,
but they don't cause it's always constant,

225
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,820
the top that want fucking more. And then
there's also people who think, well,

226
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,720
you know, if there's no reward for
fucking working harder than somebody else,

227
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:22,990
I'm just going to coast con.
Right?

228
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,590
And then you have capitalism a whoever's
the fucking best fuck and the bad,

229
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:29,200
the bad. They're going to fucking the,
and it's, that's not how it works.

230
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,670
It's not how it works.

231
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,330
Whoever's the best whatever will now be
absorbed by a corporation or crushed is

232
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:41,080
how it works. And um, I don't know
if you think it's fucking working,

233
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,690
you're not paying attention
to our bottom line right now.

234
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:48,691
This country is bankrupt and has been
bankrupt since fucking 2008 as far as I

235
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:53,830
can tell. And everybody's just
ignoring it. I mean, Jesus Christ,

236
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,500
Clemson won the national championship.

237
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,220
They go to the White House and they
got fucking Domino's and Wendy's

238
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,030
and everybody's blaming Donald Trump.
Like,

239
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,150
what kind of a fucking asshole does that?
And they're blaming the shutdown.

240
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,770
It's like gay guys, we are bankrupt. Okay.

241
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,570
This is what poor people eat.
They eat fast food. All right,

242
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,350
I'm sorry. That's a wakeup call to
where the fuck we're at right now.

243
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,270
But we are fucking bankrupt and I don't
agree with a lot of shit that Trump's

244
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:28,810
doing,

245
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,810
but if that guy can somehow get us out
of these fucking wars so we can begin to

246
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:38,920
try and figure out how to pay him
back. I mean, I, I don't, I don't know.

247
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:43,540
Uh, yeah, I don't get
like whatever. I mean,

248
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,070
I know what the fuck
we're doing over there.

249
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,470
Everybody knows what the fuck we're
doing over there and then everybody knows

250
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,500
what we're saying that we're doing over
there and it's two completely fucking

251
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:54,270
different. Um, anyways,

252
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:55,850
I don't want to get on a
whole fucking thing. It,

253
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:57,480
cause I don't pay
attention to enough of it.

254
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,270
But it seems to me that we are fucking,

255
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,630
we spent $1 trillion to stop 3,500 fucking
jerk offs is what we're doing now on

256
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:09,960
a jungle gym that don't have a planer,
a fucking boat.

257
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,370
And we'd gone bankrupt doing that
in like a half a dozen corporations,

258
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:19,371
made a zillion dollars off of it and
continued to try and keep us over there

259
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:22,230
cause they also own media.
So no one is,

260
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,000
hopefully people will begin to
talk about this shit cause uh,

261
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,600
I know this doesn't sound patriotic
because now patriotism is just support the

262
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:32,820
troops. I support the troops, you
know, and if you don't have, you know,

263
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,700
support the troops, get the fuck out
of the country. And it's like, okay,

264
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,690
I support the troops,

265
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:41,691
but can I logically talk financially
what the fuck we've done so that our kids

266
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,860
are kids, kids are kids, kids, kids, kids,

267
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,470
kids all the way down the line won't
still be paying for this fucking thing.

268
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,283
MMM.

269
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,870
And you know what? I am open to discussion
here. Let's, let's fucking open this up.

270
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:54,970
We got the call,
we got the fucking lines open.

271
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,630
Can Somebody please explain
to me financially how
we're going to get out from

272
00:15:58,631 --> 00:15:59,464
underneath us?

273
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,593
MMM.

274
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,170
I did feel good when I was in Germany
that they were going to switch to

275
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,220
renewable energy,

276
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,520
which I think is the solution to Middle
Eastern terrorism because it seems all

277
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:16,040
the oil money that they make up for oil
is funneled through the mosque and then

278
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:20,150
financed to these groups that we
don't like that want to kill us.

279
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,860
So if we stopped buying their oil,

280
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,820
they count have any money and then
they don't even have a jungle gym.

281
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,900
Is that, is that too? I'm sure that's
too simple, but I do this a lot.

282
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,910
I say ignorant shit and then
people straighten me out.

283
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,500
So I ask is that if you think I'm way off
base and right now you're screaming at

284
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,430
your fucking windshield,

285
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,700
calm the fuck down and just explain to
me how our space I am and I will listen.

286
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,370
I can be swayed.
I don't have confidence in my opinion.

287
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,730
I deliver it with confidence. But in
the back of my book, my head, there's,

288
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,430
there's always that voice be a pill.
You don't read, you don't read books.

289
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,430
All right? So we went to, uh,

290
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,170
we went to Prague and we,
uh,

291
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,850
we performed at this place where I
imagined Bresch Never Gorbachev fits,

292
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:09,684
spoke at.

293
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,790
And I got such a kick out of being in
there is far as like all the shit talk.

294
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,530
And that must've been done about
the United States of America.

295
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,420
And I was Sorta refund imitating them
comrade. They don't have fat over there.

296
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,990
They have fat and they fucked
her six sisters, all that shit.

297
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:27,610
And then I was there
telling my Dick Jokes,

298
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,770
but that crowd was fucking unbelievable
and they just rolled with everything.

299
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,080
And I gotta be honest with you,
I haven't felt that much.

300
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,110
I haven't had that much fun on fucking
stage in forever because of what's going

301
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:45,000
on with stand up comedy.
I actually was able to get away.

302
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:49,290
I kept tagging all of my jokes
going and if I said that in America,

303
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,760
my career would be over.
And they all laughed.

304
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,740
They all laughed, you know. So, once
again, as I stated in my last podcast,

305
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,850
comedians, okay, we're, you know,
we need to stick up for each other.

306
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:07,050
We don't need to be taking
each other down about material.

307
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,690
There's literally comedians going online
tweeting about people's material and

308
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,240
saying, maybe they
shouldn't, they're there.

309
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,170
Everybody's Comedians are turning
into Al Gore's wife. You know,

310
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:22,320
when she used to attack heavy metal, like
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

311
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:25,890
but for the love of God,
shut up, use your head,

312
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,990
cause you're chopping
your own fucking head off.

313
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,280
Eventually that shit is the water's gonna
rise up around your ankles and you can

314
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,250
eventually you're going to drown in
the bullshit that you're creating here.

315
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,200
So anyways, we were over there, had
a great show, we found a cigar bar,

316
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,300
um, smoked a wonderful partake agis
party guests are the fuck you say.

317
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,780
Um, tomato, tomato. And then we went
back to the hotel room and be like,

318
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:52,050
can you imagine if the fucking
Kansas City colts game was on?

319
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,210
And they had this sports channel seven,

320
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:58,710
they are over there and we got it and
we fucking lost our minds. And it like,

321
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,410
you know, midnight over there,
we were watching the second,

322
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,560
third and fourth quarter. No,
because we watched the second half.

323
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,990
So we kind of missed all the scoring.
Um,

324
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,270
and I would say this,
I will say this,

325
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:17,160
the Patriots game and the chiefs game,
uh,

326
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,200
both of those defenses that you saw,

327
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,140
the Patriots' defense and the chief's
defense, every, it's like, wow,

328
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,260
what's going on? These guys really figured
something out. What you were seeing,

329
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:30,261
there was two teams that were just
totally out coaching the other team.

330
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,390
They had a game plan that worked and
the other team could not adjust to it.

331
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,230
All right. The chief's defense
is not as good as it looked.

332
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,260
The Patriots' defense is not as
good as it looked against the colts.

333
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,460
That's what I took away from both
of those fucking games. So, um,

334
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,670
I'm an old school guy. I know that the
game is played a different way now. Uh,

335
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,780
when you go for two point convergence,
it's with an entire fucking quarter left.

336
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,960
Um,
I know it's all about offense,

337
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:05,961
but I still believe that defense wins
Superbowls despite last year's Superbowl.

338
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,530
You know, if you really look
at it all, all, you know,

339
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,670
they only needed to
make one defensive play.

340
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,050
One big defensive play was made
and that changed the game. So, um,

341
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,200
I dunno,

342
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,770
I am definitely skeptical as to whether
the Patriots or the chiefs can win the

343
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:27,750
Superbowl with their defenses.
Um, having said that,

344
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,410
uh,

345
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,930
I'm very excited for this match up the
rematch and the Patriots have to go into

346
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,950
arrowhead after already beating the Kansas
city chiefs by the skin of our teeth

347
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:43,860
letting up 40, 41 points. Was
it 44 40 or something like that.

348
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,443
Um,

349
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,410
even though we them last time it was
by no means impressive defensively,

350
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,680
you know, which is why, you
know, we beat the chargers.

351
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,320
Somebody wrote, had this hilarious
tweet where they said, okay,

352
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,220
you know, it's the poor
chargers, you know,

353
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:08,640
it's so difficult to find a
quarterback that can beat Tom Brady.

354
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,440
And then they had a picture of,

355
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,700
of Eli Manning when he first got drafted
by the charges holding up the jerseys.

356
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,751
And then of course,

357
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:19,320
all these other fans rather than getting
the joke that the joke was making fun

358
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,370
of the chargers decision to get ready.
Eli Manning,

359
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:27,510
forget about drew Brees,
um, someone's world, um,

360
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:30,990
and then showed a picture of nick falls
and it's like they weren't talking about

361
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,130
the eagles and that's,

362
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,370
that is something that does bug me
though as a patriots fan that people are

363
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:38,850
trying to say nick foals beat Tom Brady.
He didn't,

364
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:43,110
he beat the fucking Patriots' defense.
All right.

365
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,490
Cause if you look them at the Patriots,
you know,

366
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,950
Brady versus falls Brady only through,

367
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:53,220
I mean foals only through for like 300
something yards breakthrough for over 500

368
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:57,690
fucking yards and lost
fucking ridiculous.

369
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,920
So having said that,

370
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,070
maybe the Patriots and the chiefs
may be one of them could win that,

371
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:06,060
the Superbowl. But my pick has been
the fucking New Orleans saints,

372
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,430
which I was really nervous about
when they were down 14 to nothing.

373
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,820
And I love nick false.
I fucking love that guy.

374
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:18,690
That guy he plays, you know,
he's one of those, he's like,

375
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:23,190
he liked the bigger the game is the
better that guy plays and the bullshit way

376
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:26,730
that that organization keeps
putting him on the fucking bench.

377
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,380
Cause they got so much money
invested I guess in Carson Wentz.

378
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,050
Not saying that that guy's bad
cause he did great, but you know,

379
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:36,450
a lot of people would demand a
trade or something like that.

380
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:38,360
He just fucking sits there and it's like,
hi,

381
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,200
when do you need me and when you do I'm
going to go in and crush it. So, um,

382
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,930
I dunno,
it was kind of funny though,

383
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,920
watching Eagle fans all patting themselves
on the back about how great they are

384
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,450
because they weren't sending death
threats to that wide receiver who had the

385
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:58,110
ball go through his, his
hands, which is a great thing.

386
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,350
And it was impressive that they
didn't do that, but they got a little,

387
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,590
they got a little ahead of
themselves about how great they are.

388
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,080
They kind of forget that they
have the jail in their stadium.

389
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,550
They kind of forget that an entire row
of eagle fans thinks nothing of beating

390
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:19,630
up a father who's there with his child
because he has a different jersey on or

391
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,990
spitting on him or puking on him.
Oh, throwing shit. Just, you know,

392
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:24,340
take it down a little bit.

393
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,480
Eagles fans are such assholes.

394
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,470
They actually think they're good people
for the simple fact that they didn't

395
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:35,320
send it death threat.
You know what you guys sound like,

396
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,000
you sound like feminists right now.

397
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,310
The only one you didn't
do is call yourself brave.

398
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,440
He dropped the ball and we didn't
send death. Threats were so brave.

399
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,140
We're where warriors, um, anyways,

400
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,920
sorry to Eagle nation.
Tough fucking loss. Um,

401
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,410
I was loving what even though you
were going to fuck up my pick,

402
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:58,550
I was loving what you guys were doing,
um,

403
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,580
when it was 14 to nothing and um,

404
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,010
yeah,

405
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,311
you know,

406
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:08,180
you did defending super bowl champions
and I felt you weren't getting your

407
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,040
respect the same way.

408
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,280
I can't say the Patriots deserve respect
this year and we've taken some brutal

409
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:16,610
losses,
but it was in the back of my head.

410
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,490
I was kind of hoping that the Patriots
and the eagles would both make it

411
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,383
mmm.

412
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,200
To the super bowl again,
just to shut all these fucking people up,

413
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,480
but we shall see. All
right. Having said that,

414
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,960
we have to go into Arrowhead stadium,

415
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,600
the loudest fans in the league,

416
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,430
they don't need a stadium
that is architecturally
designed to make them sound

417
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:43,300
louder than they really are.
They are fucking loud as shit.

418
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,160
They are so fucking sick of the Patriots.
They always beat us,

419
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,480
you know, early in the season or give us
a good game. And every year it's like,

420
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:56,640
this is the year it's going to be over.
I told you that guy, that guy I saw on,

421
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,813
uh,

422
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,710
I was in that sports bar in New York
City and that guy was just screaming,

423
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,530
this is, it's all over.
This is what it is now.

424
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:09,670
And he was losing his shit about
wanting to beat the patriots,

425
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:10,630
who's a chiefs fan.

426
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,030
And he just kept yelling sporadically
and then it just became nonstop yelling

427
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:20,020
until he was tapped on the shoulder,
ask to go. He got up peacefully,

428
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,190
put his coat on and continued to
scream at the TV right out into public.

429
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,040
And I was just sitting there being like,
wow man,

430
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,590
that's how much people hate the Patriots.

431
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,340
And also I've been there as you know,

432
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,290
back when the old school patriots fans,

433
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:39,550
certainly a red sox fan and a Bruins fan
when we couldn't beat the Canadians and

434
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:42,160
all of that shit. So I kind of knew
what that guy was going for. So

435
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,650
it's going to be a weird game where I
want to see the Patriots win obviously.

436
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,540
But if the chiefs go to the
Super Bowl, uh, that'll be
really, really fucking cool.

437
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,460
I mean, they have not been there
since fucking Superbowl for everybody.

438
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,700
67 68, 69, 1970

439
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,813
mmm.

440
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,450
64 toss power trap, right. Hank scramp
way the fuck back then when they played,

441
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:12,160
played the Vikings, um, super
bowl for what are we up to now?

442
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,780
Superbowl 50 something.

443
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:18,540
I've even lost track and I'm a fucking
nerd about this shit. So with that, oh,

444
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:22,960
and the rams, the rams beat the cowboys.
I missed that game. And then I miss the,

445
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:27,640
uh, I missed another game. I
forgot what the other, no, I don't,

446
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,610
I think I saw both AFC games. I saw
parts of three of four of them. Um,

447
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,150
but now I am back. I'm
back when, you know, it's,

448
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,320
you know what's Hilarious is,
uh,

449
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,050
I have a birthday party you have to go
to for a very special in my own daughter

450
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,460
coming up this week.

451
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:48,160
So I'm going to be missing some of the
playoffs because old daddy makes the,

452
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,370
I make a birthday cake from scratch
every year. That's what I'm going to do.

453
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,600
And I get, I got to do that. You know,
you got to do shit like that. Um,

454
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,230
anyways. All right. So

455
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,730
yeah,

456
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,050
I took a bunch of Saunas when I was
over there in Europe and uh, oh,

457
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,360
I didn't even talk about the cities by
the way. And even talking about Vienna,

458
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,070
then I go to Vienna in Vienna,

459
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:13,071
had like this incredible fucking theater
and this club owner to the club owners.

460
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,610
Okay.

461
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,620
They were just the nicest people ever.

462
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:20,160
And they were feeding us
like an Italian grandmother,

463
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,010
like I even know what that is.
The way verse he always described,

464
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:27,210
it just would not say no, just
kept bringing out, you know,

465
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,960
Vino Schnitzel, Lynn and, and
then all these desserts, you know,

466
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,230
I love all desserts over there is like a
tray of cheese or like something sugary

467
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:37,140
and it was just,

468
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,390
yeah,

469
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,570
it was unbelievable.
I think I consumed like 3000 calories,

470
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:45,380
but it's European calories,
so it's not like the poison over here.

471
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:49,160
So I woke up the next day being like,
how am I not fatter? Oh, that's right.

472
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,100
I got out from under my own food
supply, so I want to thank them too. Um,

473
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,600
Prague, I gotta tell
you, Prague and Budapest,

474
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,250
a lot of American sleep on those cities.
Um,

475
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,480
okay.

476
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,650
Absolutely gorgeous.

477
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:08,180
Like I would say even Prague is like
the Paris of the Midwest of Europe.

478
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,320
As far as my little, you know, I didn't
get to see too much of it, but just,

479
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,210
yeah.

480
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,850
You know, driving from the
airport and looking at it,

481
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:20,660
it was like both of those cities
were a, were breathtaking. And, um,

482
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:21,740
okay.

483
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,990
All right. My stupid computer keeps
shutting down here. Um, anyways.

484
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay.

485
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,210
I watched the rest of pappy onto
the original one when I came back,

486
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,240
when I flew back, man, that
was fucking incredible.

487
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:38,500
And then I watched this two
hour documentary, which I
forget what it was called,

488
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,380
okay.

489
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,900
About the crossfit championships.

490
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:43,810
Okay.

491
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:48,240
And it mainly focused on the women and
stuff like that. And uh, you know what,

492
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,630
like I said earlier where I
could be wrong about our, our uh,

493
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,003
yeah,

494
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,390
our foreign policy.
I think I was wrong about crossfit.

495
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,100
I'm watching what those people
were able to do physically,

496
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,950
but as an old man watching it,
I'm just going like,

497
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,300
I don't know how long these people's
bodies are going to last doing that. Um,

498
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,930
all of those fucking squats
and all of that shit with you,

499
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:15,170
Charlotte was all I was thinking. Knees
and shoulders, knees and shoulders,

500
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,330
you need those for the rest of your life.
However,

501
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:20,480
I think stem cell research is going
to get to the point where everyone's,

502
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,650
you know,

503
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,760
all their religious shit is going to go
by the wayside to just have the fucking

504
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:29,150
knees and shoulders of an 18
year old when you're 60. Um,

505
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:33,770
I'm telling you right now, there is going
to be some fucking jacked older people

506
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,890
in the future.
I got a buddy of mine,

507
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:41,710
he had a torn rotator cuff and he got
that shit injected in there and he doesn't

508
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:45,670
even have scar tissue.
It's fucking crazy. Um,

509
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,910
do I sound like a crazy person right
now I'm talking about foreign policy and

510
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:52,510
fucking stem cell research lab.
This is, this is all jet lag, Billy.

511
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,680
He's all over the fucking
map. Um, all right,

512
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:58,840
let me do a couple of reads and then I'm
going to tell you what it was like to

513
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,130
take a sauna in Germany.

514
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,570
All right. Um, okay. Butcher box.

515
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,830
A butcher blocks delivers healthy
100% grass fed, grass finished beef,

516
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,710
free range, orange chicken and the, the,

517
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:19,270
the the top shelf heritage bread.

518
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,400
Pork.
All right,

519
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,760
this is pure bred pigs that you can
trace the bloodline back to Europe.

520
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,660
All right. Fucking Rudolf Hess.
What an eighth is fucking poor.

521
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,090
The incredible quality of
butcher box. I, you know,

522
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:37,690
I did Rudel I didn't know that Rudolph
has, he left before all the evil,

523
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,020
evil shit went down. He was there
for the beginning of the evil,

524
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:44,260
like the game plan of it.
But before the final solution was,

525
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,430
was even put into place,
he fucking got on a plane and left.

526
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:53,200
They went to Scotland and there's all
this shit about whether Hitler knew he was

527
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:55,930
going to do it or if he deserted.

528
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,060
He went up there and tried to
make peace with England. It,

529
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:03,300
Winston Churchill was like,
no, and not making peace.

530
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,470
Go Fuck yourself and arrest this cunt.

531
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,680
And then he spent the rest of his life
in jail and then killed himself allegedly

532
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:15,790
at 93 where some people thought that
he was, uh, he was strangled. You know,

533
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,040
there's always people being or whatever.
But anyways,

534
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:23,041
one of the great quotes of all time when
Rudolph has got an a plane and flew up

535
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:28,540
to Scotland in the middle of
the war to try and make peace.

536
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,880
Hitler's close quote about Rudolf
Hess was, that guy's insane.

537
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,010
Okay.

538
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,590
I mean, that's just one of the
greatest fucking quotes ever.

539
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,590
Adolf Hitler called somebody insane.

540
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,000
That goes back to when I first
started in this business.

541
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,080
It was right around the time when
my favorite drummers of all time,

542
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,980
Steven Adler got kicked out of guns
and roses and their thing was, yeah,

543
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:01,550
he's doing too many drugs and
every comic had the joke. How many?

544
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,750
How much drugs are you doing
that the other members that
guns and roses go, yeah,

545
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:09,230
we got to get rid of this guy. He's
partying too much. That was, you know

546
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,650
that that was the guns and roses
version of when Hitler said,

547
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:20,330
Hey, Rudolph has is insane. All right.
All right. Back to butcher box, everybody.

548
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:25,190
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to start

549
00:32:25,191 --> 00:32:29,060
with the commitments are raising animals
humanely and free of antibiotics and

550
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:32,720
hormones before they killed him.
Cook with Pete, the peace of mind,

551
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,180
of knowing you're eating healthy,
high quality meat.

552
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,190
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

553
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,870
which is for 24 individual size meals.

554
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,860
If you have the discipline,
you know,

555
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:51,180
if you eat like that guy in seven who
ended up face down in his spaghetti o's,

556
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:54,660
I mean you're going to, you're going
to go through that shit in a week. Um,

557
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,330
you can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

558
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,430
beef and pork mixed box,

559
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:07,020
a custom box which lets you
choose your own cuts. Uh,

560
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,630
my favorite box cut is
I'm supposed to say,

561
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:14,550
I would say I'd have to go beef
and pork or maybe I go mix box

562
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,130
by like custom box too. You know,
I like a custom car. I Dunno.

563
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,530
Yeah,

564
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,490
I dunno because they just keep sending
me the shit for free cause they're liking

565
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,720
the way I'm reading this stuff.
Anyways.

566
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:30,370
Oh now we're announcing our new brand
of protein, what they find a new animal,

567
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,350
a wild Alaskan Salmon,
butcher box sources, sources.

568
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:39,910
They're pure, sustainably harvested
salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska.

569
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,660
Unlike any salmon you'll find in
your local store, literally is,

570
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,200
it's red color means that this salmon is
as fresh and nutrient rich as it gets.

571
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,560
For $20 off your first box
in two pounds of free salmon,

572
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,770
go to butcher box.com/burn enter bur bur
that's butcher box.com enter burr and

573
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:03,430
introvert. Sorry. You know what's
funny? I got, I got so sick of,

574
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:08,431
I'm watching comedians attacking
other comedians on Twitter and,

575
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,170
and people screaming about Trump that I,

576
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:15,460
I found somehow I find this place
where you could like maybe follow some

577
00:34:15,461 --> 00:34:18,970
different things on Twitter.
So I decided to go into the science world.

578
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:19,670
Okay.

579
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,250
Like this will fascinate me.
I'm such a poor science background.

580
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:23,960
Let me fucking read up on this shit.
Right?

581
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,920
And all they did was talk about how
we're destroying the environment.

582
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:31,760
And it was even more depressing than
listen to fucking morons yelling about

583
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:34,820
politics as I on this politics.

584
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,920
Politics on this podcast gave you my
solution for solving the Middle East

585
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:42,770
problems. I mean, how
Hypocritical Ama. So anyways,

586
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:45,950
I went on there and I found out some
snail, just the last one they called him.

587
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,040
George out in Hawaii has now died.

588
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:49,910
Okay.

589
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:54,900
And uh, evidently those things are going
to go extinct. stamps.com everybody

590
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,730
stamps.com is the faster and more
convenient way to get postage.

591
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,120
Simple. Use Your computer to print
official US postage for any letter,

592
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,030
any package, any class of mail,
anywhere you wanted to send it.

593
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,140
And the mail carrier picks it up.
No more lugging mail to the post office.

594
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:17,610
No more hassles man. With stamps.com
you get discounted postage rates,

595
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,040
uh, that you can't even
get at the post office.

596
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:23,850
Not to mention it's a fraction of the
cost of those expensive postage meters and

597
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:26,850
there's no equipment to at least
and no long term commitments.

598
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,560
I use stamps.com to send out
all my posters, Christmas gifts.

599
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,910
It's great. It's great. And right now,
and I'm a moron if I can figure it out.

600
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:38,730
So can you, and right now
you too can enjoy Stan stock,

601
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:42,900
the stamps.com service with a special

new year off, right. Go to stamps.com.

603
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:51,900
Click
on the
microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinburrthatstamps.com
enter

604
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:56,130
burr. All right, before I
do the reads this week, um,

605
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,980
I took a sauna when I was in,
uh,

606
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,430
Germany and evidently they,

607
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,410
I heard that they were naked. They go
into those saunas naked and it's coed.

608
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,490
So I asked for Z if he wanted to go
down to the sign and he said yes.

609
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,400
And then I texted him, he must've fell
asleep. So I said, fuck. I went down,

610
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,070
I worked out,
got a great workout in,

611
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,600
and then I went to go into the sun and
there was nobody in there. And the old me,

612
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:25,860
I like the steam. Now I really liked the
dry sauna because it can get way hotter.

613
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,290
You know, Joe Rogan converted me, right?

614
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,920
So I go in there and I went in there
like an American, I have my slippers on,

615
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:33,660
I had my towel on and all of that shit.

616
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,470
And then all of a sudden this dude comes
walking in, he has a towel on. I'm like,

617
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:40,410
oh, thank God, thank God it's
Berlin. Okay, it's brilliant. Okay,

618
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:44,160
this is like they're in New York City so
everybody is going to act accordingly.

619
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,730
And then he just immediately takes his
towel off and I'm like, what the fuck?

620
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,190
So then he lays and then lays down.

621
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,310
And what he did was he put his outside
leg, the leg close to me, he put it up.

622
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,310
So he was sort of covering his junk,
slashed,

623
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,900
looked like he was getting ready to do,

624
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:05,310
recreate the Burt Reynolds
playgirls center full.

625
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,190
Right.
So anyways,

626
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,680
and I know this is going to be the fucking
Photoshop. So I'm sitting there like,

627
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:16,380
yeah, what the fuck? All right. Whatever
one they could do it. Who gives a shit?

628
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,440
Right? And then all of a sudden another
guy comes in and this guy comes in,

629
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,770
he does, he have his towel on. He's just
holding his towel in front of his junk.

630
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,040
Then he goes in like it was
shaped like a horse shoe,

631
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:31,020
you know like the old fucking a
Denver Bronco Stadium back in the day.

632
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,320
So I'm on one side of the horse shoe.
I'm on like the visitor's side.

633
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,560
The first naked dude is on the fucking
home site and then this naked guy comes

634
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:41,940
in and he lays down the same way.

635
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:46,230
Same playgirl fucking thing
with the outside leg up.

636
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,960
He's sitting in the end zone seats. All
right. And I'm like Jesus fucking Christ.

637
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:55,920
So now I'm laughing cause all I'm thinking
is I to tell versus he cause at this

638
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:59,070
point it's just naked guys and
just naked guys. It's just funny.

639
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,750
I used to put in my act, a naked
man is either funny or scary, right?

640
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,050
If you're at a football game and a naked
guy jumps out of the crowd and runs

641
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,970
across the field,
you're laughing your ass off.

642
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,740
If you're walking home late at night,

643
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:12,870
then naked guy jumps out
of the fucking bushes.

644
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:16,920
It's one of the scariest things ever.
So this was just funny. I'm in a gym,

645
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,570
there's all kinds of
people around or whatever,

646
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:21,600
even though it's just the three of us in
there. But you know, I can just get up,

647
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:24,780
walk out the fucking door. There's no
danger here. There's two naked guys.

648
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,770
It's fucking hilarious.

649
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,870
So I'm looking down at the floor
and all I'm thinking about as,

650
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:32,670
I can't wait to tell version
of this fucking story.

651
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:35,660
They both lay in here and like fucking
twin Burt Reynolds and sitting here with

652
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:40,070
my slippers on and my towel,
I don't know.

653
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,060
So anyways,

654
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,240
and then all of a sudden the door opens
again and now a woman comes walking in

655
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,050
and I'm looking,
I kind of look at the guys like,

656
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,030
are they going to cover themselves up?
And they don't.

657
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,100
And then she comes in and just
takes her fucking towel off.

658
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,513
Yeah.

659
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,320
Oh,
just like what the fuck?

660
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,090
And then she sits down in the
end zone seats. All right,

661
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,680
so above her and the upper deck is this
naked guy to her left as the other naked

662
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,980
guy.
She's naked and now,

663
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,540
and she looks over at me and
I got a towel on his slippers.

664
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,760
So now I'm looking like the Weirdo. Now
I'm the fucking pervert. Like, look,

665
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:20,230
did this fucking guy, we're all getting
naked while you sitting over there. Right?

666
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,100
So now I'm like, well, I
gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

667
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,070
And just as I said that
the dude in the home seat,

668
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,750
he stands up and he's going to walk
out and I'm like, all right, perfect.

669
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,890
Now he's going to use the shower.

670
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:34,270
I'm just going to wait till
he's done with the shower,

671
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:38,770
then I'm going to fucking walk out. So
that's exactly what happens. I walk out,

672
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,090
but when I walk out, what I forgot to
mention was they had like, you know,

673
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:48,040
those ice baths that like NFL
players go to get into, um, bad,

674
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,850
something like that. But there wasn't
ice. It was just like, uh, it was a tank.

675
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:55,750
You climbed up like six steps and then
climb down into this thing and it was

676
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:58,750
freezing fucking cold right
after the sauna. Right.

677
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:00,250
And just closes up all your pores.

678
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:02,320
It gets rid of all the fucking
toxins and all of that.

679
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,740
All the shit washes off you.
Granted everybody else is using it.

680
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:09,040
So it's probably fucking gross
on some level. I have no idea.

681
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,130
Maybe because it's so cold, it
kills the shit. I don't know what.

682
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,750
So I wanted to use it,

683
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:17,200
but there was no way I was gonna use it
because I had to get up to the top of it

684
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,190
and take my towel off,

685
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:21,310
would be standing up there with my
fucking man who had twisted in the breeze

686
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,770
before I went down into
the fucking Arctic water.

687
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,170
But when I came out there was nobody
there. So I was like, I gotta,

688
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:33,580
I gotta try it. So I fucking
scampered up the ladder quickly,

689
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:37,150
took my towel off and then went
down into it and I was like, fuck.

690
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:42,100
It was freezing cold when all the way
up to like my neck and wanted to stay

691
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:45,310
there for a minute, but probably only
stayed there for like 15 seconds.

692
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,240
It was enough for me.

693
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,150
But plus also I knew other people were
going to come in and I didn't want to

694
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:51,580
come crawling out of
there completely naked,

695
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,900
like fucking Jason Alexander now with
my fucking junk all pulled up into me.

696
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,743
Right.

697
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,703
Okay.
Oh

698
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,510
the other dude's in the shower.
I could hear him.

699
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:03,460
So now I go to get out
of this fucking thing.

700
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:08,110
I get my towel on and everything and I
feel fucking amazing to go from that heat

701
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:11,050
to that call. Now I'm going to go into
the shower. It was fucking amazing.

702
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,091
So again,

703
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:16,990
out of the shower now all I want to
do is tell Versie the fucking story.

704
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,360
It'd be like, dude, even a chick
came in, this is fucking nuts.

705
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,230
And I reached into my robe and
I can't find my key to my locker

706
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,850
and like where the fuck is it?

707
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,800
Drop it with a foot and I'm looking
all around and I was in last time I

708
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:30,640
remembered having it.

709
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:35,270
I was holding it in my hand when I was
in the sauna because I didn't want to

710
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:38,630
leave it in the pocket of
my robe for some reason,

711
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,360
I didn't see like the band that
you could put it around your wrist.

712
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:43,550
I just didn't, you know,
I'm an idiot. And I saw,

713
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:48,020
I was just holding onto it and I suddenly
realized that it was still in the

714
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:48,920
fucking sauna.

715
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,480
Okay.

716
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,610
So now I have to go back into the sauna.

717
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:58,570
So I go back in there with my head down
with my fucking slippers on and my towel

718
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:05,371
on and I go back in there and the naked
woman is now laying down sideways facing

719
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:12,790
the door.
Okay.

720
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:17,950
Laying down where I was
sitting and I'm like,

721
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,590
I can't go over there with
my towel and be like, Hey,

722
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:22,830
I'm just looking for my keys. All
right there sweetheart. Right.

723
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:27,040
It felt like a fucking Weirdo.
So now I sat down,

724
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,680
she's sitting on the
fucking visitor's side.

725
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,360
Now I'm on the home side or whatever.

726
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,130
I might have fucked up
these things you don't want.

727
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:35,230
I mean I'm sitting on the opposite
side that I was sitting on

728
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,070
and I'm just sitting there
going, all right, well she was,

729
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,100
she's been in here for like 10 minutes.
She's going to fucking leave soon.

730
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,240
And when she does, I'm going to look
for my keys and she just won't leave.

731
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,260
She won't leave.

732
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,320
Yeah.

733
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,620
And then finally I just have to get up
cause I'm dying cause this is my second

734
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:53,150
trip.
And then I find when I say I'm sorry,

735
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:56,600
I think I left my key over here
and she's like, Oh I didn't see it.

736
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:59,660
And she's like sitting up
like fucking naked. Right.

737
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,610
Okay.

738
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,600
So now I go back over and I just fucking
sit down. No, I fucked up the story.

739
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,340
Okay.

740
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,630
I'm sitting down there going,

741
00:43:07,631 --> 00:43:11,320
what the fuck do I do now because I'm
dying to heat. And then all of a sudden

742
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,220
this couple comes walking in
and then they both get naked.

743
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,510
Now there's two naked
women are naked dude.

744
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,460
And then me all covered up.

745
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:28,420
And at this point now I
feel like a fucking Weirdo
Joe. I'm like, well fuck it.

746
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:30,580
I'm a Germany.
So now I take my towel off

747
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,640
and I'm just sitting there cracking up,
fucking laughing. Like, you know that you,

748
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,570
he just looked down and you just,
you know what it's like,

749
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:41,460
I'm gonna laugh my ass off,
but nobody's going to know.

750
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:44,070
So you don't make a sound and
you don't change your face,

751
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:46,530
you just have your mouth open
and you just kind of go, like,

752
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,300
I was literally doing that
while I was so fucking hot.

753
00:43:51,301 --> 00:43:53,610
I could feel my heartbeat in my ears.

754
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:54,970
Okay.

755
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,870
So at some point it just got so
hot and she wasn't leaving and it,

756
00:43:57,871 --> 00:43:58,810
she was like a pro.

757
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,650
So I finally just got up and I just sort
of had my towel cover myself and go,

758
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:05,620
I'm sorry. I think I left my cue over. And
she goes, oh, I did not see it. The BOBA.

759
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:06,880
Okay.

760
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,700
And I go, all right. So then I went
back and I sat down. That's what I did.

761
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:12,940
That's when I sat down and then she got
up and I was like, still going to go.

762
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,690
It's gotta be underneath or something.
So I waited for her to leave.

763
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:21,691
I toughed it out and then I walk over
there and I'm feeling around on the

764
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:25,810
fucking seats and shit
and it's just not there.

765
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:29,020
And they have the slats and I'm like,
it probably fell down in between it.

766
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,970
Now I'm going to have to walk
out with just my and robot,

767
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,430
go back to the front desk, pay
the fee, and all of this shit.

768
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,190
So now I walk out of the Sauna.

769
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,480
I'm fucking almost passing out
and to my left and my peripheral,

770
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,640
I see that woman again naked at the top
of the fucking ladder to go into the ice

771
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,670
bath. I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ.
I gotta get Outta here. Right?

772
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,410
And as I'm walking away,

773
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:58,010
you know [inaudible] I hear her
yelling over to somebody and I'm like,

774
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,780
I know she's not talking to me.
And then she just goes,

775
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,870
then she switches to English and she goes,
did you find your key?

776
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:12,240
And I kind of have turned but didn't
look at it and I go, no, no, I didn't.

777
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,340
And then she goes, is this it? And I
realized I had bets where I left it.

778
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:20,790
When I scampered up the
ladder to go there, I left
it at the top of the iceberg.

779
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,560
I go, Oh yeah it is. And then she stays
at the top of the ladder and just,

780
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,770
you know,
kinda hands.

781
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:31,870
And I walk over and literally her vagina
is above me and I kind of reached up,

782
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:33,800
like looking but not looking

783
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,650
dog has shade.

784
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,770
And that was so fucked up.

785
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:48,300
I didn't even take a shower and I just
walked out and I went to the locker room

786
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:51,570
and I went in there and I was like pouring
sweat and everyone was looking at me

787
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:55,680
like, well divided these shower
off. He's all red, like the tomato.

788
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,490
Um, anyways. And then I just,

789
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,910
I put my shit back on and
that, and that. There you go.

790
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:05,290
That's my German Sana
story. But I have, I got to,

791
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:09,380
I do have to tell you this though.
If you're completely naked in a sauna,

792
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,420
it's even better. It is even
better. It's fucking weird.

793
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:15,900
But you only can do it in a place. If
everybody's naked, then it isn't weird.

794
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,960
It isn't weird. And, uh,

795
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,620
if you're worried that you're going to
get a stiffy cause there's a naked woman

796
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:26,610
in there. There's also no other naked
men in there. So it neutralizes it.

797
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,830
Not to mention it's hot as shit.

798
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,080
Like I don't think anybody has ever
fucked in one of those hot naked, uh,

799
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,990
you know, the, that naked, the hot
yoga class, what do they call that?

800
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:39,330
The Bikram Yoga.
Like you can barely survive.

801
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,010
Fucking somebody is the last thing on
your mind when you're sitting at like 180

802
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:47,590
degree heat. But, uh,
anyways, bears my, um,

803
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,760
that was my, a story. It was hilarious.

804
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:53,910
I was worried that my junk was going to
look too small when I got into the ice

805
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,960
bath and I was worried that I was going
to fucking salute the Germans when I was

806
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:02,190
in the sauna. I would, you know, for
naked woman walked in, but it didn't,

807
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,750
I just felt like a fucking
creep. Um, so anyways,

808
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,680
and that's why you travel
the world every body.

809
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:10,620
Okay.

810
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,730
To get stories like
that. All right. Anyways,

811
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,590
all right, follow up. Should
girl have paid for dinner?

812
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,150
Now this became something on reddit
where I was reading this thing where,

813
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,830
uh, this guy, the way I read
it in the way I understood it,

814
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,260
now granted I was jet
lagged flying around Europe.

815
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,320
I thought he was saying that he took
his girlfriend out for a birthday dinner

816
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,910
with his parents and when the bill
came she had to pay for her meal.

817
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,570
So she was upset about that.

818
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:50,770
And then now he invited to another family
gathering and she made some flippant

819
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,920
comment asking him she'd have
to pay for the gas to get there.

820
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,260
And I sided with her going through it.

821
00:47:56,261 --> 00:48:00,280
You can't make somebody pay for
their birthday meal. So anyways,

822
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:01,961
somebody had read it,

823
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:05,650
said Billy got a little confused with
that email about the birthday dinner.

824
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,640
The boyfriend's family weren't expecting
the girlfriend to pay for her own

825
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:10,480
birthday dinner.

826
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,830
They were expecting her to pay for
our own meal at his birthday dinner.

827
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:20,500
Oh, okay. The email said this, I think
he was just a little bit too jet lagged.

828
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,720
All right, well my mistake, um,

829
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:29,190
it's a little spoiled for her to get
that dinner and instantly expect to go to

830
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:33,250
that dinner and instantly
expect her meal be paid for.

831
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,360
I wouldn't really say I come from a
family of means, but we're not broke.

832
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,850
And when I've gone out for
dinner for my birthday,

833
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:42,340
my folks have always been happy to pay.
However,

834
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:46,510
my partner never just assume this.
It's rude to, I agree with that.

835
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:48,580
But having said that,
I would also pay,

836
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,410
I wouldn't make my girlfriend pay
for the meal. Um, even if you seek,

837
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,460
if you're secretly hoping someone else
pays through meal when it's not a special

838
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:02,440
occasion celebrating something for you,
just don't sit there and assume a,

839
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:07,441
the text message asking if she expected
to pay for own gas is astounding in its

840
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:12,100
level of rudeness to, I don't think
that that's rude because I think that's,

841
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:16,210
that's her reacting to being upset that,
um,

842
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,860
she was made to pay for
her own meal. Uh, yeah.

843
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,680
And then I actually see the
boyfriend's point, if that's exactly,

844
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:27,470
if that's how it was
worded. I mean, I can just,

845
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,550
I understand why she assumed that they
would have taken care of both of them.

846
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:35,960
Cause it was his birthday. It was a
special occasion and she's also a guest.

847
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:40,790
She's company, you know what I mean? I
understand that. That makes sense to me.

848
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,670
Um, so I, I actually,

849
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:47,450
I still side with the, uh,
with the woman on this one.

850
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,280
I kind of get it. Like if my parents
didn't pick up for my wife's meal,

851
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:56,710
I would have paid for it. I
Dunno. Anyways. Um, anyways,

852
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,000
it's not,

853
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,080
it's not remotely spoiled for the girl
to assume that the meal was paid for.

854
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:07,081
I'm on her side 100% I cannot remember
a single time growing up where I was

855
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:10,660
invited out to dinner with a friend's
family and I was expected to pay for my

856
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:15,130
own meal. Yeah. It's one of those
things if you're going out as a couple,

857
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:18,460
like two couples are going out,
then you split it anyways.

858
00:50:18,461 --> 00:50:20,500
Now that I am an adult
with kids of my own,

859
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:25,000
I would be incredibly embarrassed to ask
my son's girlfriend to pay for own meal

860
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:26,210
at his birthday.
I am a,

861
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,470
I agree with that 100% now the text
message was passive aggressive,

862
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:35,450
but I think the meal thing
and the boyfriend's reaction
to it was so egregious

863
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,540
that I don't have a problem with
it. I don't either. I don't either.

864
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:42,380
I side with them to anyways and another
one, I'm sorry. Supposed to say any way.

865
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,280
I like saying anyways,
I used the ways app.

866
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:47,420
Why can't I say anyways?

867
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,610
I can not believe anyone doesn't have the
same answer as you. Haha Jesus Christ.

868
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:53,870
Where did these animals grow up?

869
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,510
I would die of embarrassment
if I was at a restaurant,

870
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,800
my with my family and my girlfriend and
my girlfriend and my dad asked her for

871
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:05,450
money. Yeah, I agree with you. You know,
I just think that maybe were braver,

872
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,920
maybe were the warriors
social justice warriors.

873
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:10,701
Hey,

874
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,610
you know what's great about doing this
podcast this early is my daughter's not

875
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:15,800
gonna be up for like
another hour. And so, um,

876
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,840
I get to hang all morning with her.

877
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,030
I bought her all these cool
sneakers when I was over there. Um,

878
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,930
she's like good until she's like three
or four years old because I got the size

879
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,610
wrong,
the size I was told to get.

880
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:33,170
I thought when she was that size now and
it turns out that that was, you know,

881
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,980
the next size up. So I got
two sizes in, three sizes up,

882
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,030
but they're all cool sneakers.
Well Thea,

883
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,470
all cool sneak attack got when
I was told three in Germany,

884
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,090
a jet lag. Hey Billy, numb nuts. Um,

885
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,443
try

886
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:54,320
Valerian tea to help reset your
sleep cycle while traveling.

887
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:59,590
It also helps take the edge off at the
end of the day when the whiskey blanky is

888
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:05,240
not an option. B L A N K Y is
not an option. Works for me. Uh,

889
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:09,380
I will definitely do that because
I'm 52 days in and not drinking.

890
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,080
And um, had I not done that
thrash, I would actually look good.

891
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:17,900
People were taking pictures of me.
I was like, I look fucking horrible.

892
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,480
Like just lack of sleep.
That's all we did for 10 days straight.

893
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,880
Fly in,
go to the hotel,

894
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,410
go do a show or to go back to the hotel,
sleep,

895
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,970
try to go to sleep and then you'd have
to get up at seven to take a train or

896
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:37,400
something like that.
And um, the younger me,

897
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:39,650
I would have looked fresh as
a daisy if I wasn't drinking,

898
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:41,120
but I was looking at those pictures.
I was like,

899
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:45,980
I might as well have been doing fucking
meth out here. Um, I will try that.

900
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:49,160
I actually got some Melatonin when I was
over there that everybody says is all

901
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:53,960
natural, but I got to tell you, it makes
you feel a little buzzed. Um, I dunno.

902
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,010
I Dunno about that Shit,
but it definitely helped me go to sleep.

903
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:02,900
I'm fat fellow speaking here. Uh, hello,

904
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,620
Mr. Bend, Bender, ovary bender over bill.

905
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,950
I don't know what that means.
I am 19 years old.

906
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:14,060
Five seven on a good day in
320 pounds. All right, dude,

907
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:17,840
you got to do something about that.
Thank God you got a young heart, but you,

908
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,030
you will not be five, seven, you know,

909
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,610
in your sixties at 320 pounds.
And I'm,

910
00:53:25,611 --> 00:53:29,010
I'm not a doctor and I know this is a
fact. Anyways, I just wanted to ask you,

911
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:34,370
as a heavy fellow who tries very hard
to be kind and courteous to those around

912
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,600
him,
how can I be better?

913
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,820
I purposely avoid planes in public
transportation because I understand how

914
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:44,370
uncomfortable it must be for
others to even be around me.

915
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,900
It is very difficult because I have an
irrational fear of driving and there are

916
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:53,820
no taxi or Uber services in my area.

917
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,250
Um, I legitimately tried to
keep to myself, for example,

918
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:01,950
in a grocery store,
if I have to pass someone who is shopping,

919
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:04,800
I apologize simply because
I block half the aisle.

920
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,730
Most of the time folks are very
kind and shore missed the bar.

921
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:13,890
How can I be better to other folks who
are less girthy. Thank you for your time.

922
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,940
Um,
what I got out of that service,

923
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:21,270
I think that you need to come out of your
shell and I probably maybe go get some

924
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:26,271
therapy and maybe part of your reason
for eating and all of that type of stuff.

925
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:28,320
Is there a,

926
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,460
that seems to be a little bit of self
loathing going on here and God knows I was

927
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:35,580
the king of that. It just didn't
manifest itself into overeating.

928
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:39,390
It manifested itself in the
other shit that I've, I've,

929
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,870
I'm still trying to work out. But, um,

930
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,730
maybe if you start going to therapy,
you start reading up on nutrition and a,

931
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:53,150
I got to tell you, dude, if you five,
seven, 320 pounds, like, I mean,

932
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:58,100
I would think that you'd be able to
drop a lot of weight if he just started

933
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,050
eating right, because you obviously
don't need all of that on you. Um,

934
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,670
and then I think as,

935
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,960
as you learn about yourself in therapy
and then she started to drop weight,

936
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,573
um,

937
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,020
you're going to come out of your shelf
because you're not going to have to have

938
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:18,980
those feelings that you're being, you
know, you're just like a sensitive person.

939
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,220
The fact that you actually care, it's,
you have ear, an empathetic person.

940
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,930
And a lot of times people who are really
empathetic can get in their heads and

941
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:29,720
can get really, like,
I just think, you know,

942
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,820
I feel like that made me sad reading that.

943
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,540
So I don't want you walking around being
sad. You're in the prime of your life.

944
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,220
Like, and what's great is the fact
that you've five, seven, 320 pounds,

945
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,850
you have a great before picture.
All right,

946
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,850
so you got that checked off
your bucket list. Now you can,

947
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,010
you can turn this whole
fucking thing around

948
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,660
and you're so young that you,
you got your whole life ahead of,

949
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:56,400
you can just turn that
around and find out.

950
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,600
I would literally go to therapy and just
put it all out on the fucking table.

951
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,240
You know what you feel your problem is,
what you're afraid of,

952
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:08,180
what makes you cry and all of that Shit.
And then I would,

953
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,410
I would just start literally
marching towards getting in shape.

954
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:15,380
It'll help your fucking confidence.
And then what's great is,

955
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,100
is when you become a good looking guy
that's out there, fucking slammed it.

956
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,130
And the ladies are loving you. You know,
you've had the experience of being five,

957
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:28,300
seven, three 20 so you won't be a
fucking asshole. I remember one time,

958
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,110
I was on a plane a long, long, long
fucking time ago, like 15 years ago.

959
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:37,590
And I was sitting next to this
woman who was a fucking knock out,

960
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:42,400
an absolute knock out. And I sat down
next to her and she was just like, hey,

961
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:46,750
how you doing? And I was
like, good. I, you know, women
who looked that good don't,

962
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:48,790
aren't like that,
you know,

963
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,080
and it's not just because you know,
this stuck up.

964
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,790
It's because when they're
that good looking,

965
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:58,150
if they even remotely make
eye contact with another man,

966
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,450
they're now going to have to deal
with them hitting on them, you know,

967
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:06,040
so she was totally open with so fucking
cool and we're just shooting the shit.

968
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,060
She was talking to me like she was like
a widget salesman instead of like a

969
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:12,220
fucking 10. And then the
end, I finally had a Segway,

970
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:13,180
I'm going to be honest with you,
I've never,

971
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,420
I've never been around a
woman as good looking as you,

972
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:19,600
that was like this outgoing had your
personality, your personality is amazing.

973
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,660
And she laughed. She Cause Ah,
she goes, I used to be fat,

974
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:29,650
so I'm sure you already, you
already got the personality. So, um,

975
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:34,780
you know what you are you
like a great barn. Find in a,

976
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:39,250
in like the automotive industry.
I'm not calling you a fucking cow.

977
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,200
I'm saying like, you know,
when they go into Barnes,

978
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:44,620
they'll find this great old car that
they then restore and everybody fucking

979
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:48,610
loves it. So there you go. We're still
yourself, sir. That's what I would do.

980
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,960
And uh, and I believe in you. I think he
can do it. She's just put your mind to it.

981
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:55,930
But I think you just got to
figure out why you're uh,

982
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,690
you know why you are the way you are.

983
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:02,080
Because I know just being courteous and
empathetic isn't all you who you are.

984
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:05,620
You've got shit to say. You got hope.
She got dreams you want to find love.

985
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:10,120
So let's go. Let's get after it.
Get your ass out there. All right,

986
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:15,070
girlfriend won't lose weight.
It's all about weight. This,

987
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,080
uh, this week here, dear Billy, not
so fat. Thank you. I'll take that.

988
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:21,970
That's exactly what I am.
I'm not so fat,

989
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:25,980
but I definitely had a little too
much English did. So, yeah. Uh,

990
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,710
my girlfriend and I had been dating
for three years going on four and I'm

991
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:34,330
starting to have different
feelings towards her because
of her eating habits and

992
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:38,230
the way she takes care of herself.
Since I met her several years ago,

993
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,700
she kind of had a weight thing
that was noticeable. You know what,

994
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:46,000
I just fucking flaked reading this.
I gotta start over again.

995
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:50,650
I was just thinking how amazing it is
that Joe Rogan has Mike Tyson on his

996
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:53,100
podcast.
Um,

997
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,350
and I remember being on his podcast early
on where it was just in his house and

998
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:03,310
how far he's come with that podcast
is fucking amazing. I'm sorry,

999
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,680
I don't know why I was thinking of
that. Anyways, dear Billy, not so fat.

1000
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,580
My girlfriend and I have been dating
for three years going on four and I'm

1001
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:12,970
starting to have different
feelings towards her because
of her eating habits and

1002
00:59:12,971 --> 00:59:17,950
the way she takes care of herself. Um,
yeah, that isn't fair to do to somebody,

1003
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,170
you know.
Um,

1004
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:25,171
and I think it's when the guy puts on way
then if a woman comes on TV and was to

1005
00:59:26,141 --> 00:59:29,980
talk about that type of stuff, they would
side with her for expressing herself.

1006
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:33,180
But if a guy does it, you're a
fucking asshole. Um, anyways,

1007
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:35,500
since I met her several
years, that's your job, man.

1008
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,030
You got to keep yourself looking good.

1009
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:41,350
You got to keep the spark going in
50% of that is your responsibility.

1010
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:46,480
Um, since I met her
several years ago, she had,

1011
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:51,010
she came, she had kind of had a
weight thing that was noticeable,

1012
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,900
but then think anything of it because
I thought she would get on some sort of

1013
00:59:55,901 --> 00:59:59,140
kick of wanting to lose some
weight in the years to come.

1014
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:00,161
I thought you were gonna say,

1015
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:02,740
I didn't mind because she was only a
little overweight and I liked her as a

1016
01:00:02,741 --> 01:00:03,574
person.

1017
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,170
You're like, wow, you know,

1018
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,510
I'll get her on the treadmill.
You, we got some potential here.

1019
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,640
And what's funny is that's how women
look at men differently. All right,

1020
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:16,020
he's got this job,
you know,

1021
01:00:16,021 --> 01:00:18,600
maybe you'll get to this job will
start making that kind of money.

1022
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,930
I'll get him some new clothes. I can
work with this. I can fix him up.

1023
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:26,700
And there's nothing wrong with that, you
know, there's nothing wrong. You know,

1024
01:00:26,701 --> 01:00:29,760
I used to, when I was younger, it used to
bother me, but it doesn't bother me that,

1025
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,210
uh, a woman asked the guy what
he does for living. It's like,

1026
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:35,940
what is she supposed to do?
Breed with a loser. Okay.

1027
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:42,220
Why don't you like me for
who I am? Uh, you know,

1028
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,920
cause I don't want to live
in a shack. All right, well,

1029
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:49,060
it's been three and a half
years and there's no stopping
her from losing weight.

1030
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:53,710
She's 25 and I'm 30 and
I don't know what to do.

1031
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:57,520
She loves to sweets and is not a fan
of running because it hurts her feet.

1032
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,980
Oh boy.
We'll get her on an elliptical.

1033
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:01,390
Okay.

1034
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,790
Oh hell bill help bill.
I love her,

1035
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:07,720
but I don't want to spend my early
thirties miserable in a relationship with

1036
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:11,500
someone who doesn't want to take care of
herself. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1037
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,300
I have to tell you something right now,
Dude.

1038
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,660
You are in the most difficult
fucking position you can possibly be.

1039
01:01:20,861 --> 01:01:22,060
And as a man,

1040
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,590
one of the hardest fucking conversations
you can have with a girlfriend other

1041
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:29,290
than I'm breaking up with you,
is I,

1042
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:31,420
this is even harder because
if you break it up with them,

1043
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,340
they're going to cry and then
you're not gonna see him again.

1044
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:35,380
Eventually they're going to move on.

1045
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:36,970
You're going to try to
stay in a relationship.

1046
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:39,190
Are you going to try to tell a woman,

1047
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:40,470
okay,

1048
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,070
that she needs to lose weight?

1049
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,063
MMM.

1050
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,510
I gotta be honest with
you. I'm an, you know what?

1051
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:51,170
I'm going to bring the lovely Nia on
my next podcast and we're going to,

1052
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,160
we're going to revisit
this question because,

1053
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,170
okay,

1054
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,640
I don't know how to do this because

1055
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,873
you know,

1056
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,570
I've been,

1057
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:08,040
I've been lucky enough that I've always
been with women that like they, you know,

1058
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:11,580
they want to go out and get
after it or whatever, you know,

1059
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:13,710
hit the gym or whatever.
Um,

1060
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:15,920
yeah.

1061
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,920
I don't know. I don't, I wouldn't
know how to do this because this is,

1062
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:23,520
this is so fucking fragile.
This is literally,

1063
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:27,960
if you start talking about a woman's
weight is in the same world as if she

1064
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:32,850
started talking about your Dick size or
your ability to satisfy her in the bed

1065
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:36,720
because you're really talking now
like a woman won't, some of them,

1066
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:41,550
their biggest power of ridiculous
power a woman has is her beauty.

1067
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:42,751
You know,

1068
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:45,660
I know they're all out there right now
trying to act like they're going to start

1069
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:49,500
their own fucking airline and all of that
shit. I'm not saying don't go do that,

1070
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,350
but like you know,

1071
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:58,800
that is if you, if you're basically
saying that you're not attracted to them,

1072
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,640
it's, you know, if, if my wife
came at me and said, hey man,

1073
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,840
you're getting a little bit fat,

1074
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:07,440
I would fucking laugh and it
would so fucking motivate me.

1075
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,260
And to the point,

1076
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:14,250
I wish she would say it to me cause
I want to tape a special soon. Uh,

1077
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:17,370
but I got to go with self motivation
here of taking of all the tweets.

1078
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:22,050
I'm going to get it from a fat
fuck am my special. But um, yeah,

1079
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:25,830
this is a really difficult thing.
Um, don't have the conversation.

1080
01:03:25,831 --> 01:03:28,200
It's all Nia comes on.
And even after what Nia says,

1081
01:03:28,201 --> 01:03:31,020
I would also try to get advice

1082
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:36,930
from women in your life and
you have to start it with,

1083
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,720
I love my girlfriend,
I love it to death.

1084
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,770
We just have a problem and I don't
know how to bring it up. Okay.

1085
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,790
If you do that, the woman you're
talking to will be more open minded,

1086
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,380
I think to listen to you.
However,

1087
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:54,410
if you start with my girlfriends
fat and I'm not attracted to it,

1088
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,790
what the fuck they,

1089
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,850
they might get defensive and start
defending her and say that you're shallow.

1090
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:03,480
They, that's certainly going
to happen on the Internet. Um,

1091
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:09,510
so whatever. Good luck with that and
I'll try to help you out on Thursday. Uh,

1092
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:14,190
thinking about breaking up with
my girlfriend. Okay, here we go.

1093
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:18,930
Dear Billy, not so fat. Look at this
shit. I got a couple of those, right.

1094
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,560
Wait a second.
All this is the same fucking person

1095
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,140
dear. Uh, my girlfriend and I
had been dating for three. Wait,

1096
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:35,790
did I just say one is to, this guy's
brilliant girlfriend won't lose weight.

1097
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:38,970
And now thinking about breaking up with
my girlfriends from the exact same guy

1098
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,510
there,
Billy not so fat.

1099
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,070
My girlfriend and I had been dating for
three years and going on foreign and

1100
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:46,800
starting to have different feelings
towards this is the exact same fucking,

1101
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:51,480
I was fucking hilarious. Wait
a second. Is it? It has to be,

1102
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,070
it's written a little bit
different. I'll still read it. Uh,

1103
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,490
since I've met her several years ago.

1104
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:59,030
She's Kinda had a weight thing
that that was noticeable,

1105
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,580
but I didn't think anything of it because
I thought she would get on some sort

1106
01:05:02,581 --> 01:05:05,610
of check of wanting to lose the way the,
as the, it's been three and a half years.

1107
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,910
There's no sign lose, lose weight. She's
25 and 30. It's exact same fucking guy.

1108
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:14,370
Alright. Okay Dude. Well then what
I did that's fucking brilliant.

1109
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,630
Fucking brilliant. Um, I would say this.

1110
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,550
Yeah,

1111
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,560
you have to make the decision right now.

1112
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,520
Okay.

1113
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,353
Um,

1114
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:31,080
do you love your girlfriend in a way
that you want to stay with her eventually

1115
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:36,850
marry her and help her
through this problem or

1116
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,260
did you sort of sort of thought,

1117
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,700
you found I'm going to marry you
love but just sort of found love,

1118
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:50,701
love and now that she's overweight
and you're not as attracted to her,

1119
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:58,450
is that feeling starting to come up?
You know what I mean?

1120
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:03,490
Cause that really is, that's when you
find out if you really love somebody,

1121
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,920
anybody can be around during the
good times. Right? You're a man,

1122
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:11,830
you're making a bunch of money. You
can take her to fucking, you know,

1123
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:16,750
France or whatever, you know,
she's a chick and she's fucking,

1124
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:17,613
you know,

1125
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:23,070
go into crossfit and crushing it and
fucking look hot that you ignore,

1126
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,650
you know? But when,
when shit hits the fan,

1127
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,820
okay, and you have to be there for
somebody emotionally or what are,

1128
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:35,210
you have to accept some of their flaws.
Uh,

1129
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,500
that's when you find out if you love,
love somebody. You know what I mean?

1130
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,570
I'm not saying that you
don't think about leaving.

1131
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:42,700
Everybody thinks about
leaving all the fucking time.

1132
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,590
I don't need this fucking
Shit fucking shit.

1133
01:06:45,591 --> 01:06:48,830
You're fucking and everything and
I'll fucking get it. You know? I know.

1134
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:50,450
I love my wife to death is,

1135
01:06:50,451 --> 01:06:54,770
even in my fantasies when I'm mad is
I can possibly be at her even in my

1136
01:06:54,771 --> 01:06:56,720
fantasies.
I can't break up with her.

1137
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,980
I get to the point where
she starts walking out of
the house and then I get sad

1138
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:05,720
and I run out and hug her.
So there you go.

1139
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,540
Okay. So there's a good question
for you and your fantasy.

1140
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:13,290
Can you break up with somebody and you
feel all right about now that isn't a

1141
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:16,130
good litmus test because then I'm
doing the arrogant thing that you're,

1142
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,520
you're wired exactly the way
that I am. Um, anyways, uh,

1143
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:25,380
any way I am, I am back from
Europe. I have to tell you,

1144
01:07:25,381 --> 01:07:30,381
that was one of the greatest experiences
I've ever had as somebody in this

1145
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:34,520
business, the business of show, you know,

1146
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,450
trying to figure out those crowds.

1147
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:41,451
Trying to remember how the vibe I had the
last time I was over there and it took

1148
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,670
me a few shows have hit
or misses to figure out,

1149
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:50,410
to find tune the thing like a fucking
race car. And I watched Versie do it too.

1150
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:53,410
And I'm at, I'm going to call
this right now with Paul Versey,

1151
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:58,060
that fucking guy after that set I saw
him do at Gotham and then watching him

1152
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,400
going over to Europe, nervous
saying to me, Gone Bell,

1153
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:06,150
I know I'm probably going to take a
couple of fucking hits over here and I'm

1154
01:08:06,151 --> 01:08:07,990
going, no, you're not, dude. You're
going to be fine. You're gonna be fine.

1155
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:11,860
Knowing that he was that kind of watching
him figure it out to the point that by

1156
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:15,040
the time we went to Vienna, the
people booking it there, we're,

1157
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,780
we need to have you back. We need
to have you come back here. Um,

1158
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:23,260
I'm just really proud of him because I
always knew that he was going to be able

1159
01:08:23,261 --> 01:08:25,450
to do shit like that and
his specials crushing it,

1160
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,980
and he's got a big tour coming up and
I'm going to lose him as an opener.

1161
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:35,500
Um, which is I, which is what I want
for anybody who ever opens for me.

1162
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:39,010
You know what I mean? I never want
to have a lifer opener, you know?

1163
01:08:39,011 --> 01:08:41,380
That's like having the kid that
never moved out of your house.

1164
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,800
It's like, son, get out there and
find love. Um, all right. That is it.

1165
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,440
God bless all you go fuck yourselves.
And I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1166
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:58,200
Hey. Oh, by the way, I think
I'm doing a podcast with that.

1167
01:08:58,201 --> 01:09:03,201
That guy there I was telling you about
that he comes across like an old school,

1168
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,300
uh, it old school, a sports announcer,

1169
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:11,960
like a Dick shap kind of guy way back.
You know it's going to,

1170
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:16,040
you'd be like the best, the base, the
best patriots coverage in the business.

1171
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,490
He actually DMD me,
so I started following him.

1172
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,710
They William?

1173
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:24,063
Yeah.

1174
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,690
Bended. B And d. E. T. S. O. N. A.

1175
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:33,130
Where the fuck are we going to be?
Oh,

1176
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:36,310
I told them sometime around January
15th. I was going to do it. What's today?

1177
01:09:36,311 --> 01:09:38,350
Today's the 14th. All right. I
got to reach out to this guy.

1178
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,190
We're going to do a podcast
talking patriots and I'll get,

1179
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:46,060
I'll send out a link and all that
type of stuff. Uh, hopefully, uh,

1180
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,880
because this guy seems like he
really knows the Patriots. I don't,

1181
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:50,890
on the other hand, I,
I'm, I'm, uh, I'm, uh,

1182
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,120
I watch as much as I can watch with the
travel and the kid. All right. Anyways,

1183
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,020
go fuck yourselves. I'll check
in on you on Thursday. See Ya.
