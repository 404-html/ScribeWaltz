1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,900
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,901 --> 00:00:07,901
It's bill burn his time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday flap ea April

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,030
17th, 2017 what's going on? How are,
yeah, happy Patriot's day, everybody.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,690
Um, I believe that only woo.
It's one of my voice right now.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,450
I believe that um,

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,760
Massachusetts is kind of the only place
that takes Patriot's day off kind of,

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:29,900
sort of, you know, they have
the Boston Marathon, right?

8
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:33,980
They usually play a red sox game during
the day for everybody doesn't want to

9
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:37,070
fucking run around and watch a bunch
of skinny people running down the damn

10
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,401
street,

11
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:42,401
shitting themselves on heartbreak hill
every year somebody shit's themselves in

12
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:46,910
that race.
You know that anytime there's a marathon,

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,270
there's people that push themselves so
hard that they literally shit themselves.

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,090
Okay.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,070
It's a fucking running up the hill.
You know those runners,

16
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,440
they were those little fucking
nylon shorts and stuff,

17
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:02,160
so there's nowhere for it to go.
And these maniacs,

18
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,850
they just stayed just keep running with
shit going down the back of their legs.

19
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,980
Like one of those fucking
horses that carried, you know,

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,630
drags the newlyweds around the park.
You know, but even then, you know,

21
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:14,880
they put the tail up,
they fucking shoot it out.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Always going in early with the shit jokes.
Everybody says what it's going to be.

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,790
Is it literally going to
be who should show? Um,

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,180
yeah.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,490
Yeah, so whatever happy
Patriot's day to everybody.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,280
I don't even know what Patriot's day is.
You know,

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,610
I don't think it's about the football
team because it's not football season

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,410
system. When we raised the banner
Patriot's Day, let's look it up. Shall We?

29
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:44,390
People Patriot's Day a Hashtag.
What the fuck is it?

30
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,910
Why does it automatically
go to fucking Wikipedia?

31
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:50,930
Even though I would have gone here.
All right. Then as I a Patriot Day,

32
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:54,320
a film starring Marky Mark Wahlberg.
That's not what I was looking for.

33
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,360
Fucking cock suckers. I just don't
understand. I had, oh my God,

34
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:04,100
I had the worst day with my fucking phone.
Like yesterday.

35
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,240
I tried to update it.

36
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,383
MMM.

37
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,551
You know,

38
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:11,550
and then it comes back on and then you
need all your fucking passwords and no

39
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,580
matter how much I type them in,
the way that it's supposed to be,

40
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,820
it doesn't recognize it.
Then it shuts down my phone.

41
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,970
Then it's going old la bones [inaudible]
guten tag and like 50 different fucking

42
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:27,360
languages. And I can't, I
can't. I came. So if I had not,

43
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,610
I haven't meditated in a month.
I'm not gonna lie to you, but I, I,

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,800
if I hadn't meditated so much,
the beginning part of the year,

45
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,080
I would have broke my phone
and half I grabbed it,

46
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:38,580
I turned it sideways and I fucking
started. I started to do it.

47
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,890
I started to fucking
break it and I stopped.

48
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,700
I did throw it at the
couch into the cushions.

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,600
And I also did throw my laptop into the,
they were all into the cushions,

50
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,390
not overly or, you know, it's
funny, when I lifted up the laptop,

51
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,300
I felt the pain of my rotator cuff
so I could only throw it so hard.

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,940
It was really pathetic. It was
a pathetic display of anger. Uh,

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,400
so, you know, I dunno my phone
still fucking with me. You don't,

54
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:10,550
I'm trying to go into the Goddamn apple
store here and they won't let me do it.

55
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,680
I don't understand these,
you know, apple is,

56
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:17,270
is everybody fucking loves
his con got company, you know.

57
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:21,260
Can somebody please fucking explain to
me why they're so hostile when it comes

58
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:24,560
to any sort of customer support.
Is there a fucking reason?

59
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,490
There's not a phone number. I can't
talk to anybody. They're like fuck you.

60
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:32,950
Here's our product that
doesn't work. Go Fuck Yourself.

61
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,470
We're not responsible for anything.
You don't know what we look like.

62
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,670
You don't know where we are.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,900
Don't even talk to me about those fucking
apple stores with the people walking

64
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,830
around with a genius tee shirts.
Give me a fucking break. Oh,

65
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:49,000
that sounds says cause somebody just
came into my house and I hear it all the

66
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:53,320
time. So I mean it doesn't
mean shit to me anyways.

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,870
What, what, what? That was
like an anger meter. You know,

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,920
as I was getting up higher would ring and
it would let me know to come back down

69
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,300
again.
You know,

70
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:04,930
like an idiot light on some cars that
your engine's overheating anyways.

71
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,080
Fuck those apple stores too.
All right, those are dead, dead.

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,570
It's all bullshit.
You're talking to low level people in the,

73
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,630
in the company. Nobody who's fucking
designing these God damn things.

74
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,390
It ended up being fucked up.
It's working at that store.

75
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,760
Okay,

76
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,700
give that stupid fucking shirt. This
is genius. It shouldn't say pee on.

77
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,180
Um,
and then what do they got to deal with?

78
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,210
Fucking balding hot heads like me who
come walking in and going like to where

79
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,880
the fuck did all my music go?
Who did you put it on the cloud?

80
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,500
I don't want you to have my stuff.

81
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,110
Fine. I don't, you know, I should
have never stopped getting cds.

82
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:45,060
All I know is everything's fucked up.
Okay.

83
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:49,530
And so now I'm signing into shit on my
laptop. My phone's talking to me going,

84
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:49,681
hey,

85
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:53,040
somebody signing in on another device
and that there's no place for me to say,

86
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:57,060
yeah, I know it's me. And then the laptop
soon, the same thing. They're like,

87
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,940
it's like David Lee Roth and Eddie
van Halen. It's like, you guys,

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,410
you were great together.

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,250
We had the band and now you're fucking
break it up and you're talking shit about

90
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:09,420
each other and don't even talk to me about
those fucking numbers I'm supposed to

91
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:12,720
punch in because I did that too.
I went into my settings,

92
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,340
I fucking stupid. Uh, whatever.

93
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,870
Clicked on my name,

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,070
went into passwords type the fucking
number that they just sent me into the

95
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,650
thing and they said they didn't
recognize it and then they freeze up.

96
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:29,880
My phone frees up my phone, like I'm
working in the Pentagon or something.

97
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,020
Come some fucking general.
I'm just some jerk off once,

98
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,840
listen to some fucking hair metal from
the 80s get killed. Well, you know,

99
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,320
well I get on a treadmill.
It's all I'm trying to do here.

100
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,040
Okay.

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,770
You know what it is. It's
fucking, it's incestuous.

102
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,450
Yeah.

103
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,360
You know how really rich people want to
keep the money in their family, you know,

104
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:53,420
so they just sort of, they sort of
breed with the same five families.

105
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,960
I've taught you this before. So
it's why, you know, you look at the,

106
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,230
it's like they're,

107
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,920
they're good looking from the forehead
down to like the mouth area and then they

108
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,470
smile and it's Whoa,
you know,

109
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,110
starts looking like they should
be playing a fucking Banjo,

110
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,590
you know? So it's the same thing
with technology. Technology.

111
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:18,670
It used to be a radio was radio over
there? My Stereo dead over there.

112
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,710
It's the dishwasher right

113
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,190
slash made. I'm sorry,

114
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,350
I was just thinking about
the time I was talking about.

115
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,630
And then you had your walk wins,
right?

116
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:35,890
Then the walk when also had a fucking
radio and a phone was a phone and now

117
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:40,090
they've all four. They've all
just been gang bang, right?

118
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,530
This big fucking calendula.
Fucking fisting technological,

119
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,580
I dunno what they're all
the same goddamn thing now.

120
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,110
Everything, everything is just on
those fucking things. And I don't know,

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,570
it's ridiculous. So what I ended up
doing as I, after I started to like,

122
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,141
it was weird.

123
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:04,141
Like I had the strength signals sent
from all the way to like my wrist.

124
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,490
I didn't let it get to my hands. I felt
the anger go all like, it's like the hulk,

125
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,290
right? The fucking my arms turned green
all the way down to my wrist and I just,

126
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,490
I stopped myself from breaking it
in half, but I have to, Oh God,

127
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:22,480
that would have been such a great feeling
to just snap the has to be youtube

128
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:26,410
videos of people snapping their
fucking phones and half. Um,

129
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,870
what I did was I just said,
fuck that phone,

130
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,020
fuck the laptop and I had a drum lesson
and I got in my truck and I just fucking

131
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:37,060
drove over and yet can admit,
you know what,

132
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:40,420
it was kind of fucking nice
not having a phone, you know,

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,790
I wasn't looking at text
messages and dwell driving.

134
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,260
I wasn't doing any of that type of shit.

135
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,850
Trying to fucking scrolled in the
next God damn song, none of that shit.

136
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,450
I just was, I dunno, driving a car,

137
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,770
like I used to talking to myself and um,

138
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,200
then it came back calm down.

139
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,880
I tried it again and about, I don't
know, maybe the 17th attempt to,

140
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:08,920
I got it to work again and uh,
I just got it as you know,

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,953
is greatest.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,740
These are and my ability to communicate
with you guys and everything like that.

143
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,840
You know, I still would been
our right without these things.

144
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,110
I could have made it the old fashioned
way as a comedian where he just keep

145
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,820
doing the clubs and doing the clubs.

146
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,510
Then I do a guest spot on the Hollywood
squares right next to Paul Lynde.

147
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,590
You know, maybe do a fucking tonight
show and I just keep building up.

148
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:35,080
I could have made it that way.
I didn't need all of this shit.

149
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,680
All this shit that these
fucking Yolo dishes, you know,

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,230
selfies and then the, the picture you
take that it takes sort of a video,

151
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,330
but it's a picture,
but it's also a video.

152
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,570
Okay.

153
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,970
You know, these flying squirrel
suits, I mean, I dunno.

154
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,293
Okay.

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,030
What is it you just to do shit that other

156
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,320
people didn't do? Is that what
it is? I don't fucking know.

157
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,860
You know, back in the day, you
know what it was back in the day,

158
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:08,861
you fucking did the clubs until you built
up enough of a following on your own

159
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:12,890
that you headlined clubs and then
maybe you got an hour special.

160
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,900
Then you know now if you're a middle act,

161
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:21,280
you need an hour special to headlines.
Like the whole thing is too.

162
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,700
I just feel like this old man,
like

163
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,990
what's the deal? All right.
Patriot's day, everybody.

164
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,860
Um,
Patriot's day.

165
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,480
Okay.

166
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,400
Whereas Patriot's day in Massachusetts,

167
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:46,401
in Wisconsin and Patriots Day in
Maine is an official state holiday

168
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,270
commemorating the anniversary of the
battles of Lexington and Concord.

169
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,140
Well, what the fuck does Maine and
Wisconsin have to do with that?

170
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,540
The first battles of the
American revolution or does,

171
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,830
does his main and Wisconsin,

172
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,440
the only other two fucking
states of respect to holiday.

173
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,980
The holiday was originally
celebrated on April 19th.

174
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,010
The actual anniversary of the battles
fought in 1775 since 1969 it has been

175
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:20,650
observed on the third Monday in April
in Massachusetts and in Maine. Doe.

176
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:23,950
Let's get a three day
weekend, Donovan, you know,

177
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,890
fuck the 19th just make
sure it's on a Monday.

178
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,150
It's also the first day of a vacation
week for public schools in both states in

179
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:38,650
both states and a school holiday for
many low local colleges and universities,

180
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:39,790
both public and private.

181
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,110
The day is a public school
observance stay in Wisconsin.

182
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,880
Florida law also encourages people to
celebrate it like those fucking people

183
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,950
needed an encouragement to
celebrate anything else.

184
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,840
If I could celebrate like
everyday's Patriot's day,

185
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,730
fucking meth day, though it is
not treated as a public holiday.

186
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,720
Okay.

187
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,170
Of observances in reenactments
of battles occur occur.

188
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,450
I remember going to one
of those when I was a kid.

189
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,910
I thought those people were cool as shit,

190
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,000
shooting the guns and pretending
to die and all that stuff.

191
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:17,450
I thought it was awesome. Then I got older
and I was like, Hey, what do you mean?

192
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:20,450
If that's what he's into? All
right. The Boston Marathon,

193
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:23,780
he's run on Patriot's day
every fucking year. Therefore,

194
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:27,080
sometimes the holiday is
referred to as marathon.

195
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:29,110
Monday at the Boston Red
Sox had been scheduled.

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,240
It had been scheduled to play at
home in Fenway park on Patriot's day.

197
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:37,241
Every year since 1959 the
games are postponed due to
weather and (596) 016-0560

198
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:43,070
seven and [inaudible] 84 do I need all
of this? All right, we got it. Okay.

199
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:45,290
We got it.
So that's what it is.

200
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,350
It's commemorating the first battles of
the American revolutions in Lexington

201
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,870
and Concord. I thought Gettysburg was
the first one. That wasn't the first one.

202
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,740
Oh, that was a civil war.
Oh my God. Shaking my head.

203
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,070
Shut up your fucking Wikipedia read and
can't nobody gives a fuck about your war

204
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:08,040
knowledge. Did you fight in it? Well then
shut up. All right. You know, it's funny,

205
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,850
before I came in here, right, I
was watching the Celtics lose.

206
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,050
It's a fresh loss at the time.
I'm, I'm taping this Sunday night,

207
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,250
a Celtics loss to a,

208
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,340
a giant Jamie Foxx and
the Chicago Bulls do that.

209
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,130
Butler guy looks like Jamie Foxx.

210
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:31,131
Circur like somewhere in the
90s in living color and uh,

211
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,580
you know, fucking brutal game,
brutal game, brutal game.
But it was also, you know,

212
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,410
with Isaiah losing his sister and
stuff, it was Kinda like, uh, the,

213
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,670
the drama of the game was definitely
just looked at us. It's a fucking game.

214
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,780
Look what this guy's going through,

215
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,660
but the balls as much as they're
an eighth seat, you know,

216
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,660
let's go a little sports morning,
talk radio all day.

217
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,230
You don't leave Chicago Bulls,
these bunches here or an AC.

218
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:59,240
Do you have a lot of veteran
presence? Ed? Can you experience? Oh,

219
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,710
would you Dwayne way
will you ever ride go and

220
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,870
yeah, it's not going to be an easy one.
Um, and then they got that Unabomber guy.

221
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,200
Like, I dunno what the fuck that
guy's deal is. You know what I mean?

222
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,880
I think when I look at that guy,

223
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:16,930
his do the hair do he has
and the fucking facial hair.

224
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,350
Okay.

225
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,600
I just hear his agent, you
know, going like, dude,

226
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:25,460
we've tried everything to get you
a lucrative advertising contracts.

227
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,440
We got nothing. So, you know,

228
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,150
why don't you just be the crazy
fucking heroin bearded face guy.

229
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,260
Why don't we try that? Did the
bird man retire yet? You know,

230
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,680
I used to get claustrophobic looking
at that guy's fucking tattoos.

231
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:42,590
They just kept going higher and higher.
Like the little he would choke in them.

232
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,690
Um, very colorful, very marvel comic.

233
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,920
Um, yeah. So we lost whatever Bam. Fucking
one game. You know, what are you gonna do?

234
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,550
I mean, we live and die, but we got
one guy, we got fucking Isaiah Thomas.

235
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:59,450
That's our guy. Okay? He's the fucking
guy. We live and die by the threes.

236
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,280
We don't get fucking offensive boards

237
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,800
and I'll die and get away with that in
the regular season. Maco playoff time.

238
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:06,634
You don't,
you won't get it.

239
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,430
Oh,
that's what I'm worried about.

240
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,940
And the Bruins blow it.

241
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,170
You blew it. We fucking
blue game. We blew it.

242
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:21,820
We fucking blew it a game too. I think
we forgot that there was a third period.

243
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,850
We were all impressed with ourselves.
You know,

244
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:27,370
we scored three goals in the second
period of something like that or to

245
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:30,880
something. We were up three. Here
we have three to one, three to one.

246
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,380
Everything's going good.
And the cross checking cons that are,

247
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,750
the auto was centered as Jesus Christ.

248
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,400
If one auto was centered, a fed bitched
about the refereeing in that game,

249
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,290
I saw one play like this fucking guy,

250
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:49,520
he crosschecked the same guy twice,
right in front of the net.

251
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,820
The guy went down twice call.

252
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,620
It was like every fucking third
crosscheck that, uh, they would call.

253
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:59,200
And then that,
that color commentator was so pro auto.

254
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:03,820
It was fucking ridiculous that that first
one that was trying to say that, that,

255
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:07,210
you know, the goal was offsides.
It's like kind of, can you tell that?

256
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,550
He definitely seems like he moves his leg,

257
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:14,440
but there's no way you can see
from that shitty angle from nine.

258
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:16,240
I love the NHL too.
It's like they're going to,

259
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:18,040
they're going to implement fucking replay,

260
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,510
but then for whatever reason they're
going to have a camera on top of the God

261
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:24,760
damn arena. At least that's
the feed we got. It's like,

262
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,440
how the fuck can you tell what the
guys on site or not? I don't know.

263
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,250
It might've been a good call.
Might have been a bad call.

264
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:33,400
I had no idea what the color
common day was, was convinced.

265
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,750
That's a doubt that they should,
that they should have call that went back.

266
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:41,800
Oh fuck you just go skate down the
Goddamn river and go get your fucking

267
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,330
whatever. Whatever the fuck you guys
eat up there. Um, so what it was,

268
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:47,900
we'll see how that one goes.
Um,

269
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,850
okay.

270
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,110
I'm hoping I bows basically open the same
thing for the Bruins and the Celtics.

271
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,420
I know we're not winning the
championship and either fucking league.

272
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,090
I'm just hoping we can go
as far as we can. All right.

273
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,580
Get some good playoff
experience and build on that.

274
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:06,170
That's what the fuck I'm looking for.
That's it. That's all. Nothing crazy.

275
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,590
You know I didn't even look to see if a,
I know the predators.

276
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,060
They won that first game. One
to nothing. A pitcher's duel.

277
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,540
See, wow. See what the fuck
happened with them and game too.

278
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,220
I know the fucking ranges and the
fucking Canadians are playing.

279
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:24,350
What do we got here? What's going
on? What's going on in the world?

280
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:28,460
The NHL fucking penguins.
They're the team to beat man.

281
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,000
Fuck the capitals till the
capital's do something.

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,350
Okay.

283
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,520
Ah, the fucking Canadians want again.
God, I hate those fucking pastors.

284
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,200
They're not going to win shit though.

285
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,560
Blue is take a three game to
none series over the wild.

286
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,820
What else do we got here? What's
going on with the phone? Come on my,

287
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:52,640
can you just give me the fucking scores
here? Oh, Pittsburgh wins in overtime.

288
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,490
All right, well where's the rest of
the, where's the rest of the scores?

289
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,050
What happened yesterday?
Chicago when

290
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,940
she,
should it be this difficult?

291
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,940
Should you just go on the website and
it's just all right there for mouth

292
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:12,540
breathing morons like me? Is this
asking too much? I went the wrong way.

293
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,520
Nashville one five to nothing.
Oh my God.

294
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,150
Okay.

295
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,570
Anaheim's up two games to not
Nashville's up two games to none.

296
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,900
Toronto beat Washington and
overtime. Ah, and I wonder,

297
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,930
I didn't hear from fucking Josh,
Adam Meyers.

298
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,710
Okay.

299
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,960
We lost in overtime. All
right, let's fuck this page.

300
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:34,430
I don't want to go back
and relive this shit.

301
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,040
So, um, yeah, that's what I did today.
That's what I've been doing this weekend.

302
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,170
Hanging out with my daughter and
I'm just watching the playoffs.

303
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,680
I watched that fucking f one race and
by rain whenever the hell that one was

304
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:53,530
that I actually taped it this time.
I had a great time watching it.

305
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,710
And the Ferrari's when again,
when again,

306
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,830
what's his face one it and I
didn't write down his name.

307
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,040
One of those v guys want it.
You know,

308
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,020
Hamilton got fucking penalize
five seconds for driving too slow,

309
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,280
slowing up Ricardo. And then people
would go and like, Hey, you know what?

310
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,400
I don't think he should have been a,

311
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,690
I don't think he should have been
penalized for uh, for fucking,

312
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,860
basically what was happening was Mercedes
was pitting both their cars at the

313
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:26,690
same fucking time, you know,
so the other guys in there,

314
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:31,310
the guy was not Nico Rosberg,
he's in there, that bolt to Skye.

315
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,070
Right. And he's fucking
sitting there. It's basically,

316
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,370
it's like when the jet pulls into
the airport, you know, and the,

317
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:40,820
and you're all excited. You're 20 minutes
fucking early. But then the guy gets on,

318
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,940
catch me Qa,

319
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,060
she could see what you arrived
about 11 minutes early yet.

320
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,680
Fortunately our gate is still occupied,
so wow.

321
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,370
Well he doesn't make a difference if
we get here early or not, we're still,

322
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,240
then I'll pull up to the, uh,
the jet way at the same time. So

323
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,183
wow.

324
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,890
Just sit back. We'll actually
as well make sure that got away.

325
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,960
Let you go enjoy the a tonic
right. Same fucking thing. Okay.

326
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:13,100
So he's fucking guy. Sorry.
I then went on way too long.

327
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,010
I was just trying to remember the
names of the airport shit. Right.

328
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,350
So here's the other guys for
already sitting there. All right.

329
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:20,900
That Boutros Boutros barley guys
already fucking sitting there.

330
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,570
So he's pulling into the pits.
He knows he can't go there,

331
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:27,890
so he starts slowing the fuck down, you
know, causing the other fucking guy.

332
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:32,530
Ricardo hit his spots open.
It's like, dude, get the fuck
out of the way. You know,

333
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,970
we said it's the way the official side,
but I,

334
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:39,340
I actually agree with the officials
because Lewis Hamilton is, uh, is, is I,

335
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,530
you know, I haven't watched
too much, but I think he's,

336
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:45,890
he's like that level competitive or he
will pull a little country moves like

337
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:49,960
that. And I think that that's why he
got paralyzed. You know, cause you know,

338
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,340
it's like, it's like when Marshawn
got busted with the fucking, you know,

339
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:55,400
the stick to the boss, you know what
I mean? You're going to get suspended.

340
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:57,700
Cause even when we know we know
the other shit you've done.

341
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,080
So I think Lewis Hamilton gets the
same fucking treatment. Um, anyways,

342
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,000
congratulations to Sebastian fettle and
the Ferrari team. This has been great.

343
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:08,890
Three races, Ferrari wins. One Mercedes.
When's the other? Now for Ryan,

344
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,450
once the third one I like,
it's gimme a nice back and forth.

345
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,040
Sebastian Vettel leads fucking Lewis
Hamilton by seven championship points,

346
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,090
68 to 61. I'm telling you guys,
get into it. It's like 57 laps.

347
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,770
It's a great fucking time. Go see what
the Illuminati does with their money.

348
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,750
It's a phenomenal God damn sport.

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,500
It's already way better than last year
where it was just fucking the Mercedes.

350
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,340
It was a race to the first turn and then
that was it. It was over, but very, uh,

351
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,450
very happy with it this
year. Um, so anyways, um,

352
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,330
what else did I do this weekend? I've been
working out like a fucking maniac. Um,

353
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,640
I actually got on the scale,
so at one 74.

354
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,190
Okay.

355
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,170
You know, I got some acting
work this week. I like to be
about a buck 72, you know,

356
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,240
that's the way I kind
of need to be around.

357
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,330
So I don't look like a big
headed fucking jackass, you know?

358
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:01,720
Shout out to all you actresses out there
who think only women deal with that.

359
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,460
It's so hard.
It's so Womack's shut up,

360
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,040
shut up. You're in a movie,
shut up. It's like, you know,

361
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,350
how was I going to, I can't be
too loud. My daughter sleeping,

362
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,420
but my wife was watching that,

363
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:20,650
keeping up with the Kardashians and
they were having a tough moment in their

364
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:23,920
family, you know, and they
were all sitting there as
you know, you know, it just,

365
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,910
it just seems like it's one thing after
another and I know a lot of families

366
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,020
deal with that, but just, it's been
really fucking, it's been really hard.

367
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,200
And as they're saying this,
they're sitting in a private jet.

368
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,670
Okay.

369
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,640
Being filmed for a television
show on their way to New York City

370
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,330
and they're all sitting there with these
said pound puppy looks on their faces.

371
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,120
I don't give a fuck if I
was going to my own funeral.

372
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,080
If I was on a private jet
to fucking New York City,

373
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,670
I would be getting shit faced. The
pilots would love me, you know,

374
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:00,130
I wouldn't have a disrupt what they're
doing up there. I would be like,

375
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,260
I'm fucking temperate. You guys. Right.

376
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,110
Okay.

377
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,490
Sitting there all sad.
It's just hard because you know,

378
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:12,990
with everything that happened last year
to then come into this year and have

379
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:16,350
more hard things to be happening,
it's just really hard.

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,320
Okay.

381
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,540
I would love to take that clip,
you know,

382
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,390
and show it to people who
actually really have problems.

383
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,270
Dual reaction video,
you know,

384
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,690
whoever's sewed together, they're
fucking clothes and I'm guilty of it too.

385
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:36,660
Everything. I fucking where's made
in a sweatshop. I actually tried,

386
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:39,750
one time there was a,
there was a website called no sweat.

387
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,690
I don't know if it still exists
and they made all these clothes.

388
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,580
None of it was sweatshop labor.

389
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:48,660
And I looked at all the clothes and none
of it was cool clothes. And I was like,

390
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:51,960
wow, I want to do the right
thing, but I can't wear that shit.

391
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:53,370
All my friends are
going to make fun of me.

392
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,080
Okay.

393
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,160
So I put my own insecurity.
I had a fucking people.

394
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,290
Okay.

395
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,420
Working for sweatshop Labor prices,
I dunno.

396
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,610
I just know it's just
really hard sometimes.

397
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:07,910
Even if you are in a private jet
on your wage in New York City.

398
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:09,820
Yeah.

399
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,740
Drinking Champagne.
They weren't even drinking champagne.

400
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,360
They were just sitting
there and looking sad.

401
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,230
They're big fucking brown
cardio machine eyes.

402
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,800
You know what they look like?
One of those fucking creepy paintings,

403
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,560
you know they make a kids with,

404
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,230
remember that that artists that just had
those giant fucking eyes that was like

405
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:29,380
his thing. They had giant,
these giant fucking creepy eyes.

406
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,740
I gotta look that shit up there. This guy,
this guy actually made a ton of money.

407
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:36,550
They were considered cute in like the
70s and I always fucking hated them.

408
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,220
I always hated him.
Oh by the way,

409
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:42,610
if you're wondering how the point
system works in f one you get 25 points.

410
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,230
If you come in first and you get
points all the way down to 10th place,

411
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:51,231
it goes 25 like (512) 108-6421 I
believe that's how it goes off and then

412
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,810
everybody else can go fuck themselves.
By the way.

413
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:59,460
How funny was it and that guy drive them
for the Honda's just bitching over the

414
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:03,630
radio, but what a piece of shit his car
was. He sounded like me in high school,

415
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,620
cause if he's driving a
fucking formula one race car,

416
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,520
he said this is the most under powered
race car I've ever driven in my life.

417
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,880
They're all sitting there like die,
do not on the radio.

418
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,830
And then they cut into his car and
it says Honda on the side of it. Um,

419
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,030
anyways, uh, yeah,

420
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:27,000
it was a really fascinating race because
there was somewhere in the Middle East

421
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:30,330
and there was, they were worried
about sand blowing onto the track,

422
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,010
which could chew up the tires and
obviously fucked with the traction. Um,

423
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,940
I don't know. The more I get
into it, the more I like it.

424
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,240
What the fuck was I looking at?
Okay.

425
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,190
Creepy big I kids.

426
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:45,900
Okay.

427
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,720
Paintings Seventies.

428
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,310
This is always search for shit.
I better get it. I barely get it.

429
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,383
Come on.

430
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,123
Okay.

431
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,440
The big eyed children, the extraordinary
story of an epic art fraud.

432
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,740
No,
that's not them.

433
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,070
Why does every art gallery have a older
white woman with the really short hair,

434
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,630
like a boy's haircut, but
it's like stylized, you know,

435
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,380
like she sings in oasis
or some shit vintage. Oh,

436
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:26,430
there it is. Is this it?
Nah, that's not them.

437
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,050
I guess everybody does the big eyed thing.

438
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,740
What does the big eyes,
what the fuck was that thing called?

439
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:38,360
It wasn't called like love is.
That's not a wow.

440
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,830
A lot of people with the big eyed kids.

441
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:43,340
A big guide kids in he
fucking big eyed kid.

442
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:48,230
Love is dot.dot.
Big Eyes.

443
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,500
Let's see if that works.
All right. I give up.

444
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,070
I'm fucking give up down a
show me a picture of spongebob.

445
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,350
Squarepants freaking out on some drugs.

446
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,350
Do you guys know the ones I was
talking about? They had little bodies.

447
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,960
They had giant heads made
these big fucking eyes,

448
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,120
these little pink fucking arms and shit.
They just were,

449
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:11,430
they were creepy as shit and everybody
thought they were so god damn cute.

450
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,640
I was a dumb kid though.
Do you know what?

451
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:19,641
Every time I walked into a Photoshop
back then and they'd have picture frames

452
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,400
and then they already have like a picture
in it like I thought that you'll buy

453
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:30,180
in that picture. My mother one time was
looking at picture frames. I was like,

454
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:34,500
why would you want that one? I mean,
whose kids are those? She just laughed.

455
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,760
She laughed and she goes,
no,

456
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:39,210
you take it out and then you put your
picture in there. I was like, oh,

457
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,550
now that I have a kid, I can't imagine
like that's gotta be a terrifying moment.

458
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:52,140
Like, oh my God, is my kid going to
be homeless? I'll fucking, you know,

459
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,770
come home. You look at you like, like dead
dead. Dumbness was not in me. You know,

460
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:58,770
you come home and you look at your
spouse, that's you. You did that.

461
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,450
And she was strand a fucking
DNA messing up my 50%.

462
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,760
Thank you very much.

463
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:08,580

advertising here for the week. Um,

big. I'd fucking kids. All Right,

It's called getting shit faced.

467

day or with someone you love,

You want me to read these two and now
you want to hear this story about me

546
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,700
trying to make fucking dumplings?
Let's talk about that.

547
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,590
A where any any fuck Anais it's out there.

548
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,650
Any Asians listen to this podcast and
anybody from the fire east migrated over

549
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:38,154
here.

550
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,190
Maybe a generation or maybe your family's
like old school and they kept the

551
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:47,930
tradition going so you know how to make
fucking dumplings. I, I love dumplings.

552
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,640
All right. I'm like Oprah
right now. I love dogs.

553
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,770
I fucking love dumplings.

554
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:59,720
And I told you the story of when I was
in Singapore and I was on my way to Hong

555
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,840
Kong and I was in the fucking airport
lounge and that con ate all the fucking

556
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:05,390
dumplings. I swear to God,
I don't know how it was.

557
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,690
Belly wasn't hanging over his pants.
He says little skinny motherfucker.

558
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,580
It was like as a competitive eater,

559
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,720
they kept bringing them out in like in
like groups of like 14 in this fucking

560
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:15,980
guy would eat like 11 of them.

561
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,270
It's like he was flying around the world
and there was going to be no food in

562
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:25,040
the God damn plane. So the best dumplings
I ever fucking head. I was in Hong Kong,

563
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,850
I went to some dim sum shit.
I don't know what the hell it was,

564
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:33,650
but it is a fucking art form over there.
But I'll tell you here in America,

565
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,590
they still do a great job,
but the dumplings, the pots,

566
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,440
I love him. All right. I told you
guys a while ago, I was, you know,

567
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,690
I wanted to get outside my palate and I
never cooked with any of the Asian Shit

568
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,860
even though I love it,
right?

569
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,310
So I decided that I'm going to try and
make these fucking dumplings right.

570
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,900
So of course I don't have any of the
ingredients I need other than the flower.

571
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,160
Hot Water, sugar, salt, what
are the fuck else did I have?

572
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,100
And of course they had some of
that with a soy sauce. I had that,

573
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,140
but everything else I didn't have,
I didn't have anything else.

574
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,290
So I go to the white grocery store,
right?

575
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,280
I go to their little Asian section
that's right next to the Mexican section

576
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,330
that's a little bit bigger.

577
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,540
And then everything else is just for
northern Europeans. I mean that's,

578
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,250
that's a white grocery store. That's what
it's like. Okay. So I say to the guy,

579
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:26,390
you got to eat his fucking chili sauce.
Do you have any of the dark soy sauce?

580
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,160
And you know,

581
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:32,390
I actually asked an agent dude that worked
at the fish counter and he was like,

582
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,090
Nah man, they don't have that
shit here. And I was like,

583
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:39,110
do you know where I can get it? And he was
like, no, I mean, I dunno where you live.

584
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,430
And I was like, all right,
sorry. So I ended up going to,

585
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:48,140
uh, uh, whatever it was a Korea town, Thai
town, I don't know what the fuck it was.

586
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:51,590
I went and I went to into this grocery
store and I come walk in whole new

587
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:56,120
fucking world, all these fucking noodles,
all of this shit I'm looking at going,

588
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,910
that's the stuff when I ordered,
there it is right there. Right.

589
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,710
So I'm looking for my style.
I needed like corn flour

590
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,940
and they didn't have any.
So when I went to the Thai grocery store,

591
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,920
I was looking for it and there was this
Asian lady there with their mother and

592
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:16,430
she sees me, the fucking white dude
no round. I here looking at the shit,

593
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:19,160
trying to figure stuff out. And
she starts laughing. She goes,

594
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,780
what are you trying to make?
And then I laughed.

595
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,020
I sent him and try to make dumplings.
So he goes, all right, what do you need?

596
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,190
I said, I'm trying to find corn flour.
And she goes, Oh, you know, it's just,

597
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,160
you know, since she talks to her mother,
we had [inaudible] down there fucking,

598
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,440
you know, the real deal, shit, you know,

599
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,860
bilingual shit going down and they're
trying to help me find the corn.

600
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,661
They couldn't.

601
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:41,770
So I they found this other shit and
that was close to it and we're like, ah,

602
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,570
I don't know if you can use
that. So I was like, I fuck it.

603
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:45,670
Maybe I got to go to Chinatown.
I have no fucking idea.

604
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,670
So I thank him and they say,
good luck and I leave.

605
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,340
Then I'm standing up at the
register and was hilarious.

606
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:54,520
That same woman came up to me
and this is what she says to me.

607
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:57,640
This is like a minute later, she
goes, uh, excuse me. She goes, well,

608
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:01,000
you're the guy who was just talking to
and immediately I'm like, oh my God,

609
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:01,834
we all look alike.

610
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,603
Okay.

611
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,820
So I laugh and I go, yeah.
She goes, I just googled it.

612
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:13,200
You can use this as a substitute. She
took the time out to Google it. It's like,

613
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:16,200
you know what, you, you're awesome. She
said, no worries. I said, all right,

614
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,370
see you later. So now I got a new
grocery store to go to. So I come home.

615
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:21,970
So I go to the meat store,

616
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,230
I get my fucking pork and all that
shit and get my ginger, right.

617
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,640
All this shit that I'm
going to put in there.

618
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,600
So I go to make this make the filling
was fucking easy. My Bok Choy,

619
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,750
fucking cutting up the green onions,
all of that. It's smelling right.

620
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,520
It's looking right,
everything's going good.

621
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,230
Then I go to do the fucking dough and
it, God damn it, that was a motherfucker.

622
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,300
Yeah.

623
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,610
Not Mixing it up. Mixing
it up was easy, but like,

624
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:47,570
just trying to make them
into a round circle was, uh,

625
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,880
that was not easy. Forget about
folding them up and uh, so whatever.

626
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:55,490
I put a little oil in the pan.
It took me forever.

627
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:58,970
It took me like two hours
to do this whole thing.

628
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,570
And I was talking to somebody else
who married into an Asian family.

629
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:05,810
It was just like, oh man. He
goes, when they do it, they
think fucking how quickly,

630
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,370
you know,

631
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:11,210
they can fucking get the dumpling together
and fold it up and make it look right.

632
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,650
It's like, it's like a fucking,
it's like magic, you know?

633
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:19,370
And I'm sitting there all clumsy trying
to get the thing together and it took me

634
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,730
like two hours to get the whole thing
together. And for whatever reason,

635
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:27,560
this fucking recipe I had like
how many did I have?

636
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,510
I had like fucking like 40 of them.

637
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,140
Okay.

638
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,130
Almost like I almost quit like
15 times just going like, yeah,

639
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,500
how many times can I have
ordered dumplings from the
people that invented them,

640
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:41,160
that know what the fuck they're
doing. But I plowed ahead. Right.

641
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,610
So we got the oil on the Pan
and I just follow the thing,

642
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:47,250
you know when they get nice and Golden
Brown, then you pour your water in,

643
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,030
you put the lid on him, you
steam them when the water's
gone, they're done. And uh,

644
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:51,990
I got to tell you they were,

645
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,220
they were ugly on a scale of one to 10,

646
00:37:56,221 --> 00:38:00,810
they were a strong six. Did Not
look good. Too many different sizes.

647
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,390
Even though the ladies on the,
on the video show me how to do what?

648
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:07,890
I still fucked that up. And um,
and then, you know, I'm the worst.

649
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:11,190
I have to stop fucking doing this. Cause
I always go to Nia like, was it good?

650
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,370
How does it taste? Is it good? And
the second she knows I want approval.

651
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,030
Okay.

652
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,470
She turns into fucking Simon Cowl.
She was just saying, Oh, you know,

653
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:23,800
they're uh, you know, and it's
like, I even said, well listen,

654
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,490
I know these aren't great
for first attempt it. That's
pretty good, right? I look,

655
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:30,010
you know, insecure fucking
guy that I am. I need to look,

656
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,940
just give me a little fucking feedback
comedian. That's why I like stand up.

657
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,940
How'd you guys like it? Ha ha ha. We it
dead silence around it. Get it. All right.

658
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:40,120
I want this one now. Do you like
math? Do you like me again? You know,

659
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,590
that's how I live my life. I lived moment
to fucking moment. Not in a zen way,

660
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,380
just in a completely insecure way.
Right?

661
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,430
So she's not giving it up and I go,
so we know what's, what's, what's up.

662
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,490
She goes to something,
uh, well, I don't know.

663
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:57,130
The doe is just not a,
you know,

664
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,920
she's clearly just opening them up and
just eating the middle out of them.

665
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,040
I go to, to like sticky, she goes, no,

666
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,600
that's not the word.
Um,

667
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,770
and immediately I'm just like, Oh God,
I just want to fucking just, yeah.

668
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,750
Um,
gummy.

669
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah.

670
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,170
Is that the worker? Yes. Sticky gummy.

671
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,220
You want it to the source. How
are you? Say The fucking word.

672
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,960
So this is what happened is,
you know,

673
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,450
I learned from the chef that you
gotta be, you know, tasting your food.

674
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,500
I feel ever I used to cook
and I wouldn't be tasting,

675
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:43,160
so I was tasting them the whole fucking
way. And the chef told me, you know,

676
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,410
by the time it's done,

677
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:47,600
you're not going to want any
because you've tasted so much of it.

678
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:51,140
So I'd already had so many fucking
dumplings the time I got it.

679
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:54,140
Like I was almost a little
sick and I fucking hate him.

680
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,750
And I knew that they weren't right.
But I definitely had a good time.

681
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,220
I think I would quarter that
recipe solely, only make
like fucking eight of them.

682
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:07,330
Then I could have fun and I could
actually like take my time rather than do.

683
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:08,540
It was like,
I swear to God,

684
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,540
it was so perfect that I did it during
tax time because that's what it felt like.

685
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,020
You know,

686
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,020
when you get all your receipts all
laid out and all these little balls of

687
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,570
fucking flower.
But um,

688
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,090
okay.

689
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,950
Ah, dude, this morning,
like I didn't even clean up.

690
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,430
I went downstairs and I was just like
a dumplings and I had a fucking scotch.

691
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,040
I was doing so well on my diet
and next day of fucking woke up,

692
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:30,610
looked like a starving child with
it, like a distended belly, you know,

693
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,540
if that should starving child
was an alcoholic. And um,

694
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,850
so I fucking,

695
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,470
I came upstairs and just the smell of
that fucking soy sauce and all that should

696
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:47,680
have to all those dumplings I
fucking hate. And I swear to God,

697
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,290
I actually have a new found
respect for that son of a bitch.

698
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:53,620
They all adopt those dumplings in,
uh,

699
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,540
in Singapore. I don't know what the
fuck that guy's stomach is made out of,

700
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:02,080
but food, you can't eat all
of that dough. So, um, Dan,

701
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:04,210
of course eating like that
kind of threw me off my diet.

702
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,620
Went to this fucking great cookout
today and I, I, you know, I ate well,

703
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:12,370
but not well, if you know what I mean.
So who knows. Whatever I'm doing. Well,

704
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:14,620
I'm doing one with the Diet. I'm still,
I'm still going in the right direction.

705
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,040
Okay. I've shaved off about eight pounds
off of the fucking Christmas Ham here.

706
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,310
Oh, bill is going to be able to fit in
as suits in about another five pounds.

707
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:26,080
Get down like one 71 71. That's it.
Then we're trying that suit again.

You know why?
Cause I'm not a quitter.

709
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,320

A salad with chicken.

770
00:44:52,681 --> 00:44:57,450
Cause you're on a diet. Yes. Everybody
knows I was talking to you about your,

771
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,100
your, your cold calculated
review of my dumplings.

772
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:07,180
What are you talking about? You know how
you do. Hey Sweetie, what's up buddy?

773
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:12,220
You just woke up. Movie that smile. Nod.

774
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,440
Oh she's, you know what I'm, I know I'm
bias, but we got, we got one cute ass kid.

775
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,930
Uh Yeah, we're done. Yeah,
you're done. Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew.

776
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,660
Ew.
Made dumplings.

777
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,790
See this is what I'm talking about.
It's so cold.

778
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,280
Yes. You A ew. Ew. Ew. You
May, dumplings tried. I mean,

779
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:46,050
you know you made it. I don't
mean you tried. You did make it.

780
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,410
No you can't. This is, this is, you
can't, you can't give it up ever.

781
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,570
I become hard.
This is who you give it up.

782
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:58,930
Okay.

783
00:45:58,930 --> 00:45:59,820
You know, I, I'm,

784
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,890
I feel like I'm very honest with you
is what it is because I respect you so,

785
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,330
Ooh,
you're going to turn this around.

786
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,360
That was a nice little flippy do that
you did there because I respect you.

787
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:14,590
I'm going to be honest with you. If I
didn't respect you, I would just be like,

788
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,490
oh yeah, everything you
do is amazing. Well wait,

789
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:21,550
that didn't come out right either.
What I'm trying to say is,

790
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,600
I think they put forth a great,

791
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,290
I'm just going to, you keep talking your
way down this fucking well, I'm done.

792
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:36,490
I'm done. I'm done. Yeah.
Okay. Well, you know what?

793
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:40,120
I realize I respect you too.
What does that mean?

794
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,540
It means I'm going to start
being as honest as you are.

795
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,850
That's what I'm going to do. What is it
exactly that you're upset with me about?

796
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,110
Cause you can't just be like, you know,
they're, they're all right then a great,

797
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:56,230
that would be perfect, but
you have to be like, um,

798
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,380
there's something with the dough and I
was just like, is it sticky? You're like,

799
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:06,000
wow, Ooh, that's not the word. Oh,

800
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:10,260
she's just let me just put two behind my
ear and I'll move onto the next fucking

801
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:10,750
meal.

802
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:15,590
Then you had to finally just
be like on gummy sat the word.

803
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:18,110
That's what,
and then he said what gummy means.

804
00:47:18,111 --> 00:47:19,580
You can live like blow bubbles with it.

805
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:23,060
And I just couldn't even say anything
because if I said anything I would start

806
00:47:23,061 --> 00:47:27,560
laughing because obviously I don't
mean that you can blow bubbles with it.

807
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,260
I know you just, you're a, you're
a tough, you're a tough one.

808
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,170
You're a tough one. It's, it's
tough to get a compliment out of,

809
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:39,730
you feel like dumplings
are also easy to make.

810
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,910
You know what I mean? It was your
first try. They looked amazing.

811
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,800
The feeling was good.
Just the dough part was,

812
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,450
it's definitely off. I think I like
overcooked it, I think, I'm not sure,

813
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,650
but I'm not, I'm just saying you
have like, you have this dislike,

814
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:58,900
you just take out the sickle when it's,

815
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:03,690
when it's coming and you turn it like go
down the Olympic judge to be like eager

816
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,290
to be like, yet. I mean they're
not the best, but you know,

817
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,950
you'll get them on the next one.
Give me a little pat on the fucking head.

818
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,640
You're just like, nope,
these are not good.

819
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,050
Have a nice evening.
I will see you in the morning.

820
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,760
All right. I'll take this
opportunity. You won't.

821
00:48:21,761 --> 00:48:24,130
I've been talking to you about
this for fucking 14 years.

822
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,630
Hey Buddy.
Oh,

823
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,110
can I take a bite out of this hour?
Huh?

824
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,630
Why can't you say this age forever?
These be this big,

825
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,940
big ball of cute.
We carry around.

826
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,410
She's got a mischievous look on her face.
You're going to be Tuffy tonight?

827
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,020
Like last night. Last night. Yeah.

828
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:53,880
I'll tell you it was a rough one.
I let,

829
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,340
let me finish this up here so I can go
eat my cold fish or chicken or whatever.

830
00:48:57,341 --> 00:49:00,470
I ordered chicken.
All right.

831
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,400
I'm not,
you're way off the microfiber.

832
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:08,580
Even annoying the shit out of people for
the last five minutes. Okay. All right.

833
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,580
Hey Nia,
that that dress is,

834
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,600
I mean it's address your,
you're wearing it

835
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:22,720
and I still, I can't even do it to you.
You look great asshole. Get out of here.

836
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:28,450
Alright, wagon, please read.
Please read. Hey there,

837
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:31,300
Billy baby white as the
first kid. One. All right.

838
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,050
I heard you the email you read a couple
of weeks ago about the older guy who was

839
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:40,051
wondering if it was worth it to lay off
the booze and reconnect with his family.

840
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,810
I can tell you I wasn't
as bad as that guy,

841
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,810
but it made me realize I
could be a better person.

842
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,900
I quit boozing two days
after I heard his story.

843
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,570
I called my brother and
I started a dialogue.

844
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,340
I should've started eight years ago.

845
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,140
I used to listen to you talk about
boobs and think it was an excuse to keep

846
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:02,860
boozing, not placing the blame on
you. I'm a moron. Well, yeah, I mean,

847
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,440
I don't know you so I wouldn't think
that you were trying to blame me.

848
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:09,060
I wouldn't accept the blame either.
Uh,

849
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,100
but then I realized you don't drink all
day every day and that you have a full

850
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,940
career in a kid and a wife.

851
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:19,180
I have a plumbing and
heating job and a terrier.

852
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,240
I still smoke weed because
it helps with my arthritis,

853
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,680
which is actually very severe and
prevents me from doing things.

854
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:30,790
It just picturing you're jerking off.
God Damn it. I can't, I can't sustain.

855
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:35,680
It prevents me from doing things like
running and lifting comfortably. Uh,

856
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,260
the call to my brother initiated.
Um,

857
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,590
well I bet taking all that booze out
of your system would probably help out.

858
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:45,070
I don't think booze and is good for
your joints. Is it all that sugar?

859
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:50,500
I don't, I don't, I, I always just repeat
shit that I half listened to. I'm sorry.

860
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,070
The call my brother initiated
his inviting me to Easter. Nice.

861
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:57,610
The first holiday I was spelling my
family and almost nine years. Thanks.

862
00:50:57,611 --> 00:51:01,120
And Go fuck yourself. All right, well,
I don't know what you thanking me for.

863
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,320
You did it. I don't know that
I said anything. By the way.

864
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,290
My wife was watching Dr Phil.

865
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,400
Okay.

866
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,400
And they had this fucking
guy on there. I, I,

867
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:15,980
it was one of the most fucked
up things I've ever seen on TV.

868
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:19,130
This guy was basically
going on the Internet.

869
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,150
He was into conspiracy theory and he lost
his job and he went and got into this

870
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:27,170
meditating thing and he said he
had reached this spiritual plane.

871
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:28,600
Okay.

872
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,090
Um,
of constant meditation.

873
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:33,880
And nobody and he couldn't
explain it to anybody around him,

874
00:51:33,881 --> 00:51:35,260
like his wife and doctor.

875
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,320
Phil's trying to talk to the guy and
he goes and he just kept going like,

876
00:51:38,321 --> 00:51:42,310
so what are you trying,
you're, you're meditating,

877
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:44,900
you're on the Internet,
you're meditating.

878
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,200
And then the guy just kept taking this
arrogant like line with him going.

879
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,650
Yeah, see once again, I
mean you'd have to read up.

880
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:55,480
I mean I can't just explain this to you.

881
00:51:55,481 --> 00:52:00,481
I can send you links on to try to get to
my level basically of higher thinking.

882
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,590
And then doctor Phil's like Dow,
talk down to me.

883
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,470
K, first of all, you don't know me.

884
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:13,060
I'm one of the most open minded people
you're ever going to me. First of all,

885
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:15,590
who the fuck says that about themselves?
Oh,

886
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,020
I'm one of the greatest people I've
ever met. Right? So long story short,

887
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:23,890
they bring in Deepak Chopra.
All right,

888
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,490
another whore of spirituality.
You know,

889
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,570
he's a horror of psychology and this
fucking jerk off comes in with these

890
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:36,571
fucking bright red sneakers on and sits
down next to this guy and the guy's

891
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:40,570
freaking out cause he feels like
he's on the same plane as this guy.

892
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:46,470
And then he proceeds to basically say
that this guy is a abandoning his family.

893
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,780
He picked his words carefully.

894
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:54,640
I will say that about a old fucking
Depok d to The motherfucking Chopra.

895
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,160
He basically picked his words carefully,

896
00:52:57,161 --> 00:53:02,161
but in the end he said to Dr Phil
that he feels this guy is bipolar.

897
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,070
Okay,

898
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:10,070
this fucking poor bastard found out that
he was bipolar on national television.

899
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:15,140
Like, Oh and the guy fucking scissor.
Excellent. He's helping people.

900
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,560
Basically,
you're bipolar.

901
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:23,620
You're not reaching a higher spiritual
plane as much as you are experiencing a

902
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,660
episode.

903
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,473
MMM.

904
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,720
Yeah.
Just doing that judge Judy Shit,

905
00:53:31,721 --> 00:53:35,560
where's he's talking all tough to
two minutes into it, I was like,

906
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:39,130
this guy needs some serious psychological
help, but I, I don't, I don't know shit.

907
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:40,620
Okay.

908
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,830
Fucking Depok coming out
with making this face.

909
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,630
I'm trying to think who the fuck he looks
like. I don't know what he looks like.

910
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:49,464
Liberace.

911
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:54,340
Okay.

912
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:58,270
Whatever, whatever national, what
is he? Is He Indian ease? Like if,

913
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,820
if India had a Liberace, this, this,

914
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:05,440
would they ever do the fucking Michael
Douglas, Matt Damon version of Liberace?

915
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:08,860
If they do it in some Bollywood thing
that he got to, you got to cast that guy.

916
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,773
MMM.

917
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,790
Any, I love that he was just available
to, does he live out in Hollywood?

918
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:16,970
All right.

919
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,750
Anyways, I have no fucking idea.
I don't know anymore. You know,

920
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:25,751
one of my favorite things too is my wife
is on Instagram and Instagram's a pain

921
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:29,230
in the ass because if you're not on it,
you can't look at the photos and shit.

922
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,660
And I just can't join
another social media site.

923
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:35,950
But one of my favorite fucking things
of those people who take up pictures of

924
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:40,750
themselves in their amazing bodies after
they work out and rather than theirs in

925
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,450
saying,
don't I look fucking amazing,

926
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,920
they actually act like they're
trying to motivate you. You know,

927
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,860
like reach Hashtag reached your goal.

928
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,733
MMM.

929
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,530
The hashtag putting that work in.
Um,

930
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,100
I just,
I think I've just,

931
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:09,130
I've just become an old man now and
I don't understand younger people.

932
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:13,630
I just don't understand like it did the
level of dose chills that you would take

933
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:17,560
a picture of yourself while
you're working out, you know,

934
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:22,060
under the guise that you're trying
to motivate people. You know, like,

935
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:26,680
this isn't about me guys. This is
in my eight pack. This is about you.

936
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,790
I'm trying to,
I try to inspire people with my beauty.

937
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,633
MMM.

938
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,660
That's why I don't believe in Christ.

939
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,330
Okay.

940
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:41,080
When I just see moments like that, it's
just like, what is God waiting for?

941
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:45,460
When are you going to send this dude
back? Like, how bad does it have to get,

942
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:49,210
you know, in a way, I almost blame God at
this point. It's like you're enabling us.

943
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,560
How long you going to keep letting us
have the intelligence to advent these

944
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:56,420
devices to further disappear
up our own ass holes?

945
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,860
As I sit on a podcast talking
to myself for a fucking hour.

946
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:05,170
Ah, Jesus. I swear to God. Every
time. I think I'll make it a point.

947
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:07,200
I just realized what a fucking
hypocrite I am. All right.

948
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,150
Little girl statue in Syria.

949
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,720
Okay.
This sounds like clickbait.

950
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:20,060
You know when you see little
girl finds a statue in Syria,

951
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:24,000
what she does next will shock you.
You know,

952
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,780
you click on it and there's
one photo in 87 ads.

953
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,340
Fuck all of those sites.
Um,

954
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,930
all right bill for days people flooded
Facebook and praise of the little girl

955
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:39,210
statue they placed in front of
the Wall Street bull. Everybody,

956
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:43,890
mostly women and social justice
warriors went on about resisting.

957
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:45,260
Okay.

958
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:49,940
And how powerful the statue was.
I choose to fight.

959
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,310
Um, it turns out the little girl statue
was put up by a media slash marketing

960
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:59,600
company that has zero interest in
doing anything but creating a buzz for

961
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:03,440
themselves. Um, that's not,

962
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,110
that's not all the bullets.

963
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:09,670
Self was a piece of art erected
by an independent artist.

964
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,310
It was panned by Wall Street
and they wanted it removed.

965
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:17,600
The people kept it there.
Everyone is a sucker. Uh,

966
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:22,660
whenever that means.K O n y 2012 I cited
a source below unless the rest of the

967
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:25,304
twats

968
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,470
okay

969
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:31,390
on Facebook. Thank you. Skipped some words
here. Sorry for the stomach growling.

970
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,320
Um,

971
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,060
also that white hat document mentoree
that went everywhere about the group of

972
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:41,380
volunteers that came to the aid of Syrian
chemical weapons victims was part of a

973
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:45,190
huge agenda to make America
mad at the Syrian regime.

974
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,850
International reporters are questioning
the source of those weapons.

975
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,800
Some think it was even, it wasn't even
the Syrian government. We're all fucked.

976
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:58,570
Love you love Nia. Congrats
on the little lady. Um,

977
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,870
yeah, I believe all that type of
shit. I believe that type of shit. Um,

978
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,500
I don't know if any of that type of stuff,

979
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:10,420
but I definitely believe that they show
images to make us fucking upset about

980
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:12,550
stuff. You know, um,

981
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,790
seems very easy to defeat terrorism.
To me,

982
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,910
all you do is just embrace the electric
cars. Just make everything electric.

983
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:21,400
We stopped buying oil from those guys.
They don't have any money.

984
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:25,210
They go bankrupt and next thing you know,
they can't afford anything but rocks.

985
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,330
We're not over there.
They gradually forget about us.

986
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:31,810
They go back to arguing with one
another and we just slowly back away.

987
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:35,830
Why don't we just do that? You know
why? Because there's no money in that.

988
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,550
That's what I think, but what
do I know? All right. Terrified.

989
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:40,800
Okay.

990
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,380
Have a threesome. Can I, can I click on
this link up here? What does this link?

991
00:58:45,381 --> 00:58:48,740
This person sent me? I don't know why.
Oh, I know why because I don't have it.

992
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:51,200
I got to click on it
when it's in the email.

993
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,780
What's in the eat when it's an email?

994
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,190
Now how do I find what the fucking email
is? Live reads. Blow my, go to that.

995
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,770
Click on inbox.
Retrace all my steps.

996
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:06,470
Go to the contents,
scroll down,

997
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,430
click on the link.
Wait for it to open.

998
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:15,480
It is now trying to load. All right,
I'll get back to that in a minute.

999
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,740
In the meantime, terrified of
a threesome. Hey parentheses,

1000
00:59:19,741 --> 00:59:24,390
insert cheap redhead insult here. Huge
Fan love you. Stand up andF is for family.

1001
00:59:24,391 --> 00:59:25,224
Thank you.

1002
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,460
I'm 20 I'm a 21 year old college student
who has a girlfriend that is bisexual

1003
00:59:29,461 --> 00:59:33,000
and beautiful as well.
God bless you.

1004
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:34,950
Woo.

1005
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,250
God bless you sir.
God bless you.

1006
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,970
There's no way you don't believe
in God, man. God bless you.

1007
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,350
We've talked about asking girls to join
us in bed and are finally getting ready

1008
00:59:46,351 --> 00:59:47,310
to have it happen.

1009
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:52,740
The girl that's joining us is a girl that
the both of us have gotten with in the

1010
00:59:52,741 --> 00:59:57,180
past at different times.
Ah, this is perfect.

1011
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:00,810
The only problem is that I get freaked
the fuck out when I think about this

1012
01:00:00,811 --> 01:00:04,560
happening. Both of the women
involved are hot and experience,

1013
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:06,000
which is what scares me.

1014
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:11,250
I'm not that astounding looking of a guy,
not that well in doubt.

1015
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:14,120
As far as my dick goes and not
experienced at all. Come here.

1016
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:17,700
You're going to talk yourself out of
this dude and not experienced at all

1017
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:21,660
compared to these girls. I do. I get
past my fears and relaxed enough to make,

1018
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:26,580
to be into what's happening and make
sure I make it worthwhile for both these

1019
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,900
ladies. Thanks. And Go
fuck yourself. Uh, two,

1020
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,630
do not fuck this up.
Okay.

1021
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,300
The only way you can fuck
this up is to not show up.

1022
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:42,590
To show up and let nature take over.
Okay? It's all right to be freaked out.

1023
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,290
You're 21 years old.
You've got to fucking smoking hot chicks,

1024
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:49,220
one of fucking banging at the same
time. That's a lot. This rockstar shit.

1025
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,450
I Dunno what you do for a living, but I'm
guessing you're not a fucking rockstar.

1026
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:58,580
So yeah, this is a, this is,
this is fucking great. This
is a great God damn thing.

1027
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,210
Um, you know, and if you
want to, I'll just tell you
girlfriend, just be like, yeah,

1028
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:04,520
I'm excited and I'm a, I'm got to
be going to seem a little nervous.

1029
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:07,340
You guys are both so, but just keep
paying it back cause it's so beautiful.

1030
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:11,840
Now things should we tell women you're
lax, just follow my lead. Just do that.

1031
01:01:11,841 --> 01:01:13,910
Just be open and honest about it.

1032
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,370
But don't take it to the
fucking point that you like.

1033
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,340
Don't say all that other shit.
You know, just look the guy,

1034
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,010
I could have had a bigger dick
than, she's going to think, well,

1035
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:26,030
what the fuck am I doing this with
you for? Don't go that far. All right,

1036
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,510
here's the thing dude.
You definitely good looking enough.

1037
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,570
You definitely got a big enough dick.
Oh, none of this shit would be happening,

1038
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:38,150
right? Okay. You got
called up to the shell.

1039
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:43,040
Okay. Get up to the plate and
swing out of your fucking cleats.

1040
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,820
I would let them start. Let them start
and then you just kind of fucking,

1041
01:01:46,821 --> 01:01:50,390
you know, work your way in. That's all.

1042
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:56,020
Just start making out with both of them.
That's it. Get some fucking, I dunno,

1043
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:00,170
I don't just, just
please, please do please.

1044
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:05,530
For the Sunday 48 year old you who
probably be doing a podcast by himself.

1045
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,460
Okay? Please don't fuck this up. Okay?
Don't do not talk yourself out of this.

1046
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,010
You getting in your fucking head.
All right?

1047
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,390
You've already gotten with both of them.
She obviously likes you,

1048
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:21,180
Dick Sheiks coming back for
more you girlfriends still
there. This is just like,

1049
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:22,350
this is something else,
dude,

1050
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,850
and this is a great experience for you
to push past all that fucking low self

1051
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:31,740
esteem. All right, so man, have fucked up.
Have a great time. Follow up email please.

1052
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:34,920
All right. My girl loves me too much. No,

1053
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:39,780
but I can't love myself at all. All
right. Hey, Billy moose knuckle.

1054
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:43,620
I always forget what that is.
I know what a camel toe is.

1055
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:45,810
I don't know what a moose knuckle is.
A,

1056
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:49,770
I'm a 22 is that a Canadian camel toe?
I don't know.

1057
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:54,000
I'm a 22 year old college student and
I've been with my girlfriend for about a

1058
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,410
year now.
Things have been great.

1059
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,890
Only problem is that she's
got the tendency to tell me,

1060
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:01,470
I love you or you're so important to me,

1061
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:05,820
or I adore you at least 15 times a
day without any lead up. Oh yeah,

1062
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,860
that's creepy. She just does
it out of the blue. I guess.

1063
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:11,850
It's nice to hear,

1064
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:15,660
but after a point it makes me wonder
if she has some underlying issue.

1065
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:21,240
I'm the first boyfriend and she's still
shocked even after dating for a year

1066
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:25,050
that someone finds her attractive.
Sorry. Hiccups are coming.

1067
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:29,190
I'm on top of all this.
She gets weird and passive aggressive.

1068
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:32,340
When I suggest I have a night
to myself saying things like,

1069
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:36,060
I guess I'll stay home alone or I'll
just eat leftover soup and watch the food

1070
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:39,750
network. This shit kills me and
I usually cave and come over.

1071
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:44,280
I'm an introvert at heart and need my
time alone to recharge and study or read

1072
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:47,220
my favorite books when we're together.
We mostly watch movies,

1073
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:51,690
talk about school or fuck, which is fine,
but I need to be alone once in awhile.

1074
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,360
I have too much empathy
and I'm a pushover,

1075
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:58,140
which doesn't help anything and it
doesn't help anything. I need some advice.

1076
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,320
Do you think she has an attachment
problem or is it something else?

1077
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,140
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
I would just work on your end of it.

1078
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,670
Whatever her issue is, it might come
to a head when you just say, listen,

1079
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:12,030
I just need a long time.
Sometimes you know,

1080
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,430
and let her pout and do whatever
the fuck she wants to do.

1081
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:16,860
And eventually she'll
accept that about you.

1082
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,840
Or she'll tell you why she's too insecure
to not spend the night and you know,

1083
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:26,870
spend a night alone or she'll flip
the fuck out and you'll be like,

1084
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,060
wow, I'm not with the right
person, but I can tell you this,

1085
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:35,120
I'm not doing what you want to do in
a relationship is the quickest way to

1086
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:37,290
poison the water.
Okay.

1087
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:40,530
And I don't mean just going
out and fucking around and
doing all shit like that,

1088
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:44,310
but I mean like, you know, if
you don't like going to Brunch,

1089
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:46,620
you have to tell him you don't
like going to brunch now.

1090
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,210
You still have to go to some brunches,

1091
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:51,210
but you're not going to be going
to them all the time. All right?

1092
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,530
To not tell her that you're an introvert
at heart and you need your time alone

1093
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,370
to recharge and study and all that
type of shit. Read your favorite books,

1094
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:00,773
you know,

1095
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,430
she has to respect that about you and
you got to respect that about you. Okay.

1096
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:09,810
Stop giving into what the
fuck she wants. Um, what you,

1097
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:14,640
you were having a night alone every
once in a while is not a crazy request.

1098
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:19,750
Okay. And, um, I would do that
first and see how she reacts.

1099
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,930
And you might get to the
bottom of why she has to say,

1100
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:27,220
I love you and I adore you and all of
that shit 50 times a fucking day probably.

1101
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:30,400
Cause you're a, she's probably terrified
that it's not going to end well.

1102
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,130
You know, she's, if she's
never had another boyfriend,

1103
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:37,060
I'm guessing she's around your age.
Maybe that gave her some sort of complex,

1104
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,730
I don't fucking know.
This is some few guys to work out,

1105
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:41,620
but I got to tell you this right now.
If you need a long time,

1106
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:44,800
you got to tell her that or else you're
gonna end up presenting her and the

1107
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:49,150
whole relationship is going to gradually
start. It's fucking downward spiral. And,

1108
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:52,780
um, and that's it. And it crashes and
Burns right in the fucking cornfield.

1109
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,750
Okay. That's it. That's the
podcasts, uh, for this week. Um,

1110
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:04,480
I said everything that I wanted to talk
about, I got Boise, Idaho coming up. Uh,

1111
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,100
this we can,
yes.

1112
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:11,101
Next weekend I'll be out there with
Rosebowl tailgate legend and puck off host

1113
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,700
all things, comedy network
podcasts, or, uh, Joe part. Nick.

1114
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,940
We're going to have a great time
on her up there. Um, that is all.

1115
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,720
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
