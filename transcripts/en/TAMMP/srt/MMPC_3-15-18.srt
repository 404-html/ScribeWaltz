1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,650
Hey, what's going on is bill burns,
is Sanford the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:06,770
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,030
just checking in on.
You just see now you weeks go in.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,300
How your life is,
how you're feeling this day.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,880
Um, uh, I'm not, I don't
know. I don't, you know,

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,890
you know I was supposed to get my
Invisalign off yesterday. Right?

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,720
I was all excited.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,700
This shit was supposed to take 16 weeks
and because I wore them like a fucking

9
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:41,300
lunatic, basically 24, seven occasion,

10
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:43,550
I'd smoke a cigar or I do is set.

11
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:46,100
If I did a long set and I didn't feel
like spitting all over the stage,

12
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:46,851
I would take him out.

13
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:50,030
But a lot of times it just left them in
one time I left them in when I smoked a

14
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:52,430
cigar. That was a bad move. Bad move.

15
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,160
I just sit there and brush and pluck an
hour so there wouldn't be fucking all

16
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,320
brown.
Hey.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,590
So last time I saw my
dentist, he's like, oh gee.

18
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,660
Willikers it wouldn't
wearing them so much.

19
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:10,380
I think we'll be done by the 13th week.
And I was like, you gotta be kidding me.

20
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,400
This is a great,
I tried not to get excited.

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,180
I tried to be like, okay, well
I'm supposed to be, you know,

22
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:20,660
just mentally just keep being prepared
for the end of March when these things

23
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:23,300
are going to be off. So anyway,
so I go to the dentist, right?

24
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:26,600
And I'm wearing them and I'm wearing
them and I'm driving over, I'm wearing,

25
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:30,260
I'm chewing on the stupid sponge to make
sure the fucking trays all the way down

26
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:35,120
and all of that shit.
So I show up and he,

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,110
you know, takes it, takes
off. He's all, he's a good,
oh man. Wow. You really would.

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,510
You'd see when you comply, blah,
blah, blah blah. But these good,

29
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:42,710
and I'm sitting there going,
don't get excited.

30
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:47,480
Don't cause he cause kid comes to
however only I think we gave enough two

31
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:51,710
fucking weeks. I was waiting for that
shit. Right? But he doesn't, he goes,

32
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,740
see these still good enough to
take them off today. I was like,

33
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:58,700
you've gotta be kidding me.
I did it. Fucking did it.

34
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,400
This is like going into the fucking
Stanley Cup playoffs. All right.

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,440
And just sweeping everybody. See
you play like fucking, I dunno.

36
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,540
Let's see if you went
seven games times four,

37
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:13,541
that's 12 above about 28 fucking
games or you could just play 16.

38
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,290
I felt like I just played 16 games.
Fresh is a fucking daisy.

39
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm ready to go another round. You already
handed me the trophy, right? So I said,

40
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,920
all right. So he seats taking the
fucking clips off or whatever.

41
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:29,420
He's filing them down and shit.
And he's like, uh, I go, okay,

42
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:34,280
so an ally you have to do now is just
where this tray at night when I sleep for

43
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:37,400
the rest of my life so they don't go back,
which is not picked deal.

44
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm asleep at the fuck. Do
I care? All right. He goes,

45
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,510
no, no. Uh, this final tray.

46
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:47,240
You have to wear this for
the next three months.

47
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,670
And then we give to the overnight
tray and it's just like,

48
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,650
and your initial pitch,
I still would have fucking it,

49
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,980
but why are you full?
Just tear the bandaid off.

50
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,940
Okay.

51
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,390
I could've just mentally got myself like
go right the next six months of my life

52
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:09,224
is going to suck.

53
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,230
You got me all excited about 16 weeks
and then 13 and then it's going to happen

54
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:17,720
and then, oh by the way, by the way,

55
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:22,240
here's another three months onto
your sentence. She not out yet. Oh,

56
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,380
fucking bug me. You know,
cause you know what it was.

57
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,140
Cause when he went initially
went to sell it to me,

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,820
he was too afraid that if he told me I
was going to be six months that I wasn't

59
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:36,200
going to do it. That's basically what it
is that you know, I get it. Capitalism,

60
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:40,680
it's sales.
I really wanted to,

61
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,010
I didn't say anything. I, you know,
what are you going to eat in a day?

62
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,490
I got fucking straight teeth and made
it works. The shit definitely works.

63
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:51,330
I am thrilled. I am elated with
it. I just, you know what I mean?

64
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,880
That's like something your wife does.

65
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,660
Okay.

66
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,580
Built the team. Is there
anything in the world, Bill,

67
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,340
that you can't turn around and blame
women for? All right, you're right.

68
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,930
I'm being emotional.
Being a cunt.

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,870
Okay.

70
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,880
Fucking three more months. I
turned 53 months. You know,

71
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,270
you think I'm gonna have a fucking braces.
I don't know about you,

72
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,910
but that's not what I might,
that's not one of my life's goals.

73
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,363
MMM.

74
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,140
So anyways, so now what's going on is
he took the fucking hooks off my tab.

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,690
I'm just giving you guys the blow by
blow. This guy's a great dentist. Okay.

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,051
You know,

77
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,420
could have been a little
more straightforward about
how long this was going to

78
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:29,470
fucking take. You know,
just dump the ball over.

79
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:32,470
My head stopped like taking little
spoonfuls and putting him out of his head.

80
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,700
Okay.
Can you handle that?

81
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,973
Yeah.

82
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,640
Anyways.
Um,

83
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,840
okay.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,920
I ain't know what the fuck does he know?

85
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,950
Just so now the hooks are
off these fucking things

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,630
and uh, this is like getting out of jail
cause you just don't get out of jail.

87
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,200
They go from maximum to
like medium to minimum two.

88
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,970
You're living in some guy's fucking
house and you can go out and go get a

89
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,570
fucking Bagel and you've got to come
back and report to somebody. This is,

90
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,290
this is how the Invisalign's going down.
Um,

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,810
I am in the,
uh,

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,840
the halfway house or the fucking minimum
security building up this shit now,

93
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:18,550
the three months, whatever.
I don't even fucking notice
him. I'm, I'm Kinda over it.

94
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,690
I did have two event I did at the vent
on it, on the podcast about it, but it's,

95
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,880
it's just the fucking yellow.
Just,

96
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,750
just tell me what I'm in
for so I can prepare for it.

97
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,560
It's like one of those fucking movies
where you sit in your God Damn cubicle at

98
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:37,040
your desk and you finish your
stack of papers. You're like, ah,

99
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,520
and you fucking put
your foot up on a desk.

100
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,110
Guy Comes back with
another stack of papers,

101
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,400
you know.

102
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:49,160
Anyways, anyways, um, oh, fucking,

103
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,610
uh,

104
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,320
Billy Boston Bruin
bandwagon is jumping on.

105
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,340
I've watched the last three games,
to be honest. You, I, I missed,

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,610
I turned on the last Bruins game or you
know, I got a kid now, so I do what I can.

107
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,660
All right. I put the game on when
it was four to one. All right.

108
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,670
I watched a beat the
Black Hawks on Saturday.

109
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:11,870
I watched them lose on Sunday and
on, I put the game on, it was,

110
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,330
they were down four to one. I was like,
Jesus Christ, every time I fuck a week,

111
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,010
they do nothing. But when,
whenever I turned them on,
they fucking loose. And um,

112
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,270
so I got the game on.
You don't medium volume.

113
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,870
I'm in the kitchen with my beautiful
daughter and I'm making her some dinner.

114
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,080
I came in, what the hell? I made her.
She likes these meatballs, right?

115
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,910
With the vegetables
and that type of stuff.

116
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,360
And now what are we trying to
keep her away from? Uh, you know,

117
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,810
all the sugar in that type of shit.
However, you know, occasionally, you know,

118
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,650
my kid's not going to not have McDonald's.
You know what I mean?

119
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,980
I'm not going to take it to that
level where the kid is like, oh,

120
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,850
can I have some dessert and be like, yeah,
here's a Kiwi or some shit like that.

121
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,310
Even though you probably should do that.
I don't know.

122
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,513
MMM.

123
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,930
So anyways, I, I have the game I'm in,

124
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:01,590
I'm out in the kitchen and then I
just hear Jack Edwards going crazy.

125
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,520
Three goals.
It's 77 seconds.

126
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,340
It's like come running in. Like what
the, what the fuck just happened?

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,190
Long Story Short,
the Bruins scored,

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,170
they scored five goals in the
third period to win six to five.

129
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,500
The last one was an empty net.

130
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,973
MMM.

131
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,550
They scored him so fast.
I don't even know who fucking scored him.

132
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,470
I can't even remember who the hell
scored them pasta knock out one of them.

133
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,040
Uh, but I do know that we also, uh,

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,790
lost like three guys got
hurt during the game.

135
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,460
Tory crew Debraski in fucking
Zidane Know Ciara. But I,

136
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,700
I looked at the replay
because I missed those place.

137
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,930
They didn't look a sitting on my couch
and not having to do a Dur. The paint,

138
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,570
they didn't look too bad.
Um,

139
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,610
charter went down like someone at a public
skating rink is what that looked like.

140
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:55,980
And then he just slid into the board.
Looks like he hit his shoulder.

141
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:57,960
He was walking off fine.
You don't,

142
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,570
when he was off the ice and he was going
through the tunnel, he seemed all right.

143
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,430
Granted he's also like nine feet tall
and can do like over 40 pull ups,

144
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:08,790
which makes no fucking
sense at 40 41 years of age.

145
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,150
It's easy for the little guys because
they don't have to travel as far.

146
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,870
But to bring that giant body and all
the way the fuck down, it's like,

147
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,440
it's like the little guys going
up like two, two steps and he's,

148
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:22,410
he's got to run up like nine flights
of stairs every time he does. It's,

149
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:25,290
it's unreal. So he's tough as
nails. I think we'll be back.

150
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,060
I don't know what happened to Tory Craig
and uh, the Brusk hopefully if I just,

151
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,403
I dunno,

152
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,990
got a mild sort of a bounce his brain
around a little bit, but uh, anyways,

153
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:40,950
what playing the Florida panthers tonight?
Seven 30 my four 30 my time,

154
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,850
seven 30 east coast time and
the panthers fight the most,

155
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,190
have the most fighting
majors in the NHL this year.

156
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:52,860
And it's like some pathetically low
number. I think they were in the,

157
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,690
they've had like 20 fighting majors.
They average of fight, like basically,

158
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:02,400
you know, every three
games. Um, it's just,

159
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,640
it's just completely out of the fucking
league and it sucks. But granted,

160
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm not the guy who I don't have to fight,
right.

161
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,840
I don't have to walk around dealing with
the concussions and all of that shit.

162
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,640
But, you know, just as a fan, I
miss it. So they got them on, uh,

163
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,820
they got them today, Thursday, and
then Saturday when I'm up in, uh,

164
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,220
Ontario, they got the lightening, so
they got some big games coming up Monday.

165
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:23,821
The blue jackets,

166
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:25,590
I don't even know how they're do because
I haven't been watching anything,

167
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:29,460
but I'm back.
I'm back on fucking bored here.

168
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,080
A lot of new faces and shit. But, um,

169
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,330
you know, like I said, I've watched
so many games in the last 10 years,

170
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:44,190
the 820 regular season games,
I bet I saw at least, you know,

171
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,180
500 of them.

172
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,290
So I missed like the last fucking
60 that they had this year.

173
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,270
Essentially. I only saw maybe five
games this year. Uh, it's embarrassing,

174
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,920
but, uh, which sucks because I watched
them totally dismantled a team,

175
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,420
you know, four years ago or something and
go all the way back down to rebuilding.

176
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,940
And I was like,
I'm going to watch this whole rebuild.

177
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:10,110
And this year when it all fucking
came together, um, I mean,

178
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,360
what am I complaining about? Oh,
I had to go and become a dad,

179
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,480
which is the most amazing
fucking thing ever. Um,

180
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,240
my little one's starting to try to
run now, which is hilarious. Um,

181
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,490
and also we've been doing
this thing where, uh,

182
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,490
when she's done with the toy and then
she wants to play with something else,

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,880
she has to put away the other
toy and she just has it down.

184
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,630
She likes it cause we applaud
every time she puts some way.

185
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,380
She's playing with these giant Lego's
today and we, and she wanted that.

186
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:39,840
She wanted to have this
bag of like, uh, you know,

187
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,010
multicolored fucking little like a, they
almost look like ping pong balls, right?

188
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,060
She wants to go play with those fucking
things. So it's just like, all right,

189
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,790
well you got to put away
the Lego blocks first.

190
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,540
So she starts putting away
and I'm applauding on everyone
that she does and then

191
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,180
there's two stuck
together and she fucking,

192
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,710
she pulled them apart before she put
him away. And as a parent right there,

193
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:02,700
you're like, oh my God, my kid
is a genius. You know, like,

194
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,520
like you have Einstein as a
kid rather than, it was a, uh,

195
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,850
a pretty logical step that
they would just able to make,

196
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:13,410
but it's still thrilling. Everything
is fucking thrilling. So anyways,

197
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,390
um, this morning I go outside, right?

198
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,220
I play a little game on Thursday
when the trash comes out. Um, is,

199
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,760
I'm always listening for the garbage
truck. All right. Because, um,

200
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,060
now that I don't have a
dog, I mean, I still do.

201
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,990
It's still technically my dog and she's
in town this week and I've been taking

202
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:38,310
her on these long hikes every day.
It's been awesome. She looks great,

203
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,940
she just looks great and
she's so freaking happy.

204
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,670
And I told you for the
first time in her life,

205
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,950
she has another dog that she's friends
with, which she never did. You know,

206
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,350
she was never in that mindset when
someone with my limited skill set had her,

207
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:57,330
she tried to do you do, she usually
ignored bigger dogs and then little dogs.

208
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,740
Okay.

209
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,010
No little dogs would bark at her and she
would ignore them. And then bigger dogs,

210
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,040
she would also ignore them until
they started some shit, you know?

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,680
Okay.

212
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,630
I believe in the hip hop community that's
known as, uh, don't start. Nothing,

213
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,470
won't be nothing.
I believe that that's where my dog,

214
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,930
her mindset was from.
So anyways,

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,150
but I always fucking hated is
when the trash is out the barrels,

216
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,780
once they empty the fucking shit that the
trash truck comes by the garbage truck,

217
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,030
if you will empties the fucking thing out.

218
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,060
You have basically about a minute when
you live in loss of Congolese before some

219
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:41,260
fucking dog on and can't comes by and
takes a shit bag and throws in deer,

220
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,550
you're, uh, you're trashed route,

221
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:47,060
which I don't necessarily give a shit
this time of year because it's cold out.

222
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,280
But during the hot months,
you know,

223
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,940
to have some stamen bag of fucking Shit
marinating and your thing that's not

224
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:57,100
even from your own dog, it's so, it's
a little annoying. I appreciate it.

225
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,760
You keeping the city fucking clean.

226
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,930
But there is something about
that that it's just the,

227
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,510
it's a little fucking annoying.
So this morning I,

228
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,840
I've been hearing phantom garbage trucks
had been out there like nine times.

229
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:11,450
I only put away the recycling and,
uh,

230
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,250
I got a feeling while
I'm doing the podcast,

231
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm going to hear this
fucking thing coming up the
street and I'm gonna tell you

232
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,960
right now, if I do, I'm,
I'm throwing down the mic.

233
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,590
I'm going to go out there and get in
and put that thing back inside. But, um,

234
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,470
I got a bunch of shit that I got handled.
I am back on Instagram.

235
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,941
Everybody.

236
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:33,290
I got to get the check next to my fucking
name so it's verified cause I guess

237
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,880
there's some people impersonating
me, which is really flattering. Um,

238
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,540
uh,
have not been on there since 2012.

239
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,140
Instagram was not something
that I gravitated towards,

240
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,930
but everybody keeps telling me, you
gotta get on it. You got to get on it.

241
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,240
And I was sick of fighting the youth there
and a, so I'm going to get back on it,

242
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:57,860
I guess. Um, it's been six
years since I'd done away. Okay.

243
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,280
It feels like I've had Invisalign on
for fucking 12 years at this point now.

244
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,890
It hasn't been that bad.
He says he had been that bad.

245
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:06,200
It's just that I got fucking
excited that it was over.

246
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,803
Okay,

247
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,300
honey, we done, I'm gonna blame
women again and we'd done this is it,

248
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:13,660
this is the last store and then it,
oh,

249
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,600
one claim to want to
look at some cosmetics.

250
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,980
Asshole.
Here's a question.

251
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:25,960
Why don't they have bars at malls?
You know,

252
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,030
I guess I do the kind of
like sports bars and shit.

253
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,460
Yeah.

254
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,770
I'm going to go into, hey,
what are you going to?

255
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,460
How do you take all the time you need?

256
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,450
I'm going to go in here and get
fucking loaded. Okay. I will.

257
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,020
I will do my best to help you with
the bags of shit that you don't need,

258
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,870
that you get. You're going to be carrying
out and then you're driving home.

259
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,760
How does that sound?
Okay.

260
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,910
Well,
I wanted to this ticket.

261
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,990
That's the thing. This is so good.
What's the exact thing that makes them a

262
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,440
great mother?
Makes them an annoying partner.

263
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,410
It's just like, just go do something
by yourself. Stop dragging me.

264
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,170
Why am I being such a jerk?
Because of my fucking Invisalign.

265
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,920
I like hanging out with my wife and I
had mentioned before when I didn't have

266
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,930
the hope that my Invisalign
was being taken off,

267
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:12,720
that I actually enjoy going to the mall
with my wife and kid there. I said it.

268
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,460
Uh,
all right.

269
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,210
Anyways,
I'm starting to understand tea by the way.

270
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,970
Yeah,

271
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,240
okay. I never understood it. It's like
it's hot as fuck. It Burns your tongue.

272
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,990
This isn't relaxing. It's like,
no stupid. It's hot as fuck.

273
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,040
So it activates what's ever in the
tea bag. And then once that's done,

274
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,970
you then take the fucking teabag out
and you throw it out like an Englishman.

275
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,340
All right? You don't keep it.
If you don't leave it in there,

276
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,380
like from sloppy American like me,

277
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:44,140
you take that out and you
let it fucking cooled down.

278
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,050
Now that everything's been accurate,
activate and then you drink it.

279
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,800
But the problem is is you've
just ordered a tea. That's fine.

280
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,480
But if he got something else coming,
by the time the fucking thing cools down,

281
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,080
you're, you're, you're,

282
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,680
you're a little Danish or whatever
the hell you ordered is already there.

283
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,090
Your crumpet, what the fuck is a
crumpet? Is that a biscuit and biscuits?

284
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:05,350
A cookie over there,
right?

285
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,043
Crump.

286
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,490
Oh,
it's what the C strumpet crop it.

287
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,300
Oh, it's an English muffin. Uh,

288
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:24,450
fuck out of you. That's all it is.
Teen crop it. I never, you know,

289
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,710
it's funny cause you know what I mean.
I,

290
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,250
I've been saying that I had no idea it
was always picked a little fucking round,

291
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,870
like Pale looking rich crack.

292
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,670
How to make crumpets BBC good food.

293
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,660
[inaudible] it would have been like a good
crop, but with their fucking, you know,

294
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,600
nobody a fucking crumpet with this
shit. Right. That's just something,

295
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,701
by the way,

296
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:52,140
has there ever not been an upbeat
chef and they always play like that?

297
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:55,050
Everything's going to be
okay. Music, you know,

298
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,510
flour, salt and sugar. Some Oregano,

299
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,010
some tomatoes.

300
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,340
Okay. Stirring it all the time.
He put it, I could do this shit.

301
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,730
I didn't know I could make
my own English muffins. Okay.

302
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,290
Is this like Philly cheese steak where
you don't say Philly cheese steak?

303
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,980
When you just say cheese steak,
when you're in England,

304
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:25,820
you don't say English muffin. You
don't even say muffin. You say crumpet

305
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,780
Oh God, this woman is either terrible or
unbelievable in bed. I don't know why.

306
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:37,730
I just thought that, oh, she's, she's
into the culinary arts. You know,

307
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:41,120
she figured, you know, she's in touch
with something. Who knows? You know,

308
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:43,970
sometimes people, they exact given one
talent. Sometimes it just, it's an,

309
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,890
it's an overall philosophy
that goes through. Um,

310
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,980
all right.
Let me read

311
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,060
a little bit of advertising here.
Uh,

312
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,020
then I'll talk about my pathetic attempts
to try to fucking learn this song for

313
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,260
the Goddamn comedy jam.
It has double bass in it and uh,

314
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,660
I haven't even really been
noticing, but like, um,

315
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,490
I'm left handed and I'm right handed at
the same time and that's fucking with my

316
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:15,270
double bass playing because sometimes
they have a tendency to lead with my left

317
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:19,110
foot. Other Times I have a tendency
to lead with my right foot.

318
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,370
You know, like if you're
going to do like a, uh,

319
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,400
like those separate the bat,
right,

320
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,540
whatever that is a fucking triplet right
before the snare hit where it's going

321
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:35,310
to be like right left, right or left,
right, left. I always go left right,

322
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,710
left.
I kind of feel like it's,

323
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:41,520
it's like if it's on the offbeat or
something like that, if it's on, you know,

324
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,050
if it's on one and two and three and
four and that should be right foot.

325
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,470
And if it's on the other ones,
I'm going left foot.

326
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,480
Right. I don't know. I have no idea.

327
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:59,481
But all I know was I'm trying to learn
this fucking song and the crashes on the

328
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,530
offbeat. And I do that with my right
foot. And then I think what I was doing,

329
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:07,711
I was,

330
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,500
when I was playing it up to speed and I
was just having fun and I didn't think

331
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,010
anybody was,

332
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,320
I was actually going to play it in front
of people and they were going to watch

333
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:13,860
me.

334
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,600
I think I was actually
playing left foot lead.

335
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,150
But then when I sat
down and broke it down,

336
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,700
I flipped it and I went from being able
to play it to up to tempo to drop in

337
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:29,730
like 30 bpm. And I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

338
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,840
And I have to have this song down
in like a week or so. So, um,

339
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,480
but I got the drum room now, so
I've just been, uh, you know,

340
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:43,500
something I learned from,
uh, Mike Johnston lessons,

341
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,230
which was a rather than practicing
at your limit to go down 10,

342
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:49,891
15,

343
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:54,891
even 20 bpms and just stay there for
like 10 minutes of really focused fucking

344
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,670
practice. Now I'm combining everything
shifted. Davey Lynch taught me.

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,870
I just kind of combined everything that
makes sense. And I've been able to start,

346
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,150
you know, going back up again
and uh, I get to tell you,

347
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,510
I don't know why the fuck I avoided
double bass drum and for so fucking long

348
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,260
it's, it's awesome. It's incredible.

349
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:21,030
And then all of this shit that I always
loved but wouldn't even attempt to play

350
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:24,570
along to prime is, uh, Pantera.

351
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,210
All those p bands that I love.
Um,

352
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,780
all of a sudden it's just like,
oh,

353
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,470
I kind of understand what's
happening right here. I mean,

354
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:37,110
I can't play it up to speed,
but it gives me somewhere to go.

355
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,970
And I remember I listened to a,

356
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,840
one of those lamb of God alums back in
the day and I was really fascinated with

357
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,900
a lot of the, the, the
drum beats that I was at,

358
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:50,060
Chris Adler came up and um,
I dunno,

359
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,350
it's like a, it's like anything, it's,

360
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,620
it's all of a sudden there's all this
new shit that you don't know you're

361
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,190
excited to sit down and
eat if it's like he kind of

362
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,440
okay,

363
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,410
learned what you know. And then you just
sort of sitting there, you actually get,

364
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:05,690
it's fucking weird.
You get like board, um,

365
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,880
and then you don't have any passion
and then you are already playing.

366
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:13,220
It's Shitty. And then you're going to
play it even fucking worse. So, uh,

367
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,600
very excited about that. Um, and to
finally have a fucking drum room,

368
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:19,111
I got to tell you,

369
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,730
I was up there fucking Waylon yesterday.

370
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,880
Not Saying I was playing well I was,
but I was hitting them is fucking hard.

371
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:29,490
Is that going to have us having a
great pouring sweat? Just, it's like,

372
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:32,280
it's fucking amazing. Can you played
double bass? All of a sudden it's like,

373
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,190
I don't think I need to do
the elliptical today. Uh,

374
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,640
that probably means my techniques sucks.

375
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,890
But that's the level of effort
that I was exerting. Yeah. So, um,

376
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,550
what's great though is darn if I
play during the day, my name was

377
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,130
okay

378
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,580
are at work and there's always somebody
with the leaf blower or a fucking

379
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:56,280
lawnmower playing. So I don't think
anybody's really going to hear me.

380
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,280
And I think it just, every day,
it's just middle of the day.

381
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,650
I play for like 90 fucking minutes. I can
have a great time, not piss anybody off.

382
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,870
And um, I don't know. And I, I think,

383
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,530
I think the dream has come true.
I'll tell you another fucking dream.

384
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:18,260
It would be if my Goddamn
fucking computer. Come on man.

385
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,230
Come back. Come back. What is the
problem? Where did you go? What happened?

386
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,410
I need to read advertising.
All right.

387
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,230
All you computer nerds
out there for some reason.

388
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,080
Hey there.
Oh,

389
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:37,040
now it came back when to like screensaver
mode and we wouldn't come back.

390
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,171
I don't know why it just,

391
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:41,320
it cause I just wrapped it
on the head like when fucking

392
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,300
Mel Howard would try to get fucking
Larry's attention here. Look,

393
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:48,640
can I get you can't just read
the, the uh, the advertising here.

394
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:51,480
I'm all over the place.
What did I do with it?

395
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,910
Yeah.
Jesus Christ belt.

396
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,550
Okay.

397
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,580
Do you see Trump just admitted that
he just completely made something up?

398
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,540
This guy like, sounds like me. You're
talking about how he said that, you know,

399
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:08,740
basically we had a trade deficit with
Canada, which I guess was not true.

400
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,260
This is when he was trying
to attack Nafta, saying,

401
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:16,150
this is the worst deal we ever signed.
And evidently, according to this site,

402
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,990
the Washington Post, I don't know
if this psychotically liberals,

403
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:21,780
so they're just snipping this,
I'm sure all you people on the right one,

404
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,640
it was the complete opposite.
It was Obama's fault. Um,

405
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,460
he said, despite having no idea
whether that was the case, he said,

406
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,090
the man who racked up more than
2000 false and misleading claims,

407
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,110
as president said, he insisted in
to Canadian prime as well. I mean,

408
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,190
I'm sure both sides would
debate that number. You know,

409
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:49,690
one side says 2000. The other
says three, uh, as president,

410
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:53,770
he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau that the United States

411
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:58,771
runs a trade deficit with Canada's despite
quote having no idea whether that was

412
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:03,400
the case. Um, he said,

413
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:07,840
I said wrong, Justin, you do.
I didn't even know Trump said,

414
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:11,440
I had no idea. I just said,
you're wrong. You know why?

415
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,540
Because we're so stupid. That's where
that guy is out of his fucking mind.

416
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,510
And I know people like this.
They're just not present in United States.

417
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,220
He's admitting that he did something
wrong and then when he says why he did it,

418
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,400
he then includes how dumb
I am. It's just like, dude,

419
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,270
I didn't say this shit you did.
I'm not saying I'm not dumb.

420
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,590
That's like, you know, I've seen some,

421
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,190
I saw this guy get in trouble one
time and he was just going like, yeah,

422
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:41,320
you know when you fuck up,
you know,

423
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,670
okay,

424
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,900
you have to uh,
you have to come clean and own up to it.

425
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,610
It's like, it also, why are you talking to
me about it? I didn't do it. You did it.

426
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,430
I fucked up.
I need to come clean.

427
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,320
And he was speaking almost in like
a third person type of fuck it.

428
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:00,310
That's hilarious.

429
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:01,910
Okay.

430
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,770
That takes me back to
that fucking tee shirt.

431
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,300
Enough was enough talking about enough
already talking about paid women less

432
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,470
than guys. It's like fuck head. You're
a corporation. You are the one doing it,

433
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:16,880
not me. Now you going to act like
he never did it and profit off.

434
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,890
What the fuck he did wrong.

435
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,050
It's John Wayne Gacy having a
fucking shirt, uh, you know,

436
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:30,460
leave the kids alone
enough already. Right. Um,

437
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:31,540
and then he makes money off of it,

438
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,540
which she then uses to pay a lawyer and
he gets out of jail before they kill him.

439
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,080
Okay.

440
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,580
So anyways, uh, you know
why? Because we're so stupid.

441
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,150
Okay.

442
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,370
I would have respected him more
if he just said, you know why?

443
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,600
Because the American average
American is so fucking stupid date.

444
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,160
All you have to do is to say some shit.

445
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,350
And if you're wearing the right colored
tie, they're going to believe it.

446
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:56,100
They're not going to research. He
said that. Then I'd be like, yeah,

447
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,200
I totally agree with that.

448
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:02,760
And that also includes people
that are root for blue ties. Okay.

449
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,190
And that also includes
people in England and Canada.

450
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:06,870
Everybody know nobody's
fucking paying attention.

451
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,030
There's very few people that
pay attention to the level dead.

452
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,630
Like these talking heads on
TV who only argue one side.

453
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,390
And the fact that you're only arguing
one side, then at that point, I dunno.

454
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,450
How do you listen to them?
That's why I like Jimmy Dore.

455
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,930
Okay.

456
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,810
I like Jimmy Dore because
Jimmy Dore also leans left,

457
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:32,250
but he also trashes the shit out of
fucking Obama and calls him out on what a

458
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:34,650
fucking company, man he was.
That guy left the office,

459
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:38,250
he was worth over 80 million
bucks making 500 grand a year.

460
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:41,130
And everybody's looking at him like
he's fucking Gandhi. It's just like,

461
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:45,450
don't he see exact same
fucking not the exact same,

462
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:46,920
but essentially it's the same thing.

463
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,030
He's doing the same thing that the
guy before that had the red tie.

464
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,760
The guy before they had the blue
tie and every eight years were like,

465
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:58,050
it's the fucking blue ties.
We need a Red Dye. Um,

466
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,830
what you really need is you need
a revolution is what you need.

467
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,730
You need a revolution,

468
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:06,000
and you would have to literally kill
the super rich if you're ever going to

469
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:10,230
change. And who's Kidding Hill? You know
that. That's not gonna happen anymore.

470
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,230
I spend, that's why they're building
these robots. Everybody know these,

471
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,950
these robot. Oh God. Bill, you're
going off the deep end. Yes, I, yeah,

472
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,350
they're building these fucking robots.
That's what the fuck. It's four.

473
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:23,190
It's going to eliminate the
ability to ever a revolt.

474
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,310
Because here's the thing,
let's just say they turn this,

475
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,230
this country ever into a police state.

476
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,680
The people that make up our
armed services services,

477
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,450
the Bray a Webinar Omega by rob services,
they are all Americans.

478
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,250
And to have them turn their guns on their
own countrymen will be very difficult.

479
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:45,660
They would almost have to go
into a robot like mind state. Um,

480
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,250
let me see what I did there.
See what I did.

481
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,280
She had it all fucking hands high right
now when you talk to yourself into a

482
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:53,640
microphone and there's nobody to debate
or check fact check anything you're

483
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:56,780
saying,
you always stick the landing.

484
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,610
You always get always standing there,
you know,

485
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,870
fucking with the gold medal around your
neck as they play the national anthem.

486
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:05,910
Uh,
you all right?

487
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,350
I fucking a Gri were barely bar.

488
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,930
He made some great points.

489
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,890
That's because no one was
able to interrupt, hoard,

490
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,670
tell him he doesn't know what
he's talking about. Um, all right,

491
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,720
well the fuck is my, uh, I'm
figuring out all my passwords.

492
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,690
I'm really turning a new corner here.
I figured out,

493
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:32,691
finally figured out how to upload
something properly on a Dropbox without

494
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,820
yelling at it. I actually just sat
down and figured it out yesterday.

495
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:40,821
I flipped out and I fucking slammed my
computer down that because both my wife

496
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:43,830
and my daughter to jump. And I was just
like, what am I doing? What am I doing?

497
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,860
I walked downstairs and came back
up, you know, cooled off, came up.

498
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,650
I apologize to him
both. You know, this is,

499
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,430
this is what I'm doing right now where
I'm like the passing the baton of anger

500
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:58,170
in my family tree. Okay.
If I continue to tradition,

501
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,220
I just would have done that.

502
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,770
I would've blamed everybody in
the room and never apologize.

503
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:05,070
But now I walk away and um,

504
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,980
and I come back a few minutes later,
I apologize and I give her a hug,

505
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:14,250
a kiss in the room. That's
what I do. Okay. So, you know,

506
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,770
I'm not saying I'm not still fucked up.

507
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,560
I'm not saying people aren't
suffering being around me. I'm just,

508
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,540
I'm just saying that I

566
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,600
that was a horrific helicopter crash in,
uh,

567
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,300
in New York City. Of course, I've
been paying attention to that. And uh,

568
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,080
this quick footage of the guy landing
the helicopter and he looks like he

569
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:42,680
totally, he totally fucking nailed it. Um,

570
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,400
the landing wasn't hard at all and
he got out and nobody else did.

571
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:51,410
And I think from what I'm
hearing in her circles is a,

572
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,890
they were flying with doors off. So,
not only did they have the seat belts,

573
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,340
which are,
I think they're the,

574
00:33:56,341 --> 00:34:01,330
the the four ones that connect with the
circle in the middle, which you also,

575
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,100
you had to turn it like clockwise or
counterclockwise cause I was thinking that

576
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:07,910
they panicked and didn't know how to,
you know, the once they land like, fuck,

577
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:10,790
I'm in a helicopter crash and then
all fuck, I don't want to drown in.

578
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:14,630
Like I remember I went skydiving and um,
I did a static line jumps.

579
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:17,870
So there was nobody attached to me.
And um,

580
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,190
I remember it was awkward towels and
thousand two, 1003 1000, 4,000 look,

581
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:24,020
if nothing,
look reached pulse.

582
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:28,220
So when you pulled your emergency ripcord
you had to talk your way through it,

583
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,480
look to see it reached, to grab
it, pull to pull the thing.

584
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,260
Cause other than you'd be panicking and
flailing starting to do somersaults and

585
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:38,910
shit. So I thought maybe
that was it. But, um,

586
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:45,010
someone was saying to me that they were
possibly flying doors off and as an

587
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,300
extra safety precaution,

588
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,160
they had them hooked to the helicopter
with one of those c clamp type of job.

589
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:53,240
He's there and there's
two different kinds.

590
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:57,330
There's the one that's the quick release,
um,

591
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,950
and then as the extra extra one that you,
you screw on.

592
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,400
Um,
and uh,

593
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,670
they were suggesting that it was probably
that one and that even if they got

594
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:11,570
this seat belts on that
they were, uh, I dunno,

595
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,430
basically strapped to the helicopter
and went down and drowned.

596
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,320
I have no idea of how
fucking horrific is that.

597
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,400
Why would I end the podcast on that? I
have no idea. I have no fucking evidence.

598
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:27,260
That's just what's been suggested to
me. So anyways, on that upbeat note,

599
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,840
Ah, listen to, uh,

600
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:34,870
some happy music now and then
we'll go into some greatest hits.

601
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:38,190
I don't know why I talked to, you
know, why cause I in that made me

602
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,870
scared.
Yeah,

603
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,180
maybe happy to see that the guy
fucking totally landed at like a stud.

604
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,920
And then if what is being suggested
happened actually happened,

605
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:54,210
I would can't imagine the pilot,
you know,

606
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,970
having to deal with those
five fucking people. You know,

607
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:01,460
they're going to try to fucking blame him.
It,

608
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,410
cause it seems like that's one of those
things where they made it so safe that

609
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:07,770
they didn't,
they created another fucking problem,

610
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,390
which means they'll probably then have
some sort of new clamp that they design.

611
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,320
I don't fucking know. Anyways. Uh,
how do I talk my way out of this?

612
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,000
I have no idea. I'm sitting here,
uh, just flailing. All right.

613
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:23,400
Listen to the fucking music
and have a great weekend.

614
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:26,490
You conch and there'll be another half
hour greatest hits where hopefully I don't

615
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,760
and that's such a gloomy.
Nope.

616
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,593
Wow.

617
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,631
Hey,
what's going on?

618
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:54,080
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

619
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:57,890
March 16th, 2010. How the hell are you?

620
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,940
How's it going? It's a daylight savings
time if you haven't figured it out yet.

621
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,930
If you're wondering why you keep
being late for the last 24 hours.

622
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:09,830
It's actually Sunday when I'm doing
this thing because, uh, you know,

623
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:12,740
I get sick of people on the
east coast bitching dude,

624
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:17,060
you should call it [inaudible] to
move fucking Monday afternoon podcast.

625
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:21,280
Should I um,
I respect that you want to get to work?

626
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:24,740
Do you want to begin fucking off
immediately start your week off, right.

627
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:28,850
I understand. So I tape them on
Sundays now when I can and uh,

628
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,730
hope you guys all had a good weekend.
My Sunday started great.

629
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:35,620
My dog puked on the floor after,
you know,

630
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:40,120
three days of threatening dry
heaves and every time we go out,

631
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:45,730
walk up the street, the things
eating grass like it's a goddamn cow.

632
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,710
And my girls always going, stop
it. Stop it. Stop eating the grass,

633
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,920
stamp it.
And uh,

634
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,250
I vaguely remember overhearing
someone who I hope new,

635
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:02,251
a veterinarian who said something to
the effect that a animals eat grass when

636
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:07,480
they're not feeling well. So last night
I was taking her out late at night,

637
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:11,350
right at that, that critical fucking
moment to scary moment. My neighborhood.

638
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,340
All right. There's a
moment where, uh, you know,

639
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:18,070
when you're in a bad
part of the city and uh,

640
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:21,820
there's that moment around dusk
where all the decent, hardworking,

641
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,170
honest people are coming in
after a nice decent, honest,

642
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,630
hardworking days pay,
you know,

643
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,800
is they try to get out kind of like
a good times episode, you know,

644
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,780
and then there's, there's that point where
then the scumbags come out, you know,

645
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,540
who are doing all kinds of illegal shit,

646
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,140
which I don't even know what the fuck
to even think about that anymore.

647
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,630
Now it's just as fucked up.
I was going to say, you know,

648
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,930
it was fucking crooked is he's
God damn banks are, you know,

649
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:54,520
is selling drugs. Yes it is. It is
just as fucking bad. So anyways,

650
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,370
just stay on.
I'm already off fucking track.

651
00:39:57,371 --> 00:40:00,160
You know what my fucking bank did to me.
I walked in,

652
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,740
I had this account in New
York that I kind of a,

653
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:05,950
it was a little checking account that
had a little bit of money in and all of a

654
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:08,470
sudden I noticed they would taking
some fees out. I'm like, well,

655
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:11,380
that shouldn't be. So I
get to New York, I walk in,

656
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:13,900
I talked to the Douche bag who
works there and he goes, yeah,

657
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:18,070
they're taking $27 a month
out. I Dunno why that is. Here,

658
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,920
let me check to see what's up. Click
and collect. I'll check on his thing.

659
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,610
And he goes, yeah, we shouldn't have
been doing that. And I go, okay,

660
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:28,540
well can you refund the money? And
they go, absolutely. A, and I go, well,

661
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,570
well you know,
I've had the account for like six years.

662
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,870
Can we see how long you've been doing
this? And he's like, oh, I'm sorry.

663
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:38,740
Are Our records only go
back for four months? Um,

664
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,840
really it only goes back for four months.

665
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:44,980
It's amazing because my bank records at
home go back the entire time I've had

666
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:46,180
the account.
That's incredible.

667
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,890
And I just have some piddly summon
there while you deal with hundreds of

668
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,570
millions of dollars, if not
billions, if not trillions.

669
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,670
I don't know what the fuck you have.

670
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:58,300
I just know there's a fucking Bank
of yours in every God damn state now.

671
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,440
But of course it only goes back like
four months. So I go, all right,

672
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:04,000
well what if I bring my records in?

673
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,060
I look them over and I find out how long
you've been doing it. And they're like,

674
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:11,640
Nah, he can only refund it for
four months. I'm like, dude,

675
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:13,240
what are you talking
about? And he goes, well,

676
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:16,630
the bank kind of looks at it like that,
that that was on you.

677
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:18,941
And I was like,

678
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:23,941
it's on me to not to not be like paying
attention to make sure the people who

679
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:27,550
supposed to be keeping my money safe
aren't fucking stealing from me.

680
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,500
And he sort of like laughed.
I'm like, dude, this isn't
funny. This is ridiculous.

681
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:36,440
You guys just from me. And if you've
been doing it for six years, what's that?

682
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:38,960
270 bucks?
Add another fucking Nav.

683
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,720
50 like almost 300 bucks
a year for six years.

684
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:44,270
That's like 1500 to 1800
bucks somewhere in there.

685
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,730
And the guy's just sitting there
fucking laughing and uh, you know,

686
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:52,010
this is a usual shit guy. What
are you gonna Sue us? Go ahead.

687
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,990
We'll take some of that bailout money,

688
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:56,370
which is part of your tax
money and we'll fucking, uh,

689
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,680
so I don't know what I'm going to do.

690
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,350
I'm going to close out the account and uh,
and I don't know.

691
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:06,260
What do I do then I go across the street
to one of the bat for banks that are

692
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:08,180
left.
If anybody out there is in banking,

693
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,210
how do I get my money back
beyond the four months?

694
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:14,470
Cause I know that they've been
doing it longer than this. Um,

695
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,680
can anybody explain that?
You know, this is why people,

696
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:22,730
this is why you don't put 100% of
your paycheck into the fucking bag.

697
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:26,060
He got to look at it this way.
If somebody mugged you last week,

698
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,800
would you walk up to the same person
and take your paycheck and stick it in

699
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,810
their back pockets? You
wouldn't, would you?

700
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,570
But for some reason we have these
fucking bankers. Yeah. I don't know.

701
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,860
I think everybody should turn like,
I dunno,

702
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:46,680
everybody should have a fucking safe
that you have buried somewhere. Yeah,

703
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,450
everybody's got a gun in. Anybody
can blow anybody away. I know.

704
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,390
It's all fucked up.
Fucking assholes.

705
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,600
You guys sitting there fucking smiling.
Nobody sitting there doing,

706
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,250
he's doing that little twirly thing.

707
00:42:58,251 --> 00:43:02,390
You know that math people do with their
pens and people were into finances.

708
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,600
I think they do it to
hypnotize you and says,

709
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,000
the guy's fucking sitting there telling
me that they'd been stealing 30 bucks a

710
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:10,970
month from me and all I'm doing
is I'm trying to focus on him.

711
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:15,230
I keep looking down at his silver
shiny pen, some sort of mind trick.

712
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,370
Fortunately, I was aware
of it. How am I said,

713
00:43:18,371 --> 00:43:20,030
can you stop twirling your fucking pen?

714
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
But I didn't want to do that cause
I was trying to keep my cool,

715
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,660
which obviously is a difficult
thing for me to do. You know?

716
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,040
I don't know right now a pill.

717
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:32,340
It's just 27 bucks a month times how
many fucking people you remember superman

718
00:43:32,341 --> 00:43:35,500
three when Richard Pryor stole half a
cent from everybody and the next day he

719
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,100
had a fucking Ferrari.

720
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,140
He's Fox had taken 27 bucks a month
from everybody. I'm convinced of it.

721
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,860
That's the fucking mob.

722
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,460
I swear to God the mob went legit
or those there will be blood guys.

723
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,670
They're the fucking assholes
and run the Goddamn bags.

724
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,460
He's fucking constant just stealing
from me and there's nobody getting,

725
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,390
nobody's going to help me.
What am I going to go down there?

726
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,710
I'm going to get that guy used to be
on the fucking, uh, leave it to beaver.

727
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:05,150
What the fuck was the name of that show?
A Mayberry. I always hated that show,

728
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,660
that old content walking around with
their false set of voice earned.

729
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,930
You know, you know what that show
lacked somebody that I wanted to bang.

730
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,190
That's why I didn't watch it.
There was nobody fuckable on it.

731
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:25,820
That was the brilliance of the
monsters that they were like,

732
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:26,810
this is going to be hilarious.

733
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:30,380
We're gonna turn fucking Frankenstein
into DRAC and Dracula into these Kooky

734
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,910
characters and it's all going to be funny.

735
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:37,911
But they knew at the end of the day
they had to be somebody that the male

736
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,320
demographic would want to fuck.

737
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,350
So they came up with that
girl who was allegedly ugly.

738
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:45,120
Why am I explaining this classic show?

739
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:50,121
You know the deal and she looked like
Marilyn Monroe and that's what kept me in

740
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:53,940
there. I Dunno. All right.

741
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Batman after a while it's like to what
is going on with this 40 year old guy in

742
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:00,384
his ward?

743
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,720
Okay.

744
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,370
And then all of a sudden they had cat
woman walking around that fucking hoary

745
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,560
outfit.
Is she the one who started that shit?

746
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,010
Did women not dress like horrors on uh,

747
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,460
on Halloween before Batman
are a bad girl or cat woman?

748
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,790
Catwoman was a bad one,
right?

749
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:22,410
Okay.

750
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,870
This such pathetic cons,
you know what I mean? It's,

751
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:27,480
we take off that fucking
ridiculous outfit.

752
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:33,160
Go stand behind a wall and, and, and
start talking to people in the store.

753
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:35,050
How many people even fucking
pay attention to you?

754
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,000
They don't cause you got nothing to say.

755
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:42,001
All you can do is just dress up your God
damn Twat and starts strutting around

756
00:45:42,311 --> 00:45:46,340
the fucking place.
That had nothing to do with Catwoman.

757
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,591
Had nothing to do with her.

758
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:51,760
I had to do with me fucking getting fucked
over by that God damn bag, assholes,

759
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,150
fucking assholes.
And I go to down there,

760
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,500
I got to go down and I like to like some
fucking guy who's buttoned store just

761
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:03,440
failed after 75 years,
you know,

762
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:06,760
Frankie fish face and sons
remember those fucking um,

763
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,660
those businesses when you were a kid.

764
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:09,770
Okay.

765
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,930
It was always something
something and sons.

766
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:13,370
Yeah.

767
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,820
You know, and like a lot of the times
the kids were forced into the business.

768
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,860
Okay.

769
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,870
Yeah. I'm Italian guy. He opens a fucking
prosciutto shop and then that's it.

770
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:25,570
It's like an arranged marriage except
that your job and then you got to show up.

771
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,490
I have been working in the restaurants
and that was the day that, you know,

772
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:32,890
they don't know shit about anything else.
Does.

773
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:36,430
Everybody wanted to strike
out on their own and now look,

774
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,710
everybody ends up in a fucking cubicle
worker for these fucking cunts was

775
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,930
stealing my money. That's
uplifting isn't it? Um, anyways,

776
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,730
this is the Monday morning
podcast and it's on my website.

777
00:46:45,731 --> 00:46:48,940
I'm trying to get it onto iTunes.
I'm in between web guys right now.

778
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:53,860
Hopefully this is up on iTunes.
We worked on it yesterday. Um,

779
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,930
you know,
and it was weird.

780
00:46:55,931 --> 00:46:59,590
It was up on my web guys computer
but it wasn't up on my computer.

781
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:03,040
So if you're listening
to this on my website,

782
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,500
maybe you go to iTunes and you
just hold down the shift button.

783
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:09,450
I mean maybe iTunes just keeps
reloading a, you know how it,

784
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,830
it remembers a page that you've been to.

785
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,640
So when you go back to it a load quicker,
hold down the shift button.

786
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:19,870
When you're on that page, um, I believe
that then you can see the new one.

787
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,550
So now I have three podcasts.

788
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,540
Okay.

789
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,270
Fucking ridiculous. But eventually
we're going to get it all under one.

790
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,620
This is the first time I've ever had a
web guy who lives down the street from me.

791
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,550
Um,

792
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:35,110
I have new video up on my
website and buy new video.

793
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:39,040
I mean video that actually works.
And um,

794
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,120
this is part of a whole new revamping
that I've tried to do like 10 times.

795
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,860
I know I've always promised that, but, um,

796
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:50,440
I'm going to be uploading video to my
website and to start video my video taping

797
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:53,980
myself out on the road, putting up little
bullshit things up there. You know,

798
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,280
the usual bullshit. Give you guys
a couple of crumbs every week.

799
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:00,460
So you still give a fuck about me.
So when I come to your town,

800
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:04,960
maybe you'll buy a ticket for you
and your best little girl or fucking

801
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:08,830
boyfriend, whatever you got going on out
there, whatever it is that you do. Um,

802
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:12,170
there's also a fan page for the
Monday morning podcast. Now, uh,

803
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:17,000
www.themmpodcast.com.
Uh,

804
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,620
there's questions, there's pictures.
I make references to fucked up stuff.

805
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:22,060
Like say you haven't watched the Munsters,

806
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:26,050
maybe there'll be a picture of the
hottie on the monsters, you know,

807
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,640
so, uh, and that's it.

808
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,240
My girlfriend just walked in and then
tippy toed back out again and then

809
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:38,470
shrugged his shoulders like I wasn't
going to address it. You heard me,

810
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:40,120
I was in a lull.
So anyways,

811
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:45,121
I really apologize for the horror that
has been trying to find my podcast over

812
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:48,340
the last month or so.
Um,

813
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,290
I didn't think that it was going
to be such a big deal, you know.

814
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,300
Uh,
I,

815
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,770
I just thought I could just switch over
to a new server server and it wasn't

816
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:04,090
going to be a problem, but evidently
it's this major fucking deal.

817
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:06,970
And I've talked to other podcasters out
there and they were talking about what a

818
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:11,620
fucking pain in the ass it is to get it
up on iTunes because once you do get it

819
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:16,480
up on iTunes, then they have to
approve of it as if to say yes,

820
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,680
this is in fact a podcast and
beyond that we approve of it.

821
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,870
So anyways, Jesus Christ, it's
already one in the afternoon.

822
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,650
I just went out to brunch with my lovely
girlfriend and I heard some fucking,

823
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,590
oh my God, that goes back to my
joke. You really go to a branch to,

824
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:38,080
did somebody have pes? Um, yeah.

825
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,650
Went down to this fucking place and
we're hanging out down there and uh,

826
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,750
this fucking dude, um, I
don't know if he was gay,

827
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,900
but he had the gay accent,
which is always fun to me.

828
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:51,790
Like there's a part of the
country that they're from,

829
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,640
which is an old joke that I used to do.
Um,

830
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,450
he was talking about daylight savings
times. He was just like, oh my God.

831
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:00,790
Like this is how it should be all
the time. You know, it's like,

832
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,170
this is Los Angeles,

833
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,330
this whole getting out of work at five
and it's dark out. It's just like,

834
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:11,260
what is going on with that?
That's like one of those things ever.

835
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,340
Just hear somebody like that.

836
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:15,100
There's like such a fucking cliche
that whoever you're with, you just,

837
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:17,110
you're just sort of
staring down at your food.

838
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,800
And then when you look at the person that
you're with, you don't move your head.

839
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,090
You just slowly look up at each other
and then all of a sudden it's like you're

840
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:27,350
in grade school again.
And there was a teacher said,

841
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:29,810
the next person who fucking
laughs is getting detention.

842
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,370
It's one of those moments.

843
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:36,220
It was tight quarters so we couldn't like
really start laughing at them. But, um,

844
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,140
I really wanted to lean over and be like,
you know,

845
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:43,130
part of the reason why it's so fucking
dark out during the wintertime is the

846
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:47,960
whole planet, the northern hemisphere
tilts away from the sun there. Fuck face.

847
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,190
All right, so even in December, it
would probably.be dark around five.

848
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:56,840
Despite the time change. Actually maybe
it would maybe more like five 45 30,

849
00:50:56,841 --> 00:51:01,100
depending on where you're at.
Right. I mean, am I ignorant?

850
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,290
Of course I am, but as far as I know,
daylight savings is the bullshit time.

851
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:10,280
Like right now it's not
really one o'clock. We're
just saying it's one o'clock.

852
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,610
So the farm hands out in the Midwest can
have more fucking time to harvest the,

853
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:20,720
uh, the beans made out of corn
products according to Food Inc. Right.

854
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,870
I don't fucking know. I have no idea
what they do and I just fucking,

855
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,160
why do I have to,
I,

856
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,490
every week I talk about shit that
I don't know anything about it.

857
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,650
It's the funniest shit.
Like I, I go into it,

858
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:36,620
I start getting anxiety cause I know
I don't know what I'm talking about.

859
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:39,500
So why would I literally try to
do is I try to use like momentum.

860
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,330
Like maybe if I say something dumb
quickly, no one's gonna notice.

861
00:51:44,331 --> 00:51:48,050
I believe that that's exactly what
it is in my world. That made sense.

862
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,600
So on to today's topics,

863
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,720
I was all excited to wake up this
morning and watch the Chicago Blackhawks

864
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,270
against the Washington capitals.
Why may you ask? I'll tell you why.

865
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,970
Because I love the sport of hockey and a,

866
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:05,210
it's a good chance that those two teams
could possibly meet in the finals,

867
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,860
if not in the finals next year.
The two teams that are right there.

868
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:11,383
All right?

869
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:15,170
And everybody always bitches out of
hockey sticks and they always blame the

870
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:19,010
fighting. They got to get the fighting
out of the fucking game. All right?

871
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,630
That's why nobody watches it.
Well,

872
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:24,260
I'm going to give you an example of the
NHL here. This is what they do today.

873
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,910
Okay?
During the week,

874
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,560
my Bruins played the Pittsburgh
penguins and a overall,

875
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:34,070
Pittsburgh's a decent franchise
for respectable. I respect them,

876
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,160
but they always didn't seem to
have one douche bag on the team.

877
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:42,230
The off Samuelson, you know the guy
who just can't fucking play, you know,

878
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,630
he can't play,
he can't fucking fight.

879
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,590
He can't even just skate around and
annoy you like a Ken Lindeman back in the

880
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:52,040
day. So what he does is he goes out there
and he basically tries to end people's

881
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:55,520
careers or their seasons and
that's what he did to mark Savara.

882
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,460
I even know the fucking guys name and
I don't even want to know his name.

883
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,300
Kind of like somebody goes up and
shoots up a fucking mall so they can get

884
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:04,550
famous. I always make sure I
don't remember the fucking name,

885
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,040
even though the news can't
stop talking about him.

886
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:12,041
So this fucking cunt just basically
glides in after survivor took shot.

887
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,090
Granted if he hit his body, it was
a legal hit, but he didn't, he took,

888
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:21,110
he took his shoulder slash elbow and just
blasted him right in the fucking head.

889
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,880
And he's so only connected with his
head that Savara literally helicoptered

890
00:53:25,881 --> 00:53:28,130
around and landed down on the ice.

891
00:53:28,131 --> 00:53:32,780
And not only was he not suspended or fine,
there wasn't even a penalty.

892
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,020
I Dunno what it is about the penguins.
For some reason,

893
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:40,140
they always have that one goon who can
go in and just blow out Cam Neeley's

894
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,170
fucking knee.
And then his career,

895
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:47,290
that guy just ended Savardi fucking season
or one goal scorer and they then they

896
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:48,344
do nothing.

897
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,800
Told the whole hockey world is
flipping out like, dude, what the fuck?

898
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,880
So what do they do to make it up today?

899
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,360
Washington capitals versus
the Chicago Blackhawks there.

900
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:03,660
One nationally televised
game this week on NBC.

901
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:06,030
You can actually watch it in HD TV.

902
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,270
So while you fucking idiots out
there who can't see the Puck,

903
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,380
I can't fear where is it? I
can't see it. Fucking black.

904
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:16,050
Object against the white surface.
Can't fucking see it.

905
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,970
Why don't you start with looking at the
guy that everybody appears to be mad at

906
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,080
on the other team? You
know, start with that guy.

907
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,280
Maybe that's the guy who has the
object that they desire. So anyways,

908
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:32,040
you know what they do?
They ended up kicking fucking Ovechkin.

909
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:36,010
They gave him a game misconduct out of
the game because he did some halfway.

910
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,620
I mean, it was a check that deserved a
penalty possibly of fucking double minor,

911
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,830
and they kicked the best player in the
league out of the fucking game on their

912
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:45,510
national telecast.
And I'm a tell you right now.

913
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,950
Well that is why that is
why nobody watches hockey,

914
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,510
because they continually make
moves like that. I don't know why.

915
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,590
Every five years they get back on ESPN
and then they go, oh, wait a minute,

916
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:02,490
the USA network is offering us $5 more,
or let's go over there.

917
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:03,390
Let's go over to the versus

918
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,253
network.

919
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,850
How many people you think
would be watching the NFL if
throughout the years they,

920
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,430
you know,

921
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,650
they occasionally for three years would
disappear onto like the learning channel.

922
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,070
You know what I mean? It really has
nothing to do with the fighting.

923
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,600
It's such a stupid fucking comment
that people make and it's hypocritical.

924
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:25,770
If you truly feel that that fighting
should be out of that game as much as the

925
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:28,860
whole world enjoys violence.
We love violence.

926
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:32,040
Go on Youtube and look at the
fucking ones that get the most hits.

927
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,650
We like to laugh and we'd like
to watch somebody get fucked up.

928
00:55:35,651 --> 00:55:38,470
That's what I've learned
from going onto youtube. Oh.

929
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:41,810
And people or we'll find a way to uh,

930
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,240
talk politics or discuss race on
any video that you stick up there.

931
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,640
And speaking of that, um, dude,
I was so fucking bummed out.

932
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:54,240
I woke up an hour late so I missed the
first period and then I find out a vet

933
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:57,850
can isn't even fucking plague and it was
laying down. And next thing you know,

934
00:55:57,851 --> 00:56:01,290
they Chicago scores, it's three nothing.
And the game is basically over for the,

935
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,260
or for those of you who don't watch
hockey three, nothing is basically, uh,

936
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:10,190
I would, it's like being down
17 points and football. Yeah,

937
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:15,080
sometimes 21, depending on how
bad your fucking team is. So, um,

938
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,980
I was upset as a hockey fan.

939
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,520
I still love the Nhl and I still
think you guys should watch the game.

940
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,530
I was actually watching a little bit of
the Premier League because I'm going to

941
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:27,880
Europe this week and uh,
the excitement of that has finally hit me.

942
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,030
I'm not excited about the
17 hour or whatever it is,

943
00:56:31,031 --> 00:56:33,850
15 hour flight from Los Angeles.
But um,

944
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:39,040
I'm beyond excited to go over there and
have killer shows and to begin to build

945
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:43,150
a following over there
because a cause why not?

946
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,710
Because you only go around once.

947
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:48,730
I was going to get a tour of the
fucking Abbey road studios and that fell

948
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:53,020
through. So now I don't know what to
do. I don't know what to do over there.

949
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:56,740
And for those of you who
haven't been on my website

950
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,850
this week,
on Thursday,

951
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,320
I am playing at the Lester
theatre in London, England.

952
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:10,090
How fucking cool does that sound?
Then I'm playing the sugar club in uh,

953
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,660
in uh,
Dublin Ireland on Friday.

954
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:16,960
And then the next night I go to Glasgow,
Scotland.

955
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,990
A lot of you Americans like me,
you are going to want to say glass.

956
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:24,720
Gow cause it looks like it's
written like slow, you know, low.

957
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:27,460
But it's Gow glass cow, uh, Scotland.

958
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:30,040
And I actually don't even know the fucking
name of the theater I'm playing there,

959
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,960
but uh, it's gonna be awesome
and I am coming off the wagon.

960
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,890
My Good Buddy Joe to
Rosa went 70 days sober,

961
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:42,640
so I had to beat him because I'm a
competitive fuck and I was going to take

962
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:45,640
myself off last night.
It's 71 days, you know,

963
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:50,170
kind of like a nod to Roger
Maris 60 home runs 61 70 71.

964
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,610
But I decided fuck it. You know, if I'm
going to fall off the fucking wagon,

965
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:59,410
it's going to be in a pub in a London,
England. That's when I'm going to do it.

966
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:04,000
So I need you English people to tell me
where there's a good pup and by a good

967
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:04,660
pub.

968
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,090
I don't meet some loud fucking bar
with a bunch of douchebags in it,

969
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,100
trying to act like they're cooler than
they really are. I want some fucking,

970
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,850
I want some place I could walk in that's
a little bit quieter but I'm not going

971
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:18,580
to get the shit kicked out of me once
they realize I'm an American. Okay,

972
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:19,540
I need to know that.

973
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,400
I also need to know if I bring DVDs over
there to sell to you guys for pounds,

974
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:26,560
euros, whatever the fuck
you're on. I believe you guys,

975
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,730
you guys haven't accepted the
euro, but I think Ireland has, um,

976
00:58:30,731 --> 00:58:32,560
I need to know the DVDs,

977
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:36,130
play the American code version,

978
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:39,370
whatever the fucking technical term is.
Do those things play over there?

979
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,590
Are they formatted correctly?

980
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:44,590
Cause I don't want to go over there
and sell you guys a bunch of shit that

981
00:58:44,591 --> 00:58:47,500
doesn't work. And then
we got to, you know,

982
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:49,300
then I'm like a bank and
then I got to be like,

983
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:51,210
well you know that's
really on you get home.

984
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,680
She should have realized that
I was from America and uh,

985
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:58,420
I have a different fucking DVD system
than you do. So there you go. My, sorry,

986
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,520
my records only go back four minutes.

987
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,120
I really don't have any recollection
of going over there. So anyways,

988
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:07,630
I don't know what else to do over
there. John Bonham's grave, you know,

989
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,090
maybe I'll go see that.
Um,

990
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,330
what else could I do?
I don't want to go do that Douchey Shit.

991
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:18,310
Guy Glow Look Big Ben and parliament.

992
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:21,620
I don't wanna I don't wanna look
at that stuff. I want to, uh,

993
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,300
I don't want, I want to do, I want to walk
around and want to look at Sim. Who is,

994
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,170
I want to do what? People in
London, England. Dope that right.

995
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,020
That's what I want to do.
Which is what?

996
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:37,960
Eat Indian food right after a
plate full of fish and chips. Um,

997
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,350
I dunno what the fuck
you guys do over there,

998
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:42,040
but if you could tell me some stuff
to do. I know stone chat, Stonehenge,

999
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,850
I've talked to enough Americans
who've gone over there.

1000
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:47,000
It's basically sitting on the side
of the road like a fucking Starbucks.

1001
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,750
It's very underwhelming. Um,
whenever they film it there,

1002
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:52,260
they're real close and
they make sure that,

1003
00:59:52,261 --> 00:59:56,360
that they don't have the highway like 10
feet away from the fucking thing. I'm,

1004
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,630
I can't wait for somebody to fall asleep
at the wheel and just drive right into

1005
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:00,800
that thing.
That's going to be hilarious.

1006
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,980
So anyways,
this is the podcast this week.

1007
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:10,040
I had been kind of Cunty the last couple
of weeks I've been in a bad move, but,

1008
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:13,040
uh, I'm in a much better
mood this week, so, uh,

1009
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:17,150
I don't know if that'll make this less
funnier or more tolerable. It's up to you.

1010
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:21,140
So here's some youtube videos.
Speaking of England, uh,

1011
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:23,750
this is my nod to,
uh,

1012
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:28,190
just something I discovered
a few years ago, um,

1013
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,430
through this comedian Jordan Rubin.
I was the one on is my space page.

1014
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:35,630
Remember that? You remember my
space? I was the last one. Um,

1015
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,030
he had a clip of this on his page
and I actually checked it out.

1016
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:41,930
It's called the Prince of Wales. And, uh,

1017
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:45,860
it's actually spelled w,
h a l e s, like the, uh,

1018
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:50,560
the mammal and a, it's
called Derek and Clive, d.

1019
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,000
R e c o s r d e r e.

1020
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,630
K. And Clive Cli. V. E. Alright.

1021
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,480
And it's actually Dudley
Moore and this Guy Peter Cook,

1022
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:03,260
who most Americans have never heard of.
And um,

1023
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,760
it's basically just imagine if I was
doing a podcast with some other asshole,

1024
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,150
but 30 years ago and it's this,

1025
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,960
just them going off on stuff and they
made, when you watch the clip, it stem,

1026
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:15,411
I believe,

1027
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:20,030
recording the album and it was just the
most filthiest shit and offensive stuff

1028
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:22,970
that they could come up. They talk
about religion, a lot of stuff,

1029
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,720
a lot of stuff that actually, I was
watching it and I was like, Jesus Christ,

1030
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:29,090
this is a,
this is like the original podcast.

1031
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,900
It's completely over the top
and a, I guess, you know,

1032
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,420
it's Dudley Moore and that Peter Cook
and I guess they were supposed to be a,

1033
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,040
I don't know what they was supposed
to be mean. I don't live over there,

1034
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,230
so obviously, so I don't know
what, who they're supposed to be.

1035
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,150
I'm just imagining it's just a couple
of cans. Kevin and I can sit in a bar.

1036
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,240
I don't know what, but it's fucking
hilarious to me and I hope you enjoy it.

1037
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,700
All right. I have also,
by the way, I have a nice,

1038
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,540
I have a nice variety of youtube videos.
So if you're not into the comedy thing,

1039
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:01,580
if you want to see a beautiful woman with
the most killer body I've ever seen in

1040
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:06,581
my fucking life and an accent to match
it and her hair done up and fucking pony

1041
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:12,590
tails as she works out.
Look up fitness, uh,

1042
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,980
killer five 50 rep workout fitness
dash killer five 50 workout.

1043
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,550
Uh,
I can't remember the name of the girl.

1044
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:26,660
She's ridiculous and she does this
insane workout. She's in shape,

1045
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,310
I believe her titties or natural,

1046
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,730
unless you went to Dallas and got those
teardrop fucking fake ones that I saw

1047
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:33,200
out there.
Um,

1048
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:37,190
and she just works out and she looks
unbelievable and as she gets further into

1049
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:38,350
the set,
she starts going like,

1050
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,250
it's fucking awesome. Um, and a comedian,
you should checkout, checkout out.

1051
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:51,140
Reggie watts are
[inaudible] watts, w a t. T.

1052
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,440
S a lot of the shitty puts up.
There was this musical stuff that he does,

1053
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:57,680
I think because he doesn't want to
burn as material like most comedians.

1054
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,540
But if you get a chance to see that guy,

1055
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:03,320
there you go recommending a
video and in a comedian, um,

1056
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,320
those are all on youtube. And
here's another, the last video.

1057
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:07,580
I will recommend this something,

1058
01:03:07,581 --> 01:03:12,530
a break.com and there's something
called the tree terminator.

1059
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:14,483
And uh,

1060
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,550
it's just one of those
machines that you're going to
see that it just shows that

1061
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:25,200
human beings were just too fucking
smart for our own God. Damn good.

1062
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:30,620
Basically this machine, for those of you
who are on a treadmill right now, it just

1063
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:37,140
each has, it's like a big hand.
I Dunno what it is. It just,

1064
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,870
it looks like a back haul,
but it's really like a hand in,

1065
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:41,520
it just grabs these trees,

1066
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:47,290
pulls them right out of the ground and
then it like, imagine if like, okay, you,

1067
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:50,830
you fucking, you threw a
jab, right. Do that right

1068
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,640
now when your cubicle several one thinks
you're fucking insane and they're just

1069
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:56,190
waiting and have a fist so they don't
think you're fucking listening to her

1070
01:03:56,191 --> 01:04:00,690
Hitler video. Um, stick. Yeah.

1071
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,880
Sticky hand out there like you're
about ready to salute Hitler,

1072
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,890
but have a fist so you
don't offend anybody.

1073
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:10,190
And then just imagine if if your arm right
down to your wrist wouldn't move yet.

1074
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:15,420
Your fucking hand could do an entire
fucking three 60 that's what this device

1075
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:19,620
does except you're holding a tree
and then what it does is it fucking,

1076
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,960
some are holds the tree in place with,

1077
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,200
I dunno what some device in there and
then it loosens its grip and it goes up

1078
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,390
and down the tree.
Like it's jacking it off horizontally.

1079
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:33,420
But what it's really doing is removing
all the branches and the leaves.

1080
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,840
So then all you're left
with is the fucking is the
trunk with the bark still on

1081
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:43,070
it. It gives it another fucking
Jack and now it's you know,

1082
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:48,220
back and forth a few times now all it is
is just as round spool of a of wood and

1083
01:04:50,651 --> 01:04:53,800
then add, it doesn't stop there.
Then it goes all the way down to the,

1084
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,690
I guess where the balls would be.
Right? It's very fucking a phallic here.

1085
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,700
And then what it starts
where the weather at,

1086
01:05:00,701 --> 01:05:05,701
the base of the shaft goes up about three
and then tramp that was supposed to be

1087
01:05:06,431 --> 01:05:08,980
at slicing and half. I really
fucking blew it on that. Uh,

1088
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,670
that was the worst sound effect ever.
Clamp. That's not what he doesn't want.

1089
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,300
That's what it did. That's the
right sound effects. Say No.

1090
01:05:16,301 --> 01:05:18,130
Michael Winslow this week and

1091
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:22,180
the edge just in sections, like little
fucking six foot sections of wood.

1092
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:26,290
And I'm telling you it can do it.
One tree every like 20 seconds.

1093
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,270
And this guy's just a one mic.

1094
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:32,410
One guy with a machine is just basically
going through this forest so we can all

1095
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:36,130
have baseball bats. I don't know what,
just you know, button an amount of time.

1096
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:39,430
It took me to fucking explain that. You
could have looked it up and watched it.

1097
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:43,210
It was such an idiot. What am I
got to hear? What's coming up next?

1098
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:45,640
What's the next subject here on
the Monday morning podcast? Oh,

1099
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,510
here's something it's called,

1100
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:51,511
let's get smart is an
exclamation ex explanation point.

1101
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,290
I'm desperately trying to become a,
uh,

1102
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:02,460
the smartest more on that I can become
an I've actually through that Lumosity.

1103
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:05,050
Dot.
And becoming a better speller.

1104
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,060
And these are some of
the words that I've been,

1105
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,610
one of the Games I've been
trying to come up with,

1106
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,430
but I don't know how to
spell them. So then I, uh,

1107
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:17,770
I just write them down and I give myself
spelling tests, aesthetic aggressive,

1108
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:22,390
allege bizarre Catamaran,
cantaloupe, catalyst, catalyst,

1109
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,810
chloroform, disingenuous, facetious.

1110
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,420
You know,
you know what's great about,

1111
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:30,130
these are all words that
you can use in print,

1112
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:34,750
but if you actually use them a while
speaking, you come off like a douchebag,

1113
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,900
at least in the circle of
people that I'm hanging out,

1114
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,200
like who we're hanging out with that
can't use the word infrastructure.

1115
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:46,960
Can I use the word melancholy?
Huh? Anybody else spell
melancholies to spell it?

1116
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:51,280
M E. L. L. O. N. K. O.
L. L. Y. Like I did,

1117
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:55,360
I wasn't that bad, but it was
pretty brutal. Like succinct.

1118
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:58,960
I was playing this game.
And uh, you have to do that.

1119
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:02,380
Like when you're texting and you come
up with a word that you so can't even

1120
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:07,120
spell, like your brain literally
locks and lights succinct.

1121
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:08,860
I was like,
how the fuck do you spell this?

1122
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:15,460
Saw as a
saint.

1123
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,750
Is that like sync? Like you
brush your teeth? S I. N, k, e. D

1124
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:25,690
you know the past tense of sync. Sinked
or like sync something up. See why.

1125
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:30,691
See I think I spelled s u s y c and
then laughed and hit enter and then the

1126
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:38,650
computer's like, oh mom,
did you mean succinct?

1127
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,770
You know, you know when Google
gets all country like that.

1128
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,110
Oh my believe when you were
trying to say was really,

1129
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:52,240
I believe we fucking made you.
That might've been my girl.

1130
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:53,074
Just laughed at me.

1131
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:56,260
What Neil was that one of the dumbest
things I've ever said on this that was

1132
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:00,670
pretty fucking stupid.
Yeah.

1133
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:03,940
I believe we made you,
you know,

1134
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,490
in 30 years when I lead the rebellion
against the robots that are, uh,

1135
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,740
that, that are going
to replace us, that's,

1136
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,820
that's are going to be our battle
cry when we're sitting there

1137
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:23,500
with our p nine dx bodies and I'll be
standing there getting a sunburn just

1138
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:26,680
standing there with half
a blue face going, ohm.

1139
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,450
I believe we made you

1140
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,770
don't move.
Don't move until their screen shuts down.

1141
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,240
That's the lights of their eyes,

1142
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,640
like giving you attitude. It does
have an APP. Well, come over here.

1143
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:48,970
You're going to be on the podcast.
It does have an attitude. Oh,

1144
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,970
it says to help you
out. No, but it's said.

1145
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,810
Yeah, it is. Well, you know something,

1146
01:08:56,811 --> 01:09:00,410
I guess it all depends on the voice
in your head. Cause did you mean this?

1147
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,900
The only thing it's missing it, it should
just have o.dot, dot. In front of it.

1148
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,790
What the fuck was that? Yeah,
you're supposed to continue.

1149
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:14,960
That just made it sound like it. Bob,
do you want, yeah. All right. Move on.

1150
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:15,794
Where are you going?

1151
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:21,940
You're a little Russian mail order bride
that you watch on youtube there. Oh,

1152
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,610
how hard is she? You gotta admit
she's hot. She's very hot. What'd you,

1153
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:29,930
what I would make out with her
answering that question. It's a yes.

1154
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:33,500
See fucking champ right here.
Fucking champ.

1155
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,330
Maybe we'll see her when
we're over there and uh,

1156
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,970
pull ups in some war torn country,

1157
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,040
which he's on the head
when she's on that route.

1158
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:48,041
When she's on that rooftop and she's
doing all her squat thrusts and making

1159
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:51,500
noises like a porno star, doesn't she
look like she's in the middle of like,

1160
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:55,580
they just bomb. First of all,
she's, she's tired after her set.

1161
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,690
She's tired after

1162
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:02,540
you fucking talking about it.
That's what I'm tired of.

1163
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:06,260
So what do you think about that?
I think that brings it full circle to me.

1164
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:07,580
Have an attitude about Google.

1165
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,940
I didn't ask you to only know
it's going to put it up there.

1166
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:15,650
Why can't I enjoy one of God's
beautiful creatures? Police

1167
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:21,880
fucking break. Fuck you. Every time
you see Kevin Garnett on the screen,

1168
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:26,000
you got to make that fucking, yeah, yeah.
See, go fuck yourself. Get out of here.

1169
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:31,160
Can I see your breath for a second?
He just said, get out. Get Out.

1170
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:35,480
Beat it. You have to
leave in 20 minutes. Well,

1171
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:39,800
call a cab sweetheart.
You know what? Nothing.

1172
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,700
Don't get that Google attitude with me.
Oh,

1173
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,290
I have to leave in 20 minutes.
No one's stopping you.

1174
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:52,250
Hey Nia. How do you spell succinct
if you're so fucking smart.

1175
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:58,460
Cause I told you how to spell it the other
day. Fuck you. Shut up. Shut your face.

1176
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,910
Watch what don't I listen?
What succinct as

1177
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:08,660
I e. N. Z. Ah, you know it isn't.

1178
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,100
Can I tell you something?

1179
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,930
This is when you know you
don't know how to spell a word.

1180
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:15,710
When for some reason you're looking the
right or left and there's nobody there.

1181
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,030
You don't know how to spell it.
The UCC.

1182
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:22,940
I. E. N. S. U. C. C. I. N. C. T. Succinct.

1183
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:27,560
There's no e. No, that's
a hard one. Facetious.

1184
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,550
It's like face Sacious,
right? Like how you say it?

1185
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,220
F A. Oh my God, I can't breathe with you.

1186
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,870
We're going to have a dumbest kid ever.

1187
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,220
Yeah,

1188
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:48,200
it's a baby boy. Boy. Oh, well,

1189
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:52,160
it'll go. That's why it has school
and teachers for dumb parents.

1190
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:55,220
Did you just say that's why
it has school and teachers?

1191
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,330
Do you see what cell phones are
doing to us? I'm telling you.

1192
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:04,760
That's why it good Lord. Would you
look at you? Wow. All right. Anyways,

1193
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:07,880
that's why they make a beautiful,

1194
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,680
you just bombed the spelling test.
Wow.

1195
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:21,590
You're not a good speller. Really? Well,

1196
01:12:21,591 --> 01:12:25,350
that was a too difficult. Okay.
Facetious. His face tee os, fac.

1197
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,110
E. T. I. O. U s. So I'm actually
sitting here. I'm like a psycho,

1198
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:35,650
like a Jack Nicholson in the shining and
I'm just sitting here writing sentences

1199
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:42,020
that don't really make any sense because
I just want to use all the words that

1200
01:12:42,021 --> 01:12:43,640
I've used that I've learned.
I mean,

1201
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,810
the mallow tourist melancholy of the
psychotic critics was aesthetically

1202
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:49,550
pleasing despite their silhouette,

1203
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:54,290
the capitulation of the
inmates penitentiary argument
could be stated that one

1204
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:57,530
doesn't need and as squiz
exquisite repertoire,

1205
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:02,900
merely a succinct dilemma with a
sociopath. Nice fucking restaurant.

1206
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:06,680
Sorry,
I ran out of words.

1207
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:09,410
I just remember all I had left
was restaurant and I was like,

1208
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:14,300
I need one more sentence and I was tired.
One of a fuck you,

1209
01:13:14,301 --> 01:13:15,590
you spell some of those words.

1210
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:20,090
But I'm saying like I'm just listen to
how I speak. Okay. And how many words?

1211
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,150
I mispronounce it.
I've lied to myself for years.

1212
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:27,290
That the reason why I make such a fool
of myself is because my brain works so

1213
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:28,270
quickly that it, it's, it's,

1214
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:32,030
it's ahead of where my tongue is at and
then that's not fucking true. All right.

1215
01:13:32,031 --> 01:13:33,800
I'm here to tell you that
I am an idiot and I'm,

1216
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:37,950
I'm really trying desperately to,
uh,

1217
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,500
I've come to the acceptance that
I'm a moron and if I can, I just,

1218
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,230
but I just want it be,
but I still don't feel even,

1219
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:50,480
I still feel like I can at least
improve on. Uh, I can be kicked by big.

1220
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:54,320
I can become less of a moron.
All right.

1221
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,300
So this is basically what I've been doing.

1222
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,070
As I've been saying in
the past couple of weeks,

1223
01:13:58,071 --> 01:14:03,071
I've been writing with my right hand cause
I'm lefthanded and I've been throwing

1224
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:07,850
with my left hand because I do sports with
my right hand, my fucking mess. But um,

1225
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:11,500
yeah, I guess it opens
different parts of your brain.

1226
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:15,310
And I was talking about it and
sounding like a moron is always,

1227
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:21,100
um, how do you spell cantaloupe
as a good one? Huh? You know,

1228
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:23,770
cantaloupe, we know those
days when you're like, ah,

1229
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:27,580
I got to get in shape yet you still go
out for breakfast and you still get the

1230
01:14:27,581 --> 01:14:29,380
pancakes and the eggs,
but you go, you know what,

1231
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:33,760
I'm not going to get the home fries. Let
me get a fruit cup instead. You know?

1232
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:36,430
And then they have that look
on their face like, holy shit,

1233
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:40,510
nobody orders the Fruit Cup. That's why
I forgot it was even on the fucking menu.

1234
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:44,500
And then they go out there and they bring
this Fruit Cup bought back out to you.

1235
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:47,080
Right. And it's always
that little, uh, you know,

1236
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:51,580
he's got a couple of grapes.
It's got a melon and this got cantaloupe.

1237
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,880
And it has little fucking moldy tentacles
reaching to each piece of fruit.

1238
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,980
Cantaloupe.
I love cantaloupe.

1239
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:03,520
A lot of people don't know that about
myself and a for the life of me,

1240
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:06,850
I couldn't spell it.
I spelled it like,

1241
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:11,860
like cantaloupe. Like you cantaloupe,
you have to have a wedding.

1242
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:18,610
This is how,
this is how he spelled c a n t a l o u.

1243
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:23,230
P. E if I haven't bored you to
fucking tears at this point,

1244
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,070
nothing I'll talk about. Well
let's move on to the next one. Um,

1245
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,550
so basically I was talking
about that stuff where you,

1246
01:15:29,551 --> 01:15:33,640
you actually use your opposite
hand. It all started with this, uh,

1247
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:36,940
some comic down the comedy store can't
move the fuck it was because my brain's

1248
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:41,941
mush was talking about how that improves
your brain and actually if you're

1249
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:45,660
lefthanded and use your right hand for
stuff that usually use with your left

1250
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:50,410
hand and actually improves your lefthand
allegedly. So this gets scientist,

1251
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,000
I'm going to call him a scientist rights.
And he said, Bill and your podcast,

1252
01:15:53,001 --> 01:15:56,320
when you talk about using your opposite
hand and learning to write with it,

1253
01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:01,030
the term is called neuroplasticity
or Blain plasticity.

1254
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,400
I don't know how the fuck
to say, uh, what are,

1255
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:05,890
what you are doing is
retraining your brain.

1256
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,400
That's the science behind brain fitness.

1257
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:14,700
Here is a nice little article about
it on a p o s I t science.com.

1258
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,630
Um, and actually, you know something,

1259
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:22,540
I've actually seen someone who
did something like that. Uh,

1260
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:26,740
every morning me and my lovely
girlfriend go for this hike.

1261
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,450
And when we first moved out here,

1262
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:33,100
there was this guy who clearly just had
a stroke and he would walk up the hill.

1263
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:35,950
He was walking like, well, I'm
talking to serious like hike here.

1264
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:40,600
And this guy was going like, you
know, a half, not even a half a mile,

1265
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:41,740
quarter of a mile an hour.

1266
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:44,200
I was almost going to say a
half a mile every two hours.

1267
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:48,040
And I quickly did the math. See, I'm
getting smarter and stop laughing at me.

1268
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:53,410
So, um, I like this. I like you coming
in and out of the room laughing.

1269
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:57,370
So I know that you kind of like a little
mini studio audience so I know that at

1270
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:59,200
least some of this is funny.
So anyways,

1271
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:04,201
this fucking guy is walking with a cane
and it's one of those deals where you

1272
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:07,240
like, there's no way he's
going to make it up to the top.

1273
01:17:07,241 --> 01:17:09,420
And every morning we would see this guy,
you know,

1274
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,840
if we'd left at the same time and then
we go a couple of weeks we wouldn't see

1275
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:15,330
him. And he just kept getting
better and better and better.

1276
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,400
And the how unbelievable did that guy
look the last time it was his arm and all

1277
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:23,070
straightened out,
his left leg was working again.

1278
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,820
Somebody should have made a documentary
about that cause that's the part of the

1279
01:17:26,821 --> 01:17:29,550
movie where we would have been
crying as opposed to being like,

1280
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:32,230
oh I haven't seen her a couple
weeks. You welcome. Great.

1281
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,020
If you're going to talk,
come over towards the microphone.

1282
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,160
I was saying we were with my
mom when we saw him. Right.

1283
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:43,210
And how did that add to the story?
See,

1284
01:17:43,211 --> 01:17:48,070
this is why women's stink
at telling stories. Yeah,

1285
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:52,320
but paint, but paint the story
about the thing that we're seeing.

1286
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:57,780
My mother was there and I saw a
Robin right next to a squirrel.

1287
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,650
So anyways, using your
opposite hand, he's just like,

1288
01:18:01,651 --> 01:18:03,960
what the fuck are you talking
about? You know what, Nia,

1289
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:08,850
just sit there and look pretty.
Awe. All right. Um, so anyways,

1290
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,710
if you guys, I'm telling
you the truth, um,

1291
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,910
you can make yourself stroke proof that
stroke proof, but you can, you can,

1292
01:18:14,911 --> 01:18:18,810
you don't have to go through the Rehab.
Just blow the doctor's mind.

1293
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,011
You know,

1294
01:18:20,011 --> 01:18:24,240
as you're writing a check
with your opposite hand for
how much they overcharged

1295
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,590
you and you're already rubbing one out.

1296
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:32,870
You're staring at your fucking, was
it bed nurse? Is that what it is?

1297
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:37,700
Wet nurse. Whatever the fuck they,
ah, what nurses said breastfeeding.

1298
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:41,060
Wasn't there something in the news
about breastfeeding this week?

1299
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:47,490
Something about somebody who drinks
breastmilk and they're way beyond the age.

1300
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:50,150
The John Mayer do another
interview for a Max.

1301
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:57,800
You don't like John Mayer. He's a
fucking moron. He's not a fucking moron.

1302
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,680
He's fucking okay.
What are you basing that on?

1303
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,850
Everything that comes
out of his douche bag.

1304
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:06,800
Give me an example.

1305
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:09,420
That whole controversy
that came out recently,

1306
01:19:09,421 --> 01:19:12,570
the interview that he gave with
Playboy magazine, you know,

1307
01:19:12,571 --> 01:19:17,090
totally talking shit about everybody
and then maybe common. Wow.

1308
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:20,610
First of all, it wasn't a controversy
really. Was it riding in the streets?

1309
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,510
It was controversial.
It was controversial.

1310
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:28,460
He got on stage and started like fake
tearing up and apologizing to his fans and

1311
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:31,220
being like,
I'm sorry I was trying to be clever.

1312
01:19:31,221 --> 01:19:34,370
I just thank you guys so much
for sticking by me and blah,

1313
01:19:34,371 --> 01:19:37,210
Blah Blah and all that. Wow. Yeah. He, he

1314
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:41,920
went to, he had a tear
up about it. So Jesus,

1315
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,730
I haven't seen, I haven't seen that
since Marlon Brando went off on the, uh,

1316
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:49,200
went off on j town over there.
You don't remember that?

1317
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:54,540
I already did that.
I got to keep it funny.

1318
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:59,080
The end of his life. Yeah, he did
a little, he did wrote the, uh,

1319
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:04,320
the prologue to the, uh, what's his
face? I will just say Martin Scorsese.

1320
01:20:04,321 --> 01:20:07,540
Melle Mel, not Mel Brooks.
Mel Gibson, his little rant.

1321
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:09,461
Yeah,

1322
01:20:09,461 --> 01:20:14,200
and just this whole thing about how
a black people love him because he's,

1323
01:20:14,201 --> 01:20:18,250
what did he say? Cause I'm very, whatever
that means. And then the interviewer,

1324
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:22,150
who admittedly I think asked to douchey
question that kind of set him up was

1325
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:26,140
like, Oh, do black women throw
themselves at you? And he was like,

1326
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:30,020
he said something like, yeah, but my
dick rejects them. Like I have a whites.

1327
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:35,060
I have a United colors of Benetton
heart and a white supremacists Dick.

1328
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,380
Yeah, but you can see how he's trying to
make a joke. He plays the Ukulele. Okay.

1329
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:41,330
His comic timing is a little off.
You can see where he's going with that.

1330
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:45,080
He knows what he likes. He knows what
he likes. He goes out and he tags it,

1331
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:48,330
you know,
with his fucking updated mullet.

1332
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:53,110
Look, if you've got to be on
coke, get another microphone.

1333
01:20:53,111 --> 01:20:55,630
If you're going to keep interjecting here.
I was trying to do a podcast.

1334
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:59,050
You keep interrupting.
I've had enough of this joking.

1335
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:05,500
You fucking control me with that
pouty face. It's fucking annoying. Um,

1336
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:09,790
all right. Uh, recommending books
for the week. See us. Yeah, exactly.

1337
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:11,710
What Oprah does it,
I can fucking do it,

1338
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,190
but at least I have the honesty least I'm
honest enough to say I don't read them.

1339
01:21:15,191 --> 01:21:17,920
Nia, as you sit there and
looking into Oprah's eyes,

1340
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:21,130
here's another wonderful
book that I didn't read,

1341
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,150
but my intern said it was
great. I'm a book, uh, Bill,

1342
01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:26,650
I enjoy the podcast.

1343
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:30,490
You have to check out a book called
the creature from Jekyll island.

1344
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:34,690
It's a book about how the Federal Reserve
was started and they planned to be

1345
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:38,950
able to have a system in place from the
start that would enable certain large

1346
01:21:38,951 --> 01:21:43,600
banks from being a,
from being bailed out if shit went down.

1347
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:48,820
Apparently they've bailed out
banks before, just not a public.

1348
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:52,990
Oh, that's fucking brilliant. So basically
they become the bank for all the banks.

1349
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:57,610
And then what they do is they bail out
some of them every time they tank the

1350
01:21:57,611 --> 01:21:59,230
economy and some of them they don't.

1351
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:04,210
And those things get consumed by the
other banks that exist and so on and so

1352
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:07,060
forth. Just like, it's like
a reverse prowl commercial.

1353
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,780
Instead of telling two
friends and so on and so on,

1354
01:22:10,781 --> 01:22:15,100
they're going the opposite direction all,
all the way towards a one World Bank,

1355
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:20,170
which is why, what are we down to?
Now we're down to chase wells Fargo,

1356
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,740
Bank of America,
and uh,

1357
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,670
John Mellencamp trust it.

1358
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,340
Doesn't he have one out there for the
farmers next to that little pink house?

1359
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,350
Sage Jabil halls show. Don't
make it rain. Ethiopia.

1360
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:38,691
All right.
Also,

1361
01:22:38,691 --> 01:22:42,530
you should look up a recent article in
Philadelphia about how more than a dozen

1362
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:47,590
armed state police raided a few small
ale houses in Philly to confiscate in air

1363
01:22:48,351 --> 01:22:50,120
quotes,
unregistered beer.

1364
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:53,870
They basically stole over seven
grand worth of pricey beer,

1365
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:57,140
most of which was most of
which was actually registered,

1366
01:22:57,141 --> 01:23:01,880
but not accurately due to a clerical
errors made on the end of the city.

1367
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:05,980
So it was the city's fall through. That's
fucking hilarious. I, that's bad. I know.

1368
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:10,600
That's mean. They shouldn't be
doing that shit. But you know,

1369
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,280
they stole beer. I mean, come on.

1370
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:16,090
It's like Pauline and the
pope of Greenwich Village.
I didn't rape his daughter.

1371
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,170
I didn't spit in his fat face. I
took money, Charlie fucking money.

1372
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:22,570
They stole some bear, whatever.
They want to have a keg party.

1373
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:28,570
And how are you going to do, all right,
here's one for you. I talked about the uh,

1374
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:32,200
going to the cloud nine, a
titty bar in Troy, New York.

1375
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:36,490
And there's actually an article on there
about this fucked up strip club that I

1376
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:40,450
went to a number of years ago.
February 1st,

1377
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:45,250
2008 CT police shut down the cloud
nine and adult entertainment business.

1378
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,840
That's because they have
the video store next to it.

1379
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:49,930
I believe that's out in the garage for
those of you didn't listen last week.

1380
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:50,141
It's a,

1381
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:54,550
it's a titty bar that you walk into and
it's like walking into somebody's house

1382
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,040
and the second you walk in
there you want to leave.

1383
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,930
But there's so few people in there.

1384
01:23:58,931 --> 01:24:02,170
They all look at you literally that moment
where the needle goes off the record

1385
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:07,960
or the laser goes off
the CD or the iPod skips.

1386
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:10,630
I don't know what the fuck to
say about nowadays, but um,

1387
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:14,770
how to say it now for nowadays technology.
But anyways,

1388
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:17,980
the city shut down the
cloud nine, uh, because uh,

1389
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:22,981
this afternoon for multiple
code violations and charged
a 46 year old dancer,

1390
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,690
a 46 year old dancer

1391
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:30,970
with prostitution,
city officials said,

1392
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:33,280
say that's for all you dancers out there.

1393
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,420
That's what happens when you're in
your 20s. You can have an attitude,

1394
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:41,200
but if you're 46 [inaudible] 46
years old and you still dancing,

1395
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,260
you better drop to your fucking knees,
sweetheart, if you want to make the rent,

1396
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:44,950
okay?

1397
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:48,670
All the more reason to stop lying that
you're going to college and actually use

1398
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:52,660
those fucking funny, that funny
money to go to college. All right.

1399
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:56,830
Or you'll be working in the cloud
nine at 46. Wow. You know what?

1400
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:58,000
I'm going to copy and paste that.

1401
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:00,490
I'm going to print that sentence
and put it right above my desk.

1402
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:03,640
Anytime I'm feeling bad about
my life, I'll be like, well,

1403
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:06,730
at least I'm not a 46 year old
dancer charged with prostitution

1404
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,110
at the, uh, cloud nine
to Troy New York. Uh,

1405
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:14,400
the raid followed a five week
undercover investigation. Yeah.

1406
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:15,460
How hilarious is that?

1407
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:20,410
What were the undercover cop got blown
by the 46 year old in which Troy and,

1408
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,200
um,
run Sealy,

1409
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:28,201
our police officers observe dancers
engaged in elicit sexual activities.

1410
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:34,420
Do this reeks of a shakedown. Like the
cops didn't know that was going on.

1411
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,290
I did a college gig out there and
figured out what the fuck was going on in

1412
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:42,580
about four hours.
What happened?

1413
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:46,450
Did this 46 year old stop given
the free blow jobs to the cops,

1414
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:49,450
speaking of which, you know,
I heard that asshole in the,

1415
01:25:49,451 --> 01:25:53,980
in the Prius who couldn't stop his
car. Um, you guys seen that story?

1416
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:56,890
Um,
allegedly.

1417
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:01,960
All that girls titties are fake by
the way. I'm looking at her right now.

1418
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,640
The tits fake Nia. My fault. Wow.

1419
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:09,660
That knocks her looks down by 40%.
I got to say, there's nothing,

1420
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:12,690
there's nothing worse than fake tits.
It's just not,

1421
01:26:12,691 --> 01:26:15,000
that really just says
something about you that's uh,

1422
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:19,530
that's right up there with like
hair plugs that just says, you know,

1423
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,380
I don't know what that is.
That does it. I don't know.

1424
01:26:22,381 --> 01:26:25,020
I'm starting to change my fucking
attitudes. I guess. You want bigger tits.

1425
01:26:25,021 --> 01:26:29,280
You think that's bad. And if you go out
and get big fake tits, those are fake,

1426
01:26:29,281 --> 01:26:33,400
right? Look at those.
Those are fake probably,

1427
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:38,500
you know. Well when, when they were
round all the way up to the top,

1428
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:41,500
they look fake in that picture.
They don't in the training video,

1429
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:45,880
you're not near the microphone.
Okay.

1430
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:50,050
You just sound like some crazy person
in a closet. You look adorable.

1431
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:56,560
What are you getting all dolled
up for? Fuck you. I don't buy it.

1432
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,660
What do you even meet? Some
hipster. Is that what happened?

1433
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,900
These vans skateboarding
shoes and is ironic.

1434
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:07,901
ACDC tee shirt or Hardcastle
Hardcastle and McCormick backpack.

1435
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,440
Fucking assholes. A mock. Everything
I loved when I was a kid. Remember?

1436
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:15,590
Hardcastle and McCormick.
You always had a cool car.

1437
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:17,300
Some chick he wanted to fucking bang.

1438
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:21,320
And then the old guy who was too old
for this shit, it's all you needed.

1439
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,890
BOMP bomp it up. All right. So
anyways, this guy had a Prius,

1440
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:27,710
he couldn't stop the car,
so he had to call the cops.

1441
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,120
I can't believe I fell for that one.

1442
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,480
And people go and he was
doing like 90 miles, you know,

1443
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:36,500
or really in the middle of the day. And
he had time to call the fucking police.

1444
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,690
They caught up with them
and he didn't hit anybody.

1445
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,810
Is anybody out there driven 90 miles
an hour in the middle of the afternoon?

1446
01:27:41,811 --> 01:27:43,520
I don't give a fuck.
Even if you're in Kansas,

1447
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:47,720
there's going to be some asshole
drive and fucking 50 in the left lane.

1448
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:53,240
So evidently that guy has a history of
a reporting back injuries and that type

1449
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:57,110
of stuff. So, uh, I actually,
the more I'm thinking about this,

1450
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:58,370
I'm really thinking that this is,

1451
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,150
this is what a Chrysler did to this as
Zukie Sam arrive when it was outselling

1452
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,300
the jeep. They just started a rumor that
a tipped over going two miles an hour.

1453
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,740
And which wasn't true, but everybody heard
it and everybody stopped buying them.

1454
01:28:11,741 --> 01:28:15,400
And that was it. Like they fucked me
on the resale resale value on my car.

1455
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:19,630
Who the fuck's gonna buy my Prius than
not? Even if I have all the documentation,

1456
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:25,270
I swear to God they fixed
it. Um, I think the, the,

1457
01:28:25,271 --> 01:28:29,200
the fucking Prius is becoming, not today's
a pinto. What do you think about that?

1458
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:32,170
I think I just wanted to that point where
this podcast should have fucking ended

1459
01:28:32,171 --> 01:28:33,160
and I'm still talking,

1460
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,640
or if you want to see more videos
of this fucking smoking hot chick,

1461
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:40,600
maybe she just got fake tits.
It's body rock. Dot. COBB.

1462
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,200
Did I just get a look from
Unia? She is. She's smoking hot.

1463
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:53,650
Exactly. Thank you. All right,
let's wrap this shit up here. Um,

1464
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,680
I dunno if I have time to read this.
These,

1465
01:28:56,681 --> 01:29:00,450
these things are getting too fucking long.
Let's end with this reality TV.

1466
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:04,980
Uh, Bill, I'm originally
from Boston. I heard you.

1467
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:09,780
I was listening to Greg Fitzsimmons
podcasts or as he refers to it fits dog

1468
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:14,781
radio and this guy writes
beyond the outer limits of gay,

1469
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:17,490
uh,
the guys on the wrong side of 40.

1470
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:22,491
And he's still referring to himself with
the sub ebonic hip name with some sub

1471
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:25,140
robotic hip name. You know
what it really is? It's Chris.

1472
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:29,400
Most people are too fucking
stupid to Fitz Simmons. I know.

1473
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:34,030
Fits dog. Yeah, that's from back
in the day. I'm so, um, yeah, fit.

1474
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,900
Say Well, you know what? He's
up. It's a great fucking show.

1475
01:29:36,901 --> 01:29:40,800
And now I'm going to plug
it fits dog radio and uh,

1476
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:44,040
the fact that you trashed it. I didn't
even notice that. I guess it's gay.

1477
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:48,750
I'm Doug. Just, I'm on the
wrong side of 42. I'm 40 also,

1478
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:50,430
I should say a. Anyways,
just wanted to say,

1479
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:53,070
I listen to your most recent
podcasts and I loved it.

1480
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:56,790
You sound exactly like my
old friend, uh, Kevin Burke.

1481
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,320
Uh, but blah, blah, blah. Thank
you. All this shit. Anyways, um,

1482
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:05,040
your virtual reality TV and your podcast
and I couldn't agree with you more.

1483
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:09,270
Nobody will remember these assholes. As
soon as this, as season two comes around,

1484
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:13,050
bring back scripted TV.
I don't care if I lose my job,

1485
01:30:13,051 --> 01:30:16,170
at least I'll have my integrity back.
Um,

1486
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,800
I unfortunately work in reality TV
and can tell you from my experience,

1487
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:24,510
every cast member I've ever
had the unpleasant chance
to chat with thinks he or

1488
01:30:24,511 --> 01:30:26,670
she was meant to be on television.

1489
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:31,050
None of these fucking pathetic shitheads
ever put in any hard work into it.

1490
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:35,670
Making a career out of being
on TV and a over never made,

1491
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:39,030
never put any hard work into
making a career out of being on TV.

1492
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:43,200
They make me sick and I have
to work with them a lot. Uh,

1493
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:47,070
well that's a tough fucking
situation. Um, well, you know what,

1494
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:48,210
as much as I made fun of that,

1495
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:53,211
that cast from the Jersey shore actually
came back for 10 grand an episode and

1496
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:54,630
a,
I want to make a prediction.

1497
01:30:54,631 --> 01:30:59,130
I think that that that next season is
going to fail miserably because they're

1498
01:30:59,131 --> 01:31:03,330
taking them out of the Jersey shore and
now that they're going to take them down

1499
01:31:03,331 --> 01:31:06,600
to a,
I believe Miami Beach,

1500
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,150
which I might be a mistake.

1501
01:31:09,151 --> 01:31:12,270
That's like when it's Sitcom has kind
of jumped the shark and they don't know

1502
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:12,961
what else to do.

1503
01:31:12,961 --> 01:31:17,400
So they do the trapped in a cabin episode
or Greg's trapped in a fucking meat

1504
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:21,600
locker with Bobby and Bobby doesn't
like being small and now he likes being

1505
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:25,830
small because he can crawl through that
little fucking window. That's, that's,

1506
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,770
that's when the show is fucking over.

1507
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:33,240
When Fonzie he has to put up fucking
jumped the shark with his leather jacket

1508
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:35,500
still on. What are some
other ones are, oh,

1509
01:31:35,501 --> 01:31:40,501
you gotta fucking introduce a cute little
kid or your dog pukes on the floor.

1510
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:46,470
Cleo. Fucking love this dog. Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

1511
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:49,770
Hopefully it's up on iTunes. If it
isn't. Yeah, we're working on it.

1512
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,080
I don't know what to tell.
You were fucking working on it.

1513
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:54,960
And I appreciate that
people are getting meat,

1514
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:58,230
getting so mad at me that I haven't been
able to figure it out or hire somebody

1515
01:31:58,231 --> 01:32:00,310
at this point,
because that means you give a shit,

1516
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:04,180
you know? All right.
That's it for the podcast.

1517
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:09,010
I'll have video next week up on bill
[inaudible] dot com of my wonderful trip

1518
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:13,770
to, uh, London, Dublin and, uh,

1519
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:19,030
in Glasgow, Scotland. And I'm coming
off the wagon and a hard fucking way.

1520
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:24,790
All right, so I'm going to be back
next week. A little more bloated,

1521
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:29,680
a little dumber, add a little something
else. So it's the magic number of three.

1522
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:30,640
All right.
You guys have a great [inaudible].

1523
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:32,663
Wow.

1524
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:46,240
Wow.

1525
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:23,810
Okay.
