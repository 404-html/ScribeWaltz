1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,940
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,830
November 4th, 2013. How
you doing? How are Ya?

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,260
How's it go?
And uh,

4
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:17,220
you know how fucking red faces
in a good mood this week?

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,890
Huh? You know why? Cause it's hockey
season. Nah, I'm fucking with you.

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,724
You know what it is?

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,240
The Boston Red Sox 2013
world series champions.

8
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,360
And I was there to see it.
Not In person.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,250
I watched it on TV,
you know,

10
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:43,251
and I've got to tell you all the emotions
I had from jumping on the bandwagon

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,010
from game one of the American
League divisional series.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,490
You know what I realized through
watching all that playoff baseball,

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,370
I fucking love hockey.
Hockey's is,

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,990
I'm really going to say how great the
fucking game is cause I don't want you

15
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,940
guys to watch it because that'll ruin it.

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,440
And then somehow hockey players will
be wearing pink in October. All right.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,731
By the way,

18
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm loving all those stories that are
coming out about how little money actually

19
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:12,870
goes to breast cancer research.
Not because I,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,080
I'm pro breast cancer for you need
Yurik fucking conch out there.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,470
It's just because from day one,

22
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:24,040
if you couldn't see the money
making scam that that was,

23
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,110
and then also on the other side
to try and get more female fence.

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,800
Okay. If you can't do the fucking math
on that, you know, the rest of it goes.

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,050
Um, so anyways, yeah, the red
sox won it, man. Fantastic.

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,660
Hey Seattle,
this is how the song's supposed to go.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,880
We are the champions.
My friends,

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,631
I love it.

29
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:51,290
You know what the best part about the
fucking red sox winning was watching was

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,010
Paul Versey immediately sent me
a text and he said, congrats.

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,630
And I knew he didn't mean it

32
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,090
and it took about four or five, you
know, it was, it was the red sox parade.

33
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,950
Something happened. And
now Paul Versey. All right?

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,540
A New York Yankee fan is now telling
me how arrogant Boston sports fans are.

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,280
I mean, I'll listen to that to anybody
else in any other fucking city,

36
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,890
but to hear that from a fucking
Yankee Fan, are you kidding me?

37
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,410
And then he starts bringing up steroids,

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,030
a fucking Yankee Finn bringing
up steroids, you know?

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,840
Well you wouldn't [inaudible]
fucking stairwell. Really?

40
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,240
You ever think maybe Manny had to do
steroids cause he was facing a roid it up.

41
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,180
Roger Clemens or roid it up.
Andy Pettitte.

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,490
Let's go around your infield.
Roid it up. Jason Gmb roid it up.

43
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:48,780
Fucking a Rod. Oh, now we're
out to the outfield. Roid it up.

44
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,070
Gary Sheffield,

45
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,050
the fucking Yankees from the late nineties
right through the two thousands where

46
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,900
a fucking steroid factory.

47
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,260
If Anna tool to 15 fucking
million dollar team. Jesus Christ.

48
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,880
But I don't begrudge them. I don't
begrudge them any of their fucking titles.

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,380
It was the steroid era. Okay?
You knew what Arrow it was.

50
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,600
If you weren't doing steroids,
that's on you. You know,

51
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,010
it's like you're in the music business
and it's the late seventies you don't

52
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,340
want to play disco.
Well have,

53
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,690
have a nice fucking time playing
in front of eight people.

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,110
We give Gregorian chant or whatever
the fuck it is you want to do.

55
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,170
It was the steroid era.
I'll tell you right now,

56
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,960
we're all going to fucking be on them.
They're gradually,

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,890
gradually going to become legal and all
of this shit that everybody's talking

58
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:45,390
about them. I look at these fucking
guys, you know I love all these guys,

59
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:50,160
how they get hurt later on
in their careers and then
they go to Germany and they

60
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,590
like, I don't know what
they're doing over in Germany,

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,610
but God knows those fucking maniacs
love experimenting on Human Beings.

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,440
These people are coming back.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,030
The Peyton Manning's the Fuck Ed Colby.

64
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,630
Colby is going to come back made out of
titanium and they're going to give all

65
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:10,060
the credit that that the drive that the
termination of the competitive there

66
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,860
assessed guy has to kill or
attack from Sacha edgery.

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,150
I'm telling you right now,

68
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,110
do you want to rewind the clock and come
back like fucking Lee majors and the $6

69
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,670
million man,
you go to fucking Germany.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,710
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing over there.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,460
I had a buddy of mine recently
was talking about the,

72
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,740
they take blood out of here and they
fucking spinning around in this fucking

73
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:33,050
centrifuge. Oh, is that
what they're doing?

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,810
Let me a fucking break.

75
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,000
My fucking leg is killing me because I
ran like two feet down the street the

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
other day at 45 years of age.

77
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:46,700
These guys can play tackle football
until 40 I know I'm not a professional

78
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:49,910
athlete, but I am a
human being. All right?

79
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,290
I'm not going to name any fucking names,
but there's a lot of people do.

80
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,460
When I was a kid,

81
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,510
35 was the breaking point,

82
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,240
and when you were 37 you
were fucking ancient.

83
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,110
People won't even playing chess players
could continue on at 37 golfers,

84
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,630
but that was it. You, you were fucking
dust. It was over. These fucking guys,

85
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:15,464
you know,

86
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,590
they'll blow out their knee at 41 42
and come back a year later and have a

87
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,760
career fucking year.

88
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,553
Okay.

89
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,530
What did it take us like what a couple
hundred thousand years to walk up, right?

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,400
All of a sudden the knee has evolved
that far in fucking 15 years.

91
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,720
I don't know what I'm talking about, but
I'm just saying, all right. Oh my God,

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,630
Dude. Versie. I've never seen him whine.

93
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,920
He so fucking pissed at the call
in Boston. Title town. I mean,

94
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,430
what else are you going to call Boston?
Three Superbowls.

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,560
Three world series in NBA title.

96
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:55,610
Get fucked out of another one with
those corrupt refs, but whatever.

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,610
We'll give it to them. Yeah,
yeah. Whatever game. Seven cough,

98
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,690
35 files on us and 16 on the other team.
That's fine. That's good. Let's watch a,

99
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:07,050
when it from the line, um, and
a Stanley Cup championship.

100
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:10,850
They won eight fucking titles in
10 years with only four teams.

101
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,170
The entire state in New York at this
point. This what does a 10 fucking teams,

102
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,960
New York City next year when
the islanders moved there,

103
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,560
they're going to have two hockey teams,
two basketball teams, two football teams,

104
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,620
two baseball teams, and they've
never had a 10 year run like this.

105
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,480
The fucking Green Bay packers.

106
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,530
If Green Bay Wisconsin could be considered
considered title town in the 60s with

107
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:34,610
one fucking team, you know? Yeah.

108
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,360
I'd say we earn it. I'm not saying
that throughout all of sports history.

109
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,360
Boston is title town, but right
now, the last 10 fucking years,

110
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,310
be honest with yourself.
Get past your hatred of fucking Boston.

111
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:50,270
Just look at it on paper. Who,
who would you rather be? You.

112
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,480
Okay.

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,050
And the success your team had or,
or what happened in Boston?

114
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,370
I had nothing to do with it.
I'm not being arrogant.

115
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,260
I'm just stating the fucking
facts. All right. And the fact is,

116
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,910
I was watching game was
what the fuck game six.

117
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,471
And at one point,

118
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:14,580
you know the changing out God damn
pitchers and it's taken for fucking ever.

119
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,080
And I click over to watch a little bit
of the Bruins Penguin's game. And uh,

120
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,830
it was right when they had a fight
right off the face off in the, uh,

121
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,270
the third period.
I forget the guy in the penguins name,

122
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,120
a name of the guy in the pangs of,
he's fucking hilarious.

123
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:30,510
He's in the middle of the fight and
he's sitting this smiling looking in the

124
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:34,170
other direction, staying out of the
way. The Bruins guys rights, you know,

125
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,930
you can tell I there's a lot
of new Bruins this year and I,

126
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,070
I've been watching baseball so I got to
get caught up and it was just instantly,

127
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,440
okay,

128
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,030
the fight was over and then we watched
like two minutes of the game and um,

129
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,760
okay.

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,390
I fuck it. I'm going to say it.
That game was more exciting.

131
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,340
The game six of the world series.
Maybe it's just me, how I'm wired.

132
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,450
Hockey's it's, I watched the
replay of the, the, the Bruins.

133
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:02,370
I taped a bunch of Bruins games
and I'm getting caught up.

134
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:06,900
I watch the Bruins islanders game and
that was a ridiculously fucking exciting

135
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:07,734
game.

136
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,940
Okay.

137
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,820
Jesus Christ. Thomas Vanek does that
guy fucking own the Bruins are what?

138
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:12,870
He's killing us.
I got to,

139
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,450
I'm going to try to make it out
by the way to an island is game.

140
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,490
Before they closed that place down,

141
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:20,940
I'd like to do that and also go to
a 40 niners game. I got it. I mean,

142
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:24,480
I've been to both places,
but uh, it is the last year.

143
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:28,710
I haven't been to Nassau Coliseum.
I think I went there in 88 or 89.

144
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,910
Yeah,

145
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,070
I can't.
And I went to a islanders rangers game.

146
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:34,960
I know I talked about this before,
but uh,

147
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,230
that's a legendary building and I
think it's sad that they're leaving and

148
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,350
they're going to go to
Brooklyn and they're going
to be the Brooklyn Islanders.

149
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
I Dunno, I liked it. I,

150
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:51,330
I've always liked the islanders every
except for when they beat the Bruins and

151
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:56,010
the, uh, when the fuck did
they be as maybe three now,

152
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,430
83. We choked to the
Canadians somewhere in there.

153
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,070
We met them in the playoffs and I thought
we were going to have a run there.

154
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:05,850
There was during that their
dynasty. Um, oh, by the way,

155
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:09,750
I saw some fucking moron.
Red Sox Fan. It said 2004,

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,190
2007,

157
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,120
2013 red sox at dynasty.

158
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,680
Who the fuck?
Like

159
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,570
the definition of a dynasty, I swear
to God is like, it's just going,

160
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,830
somebody has to stop it from its free
fall. I remember when the Patriots,

161
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,970
we want three in four years and it was
called the dynasty and that was the first

162
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:42,740
time. I'm like, wait a minute.
Where dynasties always been,

163
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:44,390
you have to win three in a row,

164
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,840
200 rows of repeat three is a dynasty.

165
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:51,860
And then like however long you can
make that go. And I, as far as I know,

166
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,080
my knowledge and professional sports,

167
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,830
I think the record in hockey and baseball
is both five by the Yankees and the

168
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:04,700
Canadians of course. And, and then in,

169
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,320
let's see, in basketball PSAs,
Celtics with nine, which I mean,

170
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,100
I dunno, I mean it's like
literally the beginning of the NBA.

171
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:16,130
I look at a lot of that shit.
Um,

172
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,850
you know those championships,

173
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:24,410
you win in the 23 skidoo years when the
fucking league is just getting started.

174
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,670
You know,

175
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,690
like the League is so new that if you
just walked in with a microphone and a PA

176
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:34,430
system, you would be the team's fucking
announcer during the game. You know,

177
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:37,010
those old guys, 80 year old guys,
when they talk about, you know,

178
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:41,150
how did you get your start? You
know, announcing for the Milwaukee

179
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,073
box,

180
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,150
I saw the paper aren't character one.
I'm Martha phone.

181
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,560
Okay.

182
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,470
I was about four 50 years later.

183
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,150
You know,
like now it's just so it's so locked down.

184
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,400
So there is that weird thing and
it's also, uh, that's, that's,

185
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,150
that's a weird thing about sportswear.

186
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,980
Like each sport has that team
that just went on that fucking run

187
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,980
when the shit was just getting established
and they got so out in front that no

188
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:18,220
one kicked. Ah, is that really right?
I Dunno. The Lakers caught the Celtics,

189
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,010
which I are catching up to him and I try
to think is the most impressive thing

190
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,560
cause they did it from 1970 [inaudible],

191
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,480
which is basically the free
agent era and all that.

192
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,010
So that's the most impressive one.

193
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,300
Canadians in a maple leafs
when blow for blow 67.

194
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,240
The Celtics are a good example of
it. And um, and the Yankees too,

195
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:43,160
a little bit of an extent. You know, it's
like they want a ton before, you know,

196
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,440
anybody other than white guys
were allowed to play. But, um,

197
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,850
you can't fuck with going
from Ruth to Gehrig to,

198
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,360
to mantle like no one will ever fuck.
Although,

199
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,940
although the Pittsburgh Penguins,

200
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,030
they're halfway there now. What'd
you say? I guess I wouldn't say that.

201
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Do they went Mario Lemieux Jaromir
Jaga to Gino and fucking Sidney Crosby.

202
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,680
That's pretty impressive. It this day
and age in a, in a 20 year period,

203
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,620
you know Peyton manning to Andrew Luck.
It's just not that. You know what?

204
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,290
It's too early. It's too early to
look back. I Dunno. I Dunno what,

205
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,900
what the fuck am I talking about?
This is the Monday morning podcast,

206
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:32,830
everybody and uh, uh, what did I do this?

207
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,150
I had a fucking great week.

208
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,780
I'm back out on the road this week
and I'm doing a tuneup show tonight at

209
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:40,510
flappers out in Burbank.

210
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,290
I going to make sure I give everybody a,

211
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,370
their money's worth this
weekend because coming up,

212
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:49,450
I got a arguably the biggest
week of shows I've ever had.

213
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,570
I'm at Constitution Hall in Washington
DC and few comedy nerds like myself.

214
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:59,700
That's where Eddie Murphy tape delirious
and I believe Martin Lawrence. Oh,

215
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:04,600
still tape to special. There's so, uh,
I got to bring the a game for that one.

216
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,060
Um, and then the next night I'm at the
beacon theater and then the last night,

217
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,950
oh man. Um, I'm in Upper
Darby. People keep saying,

218
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:18,550
stop saying it's Philly. I mean, to me
it's 15 minutes from downtown Philly,

219
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,640
upper Darby, whatever the
fuck you want to call it. A,

220
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,670
I'm at the tower theater and I'll be
bringing along the most bitter sports fan

221
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,150
that I know in this moment right now.
Paul Versey.

222
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,450
Dude, he was so fucking
mad that the red sox won.

223
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:42,160
He even brought up the Celtics.
They pile on championship.

224
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,530
Okay.
In 2008,

225
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:48,550
which I'm always admitted to and I felt
the Kevin Garnett trade should have been

226
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:51,580
and get investigated considered
Kevin Mchale was like the fucking,

227
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,853
yeah,

228
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,270
whatever it was running shit
for the Timberwolves. Okay.
And I'll list once again,

229
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,290
I'll listen to anybody give me shit about
that. Other than a fucking New Yorker,

230
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,810
he's going to give me shit about buying
a New Yorker is going to give me shit

231
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:11,130
about buying a fucking championship.
Really 77 78,

232
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:13,980
Oakland A's slash
fucking New York Yankees.

233
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,900
The 1994 Edmonton Oilers
slash New York Rangers.

234
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:23,010
Give me a fucking break and then I don't
even need to bring up the Yankees. 99,

235
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:25,140
2000, 2009. I get the fuck Outta here.

236
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,650
Okay.

237
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,060
Fucking jerk off. Um, anyways,

238
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,210
what am I talking about here? Uh,
yeah, I had, I had an unreal, we,

239
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:38,160
I gotta I gotta do a little
bit advertising here. Sorry,

240
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,410
I'm a little bit all of them
over the place. I got a,

241
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,150
I got some bullshit I have to do today
before I run over to the club. Um,

242
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,400
I did a benefit last night for a,

243
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,270
for pit bulls down at
Largo and I get admitted.

244
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,450
I was a little fucking out of sorts.
I've been in a weird mood.

245
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,160
I'd just been a joy.

246
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,730
I've been home for like two weeks for the
first two straight weeks in a row this

247
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:05,360
year. And I got to tell you, I did not
miss going on the road. Kind of scared me,

248
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,460
you know, sat around making Pumpkin
bread and shit wearing a fucking apron.

249
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,550
The hell's wrong with me.
I got to get back out on the road.

250
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm going to retire a dollar
shave club. Everybody, uh,

259
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,700
I always get stuck behind the lady paying
for all her loose change from the car

260
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:50,150
ashtray. Is that me supposed
to be saying that now? I don't.

261
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:54,500

of seven who want to develop pictures,

262
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,510
get some ice cream and also a,

Lr Mint Listerine. I don't
know what the fuck it is.

me. It's just me. All right?

butter from dollar shave club.com. Trust

Ah,

327
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:49,680
writing back to the podcast.
All right,

328
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:54,630
here's one that I've been keeping
an eye on over the last cup.

329
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,670
Oh, by the way, dude, I
tried another, um, you know,

330
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,870
I've been sober here for fucking 13 days.
Um,

331
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,240
I like it.
I like it in the morning.

332
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:07,140
I hated at night and the morning I want
to hug somebody, but at night I, uh,

333
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,240
you know, I dunno what I want to do,
but I want to inflict pain on somebody.

334
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,900
So I been just been trying
to fill up those times with
some that I used to booze.

335
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,060
Uh, and I'm not done forever
people, I'm coming back. All right.

336
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,810
Just like Marianna Rivera,
I'm coming back.

337
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,070
Um,
I tried,

338
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,050
I tried to make homemade Ravioli
for the first time. Okay.

339
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:38,520
And like an asshole rather than just
trying to make the homemade Ravioli and

340
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,050
making a simple ricotta filling,

341
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,790
just keeping it simple like that or
maybe just make an a sketti right.

342
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,980
What is old Billy fuck face too?

343
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,020
He tries to make a braised short rib
Ravioli with this mushroom gravy on top.

344
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,380
It was like trying to
make three fucking entrees

345
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,350
by myself. I already knew how
to make braised short ribs,

346
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,580
so I had to go through that whole fucking
process just to get the filling for

347
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:10,170
the Ravioli that I had never made.
So for the first time in my life,

348
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,180
my mother bought me one of those
kitchen aid mixes like seven years ago,

349
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:16,590
and I have never used it.

350
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,490
The fucking thing weighs more
than the god Damn Stanley Cup.

351
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,270
And I finally took this thing out of the
back of my poor excuse for a pantry and

352
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:31,220
I set it down and I had the pasta making,
uh,

353
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:37,120
attachment and a, I can't even
tell you how fucking excited I was.

354
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,350
So I watched the Sicilian woman, I'll
send you the link to it when she makes,

355
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,930
she makes this homemade
pasta semolina with her.

356
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,770
Fucking perfect. Did she just
look at her? She's, she's,

357
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,780
she's from Sicily.

358
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,870
Sound like she's Sicilian and she's
lived over here for a couple of,

359
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,310
I'll just show it to you. When you
look at her Fred Sanford fucking hands,

360
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:04,360
you know that she's been needing pasta
dough since the day she came out of the

361
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:07,510
womb and she knew what the
fuck she was doing. So the pot,

362
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,370
the doe actually came out.
All right.

363
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:13,870
I probably should have needed it a little
bit more, but I didn't have that. Um,

364
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,240
they'll Ravioli thing where you,
it's like you're,

365
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,260
you're like a notary republic
and you got to stamp it down.

366
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,730
So I make the fuck and I
make the fucking Ravioli.

367
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,440
It actually came out really good.
I could have mixed it a little bit more.

368
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:33,430
There's a little bit of granulated Samuel
Semolina so I kind of fucked it up a

369
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,560
little bit.
And then I put my filling in,

370
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:40,561
they're caramelized onions with braised
short ribs and a little bit of carrots

371
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:44,620
in there.
Fucking delicious sticking in this shit.

372
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,250
And I go to make these stinks and
I fucked up on two levels. One,

373
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:52,480
I didn't seal them correctly and two,
I made them too big.

374
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,440
Okay.

375
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,380
Cause I guess when you drop them in the
water when they're done is when they

376
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:56,891
float.

377
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:00,940
But mine was so big they will like fucking
barges and they would just floating

378
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:04,180
up top and they weren't
sealed and all the fuck

379
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,600
all the fucking filling came out of him.
And um,

380
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,860
it was a fucking mess.
It was an absolute fucking mess.

381
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,940
And Ah, I almost started crying.

382
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,680
It took me like that entire process
took about five and a half hours.

383
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,480
It took me three hours to
fucking braised short ribs,

384
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,050
get all the ingredients, braised
short ribs and it fucking Dutch oven.

385
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,250
And it just, I, I wa I didn't, you
know what? I didn't waste a day.

386
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,130
You learn something in your failures.
I know how to caramelized onion.

387
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,940
I know how to fucking reduce that God
damn sauce down to a fucking gravy.

388
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,670
The douche bag with the youtube video,
the you edited the shit together.

389
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,760
You made it seem like that took five
minutes. Should I sit or already started?

390
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,500
Saute my mushrooms?
You can't.

391
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,330
And you're fucking left half
of the ingredients off of
your shit because you won

392
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:59,120
that cook and contest with
it. All right. And I get it.

393
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,820
You want to be a celebrity chef so you
don't want to tell all your fucking

394
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:04,110
secrets.
So why don't you put up a recipe of,

395
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,660
of PB and j next time instead of having
this vague thing and having me waste my

396
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:12,290
whole fucking Saturday.
You conk Africanus all right.

397
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,870
So anyways, but a homemade
pasta, not that hard to do a,

398
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,930
I'm going to do it again tonight.
Picking myself up off the Mat.

399
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,560
Unlike George Foreman, when Molly got
knocked him down back in the day, right?

400
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,610
I'm getting up,
I'm coming out.

401
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,840
I'm going to try spaghetti tonight,
making it nice and simple. All right,

402
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,870
I've got to prego sauce. I don't give a
fuck. I'm keeping, I'm working at one,

403
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,640
working on my pasta game tonight and
that'll be easy. I got the attachment.

404
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,480
He just,
you know,

405
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,070
send it through number one a couple
of times and then to then up to three,

406
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,730
I think,

407
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,060
and then I'll put the fucking sketti
attachment on and I'll send it right

408
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,790
through the fucker. And that's going
to be it. That's what I'm hoping.

409
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,230
Jesus Christ, what happened to me. You
know what happened? I stopped drinking.

410
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,440
That's what happened when I
stopped drinking. All right?

411
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:03,410
The booze goes away and the
apron comes out of the drawer.

412
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,130
Oh, hey, by the way, do you know we
didn't celebrate Halloween this year?

413
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,930
I was really, uh, that was nias
call because of all the, uh,

414
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,030
all the fucking assholes who came to
our house last year who were well beyond

415
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,800
the age of being able to trick or treat.

416
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,250
So instead we went to the clippers
warriors game and a what a fucking team.

417
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:26,550
The warriors half man.

418
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,410
I'm actually thinking about getting the
fucking NBA package cause I don't watch

419
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:32,244
enough sports.
Right.

420
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,943
MMM.

421
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,600
It was ridiculous.
That's the fucking game was like,

422
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,380
it was like an all star game as far as
the, it wasn't like one 20 something,

423
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:43,890
the one 20 something.
Um,

424
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,650
but I could tell you we went to the
game and being stone sober at a game and

425
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:52,280
just taking in the level
of mouth breathing,

426
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,160
fucking drunk morons that go to the game.

427
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,990
That was really eyeopening.

428
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,213
MMM.

429
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,710
I used to sit in there like, wow, that,
that guy is me except I'm sober right now.

430
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,450
I watched this drunk fat couple in front
of me get hammered out of their minds

431
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:14,050
and then order this big thing and Nachos
and then feed them to each other like

432
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:16,360
this. Like they were
in lady. And the tramp.

433
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,940
It's one of the most disgusting
things I've ever seen.

434
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:23,230
But like if I was hammered, I would've
been like all look at their in love.

435
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,830
So I'm basically, I'm going to
try and stay sober until, uh,

436
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,700
until I go over to Europe and then
all bets are off all bets. I mean,

437
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:36,640
like I'm going to go to Italy and I'm
not going to fucking drink some wine.

438
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,800
Give me a fucking break. Right. Anyways,
and speaking over there in Europe,

439
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,800
this is a story that I've been keeping
up on is the, uh, the Greenpeace 30.

440
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,380
Okay.

441
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,970
The Greenpeace sturdy.
Okay.

442
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,160
Now for those of you who haven't been
paying at paying attention or, uh,

443
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,960
having listened to the
podcast really quickly,

444
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,610
it was a group of 28 greenpeacers,
is that the correct word?

445
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,580
Greenpeace people and uh,

446
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,060
and to journalists. And they decided
that they were going to board

447
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,910
a Russian oil rig five basically somehow
shooting their ropes up there and

448
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:21,580
climbing up the side of it.

449
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,610
And they got arrested by Russian Navy
seals and they would charge with piracy as

450
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:29,910
you would think that they would.
And they've all been, you know,

451
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:32,160
all the Greenpeace supporters
and their family members.

452
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:35,940
They're all outrage thinking that
the Russians are overreacting.

453
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,900
And, uh, and when we last saw them,

454
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,080
let me click on this.
When we last saw them,

455
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:49,020
they were in a jail in Murmansk
Russia, which at this time, a year,

456
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:52,740
it's dark, 24 hours. And, uh,

457
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,330
and they were actually going to drop
the piracy charges from piracy down to

458
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:01,160
hooliganism. But, uh, this
is what's happened this week.

459
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:04,700
Arctic 30 being moved from
Murmansk to Saint Petersburg.

460
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:08,270
St Petersburg is out of the Arctic
circle and now you're basically right,

461
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,720
just south of Finland.
Um,

462
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,680
and I want to say that that's the city
that Finland had to give back to the

463
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,590
Russians, even though they
beat him and World War II,

464
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,490
they had to give him back just
because they sided with the, uh,

465
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,430
angry Charlie Chaplin over there. Um,
alright. Amsterdam, November 1st, 2013,

466
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:33,690
Greenpeace international understands,
uh,

467
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:38,520
from diplomatic sources that the 30 men
and women detained in Russia following a

468
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:42,520
peaceful protest. That's what they
said. Peaceful protest. Yeah. Like that.

469
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,280
There was nothing peaceful about that.

470
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,450
It was somewhere between
peaceful and an act of war.

471
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,580
As far as I'm concerned.

472
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,610
You just don't go out into international
waters and just without permission

473
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,590
boards,
somebody else's vehicle.

474
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,540
He can't do shit like
that. Yeah. All right.

475
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,380
But they consider it a peaceful protest,
uh,

476
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:12,230
against an Arctic oil platform and are
being moved from a detention center in

477
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,690
Murmansk to a jail in Saint Petersburg.

478
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,810
You like how they completely ignore
the fact that they tried to board the

479
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:18,381
fucking thing.

480
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,530
It's not like they just showed up and
kind of drove around it with signs saying,

481
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:24,490
hey man, fucking knock it off. Uh,

482
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,560
lawyers for Greenpeace are not
aware of the reasons for the move.

483
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,590
Greenpeace international executor
directive Kumi nine idle said, uh,

484
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:36,810
that the detainees, this is what the PR,
that's cool. Me Person said that today,

485
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,480
any shouldn't be in jail at all.

486
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,460
They should be free to join their
families and restart their lives.

487
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,580
St Petersburg has some
daylight in the winter months,

488
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,230
unlike Murmansk families and counts and
consular officials will now find it easy

489
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:51,130
to visit the 30.

490
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,900
But there is no guarantee t
that conditions inside the
new detention center will

491
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:00,160
be any better than in Murmansk. In fact,
they could be worse. There is no justice,

492
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,020
there's no justification whatsoever to
keep the Arctic 30 in prison for four a

493
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,560
day longer.
I love that.

494
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:11,950
They just completely ignore
that they broke the law.

495
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,590
I don't know what law it is.
I'm completely uninformed,

496
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:21,350
but I know you just can't
go around boarding other
countries. Fucking oil play.

497
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:22,810
I wouldn't even do that to excellence.

498
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,620
And they were allegedly
on my team anyways.

499
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,300
They are prisoners of conscience who
acted out of determination to protect us

500
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:34,240
all. And they should be free
now that I don't disagree with,

501
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:38,890
but the way you fucking went
about it. Um, so here's the thing.

502
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:43,450
Greenpeace today released photographs,
blah, blah blah. So as a last week they,

503
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,740
they allegedly drop the piracy charges,
but um,

504
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,050
I guess they're saying they haven't.

505
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:52,810
Now all they've done is
tacked on hooligan charges.

506
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,960
So they nan now stand as of right now,

507
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:58,840
they now stand accused of both offenses,

508
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:03,280
which carry a maximum sentence
of 15 years for piracy.

509
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:07,420
And seven years for hooliganism
respectively. All right. So

510
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:09,963
I dunno,

511
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,320
I don't disagree with Greenpeace
of that type of thing,

512
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:18,940
but I hope that they learned that,
you know, you can't just go around

513
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,690
boarding Russian oil platforms
and just because you know,

514
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:30,610
it's a peaceful, I mean, Jesus Christ,

515
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:34,670
I mean that's like, I dunno, somewhere
in there there's a protest is,

516
00:31:34,671 --> 00:31:37,330
is that gray area between a
protest and an act of war.

517
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,300
Like that shit that's going on
between China and Japan right now,

518
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:41,710
they're fighting over those islands.

519
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,700
Okay.

520
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,700
I forget who said somebody going to
shoot down another person's drones and a,

521
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,420
the other countries going to consider
it a fucking act of war if they do it.

522
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,651
I gotta tell you,
man,

523
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:58,560
that that will be fucking insane
if Japan and China go at it.

524
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,350
Okay.

525
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,880
Who Do you like?
Who Do you like in that dog fight?

526
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,360
Let's just say for once the United States
stays out of it and Russia stays out

527
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,570
of it, and if the two of them
were just going to throw it out,

528
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,460
I would just think sheer numbers.
China has to have them.

529
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,563
They got to have.

530
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,230
Yeah.

531
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,540
You know,
and those islands are closer to China,

532
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:23,700
so that's more a home
field advantage for them.

533
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,933
I don't know.

534
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,320
Is it weird that I want to see it?

535
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,420
Okay.

536
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,230
That's fucked up, right? I'm
just sick of like, you know,

537
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,750
it's like when the Yankees
and red sox played each other,

538
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,970
like to the point they just pat each
other, play each other for 30 years.

539
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:44,570
I got burned out in that rivalry and
I just wanted to watch somebody else.

540
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:45,950
I started watching the royals.

541
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,650
I am sick of watching the fucking
the u s go at it with everybody.

542
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:51,610
I want to watch Japan powers.

543
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,610
Watch two other countries have
a nice fucking throw down.

544
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,110
I want to see it pay per view.
Japan versus China. Who Do you like?

545
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,620
Yeah.

546
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,190
You know, technicians versus
fucking smash mouth football.

547
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,083
Okay.

548
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,760
All right.
Enough with me sounding fucking stupid.

549
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:11,350
Trying to talk about international shit.

550
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,520
Okay.

551
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,100
I had a dream come true this week.
Everybody,

552
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,800
aside from watching just Paul Versey.
Oh my God.

553
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,240
Was he a fucking baby?

554
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,080
He was pulling out all
the stops last night.

555
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:30,990
He fucking hates Boston.

556
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,100
And then he tried to tell me all the
reasons why he loved Boston to justify his

557
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,690
hatred of Boston.
You know,

558
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:41,580
he basically gave me the sports analogy
of the classic. No, no, no. Wait,

559
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:45,570
my best friend is African American. That's
what he did. But he did it in a sports,

560
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:50,460
you know, it was fucking horrific to
people who've funny. They like to food.

561
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,600
Shut the F stop trying to
give yourself credibility. Um,

562
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,210
please, please listen to the Paul versus,
uh, podcasts Diversey effect this week.

563
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,840
I'm sure he's going to be going off.
If you're as a red sox fan,

564
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,950
you should really listen to them.

565
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,820
You got to listen to him piss and Moan
about their beards and all of that shit.

566
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:09,450
It's going to be,

567
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:14,070
it's just going to be fucking
music to my goddamn years.

568
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,760
And all he does is he just brings up the
fact that the giants beat the Patriots

569
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:21,580
twice. I don't give a fuck. We
still won three super bowls.

570
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,770
I would rather,
who would you rather fucking be?

571
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,610
And I'm not giving all New York fans shit.

572
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:31,580
I'm just talking specifically diversity.
Um,

573
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,480
and anybody else there who's a whiny
fucking cunt who God knows I'm a hypocrite

574
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,990
because I've been a whiny cunt about
the Lakers and the Yankees and every,

575
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,860
the Canadians. It's just fun to be on
the other side of the wine. If, um,

576
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:47,630
and now I get to act like
I'm a fucking perfect person,
um, yeah, I am a hypocrite.

577
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:49,640
Go Fuck Yourself. I stand by it. Anyways,

578
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:52,910
the other dream that had come through
is I've been, I've been gradually, uh,

579
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,410
for like I would say,
I don't know,

580
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:57,440
whenever Mike Johnston started
doing those drum lessons,

581
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,810
whenever I stumbled upon them,
I was still living in New York,

582
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:03,200
I believe when I first found them
back in like, oh seven or whatever.

583
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,630
And um,
you know,

584
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,440
I found these drum lessons online and I
just kept going from guy to guy to guy.

585
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,330
And then I stopped at this guy,
Mike Johnston,

586
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:16,331
and he was just head and shoulders above
everybody else that I saw it there.

587
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:21,761
And the and the stuff that he was
teaching and the way broke it down and his

588
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,990
whole philosophy,
the whole pattern speed movement,

589
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,200
the whole fucking thing that
he did was just, I don't know,

590
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:33,590
it just really connected with me. So
for years I was thinking, you know,

591
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,650
some point I'm going to see that guy
either at a clinic and I'm going to take,

592
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,420
you know, maybe take a lesson, one of
the other blah blah blah blah blah.

593
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,130
Long story short,

594
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,900
he came down to the new recessed
studios in Santa Ana, California,

595
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:49,770
which is right down in
Orange County, California.

596
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:52,440
If you play in a band and you
don't want to play in some grimy,

597
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,870
horrific rehearsal space,

598
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:59,871
like most of them are with like fucking
stains on the rug from grand funk

599
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:05,440
railroad 40 fucking years earlier
when they weren't even famous. Uh,

600
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,760
if you want to plan an just state
of the art awesome facility,

601
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,290
recessed studios in Santa Ana,
California. Anyways, long story short,

602
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,120
I guess the guy who opened the place was
one of Mike Johnson's drum students and

603
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:21,660
he was talking about opening a
rehearsal place and Mike said, well,

604
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:26,190
if you ever opened one, I'll come
down for free and do a drum clinic.

605
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,880
So that's how I ended up going down there.
And I reached out to Mike and he goes,

606
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:32,980
hey, why don't you come down and take a
fucking lesson? He didn't say fucking,

607
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,860
he's much more classy guy than I am.
And I got to knock that out. And uh,

608
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,230
it was the shit.
So I'm sober,

609
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:45,231
I'm cooking and I took drum lessons
from a fucking drum God this week.

610
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,990
And now I have to go back to fuck at
lax tomorrow where somebody shot up a

611
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:53,670
fucking tee at TSA agent

612
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,610
and I have been a grumpy cunt
on stage by last two shows.

613
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,080
I'm getting nervous. Everybody,
I think I'm getting old.

614
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,410
I'm getting too old to do the fucking
road. I got to, I, you know what?

615
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:14,190
I got to go to Germany, like Peyton
manning and those guys I, I need,

616
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,400
I need to fucking get up.

617
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,980
Have them spin my blood
around some centrifuge or
whatever the fuck you call it.

618
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:22,770
But anyways, I'm getting off track.
So thank you to Mike Johnston,

619
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,190
unbelievably patient,
uh,

620
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,750
dealing with my drum and in and helping
me try and improve. And if you don't,

621
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,190
if you play drums or whatever,

622
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:36,180
I highly recommend going
to a Mike's lessons.com.

623
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,700
And um, he, I mean he's just state of the
art. You can Skype in and watch the guy,

624
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,760
you know, do live lessons is just like,
he is at the forefront of all of that.

625
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:49,050
And on top of all of that,

626
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,100
he's a phenomenal drummer
and we'll break down any,

627
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,770
basically if you can get in touch
with them, anything that he did,

628
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:59,520
he'll break it down as slow as you
want. He's just, he's the shit.

629
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,230
So that was my weekend with
that. With that, let me, uh,

630
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,270
let me, um, oh, and also something else.

631
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,910
I'm not going to say who it
was, but uh, someone else,

632
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:15,810
I know a has one of those,
those cars,

633
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,130
Tesla's and I got to
drive one and ride in one.

634
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,640
It was the fastest fucking car I've
ever been in. It's a 100% electric.

635
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:27,180
So all you guys who wrote all that
homophobic shit about my Prius. No, that,

636
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:32,181
my Prius is actually a gas combustion
engine past five miles an hour.

637
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,870
It's a big fucking scam.

638
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:38,871
It's only electric from five and
a five miles an hour and under.

639
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:42,820
But this was actually a full on
electric car and it was fucking insane.

640
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,640
The back of my head was tingling.

641
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:47,770
I think that was blood going
to the back of my head.

642
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:52,330
We got up to 60 miles an hour so god damn
fast and he didn't even have the fast

643
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,350
one. He had I guess the
slower version of it. And uh,

644
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,890
you can drive from San Diego all the way
up to the border of Canada in charge.

645
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:09,130
The car right now, it takes 30 minutes
to charge it. You can go 350 miles.

646
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,030
Most of the charges I
guess during rest areas,

647
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,860
he just sit down and you have something
to eat. Check your fucking messages.

648
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,610
I know it's 30 minutes,
but whatever you pull into a gas station,

649
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:22,330
you get a slim Jim, you go in there, you'd
take a shit. Right. That's 10 minutes.

650
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,440
Which I,

651
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,040
you know what the one thing I didn't
ask was how much the electricity costs?

652
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,370
I have no idea,
but I guess a,

653
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,380
their goal is you're going to be
able to hopefully by 2014 drive from

654
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,060
Los Angeles to New York City. But, uh,

655
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,110
I don't know if you got the money because
they're not cheap. Dude. It was insane.

656
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,920
I wanted to,

657
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,740
I guess all the batteries are under the
car and I wanted to look under and see

658
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:49,270
him and the guy was like,
well,

659
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:53,160
it's going to look like a skateboard
underneath the car. And uh,

660
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,550
it was insane. I, there was a couple of
things that he said and I forgot to ask.

661
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:01,960
He said, there's no fluid in the car.
And I'm thinking, all right, well,

662
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,670
it's all batteries so you don't need
to, uh, you don't need any antifreeze.

663
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:10,630
You don't need any oil. There's no
transmission, no transmission fluid.

664
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:13,420
But I forgot to ask him about the braking
system. You got to have brake fluid,

665
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:16,420
right? You know, it's funny as I could
just probably look it up, but, uh,

666
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,840
if you get a chance,
definitely check those things out.

667
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,100
And this guy was telling me that there's
people that drag strips that'll take

668
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:26,170
like to some guy,
he has a Datsun,

669
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,620
just a regular old Datsun from the 70s.

670
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,640
It's all electric power and he fucking
wings in the quarter mile drag races all

671
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,320
the time, all the, all the, all the time,

672
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:38,950
which makes me feel great because for
years I defended the Prius and electrical

673
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:43,480
power by saying you can get on a subway
and that can move a thousand people

674
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,450
at like 35, 40 miles an hour
during rush hour in New York City.

675
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:50,440
You think of fucking car.

676
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,800
If they really wanted to make
one with electrical power,

677
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:58,150
couldn't be fast while I finally
experienced it. So, uh, I dunno,

678
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:01,820
I'm really battling this week.
Uh, let's, let's get to the, uh,

679
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,460
let's get the questions for this week.
A pumpkin bread. Hey, Billy Crocker.

680
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,250
Tell us something exciting about the
Pumpkin bread making experience as if you

681
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:17,140
were doing sports center coverage of
what went down during the process. Dude,

682
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,670
what is this like a fucking Improv class?
I Dunno.

683
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,530
I Dunno what to tell you. I already
told you about the disaster. I my,

684
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,630
you know what I did? I
already did it with my, my,

685
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,720
my braised short rib Ravioli.

686
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,030
That was like talking about the red
collapse in September last year.

687
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:38,270
That's as close as I'm going to
get. And A, I don't know, we gotta,

688
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,540
we gotta switch it up this week with
a bunch of international emails.

689
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,050
Take a break from the relationship advice.
Listen to this one.

690
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:47,900
This one's from Peru.
Dear Billie holiday,

691
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:53,340
I am from Peru and I love your comedy.
I wish I could say Peru loves you,

692
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:55,320
but I haven't met many
people who have heard of you.

693
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,960
I think you should come in for form
here. Well, what the fuck? Toe.

694
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,860
Okay. If you, I'm to you,

695
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,070
why don't you just have a birthday
party and I'll fly down there,

696
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,520
take me to a soccer game and I'll do stand
up and I'll bomb in front of all your

697
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:14,140
relatives.
Um,

698
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:18,130
as they stare at me and my lack of pigment
anyways, nobody knows me down there,

699
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:20,920
but for some reason I should
go there and perform. He says,

700
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:24,400
but I don't know how many people
would understand your humor. He said,

701
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:29,350
he said a gold digging whore would be
a good thing here because it would mean

702
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:33,640
she gave out sex. And also what's
so bad about a girl who digs,

703
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,710
digs for gold? That's been an, that's
better than a girl that doesn't, you know,

704
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:42,120
I forgot you guys actually have mines
down there and that's actually it. Job,

705
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,090
you know, for an individual rather
than a giant machine. Uh, anyways,

706
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:51,240
he says that's what people here
would think. Don't feel bad though,

707
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,020
because I think the most people
here don't know who bill Cosby is.

708
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,630
Listen, if I somehow could get
through Rosetta stone Spanish

709
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,680
and, uh, learn how to speak your language.

710
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:08,640
If you think I wouldn't come down to
Peru, I'd actually would read up. I mean,

711
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:12,030
do you guys hate us down there too?
I believe,

712
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:16,950
don't feel like getting kidnapped by
some sort of rebel group and I hate to

713
00:43:16,951 --> 00:43:17,371
admit it,

714
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:21,030
but to me that's what a lot of South
America is because that's what I see.

715
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:26,400
I see all the, you know, killing
Pablo. I read that book. I probably,

716
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,600
I probably haven't read a lot of good
things about South America. Yeah,

717
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,000
it's cocaine cowboys.
It's a Nazi war criminals.

718
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:37,800
Yeah.

719
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,480
It's um, the most perfect
asses in the world in Brazil.

720
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,630
And uh,
I dunno,

721
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,150
I don't know what else it is.
It's the Galapagos silence

722
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,550
that's arrested abroad. It's
the hand to God. Shocker.

723
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:01,100
Move by. That fucking guy.
Was it Vince Ferragamo?

724
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,010
I don't know a lot about down there.
I'd love to go though. You know,

725
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:11,340
if I could go down there and you could
guarantee that I wouldn't get kidnapped,

726
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:16,200
I wouldn't get stabbed because it's some
horrific shit that we do in our foreign

727
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:19,260
policy down there. I would definitely
go down there. I've been to Costa Rica.

728
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:24,190
That's the closest I ever, I forgot
to uh, to South America, but um,

729
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,660
that is on my bucket list to [inaudible].

730
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:29,450
I want to go to all the continents
other than a Antarctica. I don't want,

731
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,330
I have no reason to fucking
go there. All right. Anyways,

732
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,710
let me know you guys open an English
speaking comedy club down there. I'll,

733
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:41,430
I'll fly down there. It's a
promise. All right. From Dublin.

734
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,190
All right there. Billy red boy,
a big fan, blah, blah, blah.

735
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,910
I only recently found out about your
podcast and been listening to them instead

736
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:54,320
of the depressing shit that's
played on our radio station. Dude,

737
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,350
the difference in work,

738
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:58,470
my work days from listening to your
comedy and laughing my ass off in the car

739
00:44:58,471 --> 00:44:59,304
was immense.

740
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,450
The urge to punch some of my managers
I have to deal with on a daily basis.

741
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:07,530
It turned has turned from a vein popper
to just saying go fuck yourself in my

742
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:10,830
head and laughing in their faces.
So thank you for that and keep it up.

743
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,450
Can't wait for the Dublin Gig.

744
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,710
I've got tickets that I'm going to bring
a date so it's gonna be a great night.

745
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,280
Thanks for penciling us in on your tour.
I'll buy you a pint.

746
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,870
Okay.

747
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,560
In Vicar Street. Go Fuck
Yourself. All right. That was
just sort of a love letter.

748
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:30,330
There's really no advice there. Uh,
well now that you brought it up,

749
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,070
I got to do my, I got to give you my
dates here for the big European tour.

750
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,890
When I fall off the wagon, I'm going
to fall off hard when I'm over there.

751
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,730
I already got some drinking buddies in
England that I met the last time I was

752
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:49,380
over there and one other friend
that's coming down from Scotland.

753
00:45:49,381 --> 00:45:53,480
So right there, you know,
that's going to go to a,

754
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:57,360

Denmark on December 12th.

765
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,290
I can't even read the name

Yeah.

And I'm going to be boozing it up,
flying solo.

773
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,220
I usually travel with
the lovely Nia, but, uh,

774
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,570
she's done that run with me a number
of times. She's a trooper. I mean,

775
00:47:14,571 --> 00:47:19,050
you can see that's just like a, uh,
that is definitely a thrash. But, um,

776
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,280
she's coming with me to Italy.

777

We're going to have a good time over
there and then I'm flying off and she's

778
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:26,670

00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,310
in the promotional code burr.
You know what?

854
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,790
I'm going to hire somebody to read
these things for me. All right?

855
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:27,800
Somebody with a nice sexy
fucking voice and I'll, I'll be,

856
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,840
I'll be equal opportunity. Male,
female, straight, gay. We like,

857
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:36,020
we gotta do something about these
reeds. Okay, I can't read them.

858
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:40,370
And now they're trying to do this,
this phony, put in a personal touch.

859
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:45,200
Like I'm using all of these products.
Okay.

860
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:50,030
I believe in all of these products,
but I don't use all of them. All right?

861
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,950
I'm only one man. I can't use
everything out there. All right,

862
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:59,330
here we go. Let's get back to the
reeds for this week. What are we up to?

863
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:03,860
53 K, excruciating minutes.
Military origins story.

864
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:04,694
Billy boy,

865
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,610
I am a military vet and wanted to share
a story with you seeing as you like

866
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:15,611
military history and by no means an
expert and this is probably all bullshit,

867
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,150
but this is how the legend goes. I love
our, I already love how this story starts.

868
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:21,470
Um,

869
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:26,010
your whole setup of this is what 99% of
the shit that comes out of my mouth can

870
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:29,820
be defined us.
I'm no expert,

871
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,410
and this is probably bullshit,

872
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,970
but this is my opinion because I
overheard this from somebody in a mall.

873
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
Uh,
back in Vietnam,

874
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:41,940
there was a guy named
Colonel Robin olds who is,

875
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,160
who was commander of a fighter squadron.
He was a triple ace.

876
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,720
I don't know what that means.

877
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:53,220
Does that mean he killed three people
or fought in three wars or read three

878
00:53:53,221 --> 00:53:57,550
different ways of killing you in the air?
I have no idea, but he was a triple A's.

879
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,790
I'm going to use that next
time I'm drinking in a bar.
Some woman gives me shit.

880
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,390
I'll be all happy. No, I'm a triple ace.
What does that mean? You'll figure it out.

881
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,460
Uh, he was a triple ace and fought in
World War II and would later retire as a

882
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:13,350
general.
Good Lord.

883
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,970
Any one of those things is beyond anything
I've accomplished in my entire life.

884
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,361
Uh,

885
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:23,361
olds grew a mustache while overseas in
defiance of the air force regulations are

886
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:28,450
righties. A red sock. Yeah, that fuzzy.

887
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,520
And he's a triple ace.
We are, the champions.

888
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:37,290
Old's grew a mustache while overseas in
defiance of the air force regulations

889
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,990
and command. I commit and
commanded his men to grow one,

890
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:45,570
two on the basis that it
makes you bulletproof.

891
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,190
One of his more men refuse
to do so because he, he,

892
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,500
he felt that look retarded
and got shot down.

893
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:58,250
He was recovered and grew a mustache
and wasn't shot down again before this.

894
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,011
Ms. This,

895
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:02,130
why all these studly guys throughout
the years would always have fucking

896
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:06,390
mustaches before hipsters
ruined them. Uh, before,

897
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,670
before this guy went home,

898
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:12,540
he shaved his mustache and
got shot down a second time.

899
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,440
It is now a tradition for flyers
to grow mustaches overseas.

900
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,260
It's such a superstition that schedulers,

901
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:24,261
we'll make sure at least one on the
crew has a mustache and avoid making a

902
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,330
as a mustache and avoid Ellen and they
avoid making all female crews. Well,

903
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,420
what about Tom Cruise? He didn't
have a mustache, but goose dead.

904
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,520
A ghost did he got hit by the canopy?

905
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,220
Well, that's Hollywood. That's not
real war. All right. This grow into it.

906
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:47,610
The tradition of mustache march
in the air force where everyone,

907
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:50,280
regardless of whether they fly or not,
gross mustaches,

908
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:55,610
this intern evolved into Movember's
where men grow mustaches or no shave

909
00:55:57,091 --> 00:56:02,091
November where men grow beers to raise
awareness for prostate cancer and other

910
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:06,990
male cancer and associated charities
during the month of November.

911
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,410
So go grow a mustache.
You pasty freckled fuck.

912
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:15,480
Okay.

913
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,900
Thanks for the free
laughs. Um, I will look, I,

914
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:22,490
I'm aware of prostate cancer.
All right.

915
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,840
I guess I should grow
one so I never get it.

916
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:30,160
I've grown mustaches and the PR in
the, I don't know, I'm a contrarian.

917
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:33,160
I can never go to the fucking way. That's
actually a really interesting story.

918
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:36,910
I hope even 8% of that
was true by the way.

919
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:41,780
Who was this guy who got shot down?
That's where it all falls apart.

920
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:45,020
And then the one there was a guy is,

921
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:49,220
that's how most of the urban myths
start. But I like it. Great Story.

922
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,660
And I stand by your complete lack of
research because that's everything that I

923
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:58,250
do. All right. From Finland, we're
going around going around Europe,

924
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:01,730
here from Finland. Hi. Hello
there. William F Birrer.

925
00:57:01,731 --> 00:57:03,740
I'm a 22 year old guy from Finland,

926
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:07,280
Finland and I've waited a long
time for you to do a show here.

927
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,880
So I'm very excited to hear you're
coming to Helsinki and December.

928
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,360
Unfortunately, because of my
studies, I'm doing a practical,

929
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,840
I'm doing a practical training
in Africa for three months,

930
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,550
so I'm going to miss the show.

931
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,440
I hope I will one day have the money
to come see your show in the u s so I'm

932
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,820
going to Ghana in a group of four students
and I'm the only guy in the group.

933
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,550
I'll be in the same house and going
to the same workplace with the,

934
00:57:32,551 --> 00:57:36,260
these three ladies for three months.

935
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,690
We all know each other quite well,
but I'm mostly used to hang out with guys.

936
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:46,700
So if you'd give me some advice or tips
on how to mentally prepare for these

937
00:57:46,701 --> 00:57:48,860
three months,
it would be greatly appreciated.

938
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,690
Are there some topics are actions
I should make sure to avoid?

939
00:57:53,691 --> 00:57:55,940
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Ps,

940
00:57:55,941 --> 00:57:59,720
love the podcast and all that other stuff.

941
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:03,380
I hope to see more in Tva. That's
very nice. What a nice email. Um,

942
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:04,310
are there some topics?

943
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:07,250
Listened to the amount of things
I've fucked up with women.

944
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:12,020
All I can tell you is what not to do.
Um,

945
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:17,810
all right.
This is what I would do if I was you.

946
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,710
The first thing you got to do is if
you're a type a male on any level,

947
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,060
you gotta tone that shit
down. Oh, if you're angry,

948
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,920
all anger does is scare women,
okay.

949
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:37,240
Or makes them not want to be around you
or it makes women who have daddy issues,

950
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,730
uh,
you know,

951
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,590
okay.

952
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:45,790
It's like a moth to a fucking light except
the moth reaches in, grabs your heart,

953
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:49,090
pulls it out of your chest and
throws it down the stairs. Um,

954
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,520
if you're going to live
with these three women,

955
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:53,500
okay,

956
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,780
all right.
This is what you could do.

957
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:59,400
Are a trying to fuck these women or are
you just trying to get along with them?

958
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,190
All right, first things first, uh,

959
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,250
make sure you're really neat.

960
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,680
Okay.

961
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,790
Granted,
you know,

962
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:12,880
women in the bathroom of some of the
messiest fuckers on the planet, but a,

963
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:13,591
I would do that.

964
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:18,510
I would come with slumber party energy
and just fucking given to their fucking

965
00:59:18,511 --> 00:59:23,330
conversations, okay? And right there is
where you establish credit credibility.

966
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,210
You're not angry,
you keep your part of the bathroom clean.

967
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,350
And you come with all my God,
you got you.

968
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:34,370
You fucking give into that fucking energy
late at night when they want to snack

969
00:59:34,501 --> 00:59:36,930
and they're fucking jam jams,
you join them.

970
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:38,680
Okay.

971
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,760
All right.
And you never try to fuck any of them.

972
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:43,530
Okay.

973
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:48,180
Then what you'd do is you'd talk to
them about how you're having problems

974
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:53,181
meeting women in Ghana and you need
advice and then there'll become a fucking

975
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:58,050
wing man for you and you'll be crushing
fucking Gannon East fucking ass.

976
00:59:58,051 --> 00:59:59,340
Whatever the hell you want to call it.

977
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,870
Right and left when you're out there
and they'll actually help you do it.

978
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,200
Okay.

979
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,000
That's, that's, that
would be my game plan.

980
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,010
But the last thing you should do is
try to hook up with any one of them and

981
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,850
unless it's the last weekend,
the last weekend comes around,

982
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,910
all bets are off.
You get in there and you fuck them all.

983
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,353
Yeah.

984
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,380
Somewhere in there is probably some
information that you could use.

985
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:30,180
If anybody has any suggestions on what
this guy should be doing. My, my, uh,

986
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:35,210
my trip isn't until December if anybody
else's studied abroad with three broad

987
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:38,910
and has better advice.

988
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,430
Yeah.

989
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,210
Um, for the love of God, let me know
and I'll pass it onto this, this, uh,

990
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:49,370
this, uh, this, this, this fine
young gentleman. All right.

991
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:54,390
Documentaries. Uh, just a
bill on Capitol Hill. Ah,

992
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:55,500
one of my favorites.

993
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,140
I know a lot of you guys are too
old to remember schoolhouse rock.

994
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:00,780
Do you remember that?
I'm just a bill. Yes.

995
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:05,781
I'm only a bill and I'm sitting
here on Capital Hill where

996
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:14,030
I put all the bank as I saw that
and I bought out a [inaudible] la.

997
01:01:19,451 --> 01:01:22,980
How bad. Sorry. That was way too long.

998
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,960
Pray that I will. But today
I'm still just a bill. Um, Hey,

999
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:29,460
your top school house rocks.

1000
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:30,940
Yeah.

1001
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,180
Three is a magic number.

1002
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,310
Okay.

1003
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,810
Conjunction junction verb.
That's what's happening.

1004
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,980
I'm just a,
Bill's a great one.

1005
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,410
Number nine is a great one.

1006
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,060
Okay.

1007
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,400
Oh my God. I'm going to have
to fucking upload that Shit.

1008
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:53,520
I have that on CD box set somewhere.

1009
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,360
Jesus under some championship hat.

1010
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:01,340
Okay.

1011
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,480
Roberta did. All right. I've got two
documentaries for your, your red face,

1012
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,080
um,
to lock onto.

1013
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,610
Yeah.

1014
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:15,470
All right. First up black fish. This
is about killer whales and sea world.

1015
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:16,131
Basically,

1016
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:20,550
it starts from the time they got a
killer whale into cap into captivity.

1017
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,090
I really apologize for
my reading out loud.

1018
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:28,530
This is like the worst I've
ever done. Um, anyways,

1019
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:30,600
he says this is about,

1020
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,530
basically it starts from the first
time they got a killer whale into cap

1021
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,000
captivity at seaworld.

1022
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:40,770
They separate it from its mother at the
age of two males remained with their

1023
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:44,730
mothers their whole lives.
So the separation is very traumatic.

1024
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,200
They are kept in tanks too
small and fed very little.

1025
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,940
The whole thing is mindblowing. It aired
on CNN and I recommend it to everyone.

1026
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,530
You won't believe the stuff that comes
out of the seaworld employees mouse.

1027
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,440
Oh, though I might just take your, uh,

1028
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,580
your word on that.
I can't handle watching people do stuff,

1029
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,043
uh,

1030
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,930
animals and kids.

1031
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,290
And then the next level,

1032
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,700
like the level of rage because
that's about as innocent as it gets.

1033
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,640
And then the next level of rage
above that is, is someone you know,

1034
01:03:25,641 --> 01:03:28,460
beating the shit out of their
girlfriend and a wife or anything.

1035
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:32,630
Like I can't handle watching that stuff.
Like they made that thing, what was it,

1036
01:03:32,631 --> 01:03:33,464
the cove

1037
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:37,990
where they just drive all those dolphins
into that little area and then they

1038
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:41,710
just bludgeoned them to death. Like just
tell me where I need to donate money.

1039
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,200
I really can't watch like last night,

1040
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,860
this is my second time doing that
pit bull thing in one of the pit,

1041
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,200
the woman who organizes it has a,

1042
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,410
has a pit bull herself and
has a scar on his back,

1043
01:03:53,411 --> 01:03:58,120
cause some Douche bag dump
battery acid on the thing. And uh,

1044
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:03,450
I showed up late to it this year hoping
I avoided the story cause I knew that

1045
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:07,150
someone was going to ask and I showed up
and someone asks and I had to listen to

1046
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:08,680
it again and it just fucking,

1047
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:13,900
I swear to God I could literally kill
somebody. I don't know if I could do that,

1048
01:04:13,901 --> 01:04:17,590
but I could do some horrific
blow torch shit to them. Um,

1049
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,710
so I'll watch as much as that is.
I can,

1050
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,270
if it's on Netflix, I'll try and
pull it up a second. Dirty wars.

1051
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,650
This follows a loan.

1052
01:04:26,651 --> 01:04:31,651
Journalists who tracks the origins of a
drone strike from Afghanistan to Yemen.

1053
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,770
It's streaming on Netflix
or I'll watch this.

1054
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,410
Those drones fascinate the shit out of me.
Uh,

1055
01:04:38,411 --> 01:04:40,270
if this aired on network television,

1056
01:04:40,271 --> 01:04:44,080
there would be riots in the streets over
what our military is doing in the name

1057
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:48,790
of the u s all right. But I'm also going
to watch it knowing that this is, I mean,

1058
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:49,450
is this,

1059
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:53,620
is this a documentary or is this like
one of those Michael Moore documentaries

1060
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:57,820
where it's really an op Ed
piece? Um, I'll watch it.

1061
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:01,640
I'll watch it. Fuck it. A dirty war.

1062
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:06,750
Dirty wars correlates with the news
coming out about Obama claiming to be good

1063
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:11,800
at killing people to his aides.
Here's an article from a Yahoo.

1064
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:13,780
I'll give you guys this link.
Um,

1065
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:18,220
I'm not co sign in on any of
this shit until I see it. Uh,

1066
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,310
Jesus, man, do you have
a happy one in there?

1067
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:27,420
Is there one about an old lady making
her own her own jam and a beaten out the

1068
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:32,140
corporations. You gotta give me a
little, you got to give me a ray of Sun.

1069
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,560
I appreciate all of that stuff.
I'm going might have to watch dirty wars.

1070
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,330
I'm going to, I know I'm gonna have to,
I'm going to watch both of those. Fucking

1071
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:42,470
okay.

1072
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:45,190
Jesus Christ.
Hey,

1073
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:50,080
how about now that he's given me two
that's going to make me lose even more

1074
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:54,640
faith in humanity and uh, and I'm not
saying I'm better than these people.

1075
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:58,080
I'm a complete piece of shit
myself. But, uh, can, can I get,

1076
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,200
can I get a good one in there?

1077
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:00,620
Yeah.

1078
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,100
Uh,
it,

1079
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:04,900
does anybody have a documentary on
Iceland standing up to the bankers that I

1080
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:07,570
could watch because
that one fascinates me.

1081
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:09,723
MMM.

1082
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,230
And how that wasn't covered
that much here in the states.

1083
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:18,430
I would love to see
that one. Um, all right,

1084
01:06:18,431 --> 01:06:20,830
so here's the wrap up everybody.

and that's it for the podcast this
week. Um, I had just an awesome week.

1089
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,320
I Know I was just bandwagon,
but it's really, you know,

1090
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:41,740
exciting after all those years
of watching the red sox suck,

1091
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:46,741
to actually watch them now consistently
be this winning franchise and be able to

1092
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:51,310
turn stuff around. And I know they
spend more money than God. Uh,

1093
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:55,030
but it is cool and, uh, I dunno,

1094
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,380
I hope it happens to your city.
I hope you guys go on a run,

1095
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:04,300
especially Cleveland, Kansas
City, um, all of those,

1096
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:09,220
you know, I don't, I am all, I'm
only a hater of, uh, you know,

1097
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,880
the Yankees, the Canadians
and the Lakers. And even then,

1098
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:15,340
I respect all of those teams
as much as I give him shit.

1099
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:18,070
I definitely respect him. But,
uh, I don't even hate the giants.

1100
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,850
I actually love the giants
and I'm hoping that they, Ya,

1101
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:26,290
I don't know. I just, I don't,

1102
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,950
I don't have that thing in football where
I have like a team that's the Yankees.

1103
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,001
I mean,

1104
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:36,001
I love that the jets beat the saints
this week because that means that uh,

1105
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:42,370
oh, Foote fellows, foot fetish guy down
there. I'm forgetting his fucking name.

1106
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,300
Rex Ryan.
He has a chance to keep in his job.

1107
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,573
You know,

1108
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:54,580
I don't want him on ESPN
analyzing football games.

1109
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:59,000
I want him to as a patriots fan,
I want him right where he is.

1110
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,310
Head coach of the New York jets.

1111
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,120
All right,
that is the podcast for this week.

1112
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:10,390
Congratulations to the 2013 red sox.

1113
01:08:10,391 --> 01:08:13,570
I wish I watched all throughout the year,
but I didn't.

1114
01:08:13,571 --> 01:08:17,420
I'm just a bandwagon guy and I'm going
to wear the red sox championship hat and

1115
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:20,870
I'm going to laugh when you guys give
me Shit because I am bandwagon. However,

1116
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:26,180
I am diehard Bruins Patriots and I'm
actually going to get the NBA channel

1117
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:31,181
because a package because cause
the Celtics are rebuilding and um,

1118
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,070
I wanna I wanna see if
they can do it again.

1119
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:39,670
They can rise from the ashes and buy some
more free agents and see what happens.

1120
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:41,330
But, um, I actually, you know,

1121
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:44,760
went to the clippers warriors game and
I had a great time and the warriors look

1122
01:08:44,761 --> 01:08:49,310
like a really exciting team as to
do the clippers. So, Eh, fuck it.

1123
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:53,180
What am I going to fuck up the Ravioli
again this week? I watched some hoop.

1124
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,380
All right. That's it. Hey, by the way, uh,

1125
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:59,360
I'm going to be at the Rangers
Penguin's game. All right.

1126
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:04,240
Stone Sober Madison Square
Garden this week. Uh,

1127
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,740
it should be a great game. All
right. If you're not watching hockey,

1128
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:09,170
give missing out. Go fuck yourselves.
They'll talk to you next week.
