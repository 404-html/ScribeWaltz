1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,571
Hey,

2
00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:04,530
what's going on is bill burns time for
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,900
June 11th, 2018 what's
going on? How are you?

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,710
How's everybody doing?
I'm a fucking old man.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,500
It's 50 year old.
Oh,

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,650
I remember when podcasting started back
in 2005 I just wanted to throw that out

7
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:28,380
there cause I know there's going to be
a bunch of fucking podcast people going.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,150
It's been in Japan since 1968 and I
stood my poor care seats for use before

9
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,110
using [inaudible] steel.
We're mind is you get these many,

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,390
many kids as you wish judge on who
gives a fuck.com I actually look at the

11
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,830
numbers every week

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,280
and I feel that my podcast [inaudible]
you and change it. I'm, I'm providing

13
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,850
computer. We shut the
fuck up. I love people.

14
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,370
Look at their fucking podcast numbers.
If you noticed,

15
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:03,580
everybody seems to be in the type town,
everybody,

16
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,920
you know it's like five talked
about this before. It's like a,

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,110
it's like back when I
used to do college gigs,

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,220
every college I went to
somehow they figured out a
way to fudge the numbers that

19
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:13,510
they were number one in something.

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,160
You know the number one a
fucking school for mathematics,

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:22,450
the number one school for engineering's
doesn't that have mathematics and it,

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,590
I don't know.
Right.

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,230
And then we're just so you get down to
a community college and they'd be the,

24
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:29,830
the number one community
college, uh, you know,

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,650
with fucking the best deal with
triple a or some shit. I don't know.

26
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:37,270
Some other were number one or something.
You got to hang your hat on something.

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,500
If you're a college to try
and get people to go there.

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,110
If I, if I was a dean, did they have
deans at like community colleges?

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,220
I would just,
I would go on fucking TV and say,

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,870
listen,

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,190
why the fuck would you go for years
when you can only pay two years?

32
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,930
You know, you want to go to
Harvard, fine. All you have to go,

33
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,610
it's your junior and senior year.

34
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,000
Go your freshman and sophomore
year over us over us.

35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,060
We are number one in being fucking
10 times less per year than Harvard.

36
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,460
You got the grades, you know
you're in. Come on down.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,370
Teach us dummies,
my dumb students,

38
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,400
how to wear fucking
loafers with those socks,

39
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,290
whatever the fuck it
is you smart people do,

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,150
do your freshman and sophomore
year here translate, translate,

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,150
fucking transfer over to
Harvard and there you go.

42
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,790
And you can graduate from Harvard
wide, a dad, Yardi, judge, [inaudible],

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,460
JJ or whatever they're fucking
school song is what is this school?

44
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,330
So my dad is rich and AH,

45
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,870
did real bad in school
but he has money. So, um,

46
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,960
for gain here. Now let's say that's the
stereotype. That's not true. I knew,

47
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,450
I knew a I one kid in my high school,

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,370
he got into Harvard and he did it with
fucking grades and no social life.

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,060
He made the sacrifice. The rest of
us didn't want to do it. You know,

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,130
like that little fable there with the
fucking ants saving all the food and the

51
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,870
other animals like,
hey man,

52
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm just jumping around and having
a good bucket time. You know,

53
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,490
you know who wrote that story?
I bet somebody who couldn't fucking,

54
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,770
who was really socially
awkward at a party.

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,560
So he was looking at the fucking,
was it a rabbit tortoise and the hare?

56
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,080
That's not the story. I don't know
what it is, but it's, you know,

57
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,810
you know people who are outgoing,

58
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,260
they get fucking annoyed
by people who are outgoing,

59
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,360
who are out there having a good time,
talking some shit, hooking up, right.

60
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,510
Singing songs.
They in the life of the party,

61
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:51,160
they stand on the side and the
fucking wall and they write scripts,

62
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,930
you know, so that's why now I don't know
what the fuck happened back in the day.

63
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,910
Used to have cool people and movies.
Now it'd be cool.

64
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:02,500
Person has this underlying insecurity
that they're trying to overcompensate for.

65
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,030
That's all right or shit, I
think, you know what I mean?

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,900
Some people just are
the life of the party.

67
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,020
So anyways,
now that I'm a senior citizen,

68
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,280
I banged out 54 pushups on my birthday,
a boy,

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,370
and then immediately just
fucking collapsed onto the
cap it and was like out of

70
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:34,450
breath. Like, I ran 54 flights of
stairs, but I did it, man. I did it.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,820
I don't know what it means.
It's still means I'm 50,

72
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:40,150
but it made me feel pretty
good about myself. Um,

73
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,370
I had a great birthday. I want
to thank my lovely wife. Um,

74
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,690
she surprised me with tickets
to the French Open, Roland Gals,

75
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,910
Valenzuela Tulay mooned
um,

76
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,270
we fucking, we went there
and I got to see, uh,

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,220
what the fucks his is his name that he's
the only one left. He just won his 11th

78
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,400
Raphael Nay Dow. That's right. I'm
not the biggest fucking tennis guy.

79
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,980
And I knew that he had won
this thing a couple of times.

80
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:14,680
I didn't realize he'd already
won the fucking French Open.

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,580
He had already won it 10 times
and I saw him when his 11th.

82
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,960
And what's really interesting is that guy,
um,

83
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,620
he wanted oh five oh six, oh seven oh
eight and then federal one oh nine.

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,070
Then he went in in 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

85
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,770
So he wanted four years in a row,
Mr Year.

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,780
And then when it five years in a
row and then two years, 15 and 16,

87
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:44,590
he didn't win it. So people probably
all thought, all right, his run is over.

88
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,050
He's one of the greats of
all time, but now that he's
older, blah, blah, blah, blah,

89
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,650
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

90
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,070
And he fucking comes back last year
and this year to go back to back again,

91
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,800
winning 11 and I was talking
to somebody last night,

92
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,880
we were trying to say how, what, how,

93
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:06,140
what do you compare that
to in a different sport?

94
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,960
You know,

95
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,980
you can't really say it's like winning
an NBA championship because there's only

96
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,670
one of those where with tennis majors,

97
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:18,530
this is for,

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,440
so it's like they have
four sort of super bowls.

99
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,050
So we kind of said,
I guess you'd have to go to golf,

100
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,950
compare it to golfers were,
um,

101
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,120
you know, there's four majors in
that sport. I don't fucking know.

102
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,980
It was kind of saying, well, maybe it's
like Lebron going to the NBA finals eight,

103
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,320
nine years in a row.
And it's like, well, no,

104
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:46,010
because this guy actually won the thing.
Um,

105
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,910
I can't believe people give
Lebron's shit after losing to, they,

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,480
people forget so quickly.

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,520
You know how ridiculous it was that Kevin
Durant went to the warriors and then

108
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:57,950
the, you know, and then he wins a
championship. People like, what the fuck?

109
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,460
And then you just kind of say, oh,
this is how it is. It's just how it is.

110
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,080
Like when they first put a little fucking
TVs in the back of a cab and people

111
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,600
like get these things the fuck out
of there, then making me car sick,

112
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,930
then I got high and then later on
they just put them back in and get,

113
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,720
and nobody said, Oh yeah,
I guess this is just how,

114
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:18,380
I guess this is just how it is.
Right.

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,730
Um, all right. Uh,

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,630
I dunno what the fuck I was going with
that tennis golf major shit. But I mean,

117
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:31,100
just the fact that this guy won 11 in
a row and I basically got to see on my

118
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:34,490
birthday the greatest,
um,

119
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,090
I guess you'd have to say the greatest
player ever on clay. I got to see him.

120
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:45,830
I got to see the fucking Wayne Gretzky,
the Bobby will, uh, uh, tennis and uh,

121
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,860
he was playing this other kid and he
broke him his first game of both sets and

122
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:55,550
the kid had a bunch of unforced
errors and uh, you know,

123
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,060
you could see he kept back to the guy
lost it seemed like he was a kid and he

124
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,630
just had to go there, experience it, lose,

125
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,320
make a bunch of unforced errors for
the next time when he comes back.

126
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,630
And in the end right, an English dude
comes out of won the French Open.

127
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,340
Uh, I dunno that from the way he was
talking, it was like late fifties,

128
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,420
early sixties.

129
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,730
And he came out to say a bunch of great
shit about Raphael and they doubt.

130
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,370
And then when he talked about the other
kid, he was just like, go and, you know,

131
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,650
we would have liked to see more.
We would like to say more tennis said.

132
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm sure he's a little disappointed in
his game today as with the rest of us.

133
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,420
And everybody's just sitting
there going like, dude,

134
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,660
you didn't need to fucking say that.

135
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,910
I couldn't tell if the guy was nervous.

136
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,150
He just sort of talked himself into
a corner and he meant to say, um,

137
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,790
he has nothing to be disappointed about.

138
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,540
I don't know what I'm trying to
give them the benefit of the doubt,

139
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,620
but everyone's just kind of sitting
there like, Eh, I kind of, uh,

140
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,970
kind put a fucking damper on things
[inaudible] done here. Right. Sorry,

141
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,230
I've got the bootleg recorded here,
um, which I have on my stomach too.

142
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,590
So if you start hearing
grumbling, I apologize. Um,

143
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,430
anyways, um, I was able to watch

144
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,420
gang,
uh,

145
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,420
was it game three of the NBA finals
when I was in London at about two in the

146
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:24,400
morning, I was able to watch and
I was able to watch, oh my God,

147
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,380
the fucking Washington capitals.

148
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,980
Okay.

149
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,640
Win The Stanley Cup through Josh.
Adam Meyers.

150
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:33,530
Cause I couldn't get it on my phone cause
I couldn't remember my password from

151
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:38,030
fucking, um, you know, my cable company.

152
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,360
I could have just gone on to NBC sports
and just sat there and watched it.

153
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:45,170
But my, my daughter and my
wife were sleeping so I was
laying a bed. What in bed?

154
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,510
Wide awake with the lights out.

155
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:49,930
Yeah,

156
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,570
just hitting refresh on my phone,
looking at the score.

157
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,750
And uh, when there was a few minutes
left, I text Josh Adam Meyers and he goes,

158
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,220
dude,
he goes for fuck it.

159
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:02,470
He was the one to tell me he
was just going to NBC sports.

160
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,260
And of course it didn't work out for me
cause I knew my password. And he goes,

161
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:09,250
well call me up. I'll answer my computer,
I'll facetime and Assam Shit. So I said,

162
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,120
all right,
but here's the thing,

163
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,140
I'm going to be in the dark and
I can't say anything because my,

164
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,150
okay,

165
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,730
my daughter's sleeping in the same room
and everything, so he goes, all right,

166
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,091
call me.

167
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:21,840
So I snuck into the bathroom light still
out because the only way to turn on the

168
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:25,170
lights in that fucking hotel room was
I had to have the bathroom door open,

169
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,270
which would have woke my kid up.
Some sitting in there,

170
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,490
they're like a dark in the dark,
like a creep.

171
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:33,600
The only thing that's lighting
me up is off of my fucking phone.

172
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,490
It looked like a horror movie and Josh
was just laughing at me and he's like,

173
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,860
can you see it? Can you see
that? Just put my pasty white,

174
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,530
the hand up to the screen,
given the thumbs up.

175
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,610
And I actually watched the final
three minutes of the Stanley Cup. Um,

176
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,010
and I have to tell you, uh, this
guy on the Internet put it best.

177
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,130
He said in talking about Alexander
Ovechkin, he goes, I don't,

178
00:10:56,131 --> 00:11:00,270
can't remember the last time I was
this happy for a complete stranger. Um,

179
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,680
that was watching the capital's when
was everything that you fucking watch

180
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:11,970
sports for? It's everything
that I love about sports and um,

181
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,800
okay.

182
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,500
You know, anybody that says, you know,

183
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,930
Russian players don't give a
shit about the Stanley Cup.

184
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:22,070
Just all they need to do is just watch
him walking around with that thing in

185
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,120
Vegas.
And how cool is it?

186
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:25,490
Like they actually know it would have
been great if they want it at home,

187
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:27,620
obviously.
But like if you got a win it on the road,

188
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,360
Las Vegas has to be the place she wants
to be if you're going to go party. Right.

189
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,770
And,
um,

190
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,970
I say it every year at the Stanley Cup
is the greatest fucking championship

191
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:43,580
trophy and all this forge
simply because there's only one.

192
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,750
And you grew up as a kid watching all
your heroes hoisting that thing up.

193
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:50,510
And when you're in the
million to one odds,

194
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:53,670
whatever the fuck it is that you actually
win it. When you hoist that thing up,

195
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,830
you're holding the same cup. You
know, Maurice was Shard Gordie Howe,

196
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:03,330
Bobby or Wayne Gretzky,
Mark Messy, a Mario Lemieux,

197
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,580
all of these greats,

198
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,150
the same fucking cup
Eisenman all of those guys.

199
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,290
And you hoist that fucking thing
up, said, daddy know Ciara twice.

200
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:18,240
I had to throw one, the Braun in there.
Um, it's the coolest fucking thing ever,

201
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,760
you know, however, I
would not drink out of it.

202
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,530
I can tell you that right now because
there's been enough guys who've, uh,

203
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,350
you know, over the years, hockey,

204
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:33,351
former hockey players that
have told stories about some
of the shit that happens

205
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:36,070
to the Stanley Cup. Uh, he
goes, yeah, and one of them,

206
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,180
I vaguely remember somebody saying,
I would not drink out of that thing.

207
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,570
Okay.

208
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,680
This stories of strippers sitting in the
top of the fucking thing and bending it

209
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:51,360
or some shit like that. Um, I dunno.

210
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,130
And then each player gets it for
like a week. It's so fucking crazy,

211
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,481
so crazy.

212
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:00,360
And then there's this guy that's got to
be a fucking movie about that sometime.

213
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,760
The poor bastard who has to
follow the cup around all years.

214
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,760
Somebody must have done
a documentary on it.

215
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,710
Vaguely remember seeing some shit like
that when you get to follow, you know,

216
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,170
go to fucking a titty bar in Saskatoon,

217
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,000
whatever the fuck the companies
up for the week. Um, but anyways,

218
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:22,320
congratulations to the Washington
capitols in their first Stanley Cup

219
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:27,180
championship and, uh,
what is it, 44 years,

220
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,320
45 seasons. Um, and as I tweeted,

221
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,000
one other great thing is,
uh,

222
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,630
NHL has another great
hockey city in Las Vegas.

223
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,100
And after all those years of taking
these cities that just, you know,

224
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:45,420
there was the initial excitement and
then it just kind of fizzled. Um,

225
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,700
they kind of hit a home run in Nashville
and Los Vegas and I got a feeling that

226
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:55,290
Seattle is going to be huge just because
those fans are maniacs, you know?

227
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,350
And I'm sure they'll build a stadium
to make him sound even louder.

228
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,120
Okay.
Why

229
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,500
do I always give him shit? You know
why? Because it's fun because it's fun.

230
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,500
Oh, I heard Edelman got
busted for something pds or
something like that. And uh,

231
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,360
now they're going to Wa
he's going to appeal it.

232
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,250
And what I'm going to love about that is
now everybody's going to be like shoe.

233
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,810
That's why they beat
Atlanta and Dah, Dah, Dah,

234
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,140
and all this fucking shit
because they're the patriots.

235
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,881
That's how it works.

236
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:29,710
You'll just look the other way when 30%
of the Legion of boom tested positive

237
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:34,130
for fucking steroids. Ah,
that's all right. That's all
right. That's Seattle. And so,

238
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:38,650
okay. I had pee Dee sent to my house
in my wife's name did for my wife.

239
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,060
She was taking a pop tart out of the
toaster and she hurt her shoulder and she

240
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:46,420
needed a fucking steroids to get back
in shape again so she could make some

241
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:48,910
fucking lemon Marangu Pie.

242
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,380
Anyways, um, if I had to guess, you know,

243
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:57,230
we had that horrific injury and
he's doing the Andy Pettitte thing.

244
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,550
He's fucking trying to get back and he
took some fucking roids and he got caught.

245
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,980
It took something and got caught.
There's a lot I'm thinking. Um,

246
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,030
but I do know when, anytime anybody
seems to appeal these things,

247
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,190
I don't think that they ever had
ever goes back the other way.

248
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:14,810
But I'm glad that I'm not in the u s
to listen to ESPN and all these fucking

249
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,430
guys now say, Oh yeah, yeah,

250
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,910
they should take away all their titles

251
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,120
because they got caught.

252
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,790
They had a player get caught
doing what a player got caught on.

253
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:30,650
Every out of bucking team has
done. Um, so anyways, enough, uh,

254
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:33,140
enough with the sports
shit. I am in Patty. Amen.

255
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,240
Patty and I embalming with my French.

256
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,590
They didn't brush up as enough as I want
it to. And it's making me discouraged,

257
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:44,360
but I'm hanging in there. I
got my, uh, I got my fucking,

258
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:49,310
uh, what do you call it?
Rosetta stone and that Shit,

259
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,910
I'll do it when you, when you go to
the fucking French Open, all right?

260
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,150
And you have your ticket, you go in and
you got out of the fucking thing scanned.

261
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,720
And then after he gets scanned, you get
this little fucking, it's like a ticket.

262
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,750
The size of the knee, they putting
your fucking white. But when you,

263
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,080
when you pay for parking, all
right? And then everywhere you go,

264
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:09,260
you have to take that thing out and they
have to scan it to know where the fuck

265
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,650
you are at all times. You know, I
went into the goddamned gift shop,

266
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:16,160
bought a little fucking
2018 Roland Garros Mug,

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,510
and he goes, I need, you know, let me
scan your ticket. And that's just like,

268
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,960
I wish she just said, no, you're
not scanning my fucking ticket.

269
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,650
I'm paying for that.
So now what does that add?

270
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:31,370
Does that add to my whole
fucking information online.

271
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,480
He's into drums. He does this,
he drinks too much whisky and he,

272
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,150
he can't lay off of a mug when he's
in some touristy fucking place.

273
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,230
Now I'm going to get all these fucking
ads. Now I'm going to get all these ads,

274
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,430
the in the side when I go to fucking
porno sites and shit about mugs.

275
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,450
He funny if they had, why don't they
have a gift shop on online? Poor porn.

276
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,010
Why [inaudible] we're good food.
Um,

277
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,150
and actually they probably
do. Um, so anyways,

278
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,360
every fucking place you went you had to
keep taking it out and keep taking out

279
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,820
and putting it away, whatever. So
now, finally I'm going, you know,

280
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:15,821
I bought like a fucking still water in
a crepe for my wife and I had to get the

281
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,010
things scanned.
You know what?

282
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm in another country somewhere on my
best behavior. Normally I would be like,

283
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,210
why the fuck do I have to scan this?

284
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,950
But the only reason why I didn't say
this is I didn't know what to say.

285
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,350
Why the fuck do I have to get
this thing scanned, you know,

286
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,660
in French on Francais, right?
So now I go to walk in,

287
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,110
it's five or three franch time and uh,
the match starts at three o'clock,

288
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:39,944
right?

289
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,330
So we go to go in and guess what I can't
find because they've had to take it out

290
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,000
of my pocket 58 fucking times.
I can't find a ticket.

291
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:50,330
I need to get into the goddamn match.

292
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,960
But I have that other thing and the
lady's like, I'm starting to see,

293
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,910
or you could not to get into the the,
but it's a doing. I was fucking shit.

294
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:59,810
I'm just like, are you serious? And then
she got mad at me. She's like, yes, yes.

295
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:03,620
I had to go all the way the fuck back,
wade through all of these goddamn people.

296
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:06,920
Then go to customer service.
Oh my God,

297
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,810
the fucking Tourette's that was going
on with me as I walked all the way back

298
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:16,670
past all of these fucking people. Um, I
got to give it up to the French people.

299
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:20,570
You know, you guys, you know, you
don't smell as bad as everybody says,

300
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:24,650
but I will say this when you do holy shit.

301
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,280
Then when we walked out of the stadium,
there was this guy like fucking,

302
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,120
he was probably a good six feet in
front of me and I said, Jesus Christ,

303
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,710
we actually made, he went left down the
stairs. After one flight, I went right.

304
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,050
And I tried to get away
from the guy I said,

305
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,100
and I had my shirt up over my nose so bad.
This guy smelled. I said to me, I could,

306
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:48,030
she's Christ. This guy smells like he
fucking played. How do you smell that bad?

307
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:49,980
Sitting,
watching people working out.

308
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,160
Maybe Casey was walking down the
stairs fast. Who's creating a breeze?

309
00:18:56,161 --> 00:19:00,270
And it was passing through his
fucking French armpits. But Holy Shit.

310
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,230
Did that guy stick?

311
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Not as bad as a homeless guy, but
like he smelled like he, you know,

312
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,370
freshly homeless, good.
Three, four days, you know,

313
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,130
maybe a tornado hit his fucking house and
Fema hadn't come over to help them get,

314
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,510
that's what this fucking guy
smelled like sitting, you know?

315
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,350
Okay.

316
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,770
And tennis is a really snobby
fucking rich person's sport,

317
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,530
especially down below, you know,
up top, it's a bunch of animals.

318
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,940
That's what we was sitting
in at the ever go. Uh,

319
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,690
we got front row in the upper deck,

320
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,310
get the second row upper deck because
front row they had this glass thing.

321
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,880
But you know, they chill
partition that you look through.

322
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:45,230
But on top of it they have this solid
thing that all holds it together.

323
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,780
And I was like, in America, this
would have been clear plastic.

324
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,900
So I had to look over and duck under it,
the whole fucking match,

325
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,940
which was still fine.
Um,

326
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,780
okay.

327
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,660
So anyways, but down low is
where all the fucking, you know,

328
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,880
the coaches are the super fucking rich
people and they go there and like fucking

329
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,870
outfits and they're big dumb
hats and all of that shit.

330
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,580
But all the animals were up top,
you know,

331
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,590
doing the wave and shit when nay dal had
some problem going on with his hand or

332
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:18,000
his arm. I don't know what
the fuck happened. And um,

333
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,470
but anyways, I always, it was,
it was an amazing fucking time.

334
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,360
So I had to go all the way
back and I got the ticket.

335
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,490
Then I came walking up and I,
you know,

336
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,460
after all that flipping out and
all of that fucking bullshit,

337
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,390
I still made it in the time
to see the match as always.

338
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:37,830
99% of the time I flip out
later on if there's a solution,

339
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,440
whatever I thought was going
to happen because he didn't,

340
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,560
convenience never
fucking happens. And, um,

341
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,900
I thought it was going to leave
all of that behind in my forties,

342
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,070
but evidently it's to continue. I started
strong the day I turned 50. It fucking,

343
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,360
it just continued on. So, um,

344
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,730
I'm going to rent a fucking bicycle
today and I'm going to ride around Paris

345
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,180
when my, uh, my daughter goes to
sleep and we just been having the, uh,

346
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,490
the best time here.
As always,

347
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,120
I'm going to take a well deserved
fucking little vacation here.

348
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,830
And,
um,

349
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,160
the hardest thing for me on vacation
is not to just playing a bunch of shit

350
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:22,600
every day. Um, you know,

351
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,430
and then it just becomes a
thrash. It's funny, like we, uh,

352
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,431
we drove by,

353
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:35,380
was it the Notre dam or some shit like
that and the guy driving us was going to

354
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,750
go, so you know, it's beautiful.

355
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:41,230
You got to go in there and Blah Blah and
I sweat it. I'm just not into that shit.

356
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,790
Those old churches and stuff. You walk in
and I just look around. It's just like,

357
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:50,050
yeah, you guys, you guys really decorated
the shit out of this place, didn't you?

358
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,900
You a no negative space in here.

359
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:57,220
It's all just filled up
with the most Gadi um,

360
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,060
you know, you don't think that,
you know, I like the Migos dress.

361
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,150
That's like the Church version of that
where you just can't have enough fucking

362
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,770
precious stones and or
like how those, you know,

363
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,750
the new thing where you get a Lamborghini,

364
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:16,810
then you do the fucking shiny wrap
that you put around it. That's like,

365
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:20,380
it wasn't enough that it was
a fucking Lamborghini. Those
old churches, it's like,

366
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,070
it's not enough that you have
90 foot fucking ceilings.

367
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:25,511
All right.

368
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,410
Then you got to have a bunch of sad
broken hearted people painted up there in

369
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:30,610
like real gold

370
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,110
and all of this crazy hocus pocus shit up.
They're like,

371
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,910
I don't have any desire to
do that, but um, you know,

372
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:44,170
if there's no line, I'll poke my
head in and be like, wow, wow,

373
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,090
this old church looks exactly like
every other old church. It's creepy.

374
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,960
I feel like I'm going to
catch tuberculosis because
it's cold and damp in here.

375
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,480
And uh,

376
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,890
the vibe in here is not the
vibe where good things happen.

377
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,710
So I'm going to leave now. Um, yeah.

378
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,210
So I'm going to, uh, I'm going to
fucking ride my bike around today. Uh,

379
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,840
like the big fucking Nancy boy that
I am maybe burn a few calories. Um,

380
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,260
I brought my little exercise
bands over here cause I'm old. Uh,

381
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,260
my shoulder feels fucking great.
Uh,

382
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,600
but I got a problem with my
fucking left foot. You know,

383
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,880
it's just always something. It's always
something. I'm an old, well not old

384
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,450
people. I'm 50. How the
fuck did that happen?

385
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,753
You know,

386
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,820
it's actually going to be kind to be
honest with six kind of a cool age to turn

387
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,950
in a lot of ways.
You know,

388
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,650
God knows I had a bunch of friends
that didn't make it this far.

389
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:49,640
So how the can I sit here and bitch and
I like a nice round number, you know,

390
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,680
30 sucked. 40 was like
Whoa, 50 has been cool. Um,

391
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,960
but I'll tell you 60 is going to crush me.

392
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,330
You know what's great about fifth? You
can lie to yourself through your forties.

393
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,380
I'm a young 40 something and blow blow 50
it's like not dude, you're fucking old.

394
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:09,410
So I am old and a I'm going to embrace it.

395
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,400
Maybe I'll start dressing a
little more dapper on stage,

396
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,320
giving myself a little pocket
square, hanging out of my
button down. Um, all right,

397
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:21,500
let's read a little bit of
advertising here. Oh look who's here.

398

my 40 style is shave club, dude.

399

teeth or trying to make your hair look

400
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:37,310
presentable. I do most of those two.

401

lavender calming body cleanser after you

Does that really work?

410
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,100
I wish I had some of that yesterday when
I couldn't find my tickets at a tennis

411
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:23,400
match. They should just have that in a

00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,810
Less so fun.

568
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,880
We ended up meeting up with friends who
ran into a friend at the royal and gals.

569
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,450
Uh Oh that was so fucking random.
So random.

570
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,530
There's about a hundred gift shops at
the Roland Garros and we just happened to

571
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:30,880
run into, but we went into the bad one.
The one that everybody goes into this.

572
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,320
Yeah, you want to go to the boutique
boutique once there's an Adidas store.

573
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,640
I saw that on the way out, but I
was trying to beat the crowd. Oh,

574
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:40,600
how funny was that?
We're like,

575
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:43,880
we gotta get away from the crowds
so we can get a fucking Uber and,

576
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,740
and I went right when everybody
else went left just to, you know,

577
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:50,380
get a few blocks over to, gives
somebody a chance. And, you know,

578
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,610
all the streets are blocked off.

579
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,150
And we ended up going from Roland
Garros and just walked past,

580
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,380
I thought it was a parking garage.
It was another stadium.

581
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:02,500
And I looked at soccer magic.
Yeah. It was like, oh fuck.

582
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,200
And then next door was another
soccer stadium. I'm like,

583
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:08,700
why the fuck this is like
stadium row over here. Um,

584
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,290
and of course we call the Uber and the
guy couldn't come down the street and it

585
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:15,300
just was a whatever it was. Yes, we did.

586
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,550
We went out to dinner and had a lovely
dinner and then we ended up meeting up

587
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:22,960
with the friends that we ran into at
Roland Garros plus another friend of yours

588
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,800
plus some friends of mine. Yeah.
We all met up and they, uh,

589
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,720
it was four couples and we just ended
up having this table at this cafe.

590
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,020
Late night. We shut it down when
you guys sang me happy birthday.

591
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,930
Got some champagne. Oh, it was awesome.

592
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,250
So much fun,
by the way.

593
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,160
Do you know it's one of the only times
anybody's ever sung happy birthday to me

594
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,910
and I haven't been embarrassed.
It's happened times in my life.

595
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,020
All right.
There it Royal Albert Hall.

596
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:55,810
So it was twice the same
birthday and then, uh,

597
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,100
last year when I was on stage in Montreal,

598
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,500
uh,
they all sang happy,

599
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:04,720
but I was one of the coolest
things that ever happened to me.

600
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,250
The crowd all saying it and the fact
that they sang it to a Bruins fan that we

601
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:14,251
could set aside our differences
to celebrate one bald heck yeah.

602
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,300
In that moment,
you know,

603
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,870
which gives me hope that when Donald
Trump goes to talk to all the, uh,

604
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,930
fatty fat face over there,
can you,

605
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:29,480
can you imagine like you'd be in that
fat when all your people are starving.

606
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,390
Now granted, I know as people are
starving because of our frigging embargo,

607
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,090
they tried to make it seem
like he's like a dictator.

608
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,570
So of course he's going to be like,
oh,

609
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,930
bad and eat lobster and Doug and drink
in the bathroom Hawaiian every night.

610
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,210
We're talking about Kim Jong. Right. Keep
going. You've got to have the own name.

611
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:47,290
That's still rob King John

612
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,490
and his dad was Kim Jong Il.
I was going to say,

613
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:57,490
imagine his wife Carmen for
dinner. Ill uh, yeah. Um,

614
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,800
Hey Kim. Jon. Hey Liz. I'm
trying to tell you something.

615
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,490
That picture that I posted of you
on my Instagram for your birthday.

616
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,060
He got over 5,000 lights. That's great.
You're really into that aren't yeah.

617
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:14,420
Retweets. Yes I do. I
am. I'm into all of that.

618
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,210
I'm an influencer.
So honestly I'm a doer.

619
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,700
But you want to tell the story why,
why you want to tell a story,

620
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:27,020
why you mock that whole influencer thing.
What is my story?

621
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,830
You don't remember when we
first heard the term influencer,

622
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,100
you were going to do something and
then you couldn't because they wanted

623
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,730
influencers. Oh yeah. I was asked to be
a part of the name. Any names I won't,

624
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,690
I was asked to be a part
of a storyteller shell. Um,

625
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,820
and what was it saying?
Yes.

626
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,880
And the theme was like cultural
diversity and families and stuff.

627
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:55,540
So it was like, oh sure. Right
up DOL we then, yeah, yeah.

628
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,250
We have an interracial relationship.

629
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,280
We have a biracial child is Kinda yeah
I can come up with something for that.

630
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:05,281
And then the person who asked me said
that they had to disinvite me because they

631
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:11,380
wanted more influencers.
So a network wanted more infant network,

632
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,620
wanted more influencers and you know,
so they got,

633
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:19,360
they replaced me with someone who had
apparently more quote unquote influence

634
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,390
and more friends and fit or whatever
the fuck it is. People on social media.

635
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,940
Um, and I didn't even really
dig into who this person was,

636
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:32,170
but apparently they were terrible and
the whole show was like kind of awkward

637
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,940
and not that great.
So it's fine.

638
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,240
But I was so offended that I wasn't
seen as an influencer when I have like,

639
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,020
you know,

640
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:46,020
I'd healthy following on Twitter and
Instagram that I just decided that I was

641
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,870
going to be an end of one of the greatest
influences ever. I am an influencer.

642
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,480
Like that's,
that's the bottom line.

643
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:55,750
Like I feel like at this point I don't
even need to keep telling people anymore.

644
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,140
It's just who you are
coming out of your pores.

645
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,080
Like naturally people want to be like me,
so

646
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
you know it's weird for some reason.
I don't know,

647
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:09,250
just looking for some reason I want
braids right now. Well that's the thing,

648
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,150
like if I have it, you want it and that's
what an influencer does and what it is.

649
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,790
You didn't even tell me to get it. You
just had it and I was like, I want that.

650
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,060
Could you see how good it looks
on me? And so you're like, wow,

651
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:25,900
can I look like that? There's only
way to find out. It's just to get it.

652
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,330
And then you're like,
oh I don't.

653
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:30,670
But I tried and it's like
that's really what it's about.

654
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,070
That's what an influencer does. Yeah,
exactly. You just exist in this space,

655
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,920
like your own site guys. Like you are your
own movement. You are your own moment.

656
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:43,720
Is this something could, could
you teach this to somebody
else? God, no, no, no, no.

657
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,480
You either have it or you don't.
So I,

658
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,660
if you want to become an influencer and
not really quite sure what to tell you

659
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:53,830
because it's like you already
have sensitivity calling.
Is it a, is it a gift?

660
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,670
How would you describe like, yeah,
it's just, it's, it's a state of being,

661
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,120
you know what I mean? It's like you're
just always influencing all the time,

662
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:05,470
so I can't teach it. I can't explain it.
Does that get taxing or tiring? It'll,

663
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,860
you know, it really doesn't, you
know, because it's like breathing.

664
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You go people some inside tips on
how to be a fucking influencer.

665
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,620
Yup. I can't believe that people
walked away from a, you know,

666
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,490
you just influenced me to try to read
up more on influencers. All right.

667
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:32,290
Hey people, go me a send me
some parish tips here. Okay.

668
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,240
By the, did you read that
thing about the wine country?

669
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,220
The email that I forwarded you,
one of our listeners wrote in maybe.

670
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,640
When did you send that?
Evidently, I'm not an influencer.

671
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,780
Just an email from your husband's.
This is wine country.

672
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,910
You know you'd make that one,
wouldn't you? At least open.

673
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,160
I know you don't open the ones that I
send you that they have the subject.

674
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:02,730
Are You mad at me?
All right.

675
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:06,780
Paris chips. They still write
into the the junk box, right?

676
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,360
No fogging dredge or were there,
hey, thank you for the best birthday.

677
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,010
That was the best birthday I've,
I've ever had.

678
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,080
I've had two back to back.
Last year was the, uh,

679
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,770
was the selfish one where I was,

680
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,950
I was in Montreal and I went to an f one
race who I don't even know who won that

681
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:28,760
the Lewis Hamilton went. And again, I got
to look that up a little behind here. Um,

682
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,180
but this year was the best. Uh, all right.

683
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,060
You know what he's about
the song happy birthday.

684
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,110
It's really long and it almost
sounds like people making fun of you.

685
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,560
Happy bird days as a year,
red douche bag.

686
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,270
And then in the end it's always
speech speech. So I actually,

687
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,020
I thought what I said at Royal Albert
Hall was really nice and I was like,

688
00:42:57,021 --> 00:43:00,710
I did it, I got through it, knocked it
out, thanked everybody and I'm done.

689
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,220
And then as I'm walking away, people
would go speech, speech and I know,

690
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:08,720
and then I go to, like I
said, just fucking gave one.
I still didn't get angry.

691
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,220
Let me love God I Paris chips.
Hey Bill,

692
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,960
I am a fan from Perry or you
were visiting our lovely city.

693
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,130
This is my French accent.
Uh,

694
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,990
make sure that you start by
Lik comp twice in Sasha Ma,

695
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,440
uh, Metro Audi on as we
get off for a nice meal.

696
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:36,310
Then take your lovely lady to the cafe
Laurel in Rue dauphine for a late drink

697
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,840
and some jazzy entertainment.
It sounds good.

698
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,530
They have a nice garden where you can
smoke a cigar and sip on some scotch.

699
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:50,430
Slash. Wine. Also, don't learn French.
It's useless. Better learn Chinese as fed.

700
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,720
Uh, enjoy your stay and go fuck
yourself. Let's go do that. All right.

701
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,030
Thank you. Thank you for that
tip. Now I want to try it.

702
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,460
Was that gay an influencer?
He's more an informative informer.

703
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:13,910
Can we please label everybody that
fucking, he's a suggestion. Uh,

704
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,090
it wasn't yesterday. That'd be
funny if that was an no, I am not.

705
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:19,670
I am not a suggestion. I
was mute. I am a presenter.

706
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,800
I was presenting information that
you can do. You know, I mean,

707
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,300
it was a suggestion. That's really what
it was. Not Bad. It does adjust things.

708
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,430
But here's a, even in
this age of me too. Hey,

709
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:36,540
I suggest you come over here,
your honor.

710
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,220
It was just a suggestion. My sausage, um,

711
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,510
crazy lawsuit co crazy war suit.
All right.

712
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,160
Hey there Billy birthday cake.

713
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,270
Wondering if your friends in the comic
community pass this onto you. Oh,

714
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:55,900
please don't be performed getting
sued and, Oh, oh, this is the one.

715
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,250
You know what? I'm going to go
take a shower, take a shower.

716
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,560
I say take a shower and something do.
Shh.

717
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:08,430
Um,
all right.

718
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,920
Wondering if your,
uh,

719
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,080
friends in the comic community
of Wa of why influence our,

720
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:16,950
uh,

721
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,870
wondering if your friends in the comic
community past this Auntie backstory,

722
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,340
this guy, oh my God, he touched
my hair and then you hit a,

723
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,640
this gay Maddix like the TV show who
started a page in the 90s called the best

724
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:36,090
page in the universe.
Um,

725
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,630
he became famous for calling out
Christopher Reeves for not caring about

726
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:44,610
paraplegics till he became one himself.
Well,

727
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:49,400
I mean, Jesus Christ, if that, of all
the things to call people out on, uh,

728
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:53,190
basically lambasted him for
being a selfish piece of shit.

729
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,200
Jesus Christ,
I don't understand.

730
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:01,860
He never sold me on the aggressive
manner of heating Reeves.

731
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,630
The only way he kick, he does this
without looking like an asshole.

732
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,620
It's as if he was also in a wheelchair,
you know,

733
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,000
and lived at the top of a flight of stairs
or shit and nobody never made a ramp

734
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:17,580
for him. Then I could see him
being mad at Christopher Reeves,

735
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,190
but even then it would
still be misdirected.

736
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:23,820
It's still should be aimed at people
like myself that didn't go over there and

737
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:28,050
help build them a fucking ramp anyways,
but I appreciate it.

738
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:32,750
A different point of view on topics.
No one questioned and so I had,

739
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,000
okay, I, but I appreciate a
different point of view on topics.

740
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,520
No one questioned and so I
had some respect for this.

741
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,730
He also had a post called something like
I can draw better than your kids and

742
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:47,960
then posted pictures kids made
and trash them. All right.

743
00:46:47,961 --> 00:46:52,590
I like this guy now because this guy is
just being a cunt. Um, he's just this guy.

744
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,700
Maybe he's the original troller I like
it. He goes, that was like 15 years ago.

745
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,570
I hadn't heard of him since college
until I read about this lawsuit.

746
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,810
Apparently this same guy who made a
career trolling the people on a personal

747
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:08,400
level across the Internet became offended
by a comic who decided to troll him.

748
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:13,350
Oh No, no. We had no sense
of humor about himself.

749
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:17,670
Or is this more trolling? Is this
gay? The Andy Kaufman of the Internet.

750
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,670
He sued the comic for $20 million,

751
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,300
which is basically way to bankrupt the
comic for whatever little he had the

752
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:28,680
judge essentially throughout the case.
Um,

753
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,220
on the advent of your 50th birthday,

754
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:36,330
I just want to thank you for not turning
into a huge hypocrite like Maddix I'll

755
00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:36,531
do it.

756
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:40,560
I'm one of the most hypocritical people
you're ever gonna meet him doing yoga,

757
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,700
meditating and then flipping out.
Cause I, cause I lost my ticket.

758
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,590
Okay.

759
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,830
Saying this whole system is
fucking stupid. You teach,

760
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,620
really build this system that makes
sure that when you get to your seats,

761
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:56,610
some mother fucking assholes not sitting
in it. You fucked up, take your medicine.

762
00:47:56,611 --> 00:47:59,450
And I didn't act like a big fucking baby.
Um,

763
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,370
even if he thought he was being wrong,

764
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:06,060
he should have taken it like a
man realized that he had to come.

765
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:08,760
And after years doing
the same thing to others,

766
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,520
you don't feel like this is the
final act of his performance.

767
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,340
And now he's gotten you up in arms.
Uh,

768
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:17,700
you're a fewer years older than me and
I've definitely taken a page on your book

769
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:20,340
in terms of allowing myself
to stay true to who I am,

770
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,730
but also allowing myself to grow
into a more well rounded person.

771
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:27,420
I'm an ONA saying, oh
hey, from back in the day,

772
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:29,370
and it's my favorite content ever.

773
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,510
But when I see comments
online that sounded like they
came from the crowd at the

774
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:37,030
virus tour,
I just feel bad for these miserable cunts.

775
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,240
Thanks for everything and happy birthday.
All right.

776
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:42,150
That went a little left there.
But I know what you mean about the,

777
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,070
that happens with everything by the way,
not just fans of the OB.

778
00:48:46,071 --> 00:48:48,240
And Anthony showed this,
I mean go on Youtube,

779
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,890
there's always going to be then the
initial thing that you like and then you

780
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:57,630
look at the comments and I forget what
comic did that bit, but he was just like,

781
00:48:57,631 --> 00:48:58,464
you know,

782
00:48:59,580 --> 00:48:59,920
yeah.

783
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,240
You scroll down like three
or four comments before it
spins into like somebody

784
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:08,050
dropping the n word or some,
you know, thanks a lot. Oh Bama.

785
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,650
Like somehow that'll be
watching like slap fights.

786
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,150
At least that's the shit that I watched,

787
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:18,060
which I do not understand those
for the life of me. First of all.

788
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,243
MMM.

789
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,130
The fact that if they hit your ear,
what that's gonna do to your hearing,

790
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,330
you know? Do you know that was a thing
that like, I got to look this up.

791
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:33,050
Moms used to do that. That was like a
disciplinarian thing back in the day.

792
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,590
You've blocked she mothers box.

793
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,070
Yeah.

794
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:43,480
Boxing
their children's.

795
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,010
This is too specific. I don't think I'll
get anything. Ears. They would just,

796
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,200
you know, it was like killer con how he
used to do that. That scream well Ha.

797
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,050
Oh Man. Just hit your
boxing the ears. Okay.

798
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:03,410
Boston hears the other Victorians.
Uh,

799
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:03,891
Anthony.

800
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:06,620
Joshua says there's nothing wrong with
parents giving them which one should I

801
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:08,910
click on here?
World champion boxer answer.

802
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:13,010
You just said there's nothing wrong with
parents giving their children a clip

803
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:17,450
around the ear.
Boxing child's ears can cause deafness.

804
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:18,284
Yes it can.

805
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,353
MMM.

806
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,210
That's, look, this one up here.

807
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:24,840
Okay.

808
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,430
Oh, unable to open this because
of legal. The fuck does that mean

809
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,450
all right. Boxing ears. Let's see if
this one will open up. Come on, come on.

810
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:37,070
Come on. There we go.
All right. A phrase sick,

811
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,550
confused me while reading Alice's
adventures in wonderland was the rabbits

812
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:46,551
explanation of why the Queen Order the
Dutch is to be executed in chapter eight.

813
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:48,630
Okay.

814
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:52,270
What of I've never seen Alice
in wonderland is a queen
in Dutchess and all this

815
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:56,250
shit. People get an executed. I,
you know some, do you know why?

816
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:59,200
I think there's so much death in
old fairy tales, the original ones,

817
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,440
because so many people just
fucking died back then anyway.

818
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:05,120
So it really was a part of
life. Um, the rabbit, it,

819
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,700
I mean it's still a part of life,
but it's way down the fucking road.

820
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,270
But everybody had like a brother
who died of like a fucking appendix,

821
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,410
ruptured appendix or some Shit, get
some sort of flu. Ah, all right.

822
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:21,060
The rabbit explains to Alice,
she boxed the Queen's ears.

823
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,360
The actions of boxing is,

824
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,450
is something I had never heard of.

825
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,970
So I decided to look into
the meaning of the term.

826
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,710
I found that boxing of ears is a hard
simultaneous slap of both of yours.

827
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:35,460
Yeah.

828
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,540
The violent act was a popular form of
child punishment during the Victorian era.

829
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,680
Oh my God.

830
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:45,540
In an 1878 issue of the London
reader of literature, science, art,

831
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:48,870
and general information,
the punishment of boxing ears is debated.

832
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,990
The article warms is 1878 people like,
dude, what the fuck are we doing here? Uh,

833
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,420
for not only his deafness caused by boxes,

834
00:51:57,421 --> 00:52:01,080
which ruptures as they continually do.
The drum of the ear,

835
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,530
but the inflammation of the internal
cavity, which is so frequent,

836
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:09,590
a result maybe followed by disease of the
bone giving rise to absent two abscess

837
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:14,040
of the brain and having
a fatal termination.

838
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,830
I liked how they took pick the euphemism.
They're around the same.

839
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:18,060
Your Kid's gonna fucking die.

840
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:23,450
The article explains its school is
suffering from the chastisement by school

841
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:28,280
masters and fears as noted above, that
the effects of the slabs may be longterm.

842
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:32,610
I swear to fucking God,
if my,

843
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,830
if I ever had a teacher
that boxed my ears.

844
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,320
Okay.

845
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,810
Oh my God. I mean, how angry
were children back then?

846
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,380
Oh my God. Like I literally have
to walk away from this article.

847
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,423
Okay.

848
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,380
Oh Man. I wish there was, you
know, some fucking kid back then,

849
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:56,380
just fucking snapped was
just big enough. You know,

850
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,640
it just beat the shit out of his teacher
and boxed is years, like nine times.

851
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:07,310
Made him a deaf fucking bastard. Um, yeah.
So whenever I watch, she'll slap fights.

852
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:09,200
It's just like,
you're going to make somebody deaf.

853
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,940
They put something in their ear.

854
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,890
Forget about just taking a concussion
for no goddamn reason. I mean,

855
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:19,640
well they'll slap fight competitions
like what is the fucking prize money?

856
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,510
Um,
anyways,

857
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:27,260
continuing on a Bayer and Monsanto.
Whoa.

858
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:31,550
Jesus didn't, uh, I guess see what time
I've done here. 53 minutes. All right.

859
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,530
It didn't, Monsanto changes her name
like Jefferson airplane or some shit. Um,

860
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,010
bear and Monsanto. Hey there,
you over the counter cunt.

861
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,940
So bare and Monsanto are merging and
reminded me of the time you mentioned an

862
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:51,080
article where bare admitted to knowing
and allowing the distribution of some

863
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:55,310
aids infected shit found the article full.
This sounds official.

864
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:58,130
First of all came from me and
then you just drive the Arctic.

865
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,250
The subject of the article
as aids infected shit.

866
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,860
Well let's check out the link.
It is from CBS news.com.

867
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,321
So all right.

868
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:14,321
Bear admits he had paid millions and
HIV infection cases just not in English.

869
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,620
Oh my God,
dude,

870
00:54:20,621 --> 00:54:22,210
I swear to God.
At what point,

871
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,800
how much money do you have to pay
politicians where they feel like they have

872
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:31,690
enough money and they don't
need the corporate dollar
and that they can actually

873
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,080
start to dismantle or a restructure.

874
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:36,840
Okay,

875
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,990
these corporations,
these corporations are going to kill us.

876
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:45,670
Not Isis, not fuck it. The Russians.

877
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,400
None of this fucking shit.
All right. When I say kill us,

878
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:54,390
I mean no human beings left are
going to be the result of because of

879
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:59,010
corporations. All right, and
what, how they view people,

880
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,570
how they view the environment, how
they view money in their whole idea of,

881
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:08,070
of what is a is worth.
I mean,

882
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:11,950
I know I've just never heard a corporation
ever been like, you know what the, the,

883
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,793
the,

884
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:18,240
the costs to innocent people or the
environment is too high for us to do that.

885
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,111
Maybe they do.

886
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:23,100
It'd be refreshing if you have an article
like that that wasn't actually written

887
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:25,380
by someone from that corporation
that's aligned. All right.

888
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,350
Turn to the read the
English speaking media.

889
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:34,060
You'd never know that bear just paid tens
of millions of dollars to end a three

890
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:39,621
decade long scandal in which the company
sold HIV contaminated blood products to

891
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:44,850
hemophilia x thousands of
whom later died of AIDS.

892
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:50,040
They just killed thousands of
fucking people or admitted to it.

893
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,760
But that doesn't mean they actually
said that they did it. You know,

894
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,070
that fucking legal thing.
Um,

895
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:01,130
ironically bears new hemophilia who feel
your iPhone app got some coverage ads.

896
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:06,090
Did bears hemophilia research grant,
are they covering their tracks?

897
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:08,460
So the University of Florida go gators,

898
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,390
but you have to pick through the French
and Italian news media to find out that

899
00:56:12,391 --> 00:56:15,750
bear is finally writing
checks to people who got aids.

900
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:21,120
I've got HIV that turned into aids
in the 1980s the cutter biological

901
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,310
unit of bear ignored

902
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,720
federal law to recruit

903
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:32,200
prisoners, intravenous
drug users, and high risk.

904
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:35,500
Amen. As donors, all they
ignored that of the blood.

905
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:41,320
Carter then use to make factor eight
and nine the clotting product that

906
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:45,820
hemophilia x need to order,
need in order to not bleed to death.

907
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,790
Oh. So they pulled the Bella check
whether they were like, all right,

908
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,670
you guys are all filming.
Need the team on the sidelines.

909
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,190
You can no longer do that.
And they just ignored it.

910
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,563
MMM.

911
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:58,641
All right.

912
00:56:58,641 --> 00:57:02,750
The German group bear in three other labs
will pay tens of billions of euros to

913
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:04,370
hemophilia.
Ooh.

914
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,630
Accuse them of having sold in the 1980s
blood products contaminated with HIV.

915
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,420
A source close to deal told him.
So did it.

916
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:16,421
Was it that they knew that it had HIV
in it or did they just went to high risk

917
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:17,570
people to get blood?

918
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,550
The figure of tens of billions of euros
and compensation is not totally wrong.

919
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,680
She had a bear in the U S company.

920
00:57:24,681 --> 00:57:27,560
Baxter are the two main
parties to the agreement.

921
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:29,870
She said accompanies folks versus said,
however,

922
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:34,871
the company accepts no responsibility
in this case and continues to insist and

923
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:38,660
it always acted responsibly and ethically.
That's how they get out of it.

924
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,040
It's like, all right, we'll
admit that we did that shit.

925
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:47,690
If you say it wasn't our fault and
that we always behaved above board.

926
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,220
You know what that's like?

927
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:53,810
That's like when they send somebody to
jail and innocent person to jail and then

928
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,820
they're like, all right,
we're going to let you out.

929
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:59,150
But the only way we can let you out as
if you sign this paper saying you won't

930
00:57:59,151 --> 00:58:01,180
sue us because we fucked up.

931
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,433
MMM.

932
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:09,300
Anyways, found the article. I just read
some of it. They're still in business.

933
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:12,780
Sell is still in business. Can't
bring down bear. That's our medicine.

934
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,740
But maybe our food supply.
Nope. Then you got,

935
00:58:16,741 --> 00:58:18,120
I don't know what this
guy's talking about now.

936
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:20,183
MMM.

937
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:25,460
Then you've got Monsanto who can't be
sued because Obama signed that laws saying

938
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:30,410
that you can't soup and Santo now there
were super team corporations are like

939
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:34,100
NBA teams. Huh? You got
room in the chopper for me.

940
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:36,770
Bill just goes all over the place.
All right.

941
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:40,910
And why did Obama sue that sign that,
so that, why did he sign that bill?

942
00:58:40,911 --> 00:58:41,744
Everybody?

943
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:47,410
Is it because he's a Ultibro targe snow
flake or whatever people getting wears a

944
00:58:47,511 --> 00:58:52,511
blue tie or is it because he's grossly
underpaid for his fucking job and is,

945
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:57,900
and I bet those guys
funded is fucking campaign,

946
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:01,490
so then he had to do them a solid,
it's all the same shit.

947
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,270
They all make 500 grand a year and then
come out of office worth hundreds of

948
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:12,470
millions of whatever, fucking
70 80 million bucks. How
does that happen, everybody?

949
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,750
Although recently I saw Bill Clinton when
that fucking piece of shit brought up

950
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:22,410
the me too thing. You know
Monica Lewinsky, I let all,

951
00:59:22,411 --> 00:59:27,080
they tried to make that a me too thing.
You know what I mean?

952
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,440
It's like she was in her twenties
she was a college graduate.

953
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,630
She never learned that she,
she is what I was saying on stage.

954
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:36,050
She never learned that you shouldn't
blow a married guy in his house with his

955
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:38,570
wife and kid down the fucking hall.
She didn't know that.

956
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:43,430
Now she's coming back being influenced
by his power and it was UPI pool people.

957
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:44,330
We get the fuck Outta here.

958
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,480
You are a driven young adults who somehow
in your 20s got a job in the fucking

959
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:53,240
White House. Okay. You weren't some dope.

960
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:57,690
He founded a bus station I near um,

961
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:01,370
some of them Monica Lewinsky thing where
now that she's trying to like turn it

962
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:03,260
around that he used his
power and influence.

963
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:07,730
It's like you are a college graduate
working in the White House. Right.

964
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,660
I don't know. I thought we had dealt
with all of that. All right. I know.

965
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,900
And he got punished for it, but in
that thing he said Clinton was like,

966
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:19,820
I left the White House. I was $16
million in debt. You know what I mean?

967
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:22,850
He's a if that's true. I think he's the
only fucking president ever did that.

968
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,900
Oh Geez. She's, she's getting
ready for nap time. All right.

969
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,420
Um,
big band drumming,

970
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:37,940
tear belt. I'm 17 years old and I
played drums every day. That's awesome.

971
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:42,560
It's my life and I'm in every band,
jazz concert and marching. Good man.

972
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,150
And I play percussion for the
chorus and for the school place.

973
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,000
Kenny Aronoff is my hair.

974
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,030
Well that I was going to say that
sounds like his autobiography. Uh,

975
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,180
how he started out.
Thank you for that dream interview.

976
01:00:56,181 --> 01:01:01,100
I have it on a playlist with music. That's
how much I listened to it. Oh, let's go.

977
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:03,650
I'm glad you liked it.
You know Nia not for nothing.

978
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:07,210
People say actually do a good interview.
Oh yeah.

979
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:12,230
Kenny Aronoff to Danica Patrick
to my lovely wife. You know,

980
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,560
I set you guys up. No, no,

981
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,210
let you guys, you know,
I love it over the plate.

982
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,130
I learned that by going on [inaudible].
That's what he does. He mean Andrew, they,

983
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,380
they just, they just lob
it over to you. All right.

984
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,240
Andy Richter,
my day was telling me about,

985
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:37,870
my dad was telling me about
the scar movement in the
90s I just watched swingers

986
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,880
and discovered this band,
squirrel nut zippers.

987
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:46,340
Oh my God.
It takes you back to your college days.

988
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,830
It's really takes me back to my early
thirties and I was in my late twenties.

989
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,260
It's really different
than anything I've heard.

990
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:56,540
I discovered that I don't like all Scott,

991
01:01:56,541 --> 01:02:01,040
but I like these guys cause it's more
big band. And Scott, I really think you,

992
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,470
uh,
enjoy the drumming.

993
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,640
It's really a cool mix between big Ben
drumming punk in almost some primus type

994
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,520
drumming stuff because of the time work.
Uh,

995
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,260
did you get ever get into any of that?

996
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,990
I remember that big bad voodoo
daddy and that type of stuff.

997
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,740
I liked it a little bit,
but I was a little too old at that point.

998
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:21,450
That was actually kids music to me.
Um,

999
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:26,640
this is what our lovely daughter does.
Before afternoon nap,

1000
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:32,040
she screamed bloody murder.
Um, and then falls asleep.

1001
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:35,490
No one talks to herself when she calms
down and then falls asleep. Anyways,

1002
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:38,880
I doubt this will get read
because it's too nerdy,

1003
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:43,260
but maybe just maybe thanks for
the laughs. Oh, Billy rim shot. Um,

1004
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,430
no, I like all that stuff. I mean,
I liked when Robert Plant was Jesus.

1005
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,170
I liked when Robert Plant did that. The
honeyed represent with Paul Shaffer. Um,

1006
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:56,460
I've always liked big bands and that
type of stuff and I really liked the way

1007
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,970
all of that music is the squirrel
nut zippers and all that.

1008
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:03,150
I just liked the way it was produced.
It sounded really live.

1009
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,410
And um, and also, you know,

1010
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,280
when you get that many people in a
band and they can all play, it's,

1011
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:15,020
it's always sounds great.
So was awesome. Oh,

1012
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,390
big diversity today. He was also in
swingers. Okay. I did not know that. Um,

1013
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:25,650
where Mike and Jon Favreau goes, Oh
yeah. Dancing with Heather Graham.

1014
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,940
Oh yeah, they were, uh, they were great.

1015
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,420
They are great, I should say. Right. What
did they forget how to play? All right.

1016
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,520
Being rude to wait staff.
All right. Hey there.

1017
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:40,530
Billy bath salts.
Your receipt.

1018
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:45,531
Talking about Nia being slightly
rude to wait staff and it made me

1019
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,350
a hit of word got cut off something,
a podcast.

1020
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:54,390
I've heard years back about raising kids.

1021
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,410
Essentially a group of economists gave
their opinions on what you can and can't

1022
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,140
change in children's supported
with studies and evidence.

1023
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:06,630
One person suggests with evidence that
there are only a small number of habits

1024
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:10,440
that kids pick up from their parents.
Those adverts are drinking, alcohol,

1025
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:15,000
smoking and how we treat others,
waitstaff, family, et cetera.

1026
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,580
Well,
those are kind of big things.

1027
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,240
As a former bartender who's dealt
with incredibly rude patrons,

1028
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:24,930
I would love to hear you and Nia debate
if she is actually being rude or not.

1029
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,330
If she feels she's not being rude,

1030
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,290
would she be okay if she saw her daughter
treating a family member the way she

1031
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:35,550
treats waitstaff? Absolutely. She would
love the can't wait to hear her thoughts.

1032
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:39,240
Here's a link to a podcast as a new dad.
I think you'll dig it.

1033
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:43,350
Have a great summer and I hope you
get sunburned. You some of them bitch.

1034
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:46,470
Um,
Nia,

1035
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,220
do you feel as an influencer,

1036
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:55,680
why can't you just influence them to make
better, better service? I am not rude.

1037
01:04:55,681 --> 01:04:58,350
I just,
and something goes wrong.

1038
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:02,670
I just let them know and I'm direct
about it. I'm not like, I'm so sorry.

1039
01:05:02,671 --> 01:05:06,240
I'm so sorry
I don't do that.

1040
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:10,020
Cause what am I apologizing for?
Unlike no out of this.

1041
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,350
Can you change it? Thank you.
That's it. What do I had to,

1042
01:05:15,351 --> 01:05:16,110
I had to do with like,

1043
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,940
do you want me to fucking blow the
waiter because he did something wrong?

1044
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:21,490
Like he's blowing me.
No,

1045
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,010
I'm just saying control
a little sugar on it.

1046
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:28,410
In the end I feel like I'm
very sugary. I'm not, no,

1047
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,660
don't take it badly right now. Like, no,

1048
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:36,220
it's quite that you did one
time it was cold and you said,

1049
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,550
can you have them go back and heat to
Stephanie's? You, Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1050
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:41,650
You and you like, yeah.
Cause it's like, yeah.

1051
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,460
As they went to take it away
and I was just like, Jesus.

1052
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:47,550
You remember everybody was at the
table like God to have Nia? No.

1053
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,490
Everybody who was everybody
at the table was, I got Dan.

1054
01:05:50,491 --> 01:05:54,400
Dan would have been family.
No, that didn't happen. Nope,

1055
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,100
I don't mean, yeah, I don't remember
it. So maybe it did happen, but like,

1056
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,890
I don't remember it. Maybe it
did happen. That was hilarious.

1057
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:11,260
What the fuck was that? That didn't
happen. I don't remember that.

1058
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,700
Yeah. Maybe it did happen.
I don't recall ever being,

1059
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:20,080
behaving in such a manner that it
would be like, so was so freaked out.

1060
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:23,060
You're adorable. And
even when you lied. Um,

1061
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:25,590
okay.

1062
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,130
Yeah. Um, I, I go the other way.

1063
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:32,131
I'm too nice and we'll eat fucking
whatever the fuck they send me.

1064
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,960
You don't see you when they
send me the wrong thing,

1065
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:38,230
I still eat it because I don't want,
because I don't want them to throw it out.

1066
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,090
Oh, who's this? I'm going to throw it out.

1067
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,590
They might put it to the side and maybe
somebody lunch and the kitchen later on.

1068
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,910
Oh No.
Yeah.

1069
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:50,230
You're telling me if somebody brought a
plate of food out into public and they

1070
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:52,400
said that's not what I wanted and
brought it back, he'd be like, oh,

1071
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:54,820
fucking eat it. Somebody might, well,

1072
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,550
how do you know they haven't put their
fucking mouth on? It was like, oh,

1073
01:06:57,551 --> 01:07:01,000
this isn't Ravioli. This is French
toast. I thought it looked weird.

1074
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,780
And then you go over there and
you get the old breakfast. Herpes.

1075
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,270
Um, all right. That's the podcast.

1076
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:16,030
I get to find out why my lovely little
boob bears a crying downstairs. Oh,

1077
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,770
she's phones. Oh, shoot. In the bedroom.

1078
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:19,143
Yeah.

1079
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,560
Okay. All right. Well I gotta get
off my day here of what? To Lamont.

1080
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,850
She on the belly on.
