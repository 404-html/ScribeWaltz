1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,010
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,563
Um,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,740
October 21st,
2013.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,440
How you're fucking doing. Why is
this such an echo in here? Hi.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,560
Um,
I'm in a hotel room.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,310
A splash fully furnished hotel room here.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,310
That's why it's echoing a little
bit and it'll good. You know what?

8
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:33,240
This will help my awful singing,
you know? Oh, you'll know.

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,680
Dasher and dancer and Prancer and vixen.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,440
Um, how are you? How was your weekend?
As you could tell him a little banged up,

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,440
a little banged up. Didn't get a lot
of sleep last night. You know what?

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,550
I've been in the phone

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,320
fog last 10 days. I was kidding.
Who lasts like 10 weeks.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,770
I've been on the road.
I would work my ass off and a dad,

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,270
daddy's been taking his
medicine every night. And uh,
you know what? I'm in a fog.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,480
I need to, I need to, uh, you know,

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,700
I need to turn over a new leaf here.
I got to become like that dude.

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,450
Remember those grape nup commercials?
We'd be outside and his fucking bathrobe,

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,740
you know,

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
one leg up on the fucking wouldn't see
couple of squirrels running around the

21
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,110
background. Some birds tweeting
and he's just eaten as grape nuts.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
All clearheaded.
Right.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,520
That's why I need to be all right.
I got to quit.

24
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,500
I sound like shit. Getting over a cold.
I'm a message this week everybody.

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,210
You know what, this should make you
feel better about yourself. You know,

26
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,650
we I at least I didn't uh,

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,060
didn't fucking Bay the way Ya
Bill Bandwagon did this weekend.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,470
You guys have been
following me on Twitter.

29
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,540
That's my new character Bill Bandwagon.

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,310
I was joking on Twitter that the Boston
red sox signed the first free agent fan

31
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:01,620
to a three week contract. We'll
bandwagon and that is make an I am him.

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,010
Bill Bandwagon does what
bill bandwagon dough.

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,660
I will actually went over to the red sox
pro shop here in Boston and I went over

34
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:10,600
to it.
Um,

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,360
okay.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,850
Well during the, whenever the fuck we were
playing Detroit this past weekend, uh,

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,230
I walked into the pro shop and I
literally, I got sick to my stomach.

38
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,760
How weird is that?
Cause I bought so much red sox shit

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,540
right up during the whole height of that
curse to the babe shit trying to end

40
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:33,160
that fucking 86 year drought.
I have more red sox shit then.

41
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,290
I don't think I'll ever
have to buy any more.

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,800
I mean if they win the championship, I'm
guessing. I'm definitely gonna buy a hat.

43
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,970
I L I like getting the world series
patch, but that, that that's about it.

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,860
Maybe a shot glass. Your shot Mike
yet. But as far as jerseys, dude,

45
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:52,770
I got d I still in mind the back of my
closet. I have Derek Lowe tee shirt,

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,420
Manny, Manny, Ramirez
Jersey. No Ma fucking jersey.

47
00:02:59,470 --> 00:02:59,720
Okay.

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,080
Somebody

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,910
got me a jersey.
That was like the old school red sox won.

50
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:06,110
It just said Papi on the front of it.
Like I'm ever going to fucking wear that,

51
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,960
but I can't throw it out,
you know.

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,400
So the last thing I fucking need to do
is go into a store and get more of that

53
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,180
shit that, that is going to become
sentimental and then I can't throw it out.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,860
So,
uh,

55
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,950
I went by there again today to see if
they had the world series patches and they

56
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:26,660
don't, I guess they get them
tomorrow. Some shit, I don't
fucking know. So anyways,

57
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,070
congratulations to the Boston red sox.
I can actually name a few now.

58
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,440
Go around the infield a little bit.

59
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,470
Was In Middlebrooks over to drove over
to Petrolia and I don't know who plays

60
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:42,470
first base.
Is it Napoli or was he out of left field?

61
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,980
I don't fucking know. Salting, Yamaka.

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,030
And then there's those two Asian guys
who would just fucking killing him.

63
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,120
I can't remember the guy's name. It begins
with a u and he's fucking lights out.

64
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:59,680
But [inaudible] it's so sad that I haven't
watched this year and I have to sit

65
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,080
here like a housewife who's been doing,

66
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,340
doing needlepoint all year and
acting like I get it. I don't get it.

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,990
I don't know what's going on. I've been
here in Boston the last five days and uh,

68
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,440
I'm actually reading the sports page in
this hell fucking nuts and spices like

69
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,740
Dan Shaughnessy, like three days in
a row wrote a positive, a article.

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,120
It's incredible. But whatever.
Let's just get down to brass tacks.

71
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:25,360
You the red sox won the world series.
Unbelievable fucking series.

72
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,380
We had to win game six. I just said we,
I know I did. I'm a fucking hypocrite.

73
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,840
They had to win game
six because they would,

74
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,780
there's no way there'll be in Berlin
to twice, so thank God they did.

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,440
And thank God that guy hit that Grand
Slam and he punched himself from the

76
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,800
checks just right. Like that
chick was sins. Sings the, uh,

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,840
the titanic song, right? Oh wait,

78
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:50,840
that's Whitney Houston. Well,
what was the titanic song?

79
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,333
Ugh.

80
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,410
I was just a song that
made you hate women.

81
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,570
You know, you have a do that. You
just really, I don't know if women,

82
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,760
if you ever do,
did you,

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,830
is there a song that comes on
that just makes you hate guys?

84
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,070
Yeah.

85
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,960
Eh,
a bunch of fucking meathead had guys,

86
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,220
bunch of peanuts around the
peanut shells around their feet,

87
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,650
sitting there screaming and yelling,
right?

88
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,220
Standing over there in the corner
with his shit. Stain draws,

89
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:28,910
drinking beers like it. This has to
be a fucking song like that for me.

90
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,230
The male version.

91
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,570
It was whatever that titanic song was
and that stupid mere cat that sang the

92
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:38,630
fucking thing and she'd punch
yourself in her little hollow chest.

93
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,440
Oh God,
the fuck was her name.

94
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,650
And then she dated and she'd married
that landscaped fucking coke dealer slash

95
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:52,250
maybe did some porn at some point
in his life directed at anyways,

96
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,440
that Boogie nights looking guy had
one of those really fucking, uh,

97
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,990
a feminist French names like Renee

98
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,150
or Susan or some shit,

99
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,073
right?

100
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,880
Jackie, whatever the fuck his
name was. Jesus am I a mood?

101
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,650
Listen to me trashing
that, that fucking, uh,

102
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,120
the female George Saint
Pierre of Canada right there.

103
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:24,140
Basically on the same level.
One can choke you out.

104
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,980
The other one, uh, chokes you
up. There you go. Look at that.

105
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:31,080
That was poetry right there.
I'm summing up Canada. Everybody

106
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,530
know Gigi. Um, anyways,

107
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,990
I found a sick Gab la when I was here in
Boston. I got to lay off that shit, dude.

108
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:47,130
I swear to God, I look phenomenal for
my age, but if I live another week,

109
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:50,700
the way I've been living the
last six weeks, all right,

110
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm going to catch up to it.

111
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,850
What Ron Howard looks like and I'm
going to go right by him, you know,

112
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,450
and that's no disrespect to Ron. Okay.
That guy's like in his sixties, isn't he?

113
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,800
Or is he in his fifties? I
don't fucking know. Whatever.

114
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,630
This is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody,

115
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:10,800
the Boston Red Sox are in the world
series against the St Louis Shit,

116
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:15,030
birds and a red bird. Sorry. Why?
Why would you start with them?

117
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,890
They're very nice fence. Very nice fans
out there in the home of Anheuser Busch.

118
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,740
Um,
and I got to tell you something right now.

119
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:25,800
I cannot name one person on their team.

120
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,390
He says the most baseball I've watched
since I stopped watching in 2010.

121
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,530
I don't know anybody on that fucking team
who's pitching for, he had John Today.

122
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,390
Who Do you got over there?
Huh?

123
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,080
Did that guy who finally
shaved his fucking head? No.
Wait, you traded him to, uh,

124
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,140
the angels and then from
what I've overheard,

125
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:50,730
he's been shitting the bed out there.
What the fuck is his name? I Dunno.

126
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,670
I don't fucking know. But
you know, I'm going to watch,

127
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,660
you know what's the hardest thing about
trying to fucking watch the red sox and

128
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:01,230
get all caught up is they all look
alike. What? Those fucking beards?

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,930
There's like three of them.
They look,

130
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,800
they're the exact same
length and color beard.

131
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,520
And then there's the backup catcher or
whatever, but he's got the gray in it.

132
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,850
I don't, I don't fucking know. I
don't pretend to know. All right,

133
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,090
but if you think I'm not going to
be standing there on the child's,

134
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:21,570
is the duck boats go by like
I've been there all fucking year.

135
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,980
You're sadly mistaken. Yes you
are. All right, let's get out.

136
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:28,650
Let's get out of the hole.
A sports thing.

137
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,610
This is a story than tricked me.
Did you guys,

138
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,100
did you such a hate that fucking word?
I saw it and I was intrigued.

139
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:38,911
You know,

140
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,960
like the whole world should be rejoicing
that you're fucking fascinated.

141
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,780
Just say sparked your interest,
you were intrigued. Uh,

142
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,990
what a self serve and fucking word that
is. That's a deal breaker right there.

143
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,830
If you're ever on a date and somebody
uses that word on a first date,

144
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,400
unless you're a fucking Douche
and you want an, you know,

145
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,180
maybe cancel out your douchey
penis, you know, like two negatives,

146
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,030
make a positive and maybe a baby
will come out and be a good shit.

147
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,470
I'm telling you right now, steer clear
of anybody ever uses the word intrigued,

148
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,500
you know,
as if they're artsy.

149
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,860
Fucking glasses didn't give
themselves away to begin with.

150
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,960
The second that word comes
out of their mouth, you know,

151
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,390
and if you can't do the math on
that, I can't fucking help. Um,

152
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,700
here's a story that
just piqued my interest.

153
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,120
If you guys seen this shit
about the Greenpeace 30,

154
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,590
basically 28 Greenpeace guys,
ladies,

155
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,800
whenever the fuck you call
them greenpeacers and two
journalists for some stupid

156
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:48,540
fucking reason, they
decide. They just decide,

157
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:49,950
okay,

158
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,450
out of the fucking blue to go over,

159
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,030
up into the Arctic circle.
All right.

160
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,420
And basic. What the F I gotta I gotta
say this right. Basically what they did,

161
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:06,300
they tried to board,
okay.

162
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:10,290
More than a month ago after Russian coast
guards seized 28 Greenpeace activist

163
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,400
and two journals,

164
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,490
journalists in the Arctic waters following
their attempt to board a Russian oil

165
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,640
rig. These guys got,
these guys had a meeting.

166
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
These 28 people had a fucking meeting
and they were like, all right,

167
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,970
here's the plan to help
save the environment.

168
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,050
Or at the very least try to slow down
the changing of the environment because

169
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,100
there's always going to be an environment,
you know,

170
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,710
taking one from George Carlin there.

171
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,160
They'll will always be in an
environment which just changing.

172
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:44,910
So they don't like the direction
that some of the other human beings,

173
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,460
the effects they have. And I want to
say decide that they can, I don't know,

174
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,530
try and stop these guys from drilling

175
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,410
in this area that Greenpeace feels
they shouldn't be drilling it.

176
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,380
So this sitting there in the war room
drawing up these plans. All right.

177
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:05,990
And I'm just picturing myself
in this fucking meeting cause I,

178
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:09,320
I don't have a problem with Greenpeace.
It out.

179
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,010
Looks like a very thrilling job.

180
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,220
Sit this zig zag and in front of a
fucking whaling ship, wind in your hair.

181
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,120
You know people from other
lands shaking their fist at you.

182
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,390
That sounds like a hell of a fight.

183
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:27,140
It sounds way better than tying
yourself to a tree going, come on, man.

184
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,270
You know, it just seems like,
you know, it's a good time.

185
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,580
So if I ever a green peace,

186
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:39,880
I could see myself getting sucked into
a position where I'm in that meeting.

187
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,900
All right,
so now you're in the fucking meeting.

188
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,150
Somebody up there who God knows who man
or a woman is up. They're gone. All right,

189
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:51,880
so we're going to go up to the Arctic
circle right there. I'm like, all right,

190
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,130
that's going to be fucking cold.
What is it?

191
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,210
It's October the fucking planet starting
to tilt away from the sun up there.

192
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:01,780
I don't know about this.
Are we going up there on an ice breaker?

193
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,600
Um, that's my first concern. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah.

194
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,920
And now we're going to go fuck with
the Russians. Whoa. Right there.

195
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:13,360
I'm looking around the room.
Then you just say,

196
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:16,120
[inaudible] am I going to fuck with the,
my whole life was a childhood.

197
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,860
Those were the guys you didn't
want to fuck with. You know what?

198
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,740
Fuck the Russians.
You know?

199
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,910
This isn't like you're going to go over
there and you're going to go mess with

200
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,960
the, I dunno, fictional buddy.

201
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,010
The Estonians.
Who the fuck knows anything about Estonia?

202
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:37,180
I don't stone here. What are they
doing over there? They eat people.

203
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,000
They don't eat people off. Fuck it.
Let's go over this. Go mess with him.

204
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,620
The second you say Russians, I'm
like, wait a minute. What is this?

205
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,330
And then they get to the fucking point.
Yeah.

206
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,340
Then we're going to
pull up to the oil rig.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,480
We're going to shoot some ropes up it
like we're in an action movie and we're

208
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:57,400
going to start climbing up the side of
it and we're going to board their oil rig

209
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,890
right there. I'm out. I'm
not fucking doing that shit.

210
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,410
You outta your mind.
We're going to get shot.

211
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,410
So many is going to take a fucking meat
cleaver, right as we get up to the top.

212
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm going to pour hot water.
A fucking oil on us.

213
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,010
Yeah.

214
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,530
So anyways,

215
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,870
these fucking jerk offs get on this
goddamn boat and then two journalists go

216
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:22,270
with them to cover it

217
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,700
and they fucking nature they take go out
there and what exactly what you would

218
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:29,251
have thought.

219
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:34,251
What happened happened plus fucking
like Russian navy seal looking guys with

220
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:39,030
these fucking awesome guns
pointed at these, these people,

221
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,590
they arrested all of them. They took
their boat and the two journalists,

222
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,370
the Greenpeace guys are saying that the
fucking boat was in international waters.

223
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,370
Gives a fuck. You're at the top of
the planet. There's no straight sex.

224
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,220
Yeah. What are you looking at?
You a little fucking watch. Oh,

225
00:13:57,221 --> 00:14:00,250
we're on this longitude, this
latitude. Nobody gives a fuck.

226
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:04,960
You just tried to board our oil
rig. All bets are off. So anyways,

227
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,040
they all got arrested in,

228
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,400
they're being charged with piracy
and they're beside themselves.

229
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,070
They're just saying, yeah, the
Russians just don't seem to understand.

230
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:16,900
And it's like, no, no, no, no. You
don't understand. You fucking morons.

231
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,430
You don't,
you don't do shit like that.

232
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,280
Yeah.

233
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Find my neighbor was planting some ugly
bushes and his yard and I wanted to

234
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:30,800
protest. I wouldn't try to fucking repel
into his living room. And then when they,

235
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,880
they arrest me for fucking
breaking and entering,

236
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,640
I wouldn't be all what? Playing the
victim being like, dude, what the fuck?

237
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,660
What are you talking about that
was protesting your, your shrubs.

238
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,940
You just don't seem to
see it to app to see,

239
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:46,780
I have the same sense of humor
about this that I do. So, uh,

240
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,453
okay.

241
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,190
Yeah. So I, I dunno, like
everybody's feeling like

242
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,020
talking about this.
Like they're the victims.

243
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,860
It says the organizer,
the organizer,

244
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,600
the organization's UK executive director
has worked every weekend since the

245
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:06,470
incident in the Pecora. See, while Lee, I
hope I said that right, the [inaudible],

246
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,670
the [inaudible] to see while leading
efforts to secure their release,

247
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,550
but it's still finding
it difficult to sleep.

248
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,690
He's in a constant rush or interview,
blah, blah, blah. I said Russia,

249
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,780
he said Russia is sending out a clear
signals saying hands off are part of the

250
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:26,440
Arctic and hands off complaining about
our right to drill for oil there.

251
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,900
I think the same,
something a little more than that.

252
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,560
Don't fucking show up to an oil rig.
Like, like you got Tom Cruise on the boat.

253
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,410
You get to do some mission
impossible shit. This is the
real world. Jesus Christ.

254
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,370
You guys know how dumb I am,
right?

255
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,650
I know not to go out on a fucking boat.
Hey,

256
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:50,090
try and board a Russian oil rig.

257
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,193
You know,

258
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,630
we'd just be like that guy
and platoon the whole time.

259
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:59,790
I got a bad feeling about this man

260
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,260
sweet going out there listening to the
Mamas and the Papas, some hippy shit.

261
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:07,560
All right.

262
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,240
The leaves are Brown. Ah, the sky is gray

263
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,180
and these fucking guys started
screaming at you in Russian.

264
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:19,910
Yeah.

265
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,980
Do the guns.
They had pointed at him with a shit.

266
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,180
I got to tell you that right now. I
think that was the, uh, the game over,

267
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,160
I think it was called the game over 9,000.

268
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,190
That's what the fuck they
were pointing at him. So, uh,

269
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,630
you know, what are you going
to do? There's a lot of
dumb ways to go to prison,

270
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:38,030
but a, that I got to say that's
that. That's right up there.

271
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,590
How awful is it to get
arrested for piracy?

272
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,370
And you didn't even fucking take
the time to dress up like one. Yeah.

273
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,323
You know,

274
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,470
the only saving grace I'd be looking at,

275
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:53,620
the only way I'm going on this mission
is if I get that fucking hamburglar

276
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:54,490
striped shirt.

277
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,050
Put a patch over my eye and some
sorta cutlass and my fucking mouth.

278
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,560
Is that a knife? Is that a gun? I
don't fucking know. What do you,

279
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,130
what he called it? One
of those, one of those.

280
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,390
It's not a sword to fat or it's like
a meat cleaver that got an erection.

281
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,880
Stick that right in your fucking mouth.
It's very phallic.

282
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,740
And then you climb up to Saigon.
Ire, ire. If I can. Hey Chef,

283
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,500
really any arctic Mekhi um,

284
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,130
but instead you fucking climbing
up the side. One, two, three.

285
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,110
We don't want you Julian for oil. Okay.
All right. Easy guys. Hands up everybody.

286
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:31,800
Jesus heard they're
serious. Um, all right,

287
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,890
let's get to some advertising here for
this week. The Greenpeace 30 everybody.

288
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,480
Let's try to keep up on that one. Can
you believe it? Who would have thought?

289
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,780
Who would have thought you couldn't
fucking just pull up to an oil rig,

290
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,120
all the fucking ocean, dude,
you couldn't do that to Exxon.

291
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,580
The very least someones gonna pee on
you as you're climbing up the side.

292
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,440
Somebody far enough from the ocean.
So you might even take his shit.

293
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,730
I don't think cell phone cameras work out
there because of the Bermuda triangle.

294
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,170
Dollar Shave Club. Everybody. Oh yeah.

295
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,020
I talk about this every damn week.
Um,

296
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,420
there's so many things in
the world that irritate me.

297
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:17,421
Hippies boarding a Russian oil rig and
getting charged for piracy and then

298
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,250
sitting there staring at their Bergen
stock, shaking their head going,

299
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,130
I don't understand.

300
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,510
Do you like how much I'm stereotyping
them that they're like this.

301
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:29,250
I'm sure they're hippies. Two Point
Oh whatever. What else bothers me? Um,

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,290
the red sox beards. I can't tell one
from the other that's been bugging me.

303
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,940
And um, I went to my, my,

304
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,090
the way I've been living my life lately,
very unhealthy. That's been bugging me.

305
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,820
But listen to that with all that things
with so many things out there that can

306
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:49,650
irritate you. Why would you add razors
to the list? You fucking moron. Come on.

307
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,920
Do the math here. It's time to
stop milking your razor blade.

308
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,040
I know with brand name razors,
you know what you used to.

309
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,250
You used to pay an outrageous prices
and exhausting those raises until they

310
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:02,700
start to look like a rusty soda can and
should drag it across your face there.

311
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,020
It's time to move on.

312
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,310
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing
quality blades to your door for just a few

313
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,800

316
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,860
They also have a new product
called one wipe Charlies.

317
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,860
It's about white from men
and you know what I say?

318
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,240
It's about time and it's
classy. Oh, is it class? He is.

Plus everybody you know last
the last couple of weeks.

325
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:51,090
I keep saying that they have breaking
bad on there and you know what?

326
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:52,080
Evidently they don't.

327
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,580
So why don't I actually go to the frigging
website and try and look it up here.

328
00:19:56,581 --> 00:20:01,130
Let's see what they got going on here.
When you first try one week free.

329
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,230
Jesus Christ, help me out here. How
am I supposed to figure this out?

330
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:08,880
Go fuck yourself with everybody
trying to get you information. Um,

331
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,830
you know I tried to rent a bicycle
here in Boston. Yeah, I did that.

332
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,600
I did that. I was going to ride
a bike and I felt good about it.

333
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,720
And you guys can say anything
you want about me. I don't care.

334
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I like riding bicycles and cities and
when I ride on my like go and Cerullo La

335
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,100
is, I go by pedestrians waiting
through a waiting to cross the street.

336
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,070
It makes me smile. So anyways,
they have these, you know,

337
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:39,660
that they have in New York City,
you know those city bikes,

338
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,430
unless you're in a rich neighborhood
and they don't want bicycles in the

339
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:45,300
neighborhood,
it's,

340
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:48,070
you know what's so amazing about
rich people is just how much they

341
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,600
just don't want to be around other
people. And you know, I, I 100% get it.

342
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,240
I fucking respect that. The Fuck
Outta here. Your animals. All right.

343
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,400
Do you think I stole all his fucking money
to listen to you getting on and off a

344
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:07,480
bicycle? Get the fuck Outta
here. You're a piece of shit.

345
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,670
And I took your 401k right.
Anyways, Hulu plus everybody.

346
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,680
No, Kim. So I um, look, get back to that
in a second. So I got a rent this bicycle.

347
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,710
Okay.

348
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,500
So I'm like, all right,
what's, what's the deal?

349
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,330
I got stick my credit card and the
bike thing, so I go ahead and do it.

350
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,300
And uh, then all of a sudden
they want my phone number.

351
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,380
Yeah,

352
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,000
they want my phone number.
I'm just riding a bike.

353
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:34,420
You already have my name and my credit
card number. You know who took the bike?

354
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,880
What do you need?
My phone number four.

355
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,070
Okay.

356
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,840
You know who I am. You know when I took
it, you know I didn't bring it back.

357
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,303
Okay.

358
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,260
Okay.

359
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,380
You have my credit card that's going
to link it to where the fuck I live in.

360
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:50,600
That's it. It's over. I got, I
got to give you the bike back.

361
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,630
Why do you want my fucking credit?
I my phone number.

362
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,380
Fucking conch.
They just can't make it.

363
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,450
It's not enough to make
some money off the bike.

364
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,150
Now they've got to get one more
piece of information out of you.

365
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,020
So then they can then stockpile all
those numbers with your credit card

366
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:08,950
information and then sell them
to the fucking tell him McKinnis.

367
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,550
So I said, you know what? Fuck you
bicycle. I'm not bicycle company.

368
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:16,880
I'm not using it, so fuck them. I don't
know if they do that in New York City,

369
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:20,210
but I'm not renting a
bike. And uh, in Boston,

370
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,090
don't give him your phone number.
You asshole.

371
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,280
I wonder if I could have just made up one.

372
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,780
Okay.

373
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,310
I'm really big on misinformation.
You know when you can get away with it.

374
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:34,850
Always put out other information about
yourself. Give yourself a chance.

375
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,800
All right,
Hulu plus everybody.

376
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,640

could do something like that.

383
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:02,420

programming that a Hulu originals,

388

so back to the fucking podcast.

401
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,910
A European trip is coming
up. Everybody. Rumor has it,

402
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,710
rumor has it,
my agent was talking to me.

403
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:17,060
I think we're going to add not as
second but a third show in London.

404
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,980
And uh, for all you people have been
sending me emails from Manchester, um,

405
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,740
England, uh, don't worry, I'm not,

406
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:28,340
I don't have time this time to do
it in the schedule cause I have to,

407
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,120
I think I go to Scotland the next day,
but without a doubt,

408
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,760
I promise you when it comes through
next year, I am going to go,

409
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:37,490
I'm going to do a show in
Manchester. I just a, you know,

410
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,890
it's a fucking zillion miles.
It's an ocean away.

411
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,840
I didn't know how it was
going to sell tickets,

412
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:45,410
so you always go to the
major cities and um,

413
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,170
I've just gotten a bunch of people saying,
calling me a cunt,

414
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,930
telling me to come to Manchester and
you know, that's all I need to hear.

415
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,860
That's all I need to hear. A little bit
of interest, a little bit of insults.

416
00:24:56,861 --> 00:25:00,170
And I'm like, I like these guys. I'm
going to go fucking head up there. Um,

417
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,480
now I'm,
now forgive me for being stupid,

418
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,270
but Manchester is that where man
United is from? It's gotta be right.

419
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,550
That's crazy. To me, you
would think that the,

420
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,500
the most successful a premier
league team would be in London.

421
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,230
Does that make sense? Rather
than being in the worster of, uh,

422
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,030
of England,
I'm really,

423
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,810
I'm really fucking on two levels
stepping on a landmine here.

424
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:31,020
I'm talking sports when I don't even
know what the fuck I'm talking about and

425
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:32,820
I'm shitting on cities and I have no idea.

426
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,190
Okay.

427
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,370
Yeah.
Jesus Manchester,

428
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,890
is that one of those train spotting
towns where I'm gonna go there and get

429
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:39,750
fucking headbutted and
have my ear bit off.

430
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,350
I really don't want to deal with that.
That's why I feel safe in London.

431
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,480
I just feel like it's a bunch of people
skipping around drinking tea and a,

432
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,940
I'm not going to get beat down.
You know, that's not on my agenda.

433
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,140
Taken up soccer hooligan,
fucking beat down.

434
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,640
I'll tell you,
a long time ago,

435
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,540
I read that book among the thugs and uh,

436
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm sure it was exaggerated or even worse.
Maybe it wasn't.

437
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,580
Maybe they toned it down, but uh, yeah,

438
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:14,370
that was enough for me. That was
enough for me. All right. Anyways,

439
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,690
I'm just fucking with you guys. I
will, I'll definitely, um, you know,

440
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,380
the more cities I can have one ad when
I go over there and the more shit I can

441
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:26,400
see, the more people I can reach. Each
time I go over to, to, uh, Europe,

442
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,100
I'm just going to keep adding countries
and cities and that type of thing.

443
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:33,060
That's the game plan and a, I'm
sticking to it. Oh, by the way,

444
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:37,350
you guys all talked me out of
going to Naples. Jesus Christ.

445
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,370
I might as well set. I was
going to fucking Dayton, Ohio.

446
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,460
I've never heard a city get trashed.
Trashed.

447
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,080
Fucking voice is cracking here
the way Naples did. Okay. Enough,

448
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,200
enough said. Enough
said. I got it. I got it.

449
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,240
So I think I'm going to
stay in Rome and then Kinda,

450
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,390
I think Florence got some good reviews.

451
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:01,080
Venice got some good reviews and having
really should do is look at dirty water.

452
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,660
I got to go somewhere.
Hey,

453
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,670
does anybody know a good book on
Mussolini? Can recommend a good one.

454
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,390
I've just read so much shit about that
guy. He reminds me of Paul Versey,

455
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,880
you know,
they both have a shaved head.

456
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,600
They both think they see things and they
both predict shit and they prepare for

457
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:26,020
victory and then they lose.
Um,

458
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:31,510
and it's it Benito Versie,
Paul Mussolini.

459
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,790
I told you that day when he fucking Ivy,

460
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:38,470
he was either invading someplace in
northern Africa or he was going in Greece

461
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,290
and Hitler told them, don't
do that shit. All right.

462
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,523
Yeah.

463
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,210
And, and mousseline he's like, yeah, I
don't why we got this. It's all good.

464
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,990
He goes out and he buys a white
horse to ride through town,

465
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,500
getting ready for the victory
party and then they lost

466
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,090
it. He's got that big dumb horse. He's
got nothing to do. What are you toe?

467
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,350
He's already though. It's going
to be a bloodbath. I got it.

468
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,840
So I want to read more about this guy.
Um,

469
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,910
he sounds like quite the character.
Speaking of characters,

470
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,580
um, there's a fucking
hilarious, hilarious video.

471
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,080
Only because it's all,

472
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:23,950
it seems like they're just
everybody's drunk and lethargic. Uh,

473
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,460
the name of the video is jet Fan Punches,

474
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,230
female patriots fan in the
face after their victory.

475
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,410
Congratulations to the green
country, by the way. Um,

476
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,350
that is your Superbowl and you know it is,
you're not winning it again this year.

477
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:42,040
You guys realize you're coming up on
your 50th anniversary of not winning a

478
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:46,780
super bowl, like the, your golden
anniversary. You know, and they,

479
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:48,490
and they said it wouldn't last.

480
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,550
Congratulations when you
guys don't win it this year.

481
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,570
This is me just pissed
because you guys won. Um, no.

482
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,130
You guys jumping around like you did
something yesterday. Ah, you wait,

483
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:04,750
you wait til we come back healthy.
You fucks. Um, and that was an excuse.

484
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,471
And you know what?

485
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:09,310
When you're losing the number one
fucking defensive player on all levels,

486
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:13,870
Vince Wilfork fucking
Mayo and a key to leap.

487
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,830
I gotta tell you, Geno Smith, dude, that
fucking guy, he bet again, a nickname.

488
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,490
You Dumb New Yorkers after
you've fucking said San Shies.

489
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,490
Can you give one to
Jane? Oh, you know what?

490
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:28,460
Don't don't jinx the guy because that
guy looks like he's the real deal. Man,

491
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:30,320
I really liked that guy as a quarterback,

492
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:33,830
Matt and I don't give a fuck man patriots
on winning shit this year anyways.

493
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,280
You know, I don't mean that in a
bad way, but I'm a realist. Okay.

494
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,680
I'm still enjoying the season
fucking cons. Um, anyway,

495
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:43,810
so it's at the end of the game.

496
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,090
And so the name of the video is like
basically mail, jet fan punches,

497
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:51,010
female Patriot's fan in face.

498
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,250
What it really should have
said was mail jet Fan Punches,

499
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:59,251
female patriots fan in the face after
female Patriot's fan was punching him in

500
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,770
the face for some reason.
You know,

501
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,900
because you're not supposed
to hit a woman in the face.

502
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,550
Whenever they show these videos,
they GE the cutout,

503
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,600
that part of the video or they show it
and the people on TV never commentate on

504
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:17,380
the fact that the woman was
punching this guy in the face.

505
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,590
Dude, you gotta see this jets
fan. It's fucking hilarious.

506
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:24,880
He's so shit faced and like lethargic.
That's the thing,

507
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:26,820
because everything is
just sorta like in slowly

508
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,250
motion round house. And uh, he
takes a lot of punishment, buddy.

509
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,200
He never, uh, he never loses focus.
I call them the big unflappable.

510
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,040
If you watch them, you know, Tim
Duncan is the big fundamental,

511
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,250
this drunk jet fan was,
was the big unflappable.

512
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,550
And I gotta tell you that female pats fan,

513
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,550
she took that punch like a
chip pop right back up. Um,

514
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,580
I don't know what was going on,
but that jet fan,

515
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:53,630
I don't know if he did something.

516
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,000
It starts right there at
the beginning of the video

517
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,920
does something and then it looks like
two ladies and some fat guy in a blue

518
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:02,760
shirt.

519
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,060
I'll kind of swinging on him and he's
just like in slow motion like girl put a

520
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,320
but button, just punching people
in the face. And uh, I dunno,

521
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,370
he obviously shouldn't have done it
and deserves to be punished. But uh,

522
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,300
this is something I think that I've asked
before of a female fans on this. Yeah.

523
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,220
Gas, if I have any. Um,
how do you feel about that?

524
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,490
Obviously you should never
punch a woman in the face,

525
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,120
but no. You know what? Fuck this.
Let me ask a better question.

526
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,180
Any women listen to this podcast?

527
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:38,660
Have you ever just gotten mad at a guy
in a bar and just started punching him in

528
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:42,470
the face and when you're doing
that are punching him in the head.

529
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,550
When you're doing that,

530
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,510
is there any fear that the
guy's going to hit you back?

531
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,800
Are you literally thinking like, well, you
can't eat, I'm a lady, you can't hit me,

532
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm in the safety zone.

533
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,960
Or are you just simply so mad you lost
your shit and you just throwing punches?

534
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,860
Because, um, like I said,

535
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:02,960
I don't think that that jet fan
should had done what he did,

536
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:03,860
what he should've done.

537
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,400
What a gentleman does when a woman is
punching him in the face is you go with,

538
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,480
you go with the front
kick at like 30% speed.

539
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,430
You go with the front kick, 30%
power. That's what you do. It's so,

540
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,440
it's not quite a kick. It's sort of
just pushing her off. You, you know,

541
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:27,680
you just sorta,
you just kind of give one of those,

542
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,720
keeps her at bay leg is
longer than the arm, you know,

543
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,750
but then there's that thing where you
got to do it fast enough because the

544
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:38,840
second you do it, you know, some guys
are going to come in and totally,

545
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,730
because you actually made physical contact
with this human being that does not

546
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:47,540
have a penis, has a vagina yet is
throwing punches at you. It's really,

547
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:51,650
it's a really weird dynamic. But, uh,

548
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,100
I gotta tell you the big unflappable.
He did all right.

549
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,110
He's got it. He's got to wear a
jets jersey. He's got something.

550
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,010
You guys got to pull some money together
after you bail them out and you got to

551
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:06,400
get him a jets Jersey and on the back
he got to have the big unflappable.

552
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,430
Um, I dunno some he's probably going to
get mad at. There is no excuse whatsoever.

553
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:16,420
I'm not saying there is

554
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,010
okay,

555
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,260
but I just, I dunno. I find that,

556
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:24,940
that that dynamic is interesting.
Um,

557
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,713
I dunno,

558
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,840
I heard a great guy fucking bomb the
other day just walking down the street.

559
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,010
Just the way he was begging was great.

560
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,730
He had some sort of musical background
and you went, you walked by him,

561
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:42,870
he had his great voice and
you just go, James, James, j,

562
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:47,430
j j change.
I can't even do it the way it did.

563
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:51,040
It put a smile on your face.
He just went right down the scale.

564
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,540
I didn't have any money. I only
had fucking ATM money, you know,

565
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:57,270
so you got like a couple of twenties in
your pocket and he's like, all right,

566
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:59,310
I want to help you but do it. I'm
not trying to help him, you know?

567
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:01,500
Okay.

568
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,200
Trying to get you a sandwich. I'm not
trying to fucking buy you, you know?

569
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,070
I don't know. What can you get with
20 minutes at 20 bucks is a bit much.

570
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,260
Yeah.

571
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,500
Have you ever given a homeless guy like,
uh,

572
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,360
like five bucks or 10 bucks and they
react the same way as if he gave him a

573
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:20,680
quarter and you kind of get mad kind
of adjacent Alexander moment where you

574
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:23,440
wanted to get credit for. Then you
also think like, well, you know,

575
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,140
if I don't have a house or an apartment,

576
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,450
okay,

577
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:27,811
you know,

578
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:32,550
getting $5 really is not a
major step in that direction.

579
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,473
It's just,

580
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,660
okay,

581
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,980
maybe I can get the egg and
Swiss, you know, the ham and egg,

582
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,310
I can get a ham, egg and cheese
as opposed to an egg and cheese.

583
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:45,370
And then I'm going to eat that and then
in 90 minutes I'm going to be fucking

584
00:34:45,371 --> 00:34:50,230
hungry again. So I kind of get it,
but it's also kind of annoying.

585
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,240
Jj, JJ, Jj, Jj, Jj, Jj, um, so anyways,

586
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:58,240
world series starts tomorrow night.
If you want to jump on my bandwagon,

587
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,160
I have the Shiny as bandwagon, the
newest and Shiny as bandwagon and town.

588
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,800
Um, oh dude, I got no fucking arguing with
someone. Rarely bill bought a surprise.

589
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,100
Don't come at me with that attitude.
All right.

590
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,010
I've got this big argument
with somebody the other day.

591
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,380
They were telling me
all about Los Angeles.

592
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,700
Yeah.

593
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,480
Talking about a fake tits and all
that type of thing was making,

594
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,253
you know,

595
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,360
and nose jobs and you know,
I went out to la we,

596
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:31,420
but he's still plastic
and fake out their paper.

597
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,330
The just like a year fucking more run.

598
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,560
Okay.

599
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,070
Yeah. And everybody back
here, just the truth, right?

600
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,720
Is that what you're telling me? Fucking
blows my mind. It just really does.

601
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,093
And that's just like,

602
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,100
you know what kills me as I've lived out
there for six years and I'm like, look,

603
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,320
I know when you first get there,
I know what you do.

604
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,590
You go down fucking sunset strip,

605
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:57,570
you go down Hollywood boulevard.
Yeah. And that's what you see. Okay.

606
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:01,200
You're telling me when you go to the
fucking meatpacking district in New York

607
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,390
City,
it's not a bunch of plastic,

608
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:08,391
phony fucking Paris Hilton
types or whoever the fuck
the new one is of that ilk.

609
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,390
Yeah. You go to the fucking club
scene with the beautiful people.

610
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:15,120
It's always going to be a bunch of
phony people. But I got to tell you,

611
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:18,390
I don't think the plastic
surgery is that bad in la.

612
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,420
And I know all you guys were
like, oh, like, and what do
you even react to it too?

613
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,160
Yeah.

614
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,330
Have you fucking bet this guy.

615
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,900
I lived out there for fucking six years
and I'm telling him go through it.

616
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:31,130
It's really not like that.

617
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:35,780
There's a lot of really talented
good people out there. So,

618
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,840
yeah. Yeah. What the fuck do
I know? I just live out there.

619
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:40,760
You've been out there six days.
I've been up there six years.

620
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:44,390
What the fuck would I know? Please? By all
means. You tell me about what you know,

621
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,970
I'm somehow missing.
I have got to be honest with you.

622
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:51,320
If you really want to see plastic
surgery, that's out of control. Um,

623
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:52,810
okay.

624
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,610
These are my top three places. And
then there's, uh, my, my wildcard pick,

625
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,260
I would say Orange County,
California, Dallas, Texas,

626
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,330
and um,

627
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,460
okay.

628
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,320
Miami Beach, Florida.
Unbelievable. And then my, my,

629
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,430
my wildcard.

630
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,840
Okay.

631
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,950
The impossible dream. What might
be a, I would say Phoenix, Arizona.

632
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,300
But the fake tits. Um, but even
then I think fake tits are out,

633
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,260
you know, like roller blades, they were
there like a 90 thing. At the very least.

634
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:29,000
They don't have them like a,

635
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,220
you remember those ones they had
in the nineties. Oh Jesus Christ.

636
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,410
Those fucking Clint Eastwood
Vein on the side of,

637
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,030
yeah.
Women fortunately stopped doing that.

638
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,020
Okay.

639
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,680
There's never been a pair of fake boobs
that looks better than the real thing.

640
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,550
Then whatever the, the original
real boobs just look way better,

641
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,380
regardless of size, way better.
You know what I mean? I Dunno.

642
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,090
I guess when you have a shirt on,

643
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,500
nobody can tell, but I don't, I don't
know the fuck. That's just weird.

644
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,140
That's fucking insane.

645
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,430
To take a plastic bag of
chemicals and stick that in. Yeah.

646
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,740
Rather than keeping your
beautiful normal ones.

647
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,750
I'm pro boobs than me talking nicely
about boobs here in October. Oh,

648
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:23,920
by the way, uh, I called
it with the pink scam.

649
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,770
It's finally fucking coming out.
You guys see in all these articles,

650
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:32,230
this is all that pink shit,
all that ways where need to up kitchen,

651
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,730
stove. How can you make of it?
Everybody coming down on me.

652
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,260
You think I'm the bad guy. I'm wearing
the black hat and fucking October,

653
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,150
I got a link for you guys to
check out that I, I swear to God,

654
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:48,700
a hundred people have tweeted to me,
so it's not my fine,

655
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,410
I'm not going to take credit for it,

656
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:54,640
but this is how it works with
that pink shit. It's basically

657
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,820
whatever they sell. So let's say they
sell a pink Football Jersey, Nfl Jersey,

658
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:05,610
you buy a Tony Romo Pinky, right?
Commie Pinko fucking Jersey,

659
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:09,510
right?
Basically like 10% of the wholesale,

660
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,280
not the retail price on the Jersey.
Now what you pay the 8,000 bucks,

661
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:16,920
whatever the fuck it is, the
wholesale, which is probably,

662
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:21,120
we'll say 35 bucks maybe.
What does it cost them after the kidneys?

663
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,080
The sweatshop makes the fucking thing.
I don't know, we'll just say 35 bucks.

664
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:26,460
So 10% of that.

665
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:27,860
Yeah.

666
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,420
So if it's a $100 Jersey retail for you,
10% of the wholesale,

667
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:33,470
35 bucks,

668
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:38,860
that's like they donate $3 and 50 cents
and then they pocket the other $96 and

669
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:44,330
50 cents and then it goes over to
the Commie Pinkos there. Right.

670
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,380
They take that $3 and 50 cents now
they have their entire infrastructure.

671
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,580
Yeah.

672
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:56,230
On all the people that are making money,
trying to ways that raise awareness.

673
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:58,690
Like that's their job.
That's how they pay their rent.

674
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,850
That's how they get themselves a yacht.

675
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,060
That $3 and 50 cents has to be thrown
into the stockpile to pay all those people

676
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:10,060
for their pink cubicles in this
pink staplers and all of that shit.

677
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,200
And by the end of it,
I don't know what you have left.

678
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,590
So there you go.
There you go.

679
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,260
It's just one big C is shit.
I Dunno.

680
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,320
I Dunno what the fuck. I
don't, I really don't mind.

681
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,660
It's one of the dumbest things
I've ever seen in my life.

682
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:34,661
I think people are aware of it and I
just find it to be this weird thing where

683
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,590
you have to be that aware of it.
Like it's more important than,

684
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,180
it's like they're jockeying for
positions in like, you know,

685
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,900
this disease march madness,
you know,

686
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:51,050
they're running up the score so they
can get the number one seat so they can

687
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:55,850
play a 16 rather than being like a five,
you know,

688
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,050
and playing a 12. I don't know. I didn't
do a fucking math on that. Um, all right,

689
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:03,310
let's get into the, um, let's
get into the fucking wall.

690
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,370
Let us the letters for the week.

691
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,860
I need a man's advice.
Well,

692
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:13,240
what the fuck are you emailing
me for a long time fan?

693
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:17,620
Recent subscriber to the podcast?
I had no idea. I'm sorry. Well,

694
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,550
I never promoted.

695
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:19,990
Okay.

696
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,080
You know, so why would you
know about my fucking podcast?

697
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,690
Isn't there like nine zillion things on
the, you don't give yourself a break.

698
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,200
This is a zillion things on the
Internet is free porn on the Internet.

699
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,760
The very fact that you even
listen to two seconds of this is,

700
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,620
is an unbelievable comment.
Compliment.

701
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,860
Um, anyways, he said, uh,

702
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,880
I'm recent subscriber but I've obsessively
caught up and listen to like five

703
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:44,570
months of Monday morning podcast,
um,

704
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,420

Chappelle show all you stand up.

705
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:50,180
So he recent my hometown of Minneapolis.

706
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,100
I'm not a huge football fan.
What are we getting to hear?

707
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,910
All right, well thank you for, oh,
there was an arrow. Sit start here.

708
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,910
Thank you for all those compliments,
sir. All right. And he says,

709
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:05,150
hope you can see the Arrow down.

710
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,220
He Moy. Gee, I love emojis also
tipsy for courage to write this.

711
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,910

He spelling Shinra. Anyway, she said,

712
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,911
I've been manifesting manifesting failings
for one of my best guy friends of 15

713
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:24,510
years. Now I'm 30 years
old and it seems like a no

714
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,030
brainer. Oh, this guy's drunk.
Braining or this woman's drunk,

715
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:35,030
whoever the fuck this is 30 years old
and it seems like a no braining that as

716
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:39,830
friends we make the go at
seeing if it could be more.

717
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,790
I don't, Jesus, let me see if
I can fucking get through this.

718
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:48,410
This is like an English person
or something. Who's drunk? Um,

719
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,440
I feel like what's holding me back are
I'm not 100% physically attracted to him.

720
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,890
I'm worried if it doesn't be, if
I'm worried, if it doesn't work out,

721
00:42:57,891 --> 00:43:02,120
I risk the chance of losing a great
friend after a night of hanging out and

722
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,680
drinking. I texted him. So why have we
never messed around in our adult life?

723
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:11,060
To which she responded? Great
question. I'm not sure Jesus.

724
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,460
To which I said
your what?

725
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,570
Your epilepsy.

726
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,113
Okay.

727
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,230
E l. L. I. P. S. I. S that's not epilepsy.

728
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,960
Ellipsis indicates that
admission of words.

729
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,480
You know, people, you know, I'm
fucking dumb. Don't use this.

730
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,650
What the fuck is that?
Ellipsis?

731
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,950
What did I got to look this
up? Ellipsis. You know,

732
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,870
a lot of people will laugh at it,

733
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,680
but a lot of people also
want to hear the definition.

734
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,830
Ellipsis is a series of dots that usually
indicate an intentional admission of

735
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:56,200
words, sentence or a whole
section. Jesus Christ. Okay.

736
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,670
All right. My world. That's dot dot,
dot. I thought that said epilepsy.

737
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:04,300
You know what it is.
I start reading a word and when I can't,

738
00:44:04,301 --> 00:44:05,081
I don't know what it is.

739
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:08,830
I panic like Mayor Menino and I
just throw out a fucking word.

740
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,090
Great question. He said, I'm not
sure. Dot Dot. Dot. To which point?

741
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:17,710
I said you're ellipsis indicates
and a mission of words.

742
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:21,640
Dot Dot, dot. All right.
You know what? Right there.

743
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:26,140
I'm not fucking you. I'm assuming
this is a woman at this point.

744
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,933
Um,

745
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,540
okay.

746
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,020
Yeah. Anybody who uses the word, you're
not even that the use the word ellipsis.

747
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:37,500
I can, I should own up to
my own stupidity or El Ep.

748
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,210
Epilepsies um,

749
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,660
indicates an admission
of words right there.

750
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:47,310
You're already putting him
on the defensive. You know,

751
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:52,260
you're already fucking like
mine. Fucking him. Anyways,

752
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:57,030
he said hoping to get them to
make the text move. He hasn't.

753
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,620
Oh, you thought that if you wrote, I'm
just gonna keep saying. Dot Dot, dot.

754
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,470
Cause I'm, I'm paranoid. Everybody's
laughing because I'm saying it wrong.

755
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,970
your.dot, dot indicates an emission
of words.dot, dot. She says,

756
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:12,570
hoping to get him to make the next
move. Dot Dot. Dot. He hasn't,

757
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,080
so is it on me to make the next move?
Is,

758
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,310
is the risk of running the relationship
ruining the relationship? Not Worth it?

759
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,930
Is it even worthy of your podcast?
Ah, what do I do if the person says,

760
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,080
I feel like we're good,
regardless of if you read this or not.

761
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,510
This is where I say thanks and
go fuck yourself. All right. Um,

762
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,263
well look,

763
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:40,360
if you're actually seriously want to, uh,

764
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,320
explore a relationship with somebody,

765
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:47,321
it's probably not a good idea to start
the relationship after a night of

766
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,920
drinking with texting.

767
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,300
Okay.

768
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,210
I would think, I think that's
a, that's a sober move.

769
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,540
Now if you just want to fuck the dude,
then yeah.

770
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,700
Drunk texting is great,

771
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:01,760
but I would leave out the big
words in Casey's a dummy like me.

772
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,433
MMM.

773
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,310
I Dunno. What is the next move?
Well, if you want to pursue it,

774
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:12,230
I would bring up the text
said, sorry. You know,

775
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:15,030
I was a little drunk when I texted
you, but, uh, I was, you know,

776
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,150
you know what? Don't do this.
This whole thing is set up wrong.

777
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,160
You just wrote, why have we never messed
around in our adult life? He didn't say,

778
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:30,630
how come you've never taken
me to a movie? Um, you,

779
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,870
you've basically the relationship
you're setting up here as a fuck buddy.

780
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,800
So if that's what you want,
I would say full steam ahead.

781
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,470
MMM.

782
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,730
If that isn't what you want,

783
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:46,180
I don't know how to finesse around
the drunk texts that you sent.

784
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,980
So why have we never messed around in our
adult life? Great question. I'm not sure

785
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,480
you're ellipsis saying that right.

786
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,880
Indicates in admission of words.

787
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,970
Yeah.

788
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:03,970
Who the fuck would ever text at this?
The guy's already drunk.

789
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,570
Okay.

790
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,403
He probably looks at what?

791
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,710
He's probably fucking held the
phone up to his drunk roommate.

792
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,640
What does that say?

793
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,023
Huh?

794
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,680
Why is she talking about epilepsy? I
don't know what to tell you ma'am. Um,

795
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,780
but if you want to hook up with
them, it's, it's there. It's there.

796
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,090
Come on. You're a female. Jesus Christ.

797
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:28,840
How hard can it be you putting it
out there like that? You're all,

798
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,830
as far as there being a love
connection. I don't, I don't,

799
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,320
I don't see it that I would
do something different. Golf,

800
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,290
fucking take a cooking class together.

801
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:42,640
You've got to do some up taking
you seriously, um, type of stuff.

802
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,650
I don't know. You're not that
physically attracted to the guy

803
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,060
it drunk texting him.
You know what you need to,

804
00:47:53,061 --> 00:47:56,090
what you need some halftime adjustments.
That's what I would do. All right.

805
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,490
You're better than this. You, you can't,

806
00:47:58,491 --> 00:48:01,250
you can't go hook up with a
guy that you were attracted to.

807
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:06,080
Don't settle for less sweetheart. All
right. You need to sober up like me.

808
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:08,510
You need to get out of the fog.
I'm doing it this week.

809
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,240
You do it to go hang out
with some different people.

810
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:16,070
Go find a good looking chap
that you're attracted to and uh,

811
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:20,570
you know, go fucking half a cup
of tea with them or some shit.

812
00:48:20,571 --> 00:48:23,840
Whatever you do. I'm guessing you're
from somewhere else because, uh,

813
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,680
just the way you are,
some of the expressions beyond that word.

814
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:32,680
I couldn't read that I've never heard.
Oh, Jesus Christ. I don't know. Anyways,

815
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,210
that gave me a headache. All right.
Advice dealing with racist family.

816
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:38,783
Okay,

817
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,300
Bill. I'm a big fan and they need
advice about a problem with you may have

818
00:48:42,301 --> 00:48:43,680
experienced,
uh,

819
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:48,090
my girlfriend is a different race than
me and my family is reacting in a racist

820
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,580
way about it. I didn't have
that problem. Thank God.

821
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,830
The problem is I am very close
to my family. I usually talk,

822
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,970
well of course you are.
I usually talk to my parents once a day,

823
00:48:56,971 --> 00:49:00,330
so this means I have to deal
with their crap on a daily basis.

824
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,890
Um,

825
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:06,600
I love your grandmother comes to town
bit and that's similar to the kind of

826
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:10,890
bullshit that I'm dealing with on a
daily basis. Uh, here's the backstory.

827
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,470
My family is Jewish but not religious.

828
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:18,471
My parents are from Russia and our old
school white as far as they can see it,

829
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,260
as far as they see it,
racism is just the way it is.

830
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,890
And there is no shame in telling it like
it is by making ignorant statements.

831
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:26,743
Statements.

832
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,940
My folks told me exact words that
they want my girlfriend to be Jewish.

833
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:33,930
Okay.

834
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:34,763
But they,

835
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,080
what my folks told me exact words that
they want my girlfriends to be Jewish,

836
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,970
but that they would
settle for someone white.

837
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,190
Did you leave something out there,
sir? That doesn't make sense to me.

838
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,330
So my girlfriend is less
Lebanese. Slash. Mexican.

839
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:55,790
Okay.

840
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:59,150
Oh wait, wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait a second. Oh, your family is Jewish.

841
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,340
All right, now I get it. Sorry.
So fucking dumb this week. Um,

842
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:04,730
okay.

843
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:07,220
My folks told me that they want
my girlfriend to be Jewish,

844
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,990
but they would settle for someone white.
My girlfriend is Lebanese. Slash. Mexican.

845
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,780
Ever since I mentioned to her,
to my parents,

846
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,730
they've been making all kinds of
racist comments about her. Um,

847
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,060
they hate us or why can't you date
normal people of Jesus and there will be

848
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:29,960
problems you'll see. So I'm stuck. I can't
dump my girlfriend because I love her.

849
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,000
And two,
we have a great relationship in three.

850
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:35,600
Dumping her just because of racist
bullshit would make me a hypocrite,

851
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,330
but I can't cut off my parents
because I loved them too.

852
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,690
And they have otherwise been
wonderful and supportive. All my life.

853
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,620
I've tried explaining to my girlfriend
is not a problem and that she won't

854
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:47,090
change my relationship with them,

855
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,580
but my folks keep repeating
the same racist bullshit.

856
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,200
Any advice for dealing with my folks
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

857
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:58,700
And looking forward to seeing you the
next time you're in New York City.

858
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,620
All right? Well Dude, you
got to live your life.

859
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,340
You got to do what's right for you.
And um,

860
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:09,570
you know, hopefully your parents will
come around, but here's the deal, dude.

861
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,530
You're gonna outlive your parents,
so they're going to be long gone.

862
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,700
And if you do everything that they
want you to do, then when they,

863
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:22,350
when they're gone and you're living the
life they wanted you to live rather than

864
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:23,700
the life that you wanted to live.

865
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,510
Now if they what they want you to
do and what you want to do overlap,

866
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,950
then fucking by all means full steam
ahead. But if you really love this girl,

867
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:33,420
then I would,
I would stay with that.

868
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,743
All right?

869
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,780
You know, what are you, what are you
going to do the fuck you gonna do?

870
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,240
Fuck people you know,
fuck.

871
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:45,870
Would they think a bunch of
fucking mouth breathe and morons?

872
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,600
Why would you even listen to me?
I'm a mugging me. I'm a moron,

873
00:51:49,601 --> 00:51:51,940
but I'm not a moron when it comes
to that shift. Fuck people live.

874
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:56,260
Live your life and let them,
uh, let them deal with it.

875
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,600
Math. Jesus. Fucking relationships are
hard enough. You don't need that shit.

876
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,450
Tell your parents to grow up. All right,
girlfriend, sleeping over. All right.

877
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:11,260
Hey Bill on 26 and my girlfriend of
about three months has been staying at my

878
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,870
house four to six nights a week.
Jesus Christ.

879
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,680
This started about the second week we
were dating when I asked her to stay over,

880
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,120
I only meant for that night.

881
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,320
I gave it time to get used to it.

882
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,630
Get used to someone being my bed.
It's killing me.

883
00:52:25,631 --> 00:52:28,990
She lives with her dad and I understand
why she would rather stay with me.

884
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,770
She only has a toothbrush in my house,
so it's not like we moved in together,

885
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:34,750
but I have never lived
with a girlfriend before.

886
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,060
I feel like the
relationship moved too fast.

887
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:40,660
The worst part is I have to get up for
work at about 6:00 AM and feel like I

888
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:44,170
have to tip toe around so I don't wake
her and get dressed and I have to get

889
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:48,610
dressed in the dark. I'm
also tired in the, uh,

890
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:50,260
in the day from lack of sleep.

891
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,590
I've dropped subtle hints when
she hasn't spent the night.

892
00:52:53,591 --> 00:52:57,910
Like I slept so good last night.
That's fucking hilarious.

893
00:52:59,590 --> 00:52:59,900
Okay.

894
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,350
I also started to be loud in the
morning and turning on a lamp.

895
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,080
I think she got the hint,
but nothing has changed.

896
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,850
I asked my roommates it and
his girlfriend for advice,

897
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:14,660
but it seemed kind of blunt.
My roommate's girlfriend is in college,

898
00:53:14,661 --> 00:53:18,710
so his girlfriend is only there on the
weekends and he misses her not being

899
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:22,670
there. So he thinks I'm being a bitch.
Uh, I don't want to break up with her.

900
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,040
Just find a nice way of saying,
go the fuck or I'll

901
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,200
see you tomorrow. Thanks
for the advice. By the way,

902
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:33,090
does everyone say go fuck yourself
at the end or do you add that Ah,

903
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:37,030
yeah, no. People say, go fuck yourself.
Um, yeah. This is the deal, ya,

904
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,390
your sound like you're a
younger person and yeah,

905
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:42,630
that's one of the hardest things you
have to learn is how to say what you're

906
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:43,340
saying.

907
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,350
I will say what you're feeling knowing
that the other person doesn't want to

908
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:51,210
hear it, but you say it in a healthy
way. So I would just say, um,

909
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,830
okay.

910
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,220
Yeah. Jesus Christ. Just say, listen,
we've got to talk about something.

911
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,560
And she'll say, what? And it's just like,
uh, listen, I love when you're over here.

912
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,790
I love spending time with you,

913
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:07,380
but four to six nights a week it's
affecting my sleep and you know,

914
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,290
my job and that type of thing. So, uh,

915
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,620
I'd like to have it be more
than like two nights a week.

916
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:17,220
It just kind of moved a little too
fast for me. And then she like,

917
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:21,870
what do you say? What are you
saying? Blah, blah, blah, blah.

918
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:25,650
And you just stay. No, I'm not saying
that. I'm not say I don't like you.

919
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm just saying it moved too
quickly and this is on me. Um,

920
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,250
I didn't, I didn't want to
hurt your feelings and I
didn't know how to convey it.

921
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,240
I know I'm 26, but you know, this is an
area in my life that I need to work on.

922
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,560
So I'm trying to get better at this.

923
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:44,760
I'm just trying to communicate with you
what would make me happy so we can be

924
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:45,594
happy.

925
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,170
Yeah.

926
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,170
And then you know, if she wants
to pout and be like, wait,

927
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,960
if you think lamean the Eh, and just
want to be over here and then you know,

928
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:54,970
what the fuck are you gonna do?
You've only seen him for three months.

929
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:57,430
If she's going to act like a fucking baby,
then a letter.

930
00:54:59,090 --> 00:54:59,940
But um,

931
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,950
you mentioned that she lives with her
dad and you understand why she would

932
00:55:03,951 --> 00:55:08,660
rather stay with me. So is that guy
a dick? So if that guy is a dick,

933
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:12,140
then like she's like a stray cat and
you gave her some milk and now she's at

934
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:15,830
your door every fucking day. That
doesn't mean she likes you. That's,

935
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,520
that's not a hell,

936
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,670
that's not a fucking healthy reason for
it to be over there four to six times a

937
00:55:19,671 --> 00:55:23,210
week. She's over there four to six
times a week because she loves you.

938
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:23,841
That's one thing.

939
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:27,380
But she's over there four to six times a
week because a dad's a fucking asshole.

940
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,443
MMM.

941
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,150
Then she's just kind of being codependent.
So,

942
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:37,090
but that's a whole other can of
worms and I don't bring up that part.

943
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:41,960
Do not bring up her dad, by the way, on
any fucking level. When you tell her,

944
00:55:41,961 --> 00:55:45,640
just say, listen, this
moved really quickly and um,

945
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,700
all the bullshit that I just said,
just say it that way.

946
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,980
And if she's going to cry then like Hootie
and the blowfish set a long time ago,

947
00:55:53,981 --> 00:55:56,110
let her cry.
All right.

948
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,130
Just let her fucking cry.

949
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:01,940
Okay.

950
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,470
And you know,
that's what they do when they get upset,

951
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:10,490
they cry.
So it doesn't mean you're a bad guy.

952
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:16,190
Just understand that she's crying because
you conveyed what's going to make you

953
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:19,600
happy.
Can you imagine if you did that?

954
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,520
If the shoe was on the other foot and
she was just saying, you watch an ESPN,

955
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:30,460
he watched sports center like three
times in a row. It's the exact same show.

956
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:31,960
Can't you just watch it once?

957
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,750
How many times do you have
to look at these highlights?

958
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,140
What do you think she would do if your
bottom lip started quivering and you

959
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:43,141
started crying and then tried to put the
entire relationship on that one little

960
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:46,060
thing,
you know?

961
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,730
Do you think she'd have any fucking guilt?
I don't think she would. So neither.

962
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:56,110
Should you grant watching ESPN three
times in a row and actually saying, hey,

963
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,110
could you not stay over here as much as
you know, they're not on the same level,

964
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:01,250
but you know what I'm saying?
So good luck to you, sir.

965
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,710
Just write down on a piece of paper.

966
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,930
That's what I used to do
because I wasn't good at it.

967
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,610
I just wrote it down on a piece of paper,

968
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:09,880
everything that I wanted to say and
I would draw a smiley face above it.

969
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,400
So I would remember not to say
it in an angry fucking way.

970
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,520
I know that sounds stupid, but it
worked for me, so good luck to you sir.

971
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:16,943
All right.

972
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:17,810
Yeah.

973
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:22,250
Two guys in a lady, two
guys and a girl. All right.

974
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:27,980
A their brother, man. Bill love you
show. My wife loves you. Stand up.

975
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:29,750
Ever since I showed her let it go,

976
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:34,670
I've got a situation on my hands here
that I would love to hear your input.

977
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,540
I had a falling out with one of my
closest friends about six years ago.

978
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,270
It was all because of a
girl that he said he was,

979
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:47,330
that he said was his first
love and apparently lost
virginity with the girl and

980
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:50,360
I hit it off.
And so we started going out.

981
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,210
We didn't want to hurt his feelings
since we were all best friends.

982
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:56,560
But after he found out he wanted
nothing to do with us. Uh,

983
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:01,590
which is understandable.
Is nothing worse than somebody banging.

984
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:03,390
Somebody used to be in love with,
right?

985
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,960
And then they come to you in a mature way.
It's the last thing you want.

986
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,630
You want it to sneak around so
you could be like, how dare you?

987
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:12,810
I thought you were friends
when they actually cut. Listen,

988
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:16,770
this is just something that we wanted
to talk to talk to you about because we

989
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,790
value our friendship
with you this same way.

990
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,640
We value the feeling that we bought in.
They're just being mature,

991
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:27,030
so you have to fucking sit there and
not call them cunt. That's the worst.

992
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,860
All right. Plowing ahead.
As the relationship grew,

993
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:34,861
she told me that she never was intimate
with him and that he didn't even know,

994
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,850
wait,
as the relationship grows,

995
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:42,580
she told me that she was never intimate
with him and that he didn't even know he

996
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:44,940
liked her that way. Oh,
and that she didn't.

997
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:48,550
He left that out there that she didn't
even know that he liked her that way.

998
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:49,900
Fast forward to present day,

999
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,200
I'm married to the same girl and have
two dogs and in the process of buying our

1000
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:57,130
first home together, out of the
blue, out of the fucking blue,

1001
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,630
my friend contacts me via
Facebook and keeps asking me

1002
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,350
to go out with him.
When I say that,

1003
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:08,810
my wife wants to tag along too.

1004
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,130
Okay.

1005
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,310
He keeps repeating the phrase.
We got to talk man,

1006
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,680
man demand before we can start a new,

1007
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:19,190
I just got all fucking turned around
in there. What the fuck just happened?

1008
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,900
All right. The wife loves it.
Your relationship group, dude,

1009
00:59:25,901 --> 00:59:28,960
you fucked up a pronoun in there and
that just threw me right over the cliff.

1010
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,390
Has the relationship grew?
She told me she never wanted to be,

1011
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,730
she was never intimate with them.
Now wait a minute.

1012
00:59:33,731 --> 00:59:35,710
This guy said he lost his virginity tour.

1013
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,670
Jesus Christ.
It's like a soap opera.

1014
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:42,700
Okay,

1015
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,630
so you married the girl.

1016
00:59:43,631 --> 00:59:45,970
He got two dogs and in the process
of buying for is out of the blue.

1017
00:59:45,971 --> 00:59:49,630
My friend contacted me via Facebook and
keeps asking me to go out with them off

1018
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,360
to have a drink. All
right. When I say that,

1019
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,640
that my wife wants to tag along too,

1020
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:58,780
we keeps repeating the phrase we gotta
talk man to man before we start a new,

1021
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,310
should I go?

1022
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,260
Okay?

1023
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,093
MMM.

1024
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,360
Uh,
no.

1025
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:10,643
Okay.

1026
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,630
No,
no you shouldn't.

1027
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:18,640
You shouldn't because
cause he's a fucking Weirdo.

1028
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,970
He sounds like he still has
a lock of her hair someplace.

1029
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,870
Got To start,
man to man,

1030
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:28,540
they'll give me a fee still fucking
that's why the f wait, wait a second.

1031
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:32,700
Why does he want to hang out with you?
He could walk away that easily.

1032
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:33,900
How good of friends were you?

1033
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:35,980
Okay.

1034
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,830
You know, if you guys just watch games
together cause you work together,

1035
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:40,900
you went to school for a couple
of years together. I mean,

1036
01:00:40,901 --> 01:00:44,800
I think it's a fucking rap. Sounds like
you've got a great thing with your wife.

1037
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,450
Why do you want to bring this guy over
and then what?

1038
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,700
Then what he wants to see what she
looks like. That's weird, dude.

1039
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:57,000
That sets single white female shit.
I wouldn't, should you go? No,

1040
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:58,170
I wouldn't go fuck him.

1041
01:00:59,110 --> 01:00:59,430
Yeah.

1042
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,460
All right. This is the deal. You want
to hang out with us for a couple?

1043
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,320
See us that way. Other than that,
you know, I can't fucking help you.

1044
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,740
Does that make sense? Yeah.
Fuck that. I wouldn't go

1045
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,130
stay with your wife. All right.
Three way relationship, sir.

1046
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,350
Billion of orange. I like
that one. It's a very, uh,

1047
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,610
I feel like I just get knighted.
Well, the fucking creamsicle. Um,

1048
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,920
thanks for the podcast, man.
I'll try to keep this short.

1049
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:32,950
So my girlfriend and I
off. Fuck. You know what?

1050
01:01:32,951 --> 01:01:35,140
I forgot to read the other
advertising there. Hold on a second.

quick. Um, he voice everybody.

1052

rise window view? Fancy Pants office?

1054
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:49,090
Oh, do you want them to know
you're sitting there and
you're underwears with he

1055

voice? You can create the appearance
of an entire building, sales,

1056

name it. They'll think you got it.

1057
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,270
Give your customers the royal
treatment with the voice.

1058

He voice will forward your
business calls to your home,

it at your convenience as an email he

1062
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:14,170
voiced not only gives you an edge
over the competitors, competitors,

1063
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,920
it takes away the edge the big
companies have over you right now.

1064
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,040
That's the big selling right there for me.

final letter of the podcast here.

1090
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,350
Okay. How about those Bruins?
Going down to Florida,

1091
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,930
showing those two teams down there,
how the game's played.

1092
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,260
Three way relationships are
built, sir, a billion of orange.

1093
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,750
Thanks for the podcast, man.
I'll try to keep this short.

1094
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:13,350
So my girlfriend and I are 25 and
invent together for about four years.

1095
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,530
Things aren't great,
but they aren't horrible either.

1096
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:21,860
Recently we started hanging out more
with her best friend and everyone,

1097
01:04:22,011 --> 01:04:24,180
whenever we hang out,
it's always a great time.

1098
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,670
Her friend has been in
a bit of a relationship,

1099
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:31,671
dry spell lately and recently
my girlfriend told me that
they've been discussing

1100
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:36,570
the possibility of us starting a
threeway relationship. All right.

1101
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:40,600
Okay.
I don't need to read any more dough it

1102
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,330
they'll always says my girlfriend and I
have already gone down this road before

1103
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:51,040
with minimal complications, but that
was primarily a sex only relationship.

1104
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:56,000
Whereas this new one would
probably be more serious. Well,

1105
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,650
you fucking Jack tripper.
How would it be more serious?

1106
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:01,500
You're going to live with the two of them.
Oh,

1107
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:05,340
that was a three's company reference
for anybody under the age of 50. Um,

1108
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:08,140
the problem is I'd really
like to date the friend.

1109
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,960
I think that we could make this trio work,

1110
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:15,130
but I could see myself liking the friend
more than my current girlfriend and

1111
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:16,960
fucking the whole thing up for everyone.

1112
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,090
I also think that breaking up with my
girlfriend at the four years just to date

1113
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:25,660
of best friend is a cut move and
therefore is off the table. Finally,

1114
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,390
this fucking Shit, the
fucking question. Sorry.

1115
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,530
So should I encourage this three way as
it's the only way I'll ever get to date

1116
01:05:32,531 --> 01:05:33,220
the friend,

1117
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,730
which seems quite cunty or should I
just break up with the girlfriend?

1118
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:40,120
Forget about the whole thing
and move west to start fresh.

1119
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:41,540
Okay,

1120
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:46,010
thanks again. And Go fuck yourself. Pleat.
Ps, come do a Gig in Maine before you get

1121
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,140
okay.

1122
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,220
Too Big for your freckles
and only do stadium gigs.

1123
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,770
Um, first of all, sir,

1124
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:58,420
you are a fucking hero and you are living
a life life right now that most men

1125
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,420
only fantasize about, myself
included. That's fucking tremendous.

1126
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,860
That is a tremendous,

1127
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:03,890
okay

1128
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,200
situation to have your cell phone.
You know what I say?

1129
01:06:06,201 --> 01:06:10,160
I say you fuck them both then
you her and then you fucking,

1130
01:06:10,161 --> 01:06:14,180
you move west and start a fresh, that's
what you do. And that's not a dirty move.

1131
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,980
Okay. Because what's your girlfriend
is doing all right? She's into women.

1132
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:23,920
She's in the bolt, but you're not going
to marry this woman. All right? This girl,

1133
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:26,050
she's, she's rogue. She's a renegade.

1134
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:28,210
She's going to get a pilot's
license to fly around.

1135
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:32,110
The fucking world is Amelia Earhart.
Man, you don't tie this woman down.

1136
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,210
Okay.

1137
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:35,930
All right. Fuck that. You're not going
to marry her. You know you're not,

1138
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,710
but you didn't want to

1139
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:39,740
friend. All right, so
why don't you just do it?

1140
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,800
I say you fucking both.
Yeah.

1141
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,400
Okay.

1142
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,660
All right. It's not a cut
move. They brought it up.

1143
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,330
You don't think your
girlfriend's being selfish here.

1144
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:51,910
Okay.

1145
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:52,451
She's not.

1146
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:56,800
She's sitting there risking her friendship
with her girlfriend to drag you into

1147
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:59,860
the fold. The whole thing's for, there's
no fucking relationship here, sir.

1148
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,450
You're a fuck stick. And by all
means, let them use you as such.

1149
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,240
Get yourself some condoms.
Have a great time.

1150
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:10,300
I'd have my suitcase packed right
outside the fucking bedroom door,

1151
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,520
right? Don't do the porky pig.
Yeah, yeah. DDD. That's all folks.

1152
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:16,510
And you're fucking out of there.

1153
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,350
Okay.

1154
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:22,340
God bless you. God bless you. But that's
Jesus Christ. People Shit on Maine.

1155
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:26,300
People make fun of that state. That's,
that's considered a problem in Maine.

1156
01:07:26,301 --> 01:07:29,660
Everybody,
it's God's country up there.

1157
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,030
Blue potatoes,
fresh air.

1158
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,440
Yeah.

1159
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,670
Fucking threesomes. They've got to
do something to stay warm. All right,

Um, I'm going to fucking, I dunno.

1162
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:50,180
Go get myself some green juice is
something I'm laying off the stokes.

1163
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,840
I'm laying off the bows feast
or famine with me. All right?

1164
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,600
I'm done with this shit.
Uh,

1165
01:07:58,930 --> 01:07:59,310
okay.

1166
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,680
Somehow still in great shape though.
I don't know what happened.

1167
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,190
It's probably the liquid diet there.

and I'm playing three legendary theaters.

1178
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:51,470
I'm going to be at Constitution Hall,
Dar Constitution Hall,

1179
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:56,420
right down the street from the
Federal Reserve. Everybody, you know,

1180
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,110
I want to take pictures and sell DVDs
in front of the Federal Reserve after my

1181
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:04,610
show. I know I won't be able to. All
right. And judging by the Greenpeace 30,

1182
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,090
I don't feel like getting arrested for
any sort of fucking terrorism or whatever.

1183
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,403
But,
um,

1184
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:13,200
let me get to my podcast page here so
I can get you the dates on these season

1185
01:09:13,201 --> 01:09:14,050
three.
Awesome.

1186
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,030
Just going to be legendary nights,

1187
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,370
uh, for myself. Uh, here we
go. Here we go. All right.

1188
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:26,140
On November 7th,
dark constitution hall in Washington DC.

1189
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,300
Deal with that one,
everybody. That one is, uh,

1190
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,670
that's where Eddie Murphy taped.
Delirious. All right. Enough said,

1191
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,530
um, I did that. I've performed
there one other time,

1192
01:09:41,531 --> 01:09:42,940
but I was there with Jim Norton,

1193
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,590
Jim Brewer and David Tell on the
antisocial network tour. It was awesome.

1194
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,830
And I was really hoping when I came out
there they'd have that electric blue

1195
01:09:50,831 --> 01:09:55,390
carpet for some reason I feel like
Eddie had the blue carpet. Um,

1196
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,200
but I think it was just a stage and it
was, it was awesome. So to actually,

1197
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:04,170
I thought I'd never get to go there again.
Um,

1198
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:05,400
so the fact that I'm going to be there,

1199
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,700
it's going to be an extra special show
and a really looking forward to it.

1200
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,050
And then on the eighth I'm doing the
beacon two shows at the beacon theater.

1201
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:14,850
Um,

1202
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:20,730
and then on the ninth I'm doing
two shows at the tower theater. Um,

1203
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:25,800
it's just, it's just going to be awesome.
Beacon theater. Obviously, you know,

1204
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,340
almond brothers do that.
The beacon run every fucking year there.

1205
01:10:29,341 --> 01:10:32,960
And I've done a number of benets
benefits there. I did the,

1206
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:37,560
when I did the night at too many
stars when I did the Steve jobs bit.

1207
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,790
Ah, that's where I take that
one. So, um, yeah, it's,

1208
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,380
it's amazing to be able to come back
there and that people are buying that many

1209
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:46,950
tickets. So I want to thank all
you guys for that. And as always,

1210
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,360
dude, I called it Versie New
Jersey's own, Paul Versey,

1211
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:55,320
Paul Benito,
Mussolini versa.

1212
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:59,700
We'll be opening for me and it's just
going to be an awesome time and I'm really

1213
01:10:59,701 --> 01:11:00,630
looking forward to it.

1214
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,680
And I got this feel as whole new chunk
of material coming so I'm beyond psyched

1215
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,820
to go out and you know,

1216
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:12,360
work it out this week in La and have it
ready to go in November. All right guys,

1217
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:15,570
that's the uh, who's
playing tonight. The G men,

1218
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:19,440
the giants trying to not go
oh and seven through Paul.

1219
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,370
He is the greatest giants fan of all time.
He,

1220
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,060
no matter how all in one all went to Olin,
three o and four.

1221
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:29,400
I have to every fucking
week their own four. Dude,

1222
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,590
I'm telling you right now they're
going to finish nine and seven.

1223
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:34,920
The giants are going to go night.
You heard it here first.

1224
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:36,270
They go in [inaudible] 93 the rest,

1225
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,640
he was saying last night I
was hanging out with them.

1226
01:11:38,641 --> 01:11:42,270
He was still talking positive.
He says they're all one six he goes,

1227
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:44,640
they're going to win this guy.
I think he's going to set that.

1228
01:11:44,641 --> 01:11:48,420
They're going to finish eight and eight
all right. Fucking phenomenal fan.

1229
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:50,880
I got to respect them for that.
Other than that,

1230
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,360
I make fun of everything else he does.
All right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves.

1231
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:54,790
I'll see you.
