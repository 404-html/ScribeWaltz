1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,900
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:08,950
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,580
Ah, just checking in on you. I get
bogged down in the mud on that one.

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,760
I didn't think I was going to
pull myself up, but you know what?

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,620
I reached down deep. Showed
what? I had it on me in on me.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,600
She'll write head in
me. Um, anyways. Yeah.

7
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:33,830
You know what?
It's nice to be here.

8
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:37,520
It's nice to be back out here in sunny
la after, uh, going back to New York.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,820
It was chilly fall Billy back there in
the New York City getting soft out here.

10
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:46,520
And you know what? I love
it. I fucking love it.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,310
That's a big thing that east coast people
are we saying when you go out west,

12
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:52,490
hey, don't, don't lose
your edge, Bro. Don't,

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,670
don't be getting all Hollywood
on the dove like dope.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,083
Okay.

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,960
Um, you basically telling
me don't become happy.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,870
That's what you saying dope.
Dope. And get to happy.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,570
What are you going to go do it?
You're gonna walk around.

18
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:11,300
You're going to get some sandals.
Really?

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,900
You fucking toes hanging out or whatever.

20
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,270
Do where some fucking clam diggers.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,133
MMM,

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,110
no, it's just nice. I went
back there and I, uh, you know,

23
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:26,020
I'm one of these fucking La people now.
I don't really have a winter coat coat.

24
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:30,580
I have a pea coat. Um, it was funny.
This one was breaking my balls.

25
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,940
Tell me it wasn't a real one because I
didn't get it at the army navy store.

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,540
It's like those fucking things
that's like wearing thick pajamas.

27
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,320
Pico doesn't work the second it's
below like, you know, 40 degrees.

28
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,670
It's one of those myths that, you know
what, it's got a mid range jumper.

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,730
That's what, that's all that fucking code
has. You know what I mean? It can't run.

30
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:53,480
The court doesn't play any fucking day.
It's too fucking hot.

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,480
You know, once you get to like 58 degrees,
it's too fucking hot to wear that coat.

32
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,230
Way Too hot.

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,230
55 write that code basically exists from
about 39 degrees to maybe 51 you know

34
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:13,370
what I mean? If you get a
decent one, forget a decent one.

35
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,190
Like I bought a diesel.
Actually Nia bought me a decent one,

36
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,510
but she used my money to do it. So you
know what I mean? Technically, I mean,

37
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,270
you know, she fucking use my money
so I guess I bought it. You know,

38
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,160
I guess I do have an assistant.
It's my wife

39
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,260
who has access to all my funds.
You got to do that with your wife,

40
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:37,660
you know what I mean?
Just give her access to all your funds.

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,690
It just gives you so much
leverage in an argument.

42
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,360
Just use that next time, you know?
But the sheer ube you a to a,

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,280
you were snoring. Just honey, honey,
you have access to all of my funds.

44
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,670
Do you understand that you
have access to all my funds.

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,630
I go to an airport in leave, leave you
with access to. I don't. I don't want,

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
I don't even know what I'm
going to come back to it.

47
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:05,360
Was there even going to be anything here
now?

48
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:09,710
What is the problem with the fucking
glass that I didn't wash that always make

49
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:13,970
me out? Like she's a Nag.
She really isn't. She really
isn't, but it's just, um,

50
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:15,950
yeah,

51
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,130
I guess it's just a fear of, of, you
know, being with somebody that can,

52
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,110
they can take you for everything.

53
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:25,520
You've got prenup doesn't mean shit out
here in California. You know what I mean?

54
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,040
You don't have a prenup is in California.

55
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,250
That's like when there's a blitz in
the fullback, misses the assignment.

56
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,780
That's what the Prenup is. You think
that fucker's going to pick up that,

57
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,330
that fucking Lawrence Taylor wanted to
be coming right around the outside. Ah,

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,260
he must, he's sitting there
with happy feet. Where is he?

59
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:48,650
He's buying you and then you get the
old right there, Fred. Right. Well,

60
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:51,890
you're fucking Bacchae your helmet.
It's the middle of your spine.

61
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,900
As you head snaps back. That's what
a fucking prenup is out here. So,

62
00:03:56,901 --> 00:04:01,760
um, anyways, I don't even want,
I'm talking about here. Um,

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,530
I just get back from New York City.

64
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,530
I had such a fucking great time going
back there doing the fifth annual Patrice

65
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,190
O'Neal benefit right out of the gate.

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,610
Thank you to everyone that
came down to this show.

67
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,010
The show was unbelievable.
I mean,

68
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,640
I wasn't there last year because
of the snow I got snowed in.

69
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:23,210
But of the four that I've seen that
might have been the strongest show that

70
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,670
we've had,
we've always had strong shows.

71
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:30,230
But there was something about that
show was like the perfect level of, um,

72
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,330
of his friends of new guys that were
influenced by him and just the ball break.

73
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:41,060
And that was going on during the
fucking show. Uh, Jesus Christ,

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,410
Rich Vos making fun of
Keith Robinson fucking

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,920
what's his face? I think Norton of
course, no one had the best line.

76
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,350
He was talking about how funny Keith was.
He goes,

77
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,310
you should have had a stroke 15 years ago.
He goes,

78
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,570
I don't understand how Keith had
his stroke and he still talks.

79
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,600
He still eat well,
easier to understand than rich vos.

80
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,220
Those are probably two of the best ones
in Voss. Had like this stupid fucking,

81
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,860
he had like this Paisley shirt from
like the early nineties like every drum

82
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,830
instructional video that I bought from
the early nineties where they didn't have

83
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:20,580
those jazz guys who are such
good musicians, you know,

84
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:24,660
you get so good that your music sucks.
After a while they were playing like that.

85
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:28,410
I'm 94 seven the way,
hey,

86
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,880
that's smooth jazz shit.

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,840
You know he had one of those shirts
and then he had like a fucking Justin

88
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,000
Timberlake does fucking bing Crosby,

89
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:42,780
one of those fucking hipster hats that
even hipsters stop wearing those things

90
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,750
like 10 years ago and it was blue on blue.

91
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,710
So we were backstage,
you know,

92
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:52,290
all of us fucking jaded
people are gone now. Rich,

93
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,350
it looks good now you should wear
it because he wasn't sure about it.

94
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,330
And Pete Davidson, the new kid, right?
New Kid. He's already on fucking SNL.

95
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:03,980
It's how old I am. He's, he was
actually telling rich going, you rich,

96
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,430
you can't wear that. It looks terrible.
And I was fine. Like page shut up.

97
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,570
The whole game is that we know it looks.
Don't tell him that.

98
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,530
And he just started laughing.

99
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,640
Then he went along with it and I believe
he took it off his head at the end,

100
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,320
at the end of his set. We had such a
great time and everybody fucking killed,

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,140
um,
right out of the gate.

102
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,170
We had Dan soda went up
first after Voss and,

103
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:33,530
um, he went up there and absolutely
just fucking murdered. It was like he,

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,480
he'd been doing it in
theaters his whole life.

105
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,510
Keith Killed Pete Davidson destroyed,

106
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,810
even though he did this whole bit
about there's no excuse to go bald.

107
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,780
That kind of bugged me,
um, in this day and age

108
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,850
saying there was enough medicine
out there with something like that.

109
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,920
Then Jim Norton crushed.

110
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,150
Then it was David Tell
and then Leslie Jones.

111
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,790
And um,
then,

112
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,130
then I had to mop up in the end after
all those guys fucking killing man.

113
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,440
It was awesome. And thank you.
Of course, to Maureen Taren,

114
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,800
who's the real force behind the whole
thing. She puts the whole thing together.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,480
She gets all as a d d comic somehow to
show up at the same place at the right

116
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,470
time every year.

117
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,943
MMM.

118
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,570
She deals with all the finances of,
of renting out the place.

119
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:22,430
She deals with the whole fucking thing.
I'm so special thanks to her and let,

120
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:27,320
once again, everybody that came out,
everybody at the stand, you know,

121
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,850
Dave and Chris down at the stand for
always hooking us up with the after party

122
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,050
and all that shit. I'm just had a great
fucking time and that's it. All right.

123
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,840
Um,
until we do it again next year.

124
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,763
MMM.

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,000
It really is my phone.
I gotta be honest.

126
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,410
It's my favorite fucking Gig of the year.

127
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,170
It's so much fucking fun cause I get
none of these guys ever get to work with

128
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:50,080
them now because they all headline
now if I get to see him again,

129
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:53,200
it's just such a fucking great time.
Jim Florentine just came down to hang out.

130
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm trying to make sure I remember
everybody, but it was, uh, it was great.

131
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:01,120
And I was in New York for
a couple of days and um,

132
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,940
had a great time. Like the
first night, Monday night,

133
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,910
I just went out and I started hitting
all these clubs that I used to. Uh,

134
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,770
you know, I used to work out in, back
in the day when I lived in New York,

135
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,050
I went to Caroline's first.

136
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,550
Okay.

137
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,510
And uh, jumped on this
show and um, you know,

138
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:21,130
I was waiting to go on and as always,
you know,

139
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:24,490
he was always end up seeing somebody
funny comedian Carmen Lynch,

140
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:26,980
who I've seen a bunch of times before,
but I hadn't seen her in awhile.

141
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,390
I'm not going to tell you the bit,

142
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,280
but she did some bit that
was fucking hilarious.

143
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:33,790
And I believe she's going to be on
Stephen Colbert this Friday night and she

144
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,700
told me she was going to be doing the
bit, the bit's basically about, um,

145
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,710
people that can sleep through
anything. Um, so anyways,

146
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:42,880
I went up and I have,

147
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,940
I just go on stage and I do the shit
that I'm working on and some older shit

148
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:49,810
that I'm bringing back.

149
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:54,760
Then I'm putting a new spin on and it was
just wire to wire this perfect fucking

150
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:57,810
set. I was taping it. You know,

151
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,330
I have a 0.2% chance that we'll
actually go back and listen to it.

152
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,480
But the fact that I'm recording
it makes me feel good. Right.

153
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,720
And I was actually going to listen to
it because I got these gigs coming up in

154
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,321
Phoenix.
Right.

155
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:15,321
I gotta get my shit together and this
set ends and for whatever fucking reason,

156
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,660
I never touched the phone. It just shut
off after like two minutes. I'm like,

157
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:25,490
he gotta be fucking kidding me.
So then I go up to the car,

158
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:29,880
but I still felt great, you know?
And um, I was like, oh, I remember,

159
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:34,120
I remember the shit. So I
got to the comic Strip, um,

160
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:37,240
which was my home club when
I first got to New York,

161
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,190
way back in the day with Lucian,
the late Great Lucian Holt,

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,210
we would sit there and go sit there.
You'd walk in and be like, hey yo,

163
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,270
Aleutian neoma but comedian,
I just moved down from Boston.

164
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,360
Yeah.
I already have enough white guys.

165
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,130
He would literally say that

166
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,480
I already have enough void guys.

167
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,470
And I remember all these white guy comics
would get so fucking mad. It'd be like,

168
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,730
you see, you see, it's the
same thing. There's fucking
reverse facing me. It's like,

169
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,960
no, it isn't. It isn't.

170
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:12,280
You know what the fuck he's saying he
has a million of you and if you're just

171
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:15,220
going to be another fucking white guy
that grew up in a fucking Culdesac,

172
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:19,840
he already has it. It's like it's a
grocery store. All right? And he's got,

173
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:23,200
he's got fucking ears of corn
stacked up to the fucking, you know,

174
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,610
sailing and you come and you want
to buy a Bushel. Now I don't,

175
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,490
you got eat chickpeas.
They're freckles. Right.

176
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,410
So I knew what he meant when he said it.
It's like,

177
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:36,250
don't come in here and just be doing
the, uh, what's the deal with shit.

178
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,840
So I remember what he said that to me,
I just was a little frustrated,

179
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:45,040
but I just said to myself, I'll get in
here. I'll get in here eventually. But um,

180
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,541
oh man,

181
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,840
I remember there's so many fucking white
dude comics would get so mad at that.

182
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,440
Um, you could never say that to another
fucking group of people. It's like, yeah,

183
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,360
but it's white on white so he can get
away with it. You know what I mean?

184
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,720
Like black people can say fucked
up shit to each other. It's,

185
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,550
he can keep it in house.
It's like your family.

186
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,920
You can say whatever the fuck you want.

187
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:07,750
You're still going to sit down
for Thanksgiving together.

188
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,600
You have to your family. You know what
I mean? It's the same fucking thing.

189
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,870
I remember exactly where I was.

190
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,870
I just remember him smiling and nodding
and he closed his eyes and I was like,

191
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:20,180
oh my God, this guy is actually
an open person. You know,

192
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,410
I'd love to get a spot here and he's
smiling, nodding. I'm like, here comes,

193
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,480
maybe he's going to give
me a phone number of seven.

194
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,170
I already have an old white guys.

195
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,500
I was sitting there with my
stupid backpack just walking away.

196
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:37,620
We used to always use the reference
of bill Bixby at the end of the hulk.

197
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:40,920
You know, when he would just be walking
down the road. That sad piano music.

198
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,230
That's how I left the club. But, um,

199
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,350
I had my little positive fucking things
that I would say to myself to, uh,

200
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,570
to get me to, you know, to
go over to the next club.

201
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:56,480
Who the fuck was over at stand up York
back in the day. He was a good dude.

202
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,110
I remember he had a dead tooth,
that's all I remember. And I would,

203
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,130
I would go in there

204
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,350
and,
um,

205
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,970
he didn't sugarcoat it. It
off. When I walked up to him,

206
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:10,780
I remember telling him that I was a new
comic and the look of fucking pain on

207
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:11,051
his see,

208
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:15,670
just sort of looked up like I was talking
to the side of his head and he just

209
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,520
looked up and he just made this,
this face,

210
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:21,380
literally like he had a major
operation then they were,

211
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,560
this is the first time they
were removing the bandages.

212
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,540
That was the look on his
face when I talked to him.

213
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,610
I think I actually petered out
through the sentence as like, Hey, uh,

214
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,430
what was the name of, hey, so and so,
uh, my name is Bill Berber community,

215
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:38,350
just moved down from New York
and I just want to, yeah.

216
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,180
And then I just fucking walked away.

217
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,463
So

218
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,960
all these years later to still be able
to go back to New York and walk into

219
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:54,220
these clubs and they still know who I
am and they'll actually put me on stage.

220
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:57,370
The thrill of that and the privilege
of that is never fucking gone away.

221
00:12:57,371 --> 00:13:01,960
So anyways, so I go to, I
go to, uh, the comic strip,

222
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,400
you know, and now I'm feeling
all cocky because I just
had a great set. So, I mean,

223
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,430
all the years that I've done this,
I never see the bomb coming after that.

224
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,830
You know, I'm feeling all fucking good
about myself. I'm like, I'm gonna go up.

225
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,780
We're going to do it.
Just like I did it at Caroline's,

226
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,960
it's going to come out perfectly.
It's going to be fucking, you know,

227
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,260
minted into my brain and this is going
to be a nice cornerstone to start this

228
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,500
next fucking hour. Right. And of course,
I go in there, nobody's paying attention,

229
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,990
small crowds, somebody ordering and,
and, and I don't know what was going on.

230
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,210
It was this giant group of people right
in the front. And they, I think they just,

231
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I basically deduced that they all just
had the ideal childhood and they couldn't

232
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,690
relate to anything I was saying.

233
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,430
And I basically had to start over
after every single joke. And of course,

234
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:55,510
that was the, the show. One of my
friends came out to see me and, um,

235
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,970
I didn't bomb, but it was like, I
just, it was, you know, you know,

236
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,520
those days weren't just, nothing's
going right. That's like what it was,

237
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:08,290
except it was in 15 minutes
set. You know, I tell a joke,

238
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:12,160
it would work and then I try to build on
that momentum and then someone would be

239
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:15,580
ordering really loud and then I'd
have to stop and then it start over.

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,550
It was just a, it was just one
thing after fucking nother.

241
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,250
So it's like Jesus Christ.
So then I get in a cab,

242
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,390
and this is a great thing about New York.

243
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:27,391
You can do like a zillion spots jumped
in a cab and I went down to the New New

244
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,260
York comedy club.

245
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,633
MMM.

246
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,690
It used to be run by Al Martin and
they redid the whole fucking thing.

247
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,730
And,
um,

248
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,770
that was a place that I did not have any
good memories of for the first fucking

249
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,800
three years that I went there.
Not Three years, but that,

250
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:50,210
that place of all the places I went to
his heart as the Boston Comedy Club,

251
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,420
the new comedy club was the one that made
me contemplate packing up my shit and

252
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:57,974
going home.

253
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,760
That fucking place was the land of
the misfit toys fucking comedians.

254
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,770
And that was one of those comedy clubs
where you walked in and there was like a

255
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,670
hundred headshots on the wall and none
of not one picture was of anybody that

256
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:18,650
made it.
I just remember thinking shit like that.

257
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,210
The punchline in Atlanta used to be
like that Jamie Bendel runs it right.

258
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,550
I used to say Jamie,
for the love of fucking God,

259
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,310
at least near when you walk on the stage,

260
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:32,300
can you have some head shots here of
people that actually were successful?

261
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,150
Yeah,

262
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,790
they had like the head shot
of every fucking comedian,

263
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,000
whoever tried to fucking make it and
they left it up on the wall. I mean,

264
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:42,610
some of them came, turned out to
be big time writers and producers,

265
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:45,040
but you don't know that.
You only know the performers.

266
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,803
MMM.

267
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,310
So the New York Comedy Club was like
that times like fucking 30. And um,

268
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,320
oh my God, did I have some brutal
fucking sets in their brutal sets?

269
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,740
That's the first place I saw Mike Machete.
Um,

270
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,820
Oh man, that, that place. But anyway, so
they did a whole facelift on that place.

271
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,840
And like it was funny,

272
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:11,420
like psychologically I went back
to where I was when I first, um,

273
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,630
was coming down in New York and I went
in and I sort of recognize the place.

274
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:19,800
It was still sorta the same floor
plan and uh, it was a great club.

275
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,110
They had, it was the lobby
had happy, hopeful colors,

276
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:26,670
painted on the walls and shit.

277
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,890
And I went up and ended up
having a great set there. Um,

278
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,710
and then after that I went over to
the stand and then after that I, I,

279
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,120
I met up with Verdesian Derosa and
some other people we hung out. And, uh,

280
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,620
it was just, it was perfect. It
was just like, I remember this,

281
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:47,250
this is what fucking living in New
York was aside from me being chilly.

282
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,953
MMM.

283
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,221
It was perfect.

284
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:53,520
And then early in the day I found a
place where I could play drums at some

285
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:54,690
rehearsal spot.
So it was like,

286
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:58,440
it was like the perfect fucking
day and then like an Asshole,

287
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,470
I stayed out til like three,

288
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:05,580
three 30 in the fucking
morning drinking like an idiot,

289
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,690
like a fucking idiot.
Woke up the next day.

290
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:14,490
I felt like shit I didn't eat for
like the first 12 hours of the day.

291
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,300
And then what do I have to start?
I have a fucking burger and fries.

292
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,680
I was trying to go my whole time not
getting a slice of pizza in New York cause

293
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:25,200
I always do that because all the
pizza out here fucking sucks.

294
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,880
Even the shit that's good sucks
compared to a pizza on the east coast.

295
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,500
And I finally gave in after the Patrice
benefit and went to this place right

296
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,720
next to the stand and I was like,
I'm just going to get one slice.

297
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,510
And then I walked in, I was like,
oh, that one looks good too.

298
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,410
And then I got to burn the shit out
of the fucking roof of my mouth.

299
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,060
I remember sitting there just going
like, Bill, just let him cool off.

300
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,390
Just let him off. I'm like, well maybe
I'll just, maybe we'll just take a little,

301
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,000
you know when you try to go in like,

302
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:57,360
you know you'd ever see like the runt of
the litter trying to nurse off the mom

303
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:00,150
just kind of, kind of, kind of
going on. I was going in like that,

304
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,030
I just still burn the shit out of my
mouth and kept fucking shoving it down my

305
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:10,080
pie hole. So anyways, I could not
have had a better fucking time.

306
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,070
And um,

307
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,760
yeah,

308
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,190
I gotta tell you man that,
that Patrice benefit,

309
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:17,590
like we definitely have
our work cut out for us.

310
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,273
MMM.

311
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,951
For next year.

312
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:23,830
We already have a couple of people in
mind that we're going to try to get to it,

313
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,110
um, to get on the show next year.
So there you go. So that said,

314
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,390
can you tell him typing in my password?
Cause the whole fuck,

315
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,300
I just start talking like half a mile an
hour. And of course I didn't type it in.

316
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:37,960
Right on. Sorry.

317
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:42,310
The Mike sliding down my chest here. There
we go. All right, let's move on here.

318
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,580
Um,
let me see here.

319
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,480
Oh, for God's sakes, I already lost. I
was going to try to hide my youtube page.

320
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:53,960
I don't even know where the fucking
link is anymore. Um, all right.

321
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,880
Can I read a little bit
of advertising here?

322
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,360
Now that we're halfway through and after
the advertising, I'm going to tell you,

323
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:04,160
I called in a certain person's,
um, radio. Should it die today?

324
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,190
Radio show today or should a radio show
today I called in coach k and Dave syms

325
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:15,770
basketball and beyond show that's
going to be airing tonight.

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,520
MMM.

327
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,520
February 23rd at 6:00 PM
on a Sirius XM channel 84.

328
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,120
Uh,
the Sirius Xm college channel.

329
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,203
MMM.

330
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,570
But you know what's funny,

331
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,570
I can't even fucking listen to it because
I was driving my Jaguar Jackie as I

332
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:41,760
call it, drives my wife
nuts. The Beautiful Jackie
driving her down the street.

333
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,910
I did a spot at the store.
This is before I went to New York.

334
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,640
It's been raining like crazy out here and
I was driving turned down Laci and ago.

335
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,970
Yeah.

336
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,970
And I'm cruising along and
then I just hit him. Boom.

337
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,950
Out of nowhere it felt like I drove
over something metal and immediately the

338
00:19:58,951 --> 00:19:59,940
dashboard lights up,

339
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:04,230
check air pressure in the car and at the
front right tire and ended up pulling

340
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:07,770
into the gas station down there. And I
had a blown out the front fucking tire.

341
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,850
I swear to God my Prius could
have taken that hit, you know.

342
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:16,560
But now I got the fucking sexy tires on
the fucking Jaguar. Oh my God. Adversity,

343
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,870
right?
Totally just fucking implodes.

344
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,773
MMM.

345
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,630
So then I was like, alright, you know,

346
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:27,320
I had the locking lugs on it and shit
and I'm like off fuck did did please tell

347
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:32,150
me I got that thing in the glove box,
which I did. I called AAA, you know,

348
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:35,210
I got the spare out and everything and
I was looking at the Jack and all that

349
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:38,510
type of shit. And it
just, I was too afraid to,

350
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:43,440
things I paid for AAA, so I'm going
to have someone change a tire. Um,

351
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,010
okay.

352
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,640
And then secondly, I was too afraid to
because the car is low to the ground.

353
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:53,380
I didn't want to stick it underneath the
fucking car and God forbid if I fucking

354
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,020
miss the a frame, you know,
which I did a long time ago.

355
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,460
Granted I was absolutely shit faced
as with a friend of mine was the 80s,

356
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,530
you know, we were drinking and
driving and um, broad daylight.

357
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,530
He gets a fucking flat and I went to
Jack it up and I put the Jack underneath

358
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:16,060
basically the floorboards and
just put it right through the car.

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,810
Um, so anyways, they ended up
changing the tire and everything.

360
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:26,140
So I had that awful spare tire
and now my car is getting fixed.

361
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,170
I took it over there cause I want to
make sure I didn't fuck up to spit

362
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,290
suspension because I ran over the
crater with my back right tire too. So,

363
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,800
um, long story short,
I came home that night.

364
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,980
My wife fucking gave me the little
emasculating shot. She's like,

365
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,830
I can't believe you didn't do it yourself.
And I was like, oh, well, you know,

366
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:47,050
I mean, I mean I could if I wanted to. I
mean, I have, you know, I just, you know,

367
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:50,970
I got AAA. So I mean, you know,
back in the day I used to, uh,

368
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,900
I used to change tires. You know,
I, I'll never forget this day,

369
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:56,660
started telling this story about how I
change the tire on my fucking Ford Ranger

370
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,770
on the driver's side,

371
00:21:57,771 --> 00:22:01,640
on the side of route one 28 at three in
the morning and how I fucking jacked it

372
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:03,020
up and I forgot to loosen the lug.

373
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,500
So I had to bring it back down
again to take it off. And, uh,

374
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,310
and I realized the entire time I was
telling her that it was because I was

375
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:13,490
embarrassed that I felt like
she questioned my man who, like,

376
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:18,320
I was some pussy that I called Aaa. But
I do have to tell you this, I actually,

377
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,390
um, even if I knew exactly
what the fuck I was doing,

378
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,140
all I had was that little
right angle fucking, you know,

379
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,520
thing to take the lugs off.

380
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:32,540
And I just assumed that they had
overtalked the fucking thing.

381
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,850
And then there was no way I was going
to get that off unless they had another

382
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,380
piece of pipe to get the leverage,

383
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,660
which is what I learned back in the day
with the old lady three Ford Ranger.

384
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,110
But the guy showed up, he goes, no, he
goes, they tighten these by hand now,

385
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,170
or at least to do a Jaguar.
And he just took it off like butter.

386
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:51,200
And I was just like, oh Jesus,
maybe I could've done this.

387
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,130
So now I'm obsessed with the fucking weird
as Jack that's in the trunk of my car.

388
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,480
I should probably know how to do
that. You know? Hey, you know what?

389
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:02,990
Maybe my wife was right. Maybe I am
a pussy. I Dunno. Let's fucking, uh,

black tux.com/burger for $20 off your

424
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:08,440
purchase at all. Right? What
do we got next? We've got lift.

425
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,160
You know about left,
right?

426
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,860
It's the APP that gets you a
riding two minutes on demand 24,

427
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:20,140
seven for less than the cost of a cab.

428
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,650
Please include all of the following
points during your read. Well,

429
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:27,910
of course I'm going to you
fucking put them here. I can
say saint, don't skip any.

430
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,720
Um, if you tried Lyft, you
know what I mean? With Lyft,

431
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,560
you can just download the APP request to
drive driver and they show up in three

432
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:38,710
and a half minutes. On
average. That's really fast.

433
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,610
He just fucking said two minutes.
They have to get you right. Oh,

434
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,460
he said in minutes.
Not two minutes. Sorry.

435
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,040
My apologies to everybody had lift.

436
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,010
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through that 10 point safety standard,

437
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,500
including criminal in
DMV background checks.

438
00:25:57,501 --> 00:26:00,920
You'll know you'll get around
quickly and safely, safely,

439
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,170
unlike at that other one
that rhymes with boober.

440
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,070
They don't give a shit as long as you have
a face and a fucking car. Right? Well,

441
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,860
you need hands and feet basically that
if you have the basics of being a human

442
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:18,020
being, they don't give a shit
stand there with a bloody ax.

443
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,090
When he got a hatchback, right. Lift
drivers are rated after every ride.

444
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,840
It's the only the best stick around.
That's hilarious.

445
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:30,500
I just picture people getting cut in
August before the football season.

446
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,300
I'm sorry man. I'm sure. I'm
sure you'll catch up. You'll
catch on over at Uber. Uh,

447
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:38,870
you don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude

448
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,070
with Lyft. You can tip in the APP, which
is obviously leads to happier drivers.

449
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,551
I mean,

450
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:48,690
nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect
five star rating from the passengers.

451
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,850
It's just a better all around experience.

452
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,140
Plus there's a lot of people that
are just too mean to not do that.

453
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,370
You know what I mean?
I think four is more legit than a five.

454
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,630
You know what I mean? Five is just like,
hey, you know what I mean? You got me,

455
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:07,710
they're good for you. A I'll
do you a solid, give you a
five. You know what I mean?

456
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,690
Five would you get a
fucking hand job there?

457
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,820
He must have hit the bucket seats right?
Um,

458
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,460
it can reach back and give you a
little fucking a little helper.

459
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,310
What's with you tonight?
You're so relaxed. I'll tell
you I'm loving left. Um,

460
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,000
bigger isn't always better.
Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

461
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,270
but it's the fastest growing
in the highest rating. One,

462
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,780
I'm talking quality over quantity.
Thanks to lift.

463
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,470
You got an easy way to avoid drunk
driving. You never have to bum a ride.

464
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:38,940
You never have to worry about parking.

465
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,980
A lot of people are actually getting
ride a ride, getting rid of their car,

466
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:46,770
sorry.
And relying on Lyft to get around.

467
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,120
Are a lot of people doing that?
What exactly is that number of percentage?

468
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,360
That's a word I use in a fucking
argument. Who said that? A lot of people,

469
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,390
and you know what? I don't
blame them evidently. Uh,

470
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,670
right now Lyft is offering our listeners
a special deal. Get three free rides,

471
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:10,170
up to $10 each. That's up to a $30 value
when you enter my Promo Code Bill Burr.

472
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,370
Just download the free Lyft APP and
enter Promo Code Bill Burr in the payment

473
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:17,910
section.
You'll start with three free rides,

474
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,020
up to $10 each sets up to a $30 value.
If you can't do basic math,

475
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,760
that's Promo Code Bill Burr.
Enter Promo Code Belper.

476
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,770
By the way, you know,
in the middle of that,

477
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:32,220
I know I did suggest a man reaching back,
giving another man a hand job.

478
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,090
That's not a gay act when
you're paying for a ride, okay?

479
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,220
If that's just a friend of yours,
even if you were in the backseat,

480
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,610
that would be a homosexual act.
But this, you know, look it up.

481
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,060
If you look it up on a taxi drive
back slash hand jobs.com you'll,

482
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,840
you'll see that I'm actually
telling the truth. All right,

483
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,350
what are we getting next here?
What do we got next? Uh Oh wait,

484
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,270
I found my youtube channel.
Beautiful. Okay. Blue Apron.
Everybody. I, you're hungry.

485
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,680
You want to fill up your fucking pie
hole or you got to go to blue apron.

486
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,030
Blue Apron. Talk about how good it
feels to cook for yourself. I love it.

487
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,340
Oh, I love cooking for myself.
I feel it down in my loins.

488
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,640
Every time I pour myself a bowl of
great nuts or corn checks are we checks.

489
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:20,850
I'm a big fan.
I'm a big fan of the check cereal.

490
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,390
Doesn't it mean it feels good
that you made yourself something?

491
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:28,980
It feels better to cook for somebody
else, right? Then you get the praise.

492
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,880
Oh my God,
you made it immediate for me.

493
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,130
You know, my dad walked out on me when he
was trying to make me supper one night.

494
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,890
I'll never forget it.
This means so much.

495
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,060
Not all ingredients are created equal,
fresh,

496
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,430
high quality ingredients
make a real difference.

497
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:50,680
So it's important to know
where your food comes from.

498
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,760
Talk about your personal experience
with Blue Apron, the meal you cooked,

499
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:58,660
the ingredients overall, how it tasted,
how it felt, cooking it, et cetera.

500
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,990
This is my bed. In my experience.
They sent me a fucking card,

501
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,130
the $30 fucking worth of free
food or wherever the fuck it is,

502
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,670
and I haven't used it yet. So that's been
my experience, but I'm going to try it.

503
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,930
I'm going, that's a threat. I'm
going to try it and when I try it on,

504
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,820
I'm going to tell you
guys about my experience.

505
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,800
Want to talk to you about the white
apron that they put it on when I cook the

506
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,330
Blue Apron, you know, and
right day you have blue and
then my pubes are red, right?

507
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,620
Red, white, and blue. That's America
right there. He wants some lentil soup.

508
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,450
Choose from a variety of new recipes each
week, each week, each week, each week,

509
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,190
or let blue aprons culinary
team surprise you. Hey, big boy.

510
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:41,470
What do you do? Oh,
I'm on a culinary team.

511
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,040
Is that rugby recipes are not repeated
within a year, so you'll never get bored.

512
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,630
What if you like a meal? Can you
fucking order it again? That got away.

513
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,900
It's like Haley's comet,
but with food and it's every year.

514
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,040
Blue Apron has several delivery options
so you can choose for what fits your

515
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:04,300
needs and there's no weekly commitment
so you don't get deliveries when you want

516
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:07,030
them to only get deliveries
when you want them. Hey,

517
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,250
what if you're just a fat fuck
and you contend with that?

518
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:14,080
Can you just order like a different
Sunday every night they tell you,

519
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,870
you know you're fat. We need a
Sunday on a Monday, you know, sorry.

520
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,840
Each meal comes with a step,
a step by step,

521
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,870
easy to follow recipe card and pre portion
ingredients and can be prepared in 40

522
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:28,240
minutes or less. This is like when your
parents help you with your homework.

523
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,630
The next day he got the star on your
forehead and you felt a little queasy.

524
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,230
You know, like I didn't really earn
it. Did I? Blue aprons, freshness.

525
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:38,860
Guaranteed promises that every ingredient
in your delivery arrives ready to cook

526
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,540
or they'll make it right. I liked that.
That's very vague. They'll make it right.

527
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:47,020
They send a fucking Hooker rover.
Check out this week's menu.

All right, and lastly, but
not leastly. Here we go.

533
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,670
Simply Thay earlier this month,

534
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,003
ces,

up ces is this incredible trade show.

536
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,820
The fuck are we talking about
here? Okay, so this is placed,

537
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:27,821
this is trade show called consumer
electronic show show and evidently it's an

538
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:28,970
incredible trade show.

539
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,100
All the big tech companies unveiled
their newest innovations. Oh my God.

540
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,920
Can you imagine the fucking
nerds at that thing?

541
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,500
It's like seeing the future
in front of your eyes.

542
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,620
The ends. Yes. Seeing the
future while smelling blue balls

543
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,390
are sponsors.
Simply safe.

544
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:54,290
Home security was there and they had
one of the most talked about products on

545
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:58,920
the show.
The new simply safe security camera early,

546
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,410
like the sound of this bump,
bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

547
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,260
The camera connects to the
sensors in your alarm system.

548
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,120
[inaudible].

549
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,350
If an intruder tries to break in, the
camera will automatically start recording.

550
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,560
They're not only will simply save,

gun to my head. I got it all on video.

10% discount. That's simply safe.

561
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,960
burg.com for 10% off your
home security subsystem.

562
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,320
Simply Safe bird.com oh shit.

563
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,120
I just thought of a good scene in a
fucking movie that I'm never gonna write.

564
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,120
All right,
so you get the fucking simply safe system,

565
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,860
Findlay faith system,

566
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,570
and you're on the road and you check in
to your fucking home to see what's going

567
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:22,650
on. And not only do you see somebody's
sneaking up to walk the walk to break into

568
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:26,590
it, it's actually you and
you like, what the fuck?

569
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,810
How can I be there breaking into my shit?
Why would I not be me,

570
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:34,480
but be someone else stealing my own shit.

571
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,900
And then you realize it's
the robot version of view.

572
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,440
BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp right.

573
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,060
You could sell that to Tom Cruise
as he was walking to his jet

574
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,360
does yelling through the chain link fence

575
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,450
job.
Simply say you're,

576
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,140
well you see yourself breaking it to
your own house cause you're a robot.

577
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,840
And he would just stop halfway up the
fucking stairs and he'd look over his

578
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:05,650
shoulder like Bruce Lee and fucking,
I'm sorry, Bruce Willis in diehard.

579
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,990
And he'd be like, he'd be like, what did
you say? I said the, it's a fucking robot,

580
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,300
but it's you.
So you play both of them.

581
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:17,570
So there's a chance you
could win a fucking Oscar.

582
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,340
All right? Then he'd be right up
fucking against the chain link fence,

583
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:26,500
right his nose poking through one of
the holes and you've got to hand him the

584
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:29,380
script and then he'd be like, I'm sorry
you gotta go through the proper channels.

585
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,680
It's just the way it works.
Okay,

586
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:36,290
so now you're on your way
over to Scientology won't
go and Cook Donk Donk. Donk.

587
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:40,830
Donk, donk, donk, donk. Right. You
fucking Paul and Dave tether too. Right?

588
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,480
Show me with the fucking big smile,
but just a weird look in their ride.

589
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,373
Greet you.

590
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,800
Yeah.

591
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,720
They're like Mr. Cruz said you were going
to come over with your fucking robot

592
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:53,750
movie about him. I'd be
like, yeah, yeah it was.

593
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,820
And they big w would you like some tea?
And I'd be like,

594
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,730
I'm not drinking fucking anything
in this building. All right.

595
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,930
Okay. Uh, just, just take
the fucking script, you know,

596
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,730
it's some big fucking place
cause they got all that money.

597
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,930
Be Echo and take the fucking scratch.
Greg, you know something like, Dad,

598
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,670
look at that.
I gave you a fucking idea from will be,

599
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,140
I told you who to sell it to. Oh
Shit. Call it into the podcast.

600
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,910
A Paul Versey, you're on the Monday
morning podcast. I got you on speaker.

601
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,430
It's Thursday. Was it Thursday afternoon?
Just before Friday. Monday morning.

602
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:32,020
Podcast, podcast listeners.
And yet guess what Paula,

603
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,180
just checking in on you. Oh Nice.
Nice. How's it going up there?

604
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,180
It's going great, Paul. I
got to talk to coach k today.

605
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,040
I do. I says, fucking nuts. So did you,

606
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,230
did he say anything about
that loss last night?

607
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,300
Uh, I asked him really quickly,
I said, what's it like as a coach

608
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:57,690
to lose a game on a last second
bank in three point shot,

609
00:36:57,691 --> 00:37:02,280
like fucking 10 feet behind the arc.
I go, does that kill you as a coach?

610
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,980
And he said, no. He said, no.

611
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:09,981
You know what kills me is having six
fast breaks in the first half and not,

612
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,830
not getting any points on those.
And it's a classic.

613
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,260
Afterwards I thought about
it. It's just like, yeah,

614
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:18,240
he doesn't sweat the
stuff he can't control,

615
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:22,020
but it's stuff that you can control that
you should follow through on so that

616
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:25,570
the Eagle people, there's a little
teaser if you want to listen tonight. Oh,

617
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,650
an ex Sirius XM channel 84 at 6:00 PM.

618
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,230
That's fucking awesome. Jelly. She
didn't ask us something stupid.

619
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:35,200
I would have asked him something stupid.
I would've been like,

620
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:38,650
what was it like coaching, like acting
like the kids are bigger than him.

621
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,390
I was like, what? You like
coaching Christian later? Uh,

622
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,010
that's so cool.
Was He cool though?

623
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,640
Yeah. No, he didn't talk.
He was totally cool.

624
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,250
I have an idea of if I ever
get him on the podcast,

625
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,400
I know how I'm going to interview him,
but that, that I'm not going to give away.

626
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm,
I'll tell you afterwards.

627
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,920
I got a great idea on how to interview
him because I figured he's been asked the

628
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:03,921
same thousand basketball questions
a million times over and I met,

629
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,950
my goal would be to do an interview
and try to see, you know, just

630
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,240
ask you to know it. Yeah, I
know you're going to be like us.

631
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:14,140
So what do you think of cars?
You start making it right.

632
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,950
It'd be a little more involved in that.
I wouldn't have them know.

633
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:18,420
What do you think? A car
is he going? I don't know.

634
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,380
I take one of the fucking venue.
You idiot. I drive white. Yeah.

635
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,050
I drive one at drive one all
the time. Hey Dude, I got to a,

636
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,200
I gotta I gotta call you right back
because I need to wrap this podcast up and

637
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:32,130
then I got to go, uh, be daddy
daycare. All right. Hey Paul.

638
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:36,700
That's exactly what I'm going to do. Okay.
It's a pleasure. Always a pleasure, Paul.

639
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:39,850
Especially since we're across the country,
Bill. Oh, you know, God bless you.

640
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,740
God bless you and everything
that is that you do. I'll see.

641
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,260
Um, anyways, so there you
go. Hey, look at that.

642
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,340
The first fucking call and
see I had the technology,

643
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,180
everybody tries to get these fucking
DSL lines of whatever the fuck they are.

644
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:56,600
UPS Shit.
Oh,

645
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:00,550
you do is you just put your iPhone on
speaker and you hold it up to the mic.

646
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,840
I think it gives it more of
a quality sound. You know,

647
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,320
all these fucking shows. They try to make
it sound like the person's in the room.

648
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,530
They're not in the room. They're calling
me on a cell phone. A God damn it.

649
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:16,200
That's what it's going to sound like. Bunk
call, call, call, call. Um, all right.

650
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,910
So there you go.
Somebody fucking right.

651
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:22,990
Then somebody write that movie and go
make a bunch of, go make a bunch of money.

652
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,080
Go loiter around an airport Cli. You
can fucking do that. Um, all right,

653
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:33,850
I think that's it right? Oh, so
this is what I learned the second,

654
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,910
third, third time I was on stage.
It's The New York comedy club.

655
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,740
I forgot to tell you. I'm fucking
doing my set and now it's going great.

656
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,740
I'm having a great set. By
the way, I didn't have a
good senate, the comic strip,

657
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,690
and of course the recorded in shut off.

658
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,480
I'm having a great fucking Senate in New
York and I looked down and Paul verse,

659
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:55,120
he's calling me, I'm like, oh, what the
fuck? Then I go, wait a minute. I go,

660
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,260
does the fucking recorder shut off?
If somebody calls millennials,

661
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:02,530
can you help me out? And they
were all like, yes, it shuts off.

662
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,940
And I go, does it come back on after
the call? And somebody said, yes.

663
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:10,960
Well guess what? It doesn't. It shuts
off. So to all you comedians out there,

664
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:14,290
if you take an ascent, if
you feel in it, you know,

665
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,110
you might want to reach over and fucking
put it in airplane mode in case your

666
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:21,130
mother calls, you know? Then you
got to give a shit. You know?

667
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:26,080
Thanks a lot Ma. You ruined my
new Dick. Joke. Um, all right,

668
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:30,250
that's the podcast for this
week. Um, not the podcast.

669
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:33,790
Just me checking in on you. Enjoy the
music. Now you've got another half hour.

670
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:37,540
Is Shit coming your way?
That's a, I dunno. It's, it's,

671
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:42,280
it's some greatest hits stuff
from a podcast, from a, I
don't know, a time gone by.

672
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,410
So when I say, and here's my
youtube channel, by the way. Um,

673
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,071
let's see here.

674
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:53,071
It's youtube.com/user/monday
morning podcast.

675
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,370
And guess what?

676
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,210
I'm going to start making fucking videos
and I'm going to upload it. I finally,

677
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,310
you know,
I never videotaped the fucking podcast.

678
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,830
I'm going to start making videos,
putting it up there,

679
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,840
starting when I go to Phoenix,

680
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,890
I'm going to start doing the
tours of the cities again. Um,

681
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:13,240
I got some other ideas of
some shit that I can do, um,

682
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,680
to add to the channel and finally try and
build that stuff up. Um, so that's it.

683
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:21,520
Once again, thank you to everybody who
did the Patrice benefit. Rich Foss,

684
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:25,390
Dan Soder, Keith Robinson, Pete Davidson,
Jim Norton, David Towl, Leslie Jones,

685
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,840
and Maureen Taren for putting the
whole fucking thing together. And uh,

686
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,190
thank you to everybody who came out.

687
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,710
We will do it again next year and I
think I already know who I'm going to

688
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,010
reach out to to try to get on the
show. That's it. Go fuck yourselves.

689
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,453
I'll talk to you on Monday.

690
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,200
[inaudible]

691
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,080
Hey,
what's up man?

692
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:38,081
It's the Monday morning podcast and
I'm going to be multitasking this week.

693
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,510
How right in fuck it.

694
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:44,990
Heating up some pizza and that's
what I'm having for breakfast.

695
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,580
I know he's supposed to have it
cold like those douchebags on ESPN.

696
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,163
Um,

697
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,280
but I'm not gonna actually in our area
ball oatmeal and now I'm fucking hungry

698
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,710
so I'm going to have some teacher.
Isn't that interesting?

699
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:05,780
If it like that website that you guys
are all going on a fucking a kitty

700
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:09,130
fuck.com. What can they do? That
thing where you, where you, uh,

701
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,730
celebrities go on there and they,
uh, what the hell they do. You know,

702
00:43:13,731 --> 00:43:18,530
they type in a, you know, 1:48
PM just tied my left sneaker.

703
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,130
Is that, what the fuck are they giving
ends with a t how many shut me a, uh,

704
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,910
an email the other day about
that type of shit. You know,

705
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,870
seeing if I wanted to
join their, uh, their,

706
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,210
their website about whatever
that stuff is, you know,

707
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,040
it wouldn't really help if I actually had
the name of the website, which I don't,

708
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,590
of course, which I don't. Um, but anyways,

709
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,320
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Does that make any sense?

710
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,920
Does it ever make any sense? You
know, a lot about this podcast is,

711
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,560
it's fucking free,
so you can never complain about it.

712
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,720
Although people don't people
to bitch about the podcast and,

713
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,410
uh, people take it seriously
sometimes. It's amazing.

714
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:02,720
I'll do like 50 minutes a shit say,

715
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:06,290
and some of the most ignorant stuff
you're probably gonna hear all day,

716
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,270
if not the whole week.
You know,

717
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:12,020
if you hang out with really smart
people and people, they send me emails,

718
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,910
like really taking me,

719
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:18,590
I've got a lot of like
condescending emails this week. Uh,

720
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,960
that were really just,
I dunno,

721
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,080
people haven't bummed or I guess I'm
really coming off like a moron, you know,

722
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,850
which I openly admit that I
am. And also that, you know,

723
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:31,460
I'm just fucking joking around.
Some people, they, they, they,

724
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,620
they take it real seriously. I'm really
trying to fucking scroll down to this.

725
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,740
I actually have, you know, which, uh,

726
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,590
actually because of it
has made me create a, a,

727
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:46,800
a new part of the podcast. You know, at
this point, if you're new to my podcast,

728
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:49,320
what I do is I, uh, people
send me questions every week.

729
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:53,310
I try to answer them to the best of
my ability. We have the overrated,

730
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:58,250
underrated lists, people's lists of
things in life. Either of, I dunno,

731
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,350
entertainers or ra can openers,
whatever the fuck you want.

732
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:05,970
Anything that you think is overrated,
underrated, and a, I got an movie reviews.

733
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,640
That's something else. Then we got
something else. Here's the new thing.

734
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,820
Douche bag of the week.
All right.

735
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,260
This guy sent me a,
uh, an email last week.

736
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:20,820
I was talking about nature out here and
the seasons and the fires and all that

737
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:25,380
type of shit. Just bullshitting, just
trying to fill up 50 minutes, you know,

738
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,550
trying to help somebody out,

739
00:45:27,551 --> 00:45:30,540
sitting in a cubicle or some
fucking job that they don't want,

740
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,340
that they're on their way out.

741
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:37,290
And this fucking asshole decides to
take me seriously. Right. I says,

742
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:42,291
what are your rights deer farmer bill
listening to you talk about nature soil in

743
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:43,290
Los Angeles.

744
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,840
Los Angeles is seasonal fires made me
put your intelligence on the overrated

745
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:51,360
list.
Fires don't just happen.

746
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,190
Are you banking your whole argument on
the theory of spontaneous combustion?

747
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,840
Some Douche flicks a lit cigarette
out the window and there you go. Yeah,

748
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:05,130
the trees and the foliage gets brown and
dry out, but they don't just explode.

749
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,220
Do you actually think we
should just let the fire burn?

750
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,320
Can you believe all this fucking guy?

751
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,250
Like I think trees just explode.

752
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:18,330
Like I really think that they should
just let the fucking hills burn and have

753
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:22,650
people's houses burned down and that
the, you know, they're rich people.

754
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:23,640
So who gives a fuck?

755
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:28,260
I mean there's a guy have any
sort of concept that in comedy,

756
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:32,180
if you just say something that's really
fucking ridiculous and over the top,

757
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,060
the shock of it.

758
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,020
What the very least bring a smile to
somebody's face unless you take it fucking

759
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:41,820
seriously. Jesus Christ. That's
one of my favorite lines ever.

760
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:45,090
Fires don't just happen.
Really?

761
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,100
I just thought they just happened.

762
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,330
Trees don't just spontaneously combust.

763
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,900
You know what a con,
you know what I'm saying?

764
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,620
Oh look at my pizza done all that
was fucking quick. You know what?

765
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,940
I didn't stick it in the microwave.

766
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,460
I don't like the microwave because it's
something Keith Richards set a fucking

767
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:09,990
funny as that. One time I read a quote
where Keith Richards says, I don't use,

768
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,710
I don't use cell phones cause you,

769
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,020
you know you might as well stick your
head in a microphone, a microwave.

770
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,440
And that kind of killed two
pieces of technology for me.

771
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,570
But I need my cell phone
so I still use that.

772
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:25,110
So I try not to use the fucking microwave.
When you think about it,

773
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:28,140
there's something just not right about it,
you know?

774
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,430
So I'm using the old thing. I used the
fire in the stove that just happened.

775
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,120
You know, it just so happened that when I
put my pizza in there, that might stove,

776
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,610
you know,
spontaneously combusted

777
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,890
Jesus fucking Christ people when
you listen to these podcasts, no,

778
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,300
that I don't read and know that when I
really say something stupid that I'm just

779
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,280
joking.
Just fucking around.

780
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:55,300
You don't need to waste 10 minutes of
your day trying to show me how fucking

781
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:59,410
intelligent you are about how you
understand how fires are started.

782
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,150
I like how you went with the hacky
lit cigarette out the window. Oh,

783
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:07,300
maybe he's just making fun of
my intelligence there. No wait.

784
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,270
He thought I thought things spontaneously
combust. I don't fucking know.

785
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,620
But he gets douche bag of
the week. Okay. All right.

786
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:18,010
I don't mind when I do standup on TV.
If somebody you know,

787
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:20,380
sends me an email and says,
you know,

788
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:24,130
I just thought your comments about
rescue dogs, but completely ridiculous.

789
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,880
I wish abortion was retroactive.
You know,

790
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,980
just kind of shut up emails I've gotten.

791
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,440
I understand that because
those people are fans of mine.

792
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,120
They don't know what it is that I do,
but I figure if it listened to my podcast,

793
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,050
you realize, did I say a lot
of over the top stupid shit?

794
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,300
And I don't mean any of it.
All right?

795
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,980
So you don't really need to fucking
send me emails. Just, you know,

796
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,460
what I'm really trying to do is save your
time. I'm actually thinking about you.

797
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:55,600
Look at me. Be in the modern.
Uh Huh. Just like Mother Teresa

798
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,890
was actually talking to this comedian
yesterday. This Guy Doug Davidoff.

799
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:03,340
He's fucking hilarious. If you
ever get a chance to see him. Uh,

800
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:06,640
he was talking to some how would keep
came around and we'd talking about Mother

801
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,910
Teresa and he said to me
that evidently one at a time,

802
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:14,911
she was talking about poverty in the
world and she said something to the effect

803
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:19,150
of, uh, the worst poverty she's
ever seen was, I think in India.

804
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:25,410
And the second worst was actually right
here in America and was basically saying

805
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:27,034
that,
um,

806
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,080
the poverty of the spirit
in America is staggering.

807
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,510
And you know, which really made
me wish she was still alive.

808
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,270
So I could just slap that
fucking none head. Right.

809
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,340
But none hat right off her fucking head.

810
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:48,310
I am so sick of fucking
people trashing America,

811
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:54,220
you know, acting like where they
live is this fucking great place.

812
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:58,120
Okay. Now I haven't hit all
the countries. All right?

813
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,890
But I've been to Australia, I've been
to Canada. This is pathetic. I've,

814
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,170
I went to Ireland. They're the
same fucking people. They, they,

815
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:14,620
they haven't figured out what life is
all about. I went into fucking Ireland.

816
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:19,600
It's a Wednesday night in the pub is
packed with fucking people. Okay. Those,

817
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,980
that's people's dads in there who should
be at home tossing a machete lately or

818
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:27,470
whatever the fuck they supposed to do
as a dad over there and then not fucking

819
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:31,550
there. So if they really understood,
you know, what makes you happy in life?

820
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,770
Oh my God.
Did my computer just fucking crash?

821
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,220
Oh fuck.
This is the day that I've been dreading.

822
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,140
This is the day that I, I kept putting
off, I'll buy a laptop next month.

823
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:49,580
I buy one next month. Don't
do this to me, baby. Come on.

824
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:54,050
We've been through too much. Wow. To
anybody out there go to computers.

825
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,020
My screen just went,

826
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,470
I'd sort of a blue black and
all the typing is now in yellow.

827
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:08,030
I can still read it. Oh, what do I
do? I hold the power button down.

828
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,770
We try to reboot it.
Fucking is getting cold.

829
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,440
This is just a cluster fuck whatever. I
don't, I don't need the fucking questions.

830
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,660
I'll just keep going.
You know what I mean?

831
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,190
Because sometimes in life that's what you
want me to get back to mother Theresa.

832
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:27,950
You know what I to fucking candy.
You know what I mean? Yeah.

833
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,590
And I know that sac religious
to say that shit, but you know,

834
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,900
she did too much shit when everyone
else was looking. You know what I mean?

835
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:37,160
That's why I never liked about her

836
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,990
say when don't they have that saying in
the Bible there's another book I never

837
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:45,800
read. I tried to, it's
just fucking, you know,

838
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:49,010
it's like update the language already,
you know?

839
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,410
And these set it to thou,

840
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,030
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about. I just, you just really,

841
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,290
I'm sick of fucking people

842
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,980
acting like people in Canada are happier
than people in America or England.

843
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,410
Those miserable motherfuckers.

844
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,050
They can't even go to a soccer
game without killing each other.

845
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,270
Fucking Mother Teresa and she just,
you know,

846
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,050
did you sue big live spiritually?

847
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,050
Jesus Christ? I'd just like to take a
fucking pie and throw right in her face.

848
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,460
I wish I was the one to interviewing
her when she said, that's right.

849
00:52:27,461 --> 00:52:29,990
You know what might you go fucking
hang out with a leper so we can see how

850
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:32,990
fucking great you are.
Fucking

851
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:35,930
what a downer.

852
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,930
You mentioned she showed up at your
party and just sitting there looking at

853
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:42,140
everybody just judging everyone
how fucking holy she is.

854
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,170
I wonder where she ended up
in the afterlife. You know,

855
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,810
just harder sell out or what a great
fucking person she was. I gotta tell you,

856
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:58,740
man, I don't buy it. I
don't fucking buy it.

857
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,300
Everybody's got something.
All right.

858
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,730
Hanging out with lepers and all
sudden you can fucking trash America.

859
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:11,260
You can jump on that Fucking Bandwagon,
Huh?

860
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,310
Why don't you go make
somebody some cookies.

861
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,210
Do what old women are supposed
to be doing. All right?

862
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,330
They're making cookies with bill,

863
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:23,420
with his grandma's hands playing in
the background. Okay, and until then,

864
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,510
shut in your face. This is the
way I like to do on my podcast.

865
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:31,590
I like to trash dead saints.
Is she a sanctuary?

866
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,660
She'll become a saint.
That's what the fuck she was trying to do.

867
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:37,290
You know what it really was?
She was a psycho who couldn't fucking,

868
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,340
she couldn't sustain a relationship.
That's what it was.

869
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,480
And she basically, you
know, just being famous,

870
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,480
which is what most Americans want,
wasn't enough for her.

871
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:52,150
She wanted to be fucking world famous. So
she traveled all around the world. Ooh,

872
00:53:52,151 --> 00:53:56,490
look at me. Look at me. Oh, there's
some kids stuck in a mud puddle.

873
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:59,640
I'm pulling them out. I don't even
care if my none gown gets dirty.

874
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,390
That's how fucking holy I am.
Wait, did you run out of tape?

875
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:04,800
Did you run a tape and the camera?
Let me,

876
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,340
let me pause and wait for you to film
that. Put the kid back in the puddle

877
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,930
spiritually fucking bankrupt.
You know? First of all,

878
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:15,030
I don't need you to fucking
tell me that Mother Teresa.

879
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,520
I know how fucked in the head I am.
Okay.

880
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,010
Sitting there racking like you're tapped
into some sort of higher fucking power.

881
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,740
He got a lot of fucking balls,
a lot of fucking balls.

882
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,940
All right. Now that I'm down
to the crust on my pizza,

883
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,220
let me see, um, see if I can
reboot this fucking thing.

884
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,740
You know what sucks? Is there so many
fucking great questions this week?

885
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,150
So many great fucking emails while
this thing is not even responding,

886
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,540
this is just flat lining.

887
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,100
You fucking cunt. Don't do this
to me. Don't do this to me.

888
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,490
Higher cubs,
it's coming back up.

889
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,370
I know there's a lot of religious people
listening to this shit going while you

890
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:02,910
just trashed mother Theresa. The
fuck was that. Okay? Oh, here we go.

891
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:08,330
See that now by the trees were so
fucking holy. The way I just trashed,

892
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:09,870
or Mike,
my computer went to reboot it

893
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,310
or maybe she's just be in
the moderate again. She's up
in heaven. She's going, no,

894
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,720
it's okay. It's okay.
Let us computer work.

895
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,350
I don't need,
I don't need you to fucking help Terry.

896
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,480
All right. I know I'm eating.
This is fucking really rude,

897
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:33,030
but you know I have to
carb up before I do.

898
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:36,240
These podcasts are so fucking
long at this point. Um,

899
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,320
all right, whatever. Oh,

900
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,730
here's one that someone actually
sent me that I remember. You know,

901
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:48,330
you know every week when I go on and on
about how you should shop at mom and pop

902
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:51,570
store, just go blow out this great fucking
point when she's like, you know what?

903
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,180
I've tried to go into those mom and pop
places and a lot of times I, you know,

904
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:57,360
I can,
I can't even do this.

905
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,470
I'm not going to paraphrase it because
it's such a fucking great slam on what

906
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:05,850
the hell. I said, I don't want to row.
I don't want to ruin it. All right?

907
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,950
What can I talk to you guys about is I
wait for my fucking ancient computer to

908
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,530
boot up. Oh, here we go. Oh,
this is getting exciting.

909
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,280
Mac Os 10 that's my operating system.

910
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,170
You're still using that man. I
had it. And like the fourth grade,

911
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,780
you're still a loser. All
right. What do think about that?

912
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:29,410
What are you fucking base
your entire existence on your
fucking operating system?

913
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,630
You don't even have a camera on
your computer now. I don't. Yeah,

914
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,390
you jerk off on the Internet. Okay.
And someone in the Pentagon watched it.

915
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,090
So now you can never be president.
What do you think about that?

916
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,060
Cause they have that clip and
if you do become president,

917
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:44,500
you got to do everything that they say.
Oh,

918
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,100
we're going gonna take
out a fucking video. Uh,

919
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:50,790
you snapping at at 23 years of age.
All right,

920
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,420
come on. I really, you know,

921
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:55,870
I don't know how long I can sustain
this false anger as I wait for the shit.

922
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,280
Have I seen any good movies? Oh,
it was in Ogden, Utah, this, uh,

923
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,270
this weekend and I want to thank
everybody who came out to wife,

924
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:11,290
guys and Ogden, Utah. Um,

925
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,830
I had a great time and it was
one of the most beautiful,

926
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:19,090
a beautiful cities I've ever been
to in my life. Just unbelief.

927
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,770
I got up in the morning to go down and
go do the radio and I'm literally driving

928
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:28,771
down the highway on the entire left hand
side as I guess the rocky mountains,

929
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,660
but they're like, they're like right
there and the sun is just coming up.

930
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:36,050
It's on the other side of the mountain.

931
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:39,580
So there's this orange glow
outlining the top of the mountains,

932
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,870
which have snow on them.

933
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:45,220
And then below at the foot
of the mountains is the
city with the lights of the

934
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:48,460
city.
I look like a fucking postcard was unreal.

935
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,160
Um, you know, see that.
I appreciated that.

936
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,920
Mother. Teresa, how are
you going to criticize that

937
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,400
you shouldn't have to about hubs in
light of this city. That city is humans.

938
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:07,900
It's dirty. It should just talked about
nature. Is that what she sounded like?

939
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,950
Did she ever even talk or did you sit
there looking sad and judging the fucking

940
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:16,480
media who were filming her?
She laid next to somebody with Lupus.

941
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,140
Um, all right, here we
go. Podcast questions.

942
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:25,120
I think I've trashed Mother Teresa Long
enough. I'm glad I did that. You know,

943
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:30,010
I think it was long overdue.
Okay. Um, all right.

944
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:31,830
Eventually I'll get to that.
Ladies when move. You know what?

945
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:35,860
Why don't I just do the fucking questions
here. All right. Oh, you know what?

946
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:39,400
Here's one for you. I was fucking coming
out of the airport in Ogden, Utah,

947
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,760
which is brutal this time
a year, by the way. Okay.

948
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,360
And I want to show you guys that I,
that I am not afraid of technology,

949
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:47,500
which people start start,

950
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,400
I've really started to suggest because
I'm so against those automated machines

951
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:55,690
at the, uh, at the supermarkets. But, um,

952
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,950
I don't mind him at the airport. I'm
not going to lie to you. I really don't.

953
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:04,090
Especially when you're in ski season
and Ogun fucking Utah and everybody in

954
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:09,091
front of you is standing in with their
fucking skis and an overnight bag.

955
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:13,210
So, you know, when I saw
him when I was there,

956
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:17,920
as I take another bite of
pizza rudely, hey, you know,

957
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,680
why don't you go pay for a podcast?
All right? When you think about that,

958
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:24,140
go pay for a fucking podcast.
I'm sure the host won't be eating.

959
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,280
Don't get indignant with me.
All right.

960
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,590
I'm fucking hang up on you right now.

961
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,050
I'll leave you alone in your cubicle
then what are you gonna do? Huh?

962
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,420
That's right. Back to the
spreadsheet, isn't it?

963
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,680
All right then you think
about that anyways, sorry.

964
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,240
Just had to give a shit at
that. Finish that bite. Um,

965
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,030
so I'm going through the airport in
Ogden, Utah, big long fucking line.

966
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:51,950
All these push. Why I cannot even
begin to tell you how fucking white

967
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,040
Utah is. It's, it's unreal. Like I was,
you know, here like my black friends with,

968
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,690
you know, telling Shit, you know, a
couple of times had gone, you know,

969
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,910
a few of them going back to APP. You
know what? They've never said that.

970
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:06,050
And I'm actually thinking of a
Richard Pryor bit if I do that.

971
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:07,190
Your Dad was one of a friend of mine.

972
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,040
Oh wait a minute with someone famous
who said that Richard Pryor did that bit

973
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,810
about like, you know,
going back to Africa,

974
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,020
how all of a sudden was all black people
and it was beautiful and all this type

975
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:18,170
of stuff. Like, you know, I
was always, I don't want that
thinks like, you know what,

976
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,900
if you're white goatee, Utah,
you'll get that experience.

977
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,260
It's fucking unbelievable.
It's just, it's, it's awesome.

978
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:27,890
It's just fucking wall
wall. Yt it just, you know,

979
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,290
and you feel real safe.

980
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:33,620
And then you realize half of them
are named Luke and mark and John,

981
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,050
all those biblical names. And then you're
like, okay, I'm out of here. You know,

982
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:40,180
when you guys get 10% of your income
to the Mormon church, you know,

983
01:00:40,181 --> 01:00:43,720
I ask those people like, who's the most
famous Mormon who is the most, you know,

984
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,760
the top Mormon out there?
And somebody yelled out to Steve Young,

985
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,470
I thought that was fucking hilarious
and entire relationship, relationship,

986
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:53,990
entire religion.
You know what I mean?

987
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:57,740
You'd think that they would
pick somebody who, I dunno,

988
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,520
did the Mother Teresa Shit and
when they'd pick the fucking, uh,

989
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:06,680
the stand in for Joe Montana
got fucking,

990
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:08,630
it annoys me.
I don't like Steve Young either.

991
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,810
He went on and on about the Patriots
fucking cheating. I love that.

992
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:14,030
I think they keep quiet, you know,
people question the Patriots.

993
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:16,250
Super Bowl victories because
of that video tape thing,

994
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:19,610
which I totally understand, but nobody's
questioning the New York Yankees there.

995
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:21,380
Last two fucking world series victory.

996
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:25,670
You know when like three guys were on
fucking roids remember Roger Clemens?

997
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:30,200
How fucking roided up with that guy?
He threw a ball through.

998
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,780
Mike Piazza is bat,

999
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,680
the fucking bat end of it comes
flying out. I'm like 80 miles an hour.

1000
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,680
He catches it bare handed and then throws
it and he was like the hulk and people

1001
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:45,500
are, he's amped up for the game. He
was roided out of his fucking tree

1002
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,790
telling you one of these days I'm
going to climb up on New York,

1003
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,980
the Yankee Stadium.

1004
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:55,430
I'm going to fucking erase those last
two championships and then they'll only

1005
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:59,570
have 24 it'd be still 200 and ahead
of the red sox. All right, sorry,

1006
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:01,740
I'm just killing time here.
All right. Uh, oh. Anyway,

1007
01:02:01,741 --> 01:02:03,620
so I'm going to the fucking
airport and is what they ended up.

1008
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,820
So there's this big long line of a bunch
of Lawrence Welk looking white people.

1009
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,690
Everybody looks like they play like
the trombone or some shit. Right? Um,

1010
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:17,000
and uh,
so they got this thing on the side.

1011
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:20,250
If you want to bypass this is the new
thing that they have in airports. Okay.

1012
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,210
If you want to bypass the long
lines and security, you know,

1013
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,620
if you're not flying first class,

1014
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:30,621
if you just some regular Joe who can't
afford a first class fucking ticket and

1015
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:34,380
you don't want to stand in line, they
got this great new piece of technology.

1016
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:34,561
We're,

1017
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:39,300
all you gotta do is just get fingerprinted
and have your retina scan and you can

1018
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,740
go right by everybody.

1019
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,990
You know what I love about that and see
this one lady in front of me is like,

1020
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:49,830
wow, is that how that God, if
that how I've found, that's great.

1021
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,510
That's great. You fucking
idiot. Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

1022
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,160
And then everybody does it,
right?

1023
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,970
And then you standing in the fucking
line again and what's it going to be?

1024
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:02,460
How it's going to be a little bit
quicker and now they have your fucking

1025
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:05,130
fingerprint, the fingerprinted,
like you committed a felon,

1026
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,060
whatever. What are you going
to do or people be able to,

1027
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:14,100
there's going to give into it and then
I'll be the last guy not to give into it

1028
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,480
and then you know what? I'll be standing
and the old school life by myself,

1029
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:23,040
you know, then I'll be going quicker.
No, it's not going to work out.

1030
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:24,060
It's kind of like the easy pass.

1031
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:26,700
Everybody eventually got the
fucking easy pass and then,

1032
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,460
and then like nine out of 10
lines and now all easy pass.

1033
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:33,180
And now I'm fucking sitting there with
like nine guys and people don't get your

1034
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:36,900
fucking fingerprints taken to get on
a God damn plane and get your fucking

1035
01:03:36,901 --> 01:03:38,520
retina scan.
Okay.

1036
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:44,910
Jesus fucking Christ. Well, if
you're not doing anything wrong,

1037
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:49,590
I don't understand what the problem is.
I'll see you in the FEMA camp.

1038
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,170
All right, question bill. Hey Bill.

1039
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:55,620
How difficult was it to tell people you
wanted to become a comedian when you

1040
01:03:55,621 --> 01:04:00,180
first started? Um, what
were some of the reactions?

1041
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:02,220
For me it was like
telling them you want it,

1042
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,590
you want it to be a superhero
was at the same for you.

1043
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,770
I got to tell you something.
I did not even a,

1044
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:12,340
I never told anybody anybody that
I was going to be a comedian. Um,

1045
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:17,370
I didn't tell anybody I was even doing
it and I didn't let anybody even come and

1046
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:21,270
see me until I've been doing
it for well over a year.

1047
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,190
Like it's always amazed me,

1048
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:27,780
the people who have the fucking balls
the first time they go on stage to do

1049
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:32,781
stand up setting yourself up for quite
possibly one of the most humiliating

1050
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:37,530
things that could ever happen to you
other than a fucking prison rape,

1051
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,430
which is basically to stand in front
of a bunch of people and get booed off

1052
01:04:41,431 --> 01:04:44,310
stage like their first time on stage.

1053
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:49,311
Like they would bring the entire office
that the people that they work with to

1054
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:54,360
come down and see him. It's like how you,
you, you can't see the possibilities.

1055
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,120
It's like dude,

1056
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,510
they didn't ever think like what if I
fucking bomb and then I have to go back to

1057
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:04,050
work on Monday and look and no
one's going to look me in the eye.

1058
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,370
You actually going to ruin all their
weekends cause they're going to be sitting

1059
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,770
there worrying what the fuck they're
going to say to you on Monday when they

1060
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:15,630
come in. But to answer your
question, um, yeah, it's,

1061
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:19,330
it's a very, uh, it's very hard
thing to do in a weird way. You know,

1062
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,590
it's sort of like a sort of like coming
out telling people you're gay I guess

1063
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:28,360
can be fucking sense.
I'm just know you just kind of like,

1064
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:33,040
how am I going to tell my
parents that, uh, you know,

1065
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,770
all that money was spent on college
education and now I'm going to go on stage

1066
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,450
and talk about my Dick. Um, yeah,

1067
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,570
it was very difficult, but I was, my
parents were unbelievably supportive.

1068
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,420
Thank God. And then maybe I
think I in within the first year,

1069
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:54,010
I told one of my close friends that
I was doing it and I, but I did not,

1070
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:56,350
I didn't tell anybody else
because I knew what they were.

1071
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,560
You going to come out and see,
you know, you're not doing that.

1072
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:04,690
You're not doing that because
I bomb horrifically, you know,

1073
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:07,960
one out of every four times at this
point and I that's just too high a ratio.

1074
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:10,810
Some, yeah, I waited a good year. Um,

1075
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,870
and even then it was just
a couple of people shell.

1076
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,730
Oh, is that a good bite of pizza?
Which is really annoying. I'm sorry,

1077
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:28,300
I went with the quattro for Romaji
so I can have a,

1078
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,660
that'd be great if I had a fucking heart
attack right there in the middle of

1079
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:34,480
this podcast,
would you guys even know who to call?

1080
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,700
Would you help me out?
You probably wouldn't.

1081
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:43,390
You'd probably save it and trying to put
it on your website to be the first one.

1082
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,240
Comedian dies during free podcast.

1083
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,910
While it'll be hilarious and I die in
the first person I see his mother Teresa,

1084
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:56,680
just looking at me. Um, all
right, Bill, next question. Um,

1085
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,870
this is such a great question.
So is my ex girlfriend,

1086
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:06,070
the only con that assumes a breakup is
an opportunity to make a fucking pen pal.

1087
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,190
She writes once a month to let me know
what's going on and ask how I'm doing.

1088
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,053
It's garbage.

1089
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:17,560
Who told this bitch that small talk
via email starts when the fucking ends.

1090
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,150
The only note I want to see from
this Twat is a suicide note.

1091
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,980
Ah, God damn it. That fucking email
me made me laugh when I read that.

1092
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,760
Read it late last night. You
guys, I'm telling you everything,

1093
01:07:33,761 --> 01:07:36,940
everybody stepping up their game there,
the questions are getting better.

1094
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:41,710
You guys are learning how to write.
It'll be out of a fucking job here. Um,

1095
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,870
I'll dude, you don't have
to answer the emails. Um,

1096
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,270
you sound like you're
almost as angry as I am.

1097
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:53,410
So I'm going to try to go easy here
and talk you off the ledge. Um,

1098
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,100
it's not a bad thing. I
mean it, that's kind of,

1099
01:07:57,101 --> 01:08:00,040
seems like you had a good breakup and
she still wants to be friends with Dan.

1100
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:04,500
If you can kind of still
be friends with them. Um,

1101
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,110
and you always got to watch
out with women. Now you go,

1102
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:08,470
he's got to watch out because you know,

1103
01:08:08,471 --> 01:08:13,210
she might just be staying in contact
with you so she can, you know,

1104
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,000
as she's asking how you're doing subtly,
you know,

1105
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:21,740
push those buttons in your head that she
still remembers the combination too and

1106
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:21,981
you know,

1107
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:26,780
subtly let you know how good her life is
going with the airline pilot that she's

1108
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:29,030
fucking now dating or something.
You got to watch out for that shit.

1109
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:30,050
But if she's just being cool,

1110
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,970
she sounds like a cool person who maybe
every once in a while you could, uh,

1111
01:08:34,971 --> 01:08:39,290
you know, maybe get a fucking hand
job out of. All right, underrated. Um,

1112
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:43,700
van Halen is running with the
devil. This is the same guy. Uh,

1113
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:47,780
he says underrated van Halen running
with the devil. When I get my born again,

1114
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:50,090
brothers answering machine,
I always screamed,

1115
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:53,210
Jesus fucking Christ Ansia Goddamn phone.

1116
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:58,490
Then I sing running with the
devil and laugh. Ah, Jesus.

1117
01:08:58,491 --> 01:08:58,790
You know,

1118
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:03,020
there's not enough people like this guy
in the world that's really fucking funny

1119
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:06,080
and I can't even read is overrated
because he's trashing a comedian.

1120
01:09:06,081 --> 01:09:10,250
I don't do that on here, but it
was, it's fucking hilarious. Um,

1121
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,320
see what I did there.
I probably shouldn't even said that.

1122
01:09:12,321 --> 01:09:15,920
Now look and read it and I go
fuck yourself. I'm not doing that.

1123
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:19,610
Might get involved in that biggie.
Tupac Shit. All right. Uh, Bill,

1124
01:09:19,611 --> 01:09:23,300
what's your best relationship? What,
what was your best relationship?

1125
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:27,680
What was your worst? Jesus Christ.
It wasn't my best relationship.

1126
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,560
Um,

1127
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,510
probably the one I'm in now
because we can have knock down,

1128
01:09:35,511 --> 01:09:38,660
drag out fights and then the end
will end up laughing occasionally.

1129
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,500
I would say that is the best
one because when you're younger,

1130
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,720
you don't know how to be in a fucking
relationship. You know what I'm saying?

1131
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:49,400
He just sit there and, yeah,
yeah. You know, for me anyways,

1132
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:52,070
you let the other person walk all
over you and in your head you're like,

1133
01:09:52,071 --> 01:09:53,930
I don't want to fucking do
that. But then you're like, oh,

1134
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:58,190
keep it happy or it won't fuck me.
And then you just continue to lose ground.

1135
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,260
And, uh, I had met,

1136
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:04,430
I had an argument the other day that
it should have been recorded and

1137
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:07,550
transcribed and put into every
men's magazine out there.

1138
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:10,010
It was just one of those
fucking arguments. You know,

1139
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:15,011
where your girlfriend is in a
bad fucking mood and or whatever,

1140
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:18,710
thinks you did some shit and she's not
thinking about the situation you're in.

1141
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,550
So she starts giving you shit.
And you know,

1142
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,590
for the first few minutes I took it like,
what do I do?

1143
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,810
Typical Moron guy before
I finally flipped out,

1144
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,790
I seem distant. Yeah. I'm in the
middle of fucking nowhere. I mean,

1145
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:39,740
you've talked upon for a fucking
God damn rednecks out here. Okay.

1146
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:42,920
I got up at eight in the fucking morning
driving along these fucking mountains.

1147
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:47,600
Yeah, I'm a little distance.
Okay. Fuck is wrong with you.

1148
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,470
The fuck is wrong with you. Get
leave me alone. Leave me alone.

1149
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:52,483
You're being a jerk.

1150
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,430
I'm watching the bill Maher show talk
to you tomorrow and hung up on it.

1151
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:59,910
That was it. Was it? Um,

1152
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,300
you know what?
I actually started to tell that argument.

1153
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,510
I just sort of fucking bailed on it
cause that's a little too personal. Um,

1154
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:09,613
all right.

1155
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:15,720
Well I recently moved from Michigan
to go to Grad school at Ucla.

1156
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:21,700
I like to see me. This is another
fucking quite one. Here we go. Um,

1157
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:26,280
I recently moved from Michigan
to go to Grad school at Ucla.

1158
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,550
I haven't met one person
that is worth my time in la.

1159
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:33,330
Everyone is so fucking fake and thinks
that I give a shit about how many

1160
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:34,830
calories they've eaten this week.

1161
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,330
I can't enjoy myself in the nice
weather cause I carry these wonderful

1162
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:43,410
Midwestern man boobs around with me
while even the people that work at

1163
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:46,260
Mcdonald's have their shirts
off showing off their abs.

1164
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,440
Are there any cool places to go around La?

1165
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:55,670
This is such a great email because this
is what it feels like when you first

1166
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:58,350
move out to la.
Okay?

1167
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,970
You go with the usual criticism. Oh
my God, everybody's still plastic.

1168
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:05,040
Everybody's so fight.
Everybody's so fake.

1169
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,940
But the reality is if you really
read between the fucking lines,

1170
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:13,020
I didn't think you have to with this
email is when you move out here,

1171
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:16,590
you realize everybody isn't,
you know, not everybody,

1172
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:21,380
but there's a lot of people who are in
great fucking shape and you know you're

1173
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:24,960
going to be a fat fuck in Michigan and
not even realize it. You know what I mean?

1174
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,580
Cause he just didn't hurt you.

1175
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:30,330
Just a bunch of buffaloes walking
across the plane. You don't know.

1176
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,460
Everybody thinks and
then you get out there,

1177
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:37,140
you know you get so fucking freaked
when you first get that to you actually

1178
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:40,680
invent shit. That didn't happen. You know,

1179
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:44,040
everyone thinks I give a shit about how
many calories they've eaten this week.

1180
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,680
I love that line because
obviously no one came up and said,

1181
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:48,930
do you know I've had only
1200 calories this week.

1182
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,650
It's just you start creating
shit in your head, you know,

1183
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:57,150
and like the people in Mcdonald's are
in such good shape that, you know,

1184
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,500
to make the point you actually have to
act like they took their shirts off.

1185
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:03,300
You know, which I know, obviously
you're exaggerating for effect,

1186
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,900
unlike that Douche bag who sent me the
fucking thing about the fires out here.

1187
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:11,940
Um, relax dude. What's going to happen
is you're going to join a gym, okay?

1188
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:16,770
You're going to let go of that. You know,
it's not minus 3000 degrees out. So,

1189
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:20,670
um,
actually somehow not living a full life.

1190
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,480
Relax. You join a gym,
you get in better shape,

1191
01:13:24,481 --> 01:13:27,210
you learn about nutrition and all of
a sudden you start feeling better.

1192
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,060
And then one day it's January and
it's fucking 70 degrees out. And you,

1193
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:34,860
when your buddies calls from
fucking back east and he disliked,

1194
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,380
you want to be like, dude, you know,
you don't have to live like that.

1195
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,910
You really don't. So there's plenty
of cool places to go around Hollywood.

1196
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,570
Now if you want to,
you don't go. You know,

1197
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:47,070
if you're in Hollywood on fucking sunset,

1198
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,420
you might as well be in Times
Square in New York City. So, uh,

1199
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:56,490
there's plenty of cool places to go
to out in la. A lot of outdoor stuff.

1200
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,300
You could literally take up surfing
the fucking beaches. This shit.

1201
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,760
They got all these mountains around
here where you can go hiking.

1202
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,540
You got all that outdoor stuff, we'll,
we'll just melt away those man boobs.

1203
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,380
Not to mention they got a bunch
of hot broads out here. Yeah,

1204
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:13,570
there are a little plastic and fake down,
but go down to like Hermosa beach.

1205
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,340
Doesn't that just gorgeous.

1206
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:19,990
And they're not trying to be an actress
and they got fucking tell me, just,

1207
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:21,100
just go to go down there.
Okay.

1208
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,460
Do you get out of the usual fucking
Moron riff Raff when you go down there on

1209
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,530
the beach?
That definitely the pit bull guys and the,

1210
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:30,310
the Douche bags with their motorcycles
and stuff. But believe me, you know,

1211
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,490
I've seen Detroit, so you really
shouldn't be bitching. Um,

1212
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,400
I guess you wanted literally
a list of cool places. Um,

1213
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,140
I don't know if you've
noticed the way I've dressed,

1214
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:42,970
I'm not exactly a trendsetter. Um, and
I know where there's some cool bars,

1215
01:14:42,971 --> 01:14:46,030
but I'm not going to say them
over my podcast because, um,

1216
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:50,590
I don't need 11 of my 14
listeners showing up ruining me,

1217
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:54,730
drowning my sorrows in my whiskey.
Okay. All right, next one. Bill.

1218
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:56,530
Love the podcast. Love you. Stand up.

1219
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:59,680
I've decided to follow your lead
in the self checkout crusade.

1220
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:03,310
I no longer use them anymore because you
said because what you said makes sense

1221
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:05,590
to me. Jesus. Thank God I
only got to some person.

1222
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,540
I'd like to offer you a deal though.

1223
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:10,380
Since I've given up self
checkout lanes at grocery stores,

1224
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:13,600
all I ask is that you look
deeper into paying bills online.

1225
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,450
I've done it for years with no problems.
I love it.

1226
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,800
I understand your concerns about it,
so that's why I merely look.

1227
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,120
I say merely look into
what into it with your bag.

1228
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,720
It's okay to be skeptical of technology,

1229
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:32,830
but don't be skeptical because it's
technology. Have a great day. All right,

1230
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:36,190
well that was my point
earlier. I'm not, you know,

1231
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,010
I'm not a hundred percent
against technology. Obviously.

1232
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,530
I'm a big fan of penicillin

1233
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,110
loving the airplane.
I'm not. I'm just like,

1234
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:51,880
my thing is I don't like
technology where you know,

1235
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:54,940
they're acting like it's making it
easier and what they're really doing is

1236
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:59,290
getting a ridiculous amount of personal
information on me that they can then use

1237
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,520
for God knows what,

1238
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:05,770
like fingerprinting me and scanning my
retina at the fucking airport so I can

1239
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:08,440
get on a Goddamn plane,
I think goes above and beyond.

1240
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:13,330
It goes above and beyond and I know
it can easily be explained away by the

1241
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:16,720
fucking tour to emails and
I'm going to get, you know,

1242
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:21,721
and they're all going to be of the same
ilk of trusting the psychopaths at the

1243
01:16:22,631 --> 01:16:27,250
top of the heap. And I just don't,
that's it. And as far as, uh,

1244
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:31,000
you know, paying your
bills online, I mean,

1245
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:34,130
the only safety you have is that you,

1246
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,200
that a bunch of people do it and you're,

1247
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:39,580
you're stuck and know you're in
the middle of the herd, you know.

1248
01:16:39,581 --> 01:16:42,460
But if you get to the outside of the hurt
and you have that little fucking deer

1249
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:45,540
limping or that baby deer, okay, these,

1250
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:49,960
you know, I don't know. You can
do it. Do it if you want to do it.

1251
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,240
I'm just saying I don't fucking trust it.

1252
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,530
I'm not going to put my
bank account numbers on.

1253
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,400
I was mainly talking about banking.

1254
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,730
I wasn't necessarily talking about
paying bills, but even that shit,

1255
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:04,450
I just don't like doing it. You know?
I don't like doing it. You can do it.

1256
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:10,280
Go for it. It's all for you. I don't
know. I like the old school, you know,

1257
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:14,630
I take out my checkbook. Nobody sees my
account numbers. I put it in an envelope,

1258
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,430
some guy at the post office fucking
when no one's looking at opens it up,

1259
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:22,240
then he looks at it. Then he's
got to do a whole bunch, you know?

1260
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:24,590
You know what I'm saying?
All I got to worry about,

1261
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:26,300
it's the people at the post
office. I, you know something,

1262
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:29,180
I actually did a little research on this
after buddy of mine who was a lawyer

1263
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:33,410
and I asked him, what is the number one
way people get their identity stolen?

1264
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:37,190
And he said, uh, people
stealing your mail.

1265
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:41,870
And uh, what did he move on?
Why did he put it? Miss Miss,

1266
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:45,110
miss guided trust or something like
that. Basically you try, you know,

1267
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:49,540
you're dating some chick and
she fucking, you know, you know,

1268
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:52,640
you think that she's enjoying you as
much as you're enjoying her and she's

1269
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:54,860
really just say, oh, whatever. You
know what I mean? Somebody at work,

1270
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:59,870
you leave your purse there or your wallet.
We know what misguided trust means.

1271
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:03,200
You don't need to explain it.
I am sorry. So I, I, you know,

1272
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:05,690
I get worried about that type
of stuff. And I also, you know,

1273
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,820
the thing about doing banking online is
I realized that every account is insured

1274
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,150
up to 100 grand. And I've heard rumors
that they're going to bump it up.

1275
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:18,380
Somebody sent me an email that they're
going to push it up to two 50. But, uh,

1276
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,310
I don't know about you guys,

1277
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:24,110
but the last five years looking at how
insurance companies handle claims and

1278
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,050
bankers, those are like two of the
most corrupt fucking people out there.

1279
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:29,660
Insurance companies and bankers.
And I'm not putting my, uh,

1280
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,650
I'm not putting my faith in them.
You know,

1281
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,370
I don't understand why people are
still doing that. Like I said before,

1282
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:43,190
I don't know. I'm a paranoid psychopaths
and sometimes it hurts me in life,

1283
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:46,790
but a lot of times it helps me and
I think this is going to help me.

1284
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:48,320
I'm not fucking banking online.

1285
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,590
You guys can do what you want to pay
your bills online. You can do it.

1286
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:54,560
I'm not doing that either. And
uh, I'm not getting my fucking,

1287
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:57,950
I'm not getting fingerprinted and my
retina scan to get on a fucking airplane.

1288
01:18:57,951 --> 01:18:58,850
I'm not doing that either.

1289
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,950
And I'm not going to the grocery store
scan in my own fucking food and bagging

1290
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,010
my own groceries under the guise that
it's quicker and easier. It isn't.

1291
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:10,460
It's a lot easier for me to just stand
there with my hands and my fucking pocket

1292
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,810
and have someone else do it for free.
All right.

1293
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,600
That's all I'm saying.
So I'm sick of arguing this point.

1294
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:20,870
If you want to use the automated
fucking grocery store thing,

1295
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:25,100
by all means go ahead and do it. If you
want to bank online, pay your bills,

1296
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:28,940
by all means go ahead and do it. If you
want to get your fucking retina scan,

1297
01:19:28,941 --> 01:19:32,450
it'd be fingerprinted. I'm not saying
don't do this shit. I'm saying,

1298
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:37,670
I guess I do say don't do it, but
I think I say please don't, I,

1299
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:41,690
I dunno. Whatever you want to do it,
go ahead and fucking do it. You know,

1300
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:45,200
just know that I'll be sitting there
thinking that you're a moron. Okay.

1301
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,230
And if you can handle that, then that's
a, that's a great, that's, you know,

1302
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:51,260
you'll be building yourself
up spiritually. Why should
you care what I think?

1303
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:56,240
All right. A long time ago I, uh, talked
about what was the sweet spot in history,

1304
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:01,490
you know what I mean? Like living in this
country, like what was perfect, you know,

1305
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:04,880
I'm looking at, you know, some
people who are really old, you know,

1306
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:06,200
if you're in your 80s or 90s,

1307
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:09,060
it's still had to live through the
fucking depression, the dust bowl,

1308
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:14,430
all the wars. And I was trying to think
what, what the sweet spot was. And

1309
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,110
I don't know, I was trying to
think, you know, maybe if you,

1310
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:21,960
if you just Miss World War II,
she had flat feet,

1311
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:24,630
you didn't have to go to Korea and
then you were too old to Vietnam.

1312
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,690
I don't know. I look at a lot of it
like, uh, like a cars and sports.

1313
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:31,981
So I want to be,

1314
01:20:31,981 --> 01:20:36,810
I would want to be alive when
sports weren't segregated,

1315
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:42,000
you know, so I could see the
Lebrons and that type of shit.

1316
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:45,570
But I also want to live when
the fucking cars with a shit.

1317
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:50,370
And for me that's the
forties, 50s and 60s. So, uh,

1318
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,440
I guess the, the first year
I would have to sit through,

1319
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:58,410
you know,
all white people playing all sports.

1320
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,250
But as long as I didn't know what
black people look like playing sports,

1321
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:04,110
what I know that it sucked.
You know what I mean?

1322
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:06,120
It's kind of like when I first was a kid,

1323
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:08,970
I used to listen to Mitch Miller records.
I didn't know any better.

1324
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:10,380
I didn't know led Zeppelin existed.

1325
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:13,770
And then I find out they stole
their first two albums. Okay.

1326
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:15,960
We're going to get into that again,
built to shut the fuck up. All right,

1327
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:16,291
so this is,

1328
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:20,190
this person is basically weighing in
what they think is the best period. Uh,

1329
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:24,240
the sweet spot where you could come
up, come of age, live a good life,

1330
01:21:24,241 --> 01:21:25,170
have a nice car,

1331
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:28,710
and not have to deal with these scary
fucking times that we're living in right

1332
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:29,640
now. Uh, hey bill,

1333
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:32,200
about six months ago you
were talking about the sweet
spot in America, blah, blah,

1334
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:36,120
blah, blah, because I couldn't decide
on when are you couldn't, um, you said,

1335
01:21:36,121 --> 01:21:38,520
well today I was watching
dazed and confused.

1336
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:41,190
You know that movie
there and I think it's,

1337
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:46,430
I think the sweet spot is a senior
in high school in the 1970s when the

1338
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:50,281
meatball,

1339
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:55,230
Mike Lowell over the green monster
sweet spot on the bat of American. Oh,

1340
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:59,850
I'm read that wrong of course, because
I suck at reading. He said, I think, um,

1341
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:04,650
I think it's senior in the 1970s was
the meatball Mike Lowell over the green

1342
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:08,100
monster sweet spot on the
bat of American history here,

1343
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:11,910
out of wars and all, all
that. But all that bullshit,

1344
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:15,990
but it's before global warming,
population crisis, crystal Meth,

1345
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,890
hyperinflation, steroids, and
George Bush share. We don't,

1346
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:21,900
we wouldn't have toys like
the Internet and the Ipod,

1347
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:26,430
but I'm 20 now and I'll gladly give
up all the achievements to go back.

1348
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:31,860
Uh, I just fucking lost warning. It wasn't
this, I'm such a bad out loud reader.

1349
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:36,720
Uh, all the achievements to go back to
the seventies rock and a mullet speeding

1350
01:22:36,721 --> 01:22:37,830
around in a caprice,

1351
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:42,600
not giving a fuck unaware that fossil
fuels are exhaustible smoking weed out of

1352
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:47,601
those Cheech and Chong Polak poorly rolled
joints back when we'd wasn't a laced

1353
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:52,620
with amphetamines and h and
habit forming. Uh, well,

1354
01:22:52,621 --> 01:22:56,070
I mean they didn't have a gas crisis
in the early seventies, but uh, yeah,

1355
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,130
I know what you mean. That is a great
fucking time. Yeah. Not wearing a condom.

1356
01:22:59,131 --> 01:23:03,390
That's another great point.
Morning after pills and penicillin.

1357
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:05,590
Have a nice day. These
guys here. You guys,

1358
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:08,260
you guys are all making great points
this week. It's really well written.

1359
01:23:08,261 --> 01:23:11,590
If I could just fucking read it.
Um,

1360
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,640
I'd have to agree with that because then,

1361
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:18,400
you know what's else is great is if
you came with New York in the 70,

1362
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:19,810
if you were a senior in the 70s,

1363
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:24,220
you could also pick up a muscle car at
that point, you know, be 10 years old.

1364
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,950
He could probably get it for nothing.
You know,

1365
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,310
because people didn't realize that
fucking all these Goddamn nerds,

1366
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:35,150
we're going to come around and ruin it.
Bloody wrath restoration,

1367
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:40,240
all original. It's got the original
radio. Yeah. It's $170,000.

1368
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:42,060
And he had said that

1369
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,340
you haven't seen those fucking those,
you know,

1370
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:49,000
I think those are bailing want to
go to for those as a banker, right.

1371
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:54,340
Dr Assumption who can afford to fucking
pay $150,000 for God their Mustang

1372
01:23:55,900 --> 01:24:00,580
I Omega Mike gets anymore. Um,
alright. Douche bag of the week.

1373
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:05,200
I already did this. Would you like
to hear my snarky email back to him?

1374
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:05,921
Why?
Yes.

1375
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:10,180
I actually do believe the trees just
explode and fires only burned brown shit.

1376
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:14,230
I've never heard of this cigarette lit
cigarette phenomenon that you speak of.

1377
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:18,730
Could you elaborate? That's what a,
that was a tone I took with them.

1378
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,820
God, I'm so stupid. Thank you
for putting me in my place.

1379
01:24:21,821 --> 01:24:23,230
It's amazing that you caught that.

1380
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:26,140
I record 50 minutes of
ridiculous statements last week,

1381
01:24:26,141 --> 01:24:29,350
none of which were meant to be taken
seriously except for the part about the

1382
01:24:29,351 --> 01:24:30,184
fires.

1383
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:34,030
I was by no means deliberately saying
ignorant things in order to give someone a

1384
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:38,140
laugh. I truly believed every word of
the fire state of the Union address.

1385
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,110
Thank God you let me know.
Both the serious,

1386
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:45,250
serious nature and the cause of fire.
Fire's just don't happen.

1387
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,990
I've got to commit that to memory.

1388
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,470
I will make sure to detract my
statements next week, which I didn't.

1389
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,510
I actually just created
Douche bag of the week,

1390
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:56,350
but for all I know that person was just
trying to be sarcastic back to me and I

1391
01:24:56,351 --> 01:25:00,460
misread it. Maybe that's
what it was. Um, all right,

1392
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:05,050
and here's some information. Um, you
know, I say a lot of shit that, you know,

1393
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,270
evidently I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

1394
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,340
I was just bitching about
muscle cars being overpriced.

1395
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:12,100
I always talk about vintage guitars,
you know,

1396
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:17,101
they have some fender strat with Johnny
Rotten snot on the fucking fret board

1397
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:21,550
and it gets 50 grand now and this guy
is saying you're complaining about the

1398
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:24,730
cost of finches guitar
guitars is largely unfounded.

1399
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:28,120
I'm going to stop right there sir and
let you know that most of my opinions are

1400
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:29,170
largely unfounded.

1401
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:35,260
That should be the name
of my next next special,

1402
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:40,030
largely unfounded specialize
specifically in the case of both, uh,

1403
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:44,740
fender and Gibson, the two companies
you cited in your rant, um,

1404
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,470
where the quality of the,

1405
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:51,370
their production line took a huge nosedive
from the mid eighties up until the

1406
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:52,420
last two years or so.

1407
01:25:52,421 --> 01:25:56,290
Switching to oversee workers for the bulk
of their production using cheaper wood

1408
01:25:56,710 --> 01:26:00,400
paint, electronics, overall
craft, craftmanship, et Cetera,

1409
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:03,130
have all added to the
embarrassingly low quality.

1410
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,270
Most instruments on the market today.

1411
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:08,570
I'm definitely with you on
muscle cars being overrated,

1412
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:13,571
but any Gibson or fender model made before
1978 as well worth a decent chunk of

1413
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:18,470
change. Alright, great fucking
points putting me in my place.

1414
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:22,400
Yeah,
it's like bid my,

1415
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:25,370
my thoughts on that away
beyond largely unfounded.

1416
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:27,240
I really don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. The,

1417
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,100
I'm just equating it to like the housing
market where if you bought a house 10

1418
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:32,930
years ago,
that was a great thing to do.

1419
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:36,620
But if you bought one fucking three
years ago or in an apartment like I did,

1420
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:37,850
you're a fucking moron.

1421
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:43,090
And when I'm saying right now is I think
once everybody is aware that how much

1422
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:48,770
something is worth and that
it's going to be, you know,

1423
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:53,060
worth a lot of money in the future,
I really feel like nine times out of 10

1424
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,560
once it's exposed like you want to be
buying those guitars 2010 20 years ago

1425
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,680
when nobody realized no one really thought
about how much they were going to be

1426
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:06,590
worth. Cause then you could get them
for nothing. You know what I mean?

1427
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,750
But now you're paying top dollar.

1428
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:12,230
I mean you're paying 50 grand
for offender fucking strat.

1429
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,780
I mean if they're going to be what,
the hundred and three year,

1430
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:19,820
I mean I don't, I don't know. I
don't, I don't understand that.

1431
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:24,140
And it's Kinda like houses,
right? I bought mine,

1432
01:27:24,141 --> 01:27:26,060
I bought an apartment at
the peak of this shift.

1433
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:30,610
I bet it's not even worth two thirds
of what the fuck I paid for it.

1434
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,470
And now it's all coming down.
That's all I'm saying.

1435
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:35,750
I think that's what I'm saying.

1436
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:40,070
Maybe I'm trying to warm out of it because
you told so totally fucking nailed me

1437
01:27:40,071 --> 01:27:43,280
to the floor on that one. All right. You
know what? I can't argue. All you guys,

1438
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,860
at some point, I have to admit, I
don't know what the fuck I'm talking.

1439
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:48,110
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. I'm goddamn comedian.

1440
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,250
I just looked at a guitar and I'm like,
yeah, it sounds good. But you know,

1441
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,850
it's fucking, it's kind
of scuffed up, you know,

1442
01:27:55,851 --> 01:27:57,680
you'd think for fucking the 50 grand,

1443
01:27:57,681 --> 01:28:02,660
it wouldn't be so scuffy that's all
I'm saying. I'm speaking of which,

1444
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:03,560
this is the last thing I'm gonna say.

1445
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:08,280
And then I've got to wrap up this
podcast at 45 minutes is uh, I went to a,

1446
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,270
I took a drive down the street the
other day and I swear to God yesterday,

1447
01:28:11,271 --> 01:28:16,271
Sunday out here in la and he three miles
stretch driving over to the highway.

1448
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:19,820
Um,
I saw 14 open houses.

1449
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:24,740
Um, I've never seen anything
like this in my fucking life.

1450
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,100
And uh,
I don't know.

1451
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:32,030
And if for some reason you can also get,
can somebody explain this to me?

1452
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:37,100
Why there's all these houses for sale.
I understand why all the houses for sale,

1453
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,390
I get that.
Okay.

1454
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,190
But what I don't understand is why you
can also get a great deal on rent out

1455
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:46,970
here.
I would think that all those people,

1456
01:28:46,971 --> 01:28:49,820
obviously they're leaving their
houses that would cause the rental,

1457
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:54,140
the amount of rental units to go down
because people who are living in houses

1458
01:28:54,141 --> 01:28:55,430
that they air,

1459
01:28:55,431 --> 01:29:00,431
quote owned would then be now looking to
rent and then rents would be going up.

1460
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,890
But it's the reverse out here.

1461
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:06,510
So the only thing I can guess is
that people are leaving Los Angeles.

1462
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,820
They just saying fuck it, you know,
I don't know. I don't fucking know.

1463
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:12,661
Is that,

1464
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:15,570
is it like that where you guys are rent
or there were a bunch of open houses?

1465
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:18,240
I mean it did. It's, this guy told me, uh,

1466
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:20,880
yesterday was trying to
say that they're out here.

1467
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,710
They're giving you first he fell,

1468
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,520
he found a place they're giving the
first month for free and you get in a

1469
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:31,470
fucking iPod. And I actually
thought like, that's a great deal.

1470
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:33,150
I'm going to go do that.
And I'm like, wait a minute,

1471
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:37,800
it's going to cost me twice that to
fucking pack all my shit up and move.

1472
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:40,680
Why don't I just go buy an
iPod and stay where I'm at?

1473
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:45,870
See that I'm not always a
moron. Right. All right.

1474
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,010
This was a really weird podcast.
I understand that. But um,

1475
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:51,810
Oh,
before I,

1476
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:56,350
before I a step away here from the phone
and get on with my God Damn Day, um,

1477
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:00,270
I want to let you guys know
that the contest winners,
the, uh, the birds are away.

1478
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:04,650
I send out the DVDs so I don't have to
worry about being called the eight wastes.

1479
01:30:04,651 --> 01:30:06,390
I sent two out of three of them.
One person,

1480
01:30:06,391 --> 01:30:10,980
I'm still waiting for you to email
me back and you know who you are.

1481
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:14,550
You're the guy who drove up to me when
I was in Houston, Texas outside the bar.

1482
01:30:14,551 --> 01:30:18,180
Freaked me out and handed your
prostate exam manuscripts.

1483
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:22,920
I still need your, uh, your address
so I can send you a DVD. All right.

1484
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:27,180
And uh, and that's basically it. And
uh, what have I got going on this week,

1485
01:30:27,181 --> 01:30:30,150
this week? Uh, for all you
people in lots of Hong delays.

1486
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:34,950
I'm going to be doing a benefit down
at the comedy store tomorrow night, uh,

1487
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,880
Tuesday, February, uh, 24th,

1488
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,060
I think.
I got the flyer right here on my desk

1489
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,380
and when I got here, wait, no, wait,

1490
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:50,430
it's on the 26th c then
almost hyped the wrong date.

1491
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:54,270
I'm a fun way am,
and then I canceled that other gig.

1492
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:57,840
I could have done the other gig.
All right.

1493
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,490
February 26th I'm going to be at the
comedy store and it's a benefit for world

1494
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:05,340
hunger. It's going to be me,
Kevin Nealon, Jeff Richards,

1495
01:31:05,341 --> 01:31:07,880
and a bunch of other hilarious
fucking people. Look,

1496
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:11,210
I've built myself first there,
the EGOMANIAC than I am. Why?

1497
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:14,350
When I say Kevin Nealon Farsi is actually
famous in his own. That great break.

1498
01:31:14,351 --> 01:31:17,490
Show the weeds. I just fucking
Bang my head on this. Goddamn.

1499
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,530
I got this room and my fucking apartment
where you're supposed to have like they

1500
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:26,550
had this, this, this
goddamn iron chandelier.

1501
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,230
Alright, that's hanging from the
ceiling and I don't know what it is.

1502
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:34,410
I'm about five [inaudible] 10 and this
thing hits me right in the center of my

1503
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:38,760
forehead. So it's probably
hanging about five foot eight. I,

1504
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:42,990
I'm supposed to have a table underneath
it and I'm supposed to sit at either end

1505
01:31:42,991 --> 01:31:47,040
of it, you know, I guess can you
please pass the peas? But I don't,

1506
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:49,140
I use this as a fucking room.

1507
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:53,280
I got my desk up against the wall
and I have this fucking light,

1508
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:56,250
ah,
fucking three days.

1509
01:31:56,251 --> 01:32:00,660
I Bang my forehead on it and have
a forehead like superfly snuck off.

1510
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:04,420
All right. Um, that really hurt. That's
one of those ones where you hit your head.

1511
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:05,010
So Hi.

1512
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:09,580
Hard that like only one either your eyes
starts tearing up your teeth fucking

1513
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,650
slammed together. Okay.
Regrouping. Anyways,

1514
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,520
I want to thank everybody for coming
out to my show out in Ogden, Utah.

1515
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,220

of rednecks or whatever,

1516

will definitely be back cause it's an

awesome club.

1518

Wise guys is a great club and the fans
were great out there and it's only a

1519
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:30,670

is just game set and match.

1520
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,820
I will definitely be there and uh,

1521
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:38,530
