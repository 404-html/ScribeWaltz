1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,910
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:06,060
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,130
November 25th, 2013. How you doing?

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,060
How are you happy thanksgiving.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,280
Eat some Turkey and
some stuffing and Gravy

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,500
v.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,330
Then he'd saw Paul.
Why?

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,460
I love Thanksgiving. I really
do. But you know, I'm actually a,

9
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:34,930
I'm leaving the country of
going to be an ex patriot.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,190
Now I'm leaving the country. Um,
the Wednesday before thanksgiving,

11
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:42,100
I didn't even realize that this is going
to be the first thanksgiving I ever

12
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:46,840
spend, you know, outside of the country.

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm actually going to be over in
Italy like, like, like one of the,

14
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:56,860
some of the army guys back in the day in
World War II sitting over there when no

15
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:01,660
moon itch your eye like a big pizza pie.
Shoot him in the face.

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,300
Um, getting ready for my big European
tour over there. Have you buddy?

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,330
You know, I didn't realize when
we went to book this thing,

18
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:13,660
how fucking cold it was going to
be in Scandinavia in December.

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,230
And I just did some, uh, some
interviews there for the,

20
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:21,080
a Norwegian journal or
the fucking Swedish, uh,

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,560
a periodical, whatever the fuck I, whoever
I was talking to over there. And um,

22
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,560
they told me they were laughing
that I was coming over there like,

23
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:34,420
why are you coming over here now?
Which is never a good sign. You know,

24
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:39,421
when the people of the nation are not ope
we like or not welcoming you with open

25
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:44,650
arms, they're immediately going like,
yeah, you sure you want to do this?

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,290
I guess the sun goes down
at three in the afternoon.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,750
I can't believe it's like,
is it that far fucking north?

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
And I'm starting to think about
it. I'm like, wait a minute.

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,270
If he goes straight across from
Massachusetts where I grew up,

30
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:08,250
where do you end up? Mediterranean
Sea. The south of Spain.

31
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,950
I okay. I don't even fucking know. And
then I'm thinking like, wait a minute,

32
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:14,610
they've wired a minute, their way,
the fuck up there. They're like,

33
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:19,560
Yukon territory's did that high up, you
know, cause you look at a fucking map,

34
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:24,120
it's flat. You spin a globe, you can't
see it. It's, it's around the corner.

35
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,090
Where is it? Where is, you know,
am I supposed to take a strength?

36
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,170
I didn't fucking know.
So evidently it's going to,

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,840
the sun's going to go down at three,

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,790
then it's going to be cold as hell.
I don't give a shit.

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,560
It's still going to be a good time,
you know, break up my party. Um,

40
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,170
yeah.

41
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,660
You know what's funny though is I
talked to this person in Iceland,

42
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,550
the radio show, and they said, okay,
before we start this, I got to do the, uh,

43
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,620
I got, uh, you know, they were, we were
recording it for the radio and he goes,

44
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:59,030
all right, before I, uh, I asked you
the questions, I just have to do a

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,560
intro, so I'm like, this, this,

46
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,230
and this is always cool because they
speak in their native tongue and then they

47
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,190
go right back to you.

48
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,370
And I had never heard the Icelandic
language and it's fucking cool as hell.

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,580
You know what it sounds like. Remember
when they would play lyrics backwards,

50
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,960
that devil shit on, on metal
records. That's what it sounded like.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,720
And he's like, okay, I'm going to
do the intro of a Ba. I can't do,

52
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,100
I can't even do the accent.
Then he just goes,

53
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,900
Rashi up to the opposite cause
I'm about to gift build births.

54
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:31,901
It's riskier option and offering
more stand up comedy or a lot barrel.

55
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:37,030
So you're coming to our
country, it's like, oh my God,

56
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,050
I opt these fucking people going to be
bilingual because there's no way I could

57
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,210
ever make that.
You know?

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,030
There's certain languages that I
feel like I could make like Spanish.

59
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:51,031
I know if I could just find some beautiful
Spanish woman to teach me Mexican,

60
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,930
Latino,
whatever the fuck I'm supposed to say.

61
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,740
If you just come over here with your
Brown titties hanging out of your fucking

62
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:04,390
beautiful white blouse, you know,
I could learn the damn language.

63
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,880
All right? If I could get some French
woman dress up, like one of those horror,

64
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,220
I would have it down.

65
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,610
The problem is as I sit here with this
Rosetta stone and I'm talking to a

66
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:17,630
fucking computer,

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,010
where is the motivation?

68
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,720
The second I walk away from the computer,

69
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:30,700
I can immediately speak English
and to do anything I want.

70
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,330
I can get food, I go to Africa, I go to
Asia, they can do whatever I want. Um,

71
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,410
why don't I just think of that
weird girl and a breakfast club? Um,

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,970
I didn't know if that was
the proper quote. Anyways,

73
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:48,850
back to what the fuck I was talking about.
So like the motivation isn't there.

74
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,200
So what I think I'm going to do this
next time I try Rosetta stone to learn

75
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:53,981
Spanish,
French,

76
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:56,890
whatever the fuck I'm trying is I'm
just going to have beautiful women

77
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,940
like pictures of them on the wall.
Even then what's second to do?

78
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,390
You don't what they should have. They
should just start like, you know,

79
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,260
like they have like those,

80
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,380
those late at night talk to some hottie
and they just show these ridiculously

81
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,100
hot women. They're like, yeah, hey,

82
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,460
for some reason nobody's buying
me a bunch of stuff tonight.

83
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,410
I'm just sitting here with my panties on.

84
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,240
Why don't you call me up and talk to
me? You visited back fat. Fuck right.

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,740
Any of you, you know what isn't
true, but you want to believe it.

86
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,730
So this might be a good business and I
don't want to start a fucking business.

87
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,360
All right. I have no, so
feel free to steal this idea.

88
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,590
What you do is you hire a bunch of
hotties to Skype with people to teach them

89
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:46,650
the language of the nation.
Nah,

90
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,200
that would work because the might have
times that they would click to talk to

91
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,650
somebody and all they would see is
just some dick getting fucking stroked.

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,350
That would just be really traumatic
for those beautiful women.

93
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,410
And why would you want to that?
You know, if they were nice enough,

94
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,700
if they were nice enough to like take
time from being hot to teach somebody at

95
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:07,821
different language,

96
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:11,120
they're probably at the person so
they shouldn't be subjected to that.

97
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,440
All those other horse that are just
walking around being hot for hot sake for

98
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,190
the sake of being hot and getting
a free Jello shot. You know, I,

99
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:22,580
I wouldn't have a problem with them
having some video dick like shook in the

100
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:26,840
face. Does that make sense? I'm
unbelievably fucking jet lagged.

101
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,420
Everybody's speaking of smart people.
I did it,

102
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,050
a college gig at this theater and a,

103
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,540
and I literally flew
out and came right back.

104
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,690
So I don't even know the name of it.
I have no idea.

105
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,000
It's the second time I've been there
and I want to shoot a special there.

106
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,980
The crowd was fucking awesome. They're
okay. I showed you my respect. But um,

107
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,420
I went there because me and version went
to the Harvard Yale game at the Yale

108
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,230
Bowl, the original bowl in
the United States of America.

109
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,790
This is the one that started all of it.

110
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,660
The reason why there is the rose
bowl that I go to every fucking year,

111
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,460
uh, is because of the Yale Bowl. And
we went there and I got to tell you,

112
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:09,461
we saw what sports look like without
the use of any sort of steroids.

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,290
Versie was fucking hilarious. He was
going to bill. I'm not even joking.

114
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,070
I feel that if I went to this
school and I played for Yale,

115
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,820
like I could not only
make the football team,

116
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,170
I could like dominate,

117
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:33,950
like I could stand out and I
understood why he felt that way.

118
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,060
I'm not saying he's right,

119
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:40,061
but to sit in the stands and for the
first time in my life be watching college

120
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:45,770
football and seeing people that
are kind of the same size as you,

121
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,040
I know the way fucking faster and
all that type of thing. But um,

122
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,250
it was unbelievable.
Yale versus Harvard.

123
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:56,000
Harvard kicked the shit out of him and uh,
I got tell you like it was,

124
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,250
it was really cool just being
around that many smart people,

125
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,210
just like some 20 year old fat kid walking
through the crowd wearing like a bow

126
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:06,560
tie, like not like a clip
on like you tight yourself.

127
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,690
Like he knows how to do it.
It's just immediately,

128
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:10,730
it's like how fucking smart is that guy?

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,270
Like who knows how,
who fucking knows how to do that?

130
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,810
I'll take two.

131
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,840
Smart people in plantation owners are
the only ones who know how to do that

132
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,630
fucking bow tie.
Right?

133
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,710
And then there was some really
good looking women there
and they will, they will,

134
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
you know, that was just, that's a really
turn on to seek women that good looking,

135
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,250
you know, I mean, they're
actually going to Harvard.

136
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,370
They just not walking around being hot,
getting free shit.

137
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:39,860
They're actually doing something with
your life. That's really a turnoff.

138
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,790
Can imagine banging a girl like that.
Just being on top of it. Like, Oh God,

139
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,750
she's so smart.

140
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,380
Yeah.

141
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,030
Ah, she has all the answers.
Um, I know this is ridiculous.

142
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,030
So the Yale Bowl, everybody,
in case you're wondering,

143
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,950
the Yale Bowl is a football stadium
in gun wave in new haven, Connecticut.

144
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,850
I'm on the border of West Haven,
Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda.

145
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:06,600
It was constructed in
broke ground in 1913.

146
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,670
All right, cost them 750 grand,
17.5 million in today's dollars.

147
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,720
Uh, that was the hundred 30th
meeting between Yale and Harvard.

148
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,880
And I was just sitting there
thinking like George Bush.

149
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,620
George W used to get fucking shit faced
back when he was still a good shit

150
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:28,010
drinking, you know, he
used to get hammered here.

151
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,780
Hilary fucking Blue Bill
Clinton under the bleaches,

152
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,173
right?

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,600
Those, those two families, they're
the worst. I don't mind his dad,

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,270
but fucking Georgie Jr and the Clintons,
they're just the fucking worst.

155
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:47,950
But anyways, um, basically
ground was broken in 1913

156
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,330
and it was the first bowl shaped stadium
in the country in provided inspiration

157
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:58,160
for the design, the design
of such stadiums as the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum,

158
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,120
the Rose Bowl and Michigan stadium.
This was the one that started at all.

159
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,840
This is the daddy to the
granddaddy of them all. All right.

160
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,590
This is Zeus to all the Athenas
and Mercurys and all that shit.

161
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:12,870
Did I jump between Greek and Roman
gods? I don't give a fuck. All right,

162
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,670
you God damn egg head. Once you go tie a
bow tie again today, nobody gives a fuck.

163
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,930
Um, so we went there and through first
he was so fucking fun. First of all,

164
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:22,310
he killed on the show.
And then

165
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,710
we was staying at this hotel
and before the show, uh,

166
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,700
we were hanging and, uh, in my hotel
room, you will watch an Lsu play in, uh,

167
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,350
the Aggies. And I was great
to see Lsu went, you know,

168
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,740
all the disappointing losses this year.
And uh,

169
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,200
when you looked out the window,

170
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:47,630
you could see Yale's campus and I
was joking with Paul and I was going,

171
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:52,430
look at it, Paul. I go, it's so close. And
then I pointed to my brain and I'm like,

172
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,490
yet so far away and I'm laughing.

173
00:10:55,491 --> 00:11:00,430
And in first he's such like a
fucking competitive psycho. He says,

174
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:03,700
going to fuck that to fuck these
fucking people. You, he's like,

175
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,060
you think we couldn't get in to
the school? I'm like, yeah, yeah,

176
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:11,080
I don't think we didn't Paul. You know,
you're going to go into fantasy land.

177
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,290
What happened is we both went to high
school and we tried and we didn't get in.

178
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:22,390
So yeah, there's that. This isn't even
like a debate at this point. We didn't.

179
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,250
And now we're coming back here like a
couple of fucking dance and monkeys to

180
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,330
entertain these people.

181
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,283
All right.

182
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,710
And he, he wouldn't, he wouldn't leave
it alone. He just kept going like, dude,

183
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,960
fuck that. If I had a
better upbringing, you know,

184
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,050
if I had like people who like made me
focus on academics and if I be gap,

185
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:46,660
Paul. Yeah. If you're not the result of,

186
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,610
of Morons fucking right.
That's too harsh.

187
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,910
Um, I feel like I'm the same
way. All right. Jesus Christ.

188
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:57,680
So just attacked his parents.
That's that. You know,

189
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,540
that's the last thing I want to do on this
podcast. But first he's sitting there.

190
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,130
He was, what was not joking
saying that he could be,

191
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,010
he could make it,
he could've went to Yale.

192
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,490
And that's why I love that guy is
I just sit there and look at go,

193
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:15,160
there's no fucking way
he's, yeah, we could do it.

194
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,890
There's no fucking forsee
if you're listening to this,
there is no fucking way.

195
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,390
If your parents made you read books
every God, like there's no fucker.

196
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:32,190
We've said enough dumb shit to me.
The foundation of you.

197
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,270
It's just not there. The same as
me, Paul. Okay. It's, it's built on.

198
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,850
It's built on sand.
Um,

199
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,880
now had either one of our parents gone
there and then we were part of a legacy

200
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:47,220
or whatever the fuck they call
it. We could go, I could go there.

201
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,300
I could go to Yale the way
George W went there. You know,

202
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,590
get their, have that fucking look
on my face. Just getting shit faced.

203
00:12:55,591 --> 00:13:00,180
Everybody loving me. He's a complete fuck
up. He's, he has no business being here,

204
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,990
but he got the, he bought the
keg. Right. I'd be that guy.

205
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,200
I don't fucking know. Either way. We
went to the game and uh, it was great.

206
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,720
It was really like a, it was sort of pure.
There was nothing riding on the game.

207
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,980
There's no reason to play football at
Yale and Harvard other than you love

208
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:22,280
playing football. And then also the fact
that, you know, they're all really smart.

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,160
That was something really
fascinating about it. Like that guy,

210
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:26,971
look at that guy out there,

211
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,840
he gets geometry and he just went
over the middle and took that hit.

212
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:32,130
That's just fucking amazing to me.

213
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,380
Just multitalented so I've got all
kinds of respect. I've got to tell you,

214
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:42,300
I think Harvard was on the juice. So
BECU or they have some sort of, I dunno,

215
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,530
lock on draft picks because they see,
they've seem to be a definite,

216
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,540
a sizable difference between the
athletes on Harvard side versus a Yale.

217
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,950
And I didn't no to root for.
I liked the ales colors spot.

218
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:00,670
Harvard's for math that [inaudible].
All right, I'm done with this shit.

219
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,300
I'm all right back to the
fucking podcast. So, oh,

220
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:09,301

As I say every year.

233
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:03,341
It's a great fucking gift just for
somebody that you don't give a shit about,

236
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,800
All right, these are those in amp. Now
what is it? Oh, not Abercrombie and Fitch.

237
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,960
Who's the guy who takes the
creepy pictures of teenagers?
It begins with an a,

238
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,240
you know, you know the deal, you
know the fuck they are. Ah, fuck.

239
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,450
Whatever.
They're nice and soft.

240
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,550
This is really bad to say after he
saying he takes pictures of teenagers,

241
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:39,810
he has those creepy things.
It's not Calvin Klein. He's
like the new Calvin Klein.

242
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,010
You know what I'm saying? They're fucking
great tee shirts. All right. And um,

243
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:48,780
this is also good thing too. You know,
brother, father, anything for guys,

244
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,740
a God tee shirt and a DVD, my moron
comedy, they're going to love it.

245
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,900
It's a perfect thing. The lovely
Da. Everybody coming into the room.

246
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,640
You got it. I got to
sign white here. Jesus.

247
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,830
And she comes in here with
a goddamn blank check.

248
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,330
It tells me I just have to sign it.

249
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:09,610
Do you understand the faith I'm
putting in you right now? You know,

250
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,030
it'd be hilarious if you just cleaned me
out right now and I never saw you again,

251
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,620
Huh? I would never do that. You don't.

252
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,210
You sound like you sound like Sharon
Stone right now in that basic instinct at

253
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:26,050
La Brea. Crazy, right? A fucking
something. Some. All right. See you. Um,

254
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,770
you have a nice day with my money.
I'm chunk fucking with you. Come here.

255
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,960
That's make always make taking the
joke one one fucking step too far.

256
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,690
Why did she have to say that?

257
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:44,310
Now people aren't gonna think they're
not your fucking saint for being with me.

258
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,620
All right, so there you go. Tee Shirt
and folk. You got it. It's up there.

259
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,180
Paula. Days are calming. If you order
now, all right, there's no fucking way.

260
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,610
You're not going to get it
before Christmas. I guarantee it.

261
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,710
And if you don't get it before Christmas,

262
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,860
I will show up at your Christmas party
in 2018 doing a tap dance with the

263
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:06,420
fucking two to one.
That's a guarantee.

264
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,050
I'm really betting that you're
not going to remember that.

265
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,480
It's going to fucking get there.
It's all I'm saying and no,

266
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:15,330
I'm not doing your Christmas party,
right? Don't be so God damn selfish.

267
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,890
I got to humiliate myself.

268
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,540
Don't I do that every week when I read
the advertising? Speaking of which,

269
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,380
Eh, I think it's time for a little bit of
advertising. Everybody. Here we go, um,

270
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,490
in danger right now of not making
the cut on the tour here. All right,

271
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,910
now let's try to make me make it easier.

272
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:39,860
We'll say that par for the course
is three. Fuck up these reeds.

273
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,900
All right? All I want to do was make
part and I want to be one under.

274
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,230
I'm going to come into the clubhouse
with a smile on my face. All right,

275
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,440
here we go. Dollar Shave Club,
everyone for a couple of bucks a month.

276
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:56,640
Dollar Shave club.com delivers amazing
quality razors right to your door.

277
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,010
Not only does it save you a ton of cash,

278
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,270
it saves you from trudge into the
drugstore for a pack of blades. All right?

279
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,480
I always get stuck behind that old
couple that wants to buy ice cream and

280
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:10,590
develop their photos as they sit.

Do you know what?

329
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:17,140
It's actually just called Saturday
night because they had how Howard Cosell

330
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:20,680
actually hosted a Saturday night
live or something like that,

331
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:23,440
so they weren't allowed to say it.
That's why they say live from New York.

332
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:26,320
It's Saturday night. Just to give you
that little tidbit of information,

333
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,550
I learned that the other day reading
an actual book about Howard Cosell.

334
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,080
Why would I read about it? Other
things, because I'm a moron. Anyways,

at [inaudible] dot com damn.

346
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,080
And I was doing great and it came up the
18th fucking fairway and I shanked it

347
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,680
the goddamn woods. All right. Back
to the podcast here. All right.

348
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,140
Very uneventful week. I
feel everybody. So, uh,

349
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,280
considering there's not a lot
going on in the world of politics,

350
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,620
what should we talk about? Oh, I don't
know. Hey, let's talk about sports.

351
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,730
Anybody Watch any sports this
weekend where you're, where you're,

352
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,110
where you're watching things that involve
sports. Was there sports watching?

353
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,480
Um, all right. First things
first I have to address the, uh,

354
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,910
the no call pass interference thing
last week and the panthers game, um,

355
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,860
that was obviously a Monday night game,
so I didn't comment on it.

356
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,700
I didn't have a problem with it.
I thought it was a good no call.

357
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,100
I didn't like that they threw the
flag and then picked it up. But

358
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,270
how's Gronk going to make
it fucking play on a pass?

359
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:14,350
It's not even going to get to them.

360
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,790
It's not like the guy who interfered
with them or held them, caught the ball.

361
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:23,791
It was another guy who undercut the route
and I just feel like the rules in the

362
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:30,100
NFL right now, our tips so
heavily in favor of the authentic,

363
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,100
it's nice every once in a while
to see the defense get a break,

364
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,990
even if it goes against my fucking
team. Okay. Classic examples.

365
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:41,980
If you watched the giants
cowboys game early in that game,

366
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,160
I think the cowboys were up
seven enough and at that point,

367
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,330
okay,

368
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,500
they forced a fumble.
They recovered it in a way from the play.

369
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,530
There was a flag with a cornerback
barely grazed this wide receiver and a

370
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:59,770
negated. The cowboys, you know, turnover.

371
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,760
The defense made a play cost to turnover.
Once again,

372
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,540
made a play cause to fucking
turnover. It's in this, this new,

373
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,140
okay.

374
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,240
The new rules. I mean I
can't complain. They are,

375
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:16,241
the rules negates that and in stops them
from having a short field and possibly

376
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:19,160
going up 14 to nothing or 21 nothing.
I can't remember what.

377
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,170
So I did not have a problem with it.

378
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,710
Good for the panthers and I actually
tweeted that I didn't have a problem with

379
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:28,940
it and all got all these
fucking condescending. Yeah.

380
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,270
Like responses to it like oh it's good
to see a levelheaded patriots fan.

381
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,370
It's good to see an
impartial patriots fan.

382
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,860
It's good to see a smart patriots fan.
What?

383
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:44,030
Cause I fucking agree with you and
your team. You Selfish Asshole,

384
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,260
you know right there.
That's when you know,

385
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:52,120
like you don't have a true friend is
when they just like you because you agree

386
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,460
with them. And I would, I am,

387
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,640
I would be willing to bet a most of my
fucking whatever my shillings here that

388
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:05,440
those people who compliment me or
not impartial and had the call gone.

389
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:08,740
If the exact same fucking
thing happened to their, uh,

390
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,390
their receiver and they lost the game,

391
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:13,840
they would be bitch moaning
and complaining and saying
how Tom Brady runs the

392
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:15,400
league and all that fucking shit.
All right.

393
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:19,360
So before you sit there and try and
pat me on the head and say that I am

394
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:22,780
impartial and I'm a smart Patriots Fan,
that's not a fucking compliment.

395
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,450
All right? You're a cunt. All right?

396
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,680
As long as I agree with you and your
team and I don't agree with my team in it

397
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:34,510
causes you to have a victory, then,
then I'm smart. Go Fuck Yourself. Um,

398
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,910
and with that, we get to a,
yesterday, yesterday's games,

399
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,090
the New York football giants lost.

400
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,220
And I know a lot of people think
that I hate the giants because, uh,

401
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,470
they beat the Patriots two times
in a row in bowls. I don't,

402
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,310
not only do I not hate the giants, I love
the giants. I love that organization.

403
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,700
I've liked them for fucking ever all
the way back to Harry Cas and Brad van

404
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,900
pelt, Beasley Reese. I've
been watching them forever.
I've always liked the giants.

405
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,320
I like the uniforms. I like the,
the defenses. I just liked to,

406
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,210
okay.

407
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,840
There's nothing better
than haven't like doing,

408
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,500
they had Lawrence Taylor and
Harry Carson and you know,

409
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,190
I was like Wilbur Marshall.
I was always like big linebacker.

410
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,060
Like I'd like the bears.
I like defenses and that type of thing.

411
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:24,560
So I don't hate the giants.

412
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,240
What I hate is listening to Paul Versey
talking about how he called something

413
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,580
because he doesn't just
say it for that weekend,

414
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,680
he'll say it for the next seven years.

415
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:38,540
So the reason why I wanted to see the
giants lose is because I don't want to

416
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:41,180
listen to versus talking to me.

417
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,610
Like he's Nostradamus if that's
how you pronounce that guy's name.

418
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,450
Um,
so that's all.

419
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,050
And what kills me too is that
division is so bad that they're still,

420
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:55,380
they're still not out of it. There
are only two games out of first place,

421
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,630
three from going all the way up front,

422
00:26:58,631 --> 00:27:02,320
which should be insurmountable
after 10 fucking games.

423
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,310
But with that division, it
isn't. It isn't. All right.

424
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,790
I don't know who shot. I don't know.
He's not waiting on what are the,

425
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:14,600
are they for, are they foreign?
Seven. Oh, so it's 11 games. Oh yeah.

426
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:18,740
That pretty much fucked. Um, but I was,
I got to tell you the back of my head,

427
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,000
I was kind of hoping that they were going
to make it into the playoffs because

428
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:27,350
playoffs, because I have a feeling
just the way the giants are.

429
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,900
They,
they would beat

430
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:36,150
Seattle in Seattle and another bunch of
people would probably think that I hate

431
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:39,940
the Seattle Seahawks because I
did that whole, you know, the,

432
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:43,840
we are the loudest song and I always make
fun of Pete Carroll. I don't hate him.

433
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:47,860
I don't give a fuck about the
Seahawks one way or the other.

434
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,990
I think the loudest crowd thing is silly
and it's something that you focus on

435
00:27:52,991 --> 00:27:56,620
when you don't have any championship
banners to look at. And I stand by that,

436
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,400
but that doesn't mean I want you to lose.
But Pete Carroll,

437
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,010
it's just funny watching that guy loose,
you know, watching a guy who goes,

438
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,680
oh

439
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,513
woo,

440
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,480
something good happens. And he's
totally proved himself as a coach.

441
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,670
She's a great fucking coach.
He's a great college coach.

442
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,150
He knows how to build up the program
illegally and right before the,

443
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:20,560
the all the shit hits the
fan to walk away from it.

444
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,160
And I don't begrudge them for doing that
because that's how the game's played.

445
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,740
The same way I don't begrudge lance for,

446
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:29,500
for doing what the fuck he did
when everyone else was doing it.

447
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,720
I don't regret any of that.

448
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:35,650
And everybody who gives the Patriot shit
for the spygate thing is living in this

449
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:39,430
fantasy fucking land that
your teams do not cheat.

450
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,740
I'm reading this great book right now
on, uh, uh, I don't have the title of it.

451
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,440
I'll get it for you next week.
Lie had gave me the book, uh,

452
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,970
somewhat the last headbangers
or something like that.

453
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:55,120
It's like basically back when you just
played with concussions and that type of

454
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:57,610
shit, the level of cheating
that was going on. First of all,

455
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:01,570
they didn't even test for steroids I
think until like 1988 and football.

456
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,000
And if you read about the Oakland Raiders,

457
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:08,260
who still to this day bitch
about the fucking tuck rule, um,

458
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,330
does shit they were doing in the 70s.
Do Dino,

459
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,380
like they used to have like their pads,

460
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,560
they used to soak them in water because
it would make them hard and it was

461
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:20,740
almost like having like a cast on and
they would just club people in the head

462
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,900
and other teams knew
that they were doing it.

463
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:25,120
So during the pregames and the warm ups,

464
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:29,620
they would wear the soft ones and they'd
have their hard ones under the bench.

465
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,920
And it wasn't nine Zillion fucking TV
cameras and people in the crowd all having

466
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:38,770
TV cameras with this smart phones.
So when the game started,

467
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:41,950
they would put the other pads on and they
would just clock people fucking head.

468
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,950
These guys were claiming they were
taking horse tranquilizers and they were

469
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:50,500
doing the dosage for a fucking 1500,
1200 pound fucking horse.

470
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,100
Um, they were out of their minds,
hopped up on everything in the plant.

471
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:57,070
So people have cheated all day long.

472
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:00,880
And the greatest thing about cheating
is watching people who don't cheat,

473
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,870
discover that there's cheating
and to just watch them as adults,

474
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,770
once again discovered that there's no
Santa Claus and seeing their bottom lip

475
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:12,070
quiver. I just, for the life of
me, the reason why it's funny,

476
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,350
it's not cause I can don't cheating,
it's just that

477
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,640
I just don't,
I don't fucking get,

478
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,470
I like how many times you've got to get
fucked over to realize that how human

479
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:28,010
beings are, you know, I'm a piece of shit,

480
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,043
right?

481
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,590
Why wouldn't a football team where
there's a zillion dollars at stake and,

482
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:39,050
and your legacy and your, your,
your spot in the all time list.

483
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,980
I'm not saying everybody's going to cheat,
but I just get this fucking shot.

484
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:47,540
Look off your face. Like when Oj got
acquitted, oh my God. That millionaire,

485
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,020
the guy who had the money enough to be
innocent gets declared in this. Yes.

486
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,470
All right. Am I fucking, I
might like preaching right now.

487
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:59,360
I should shut the fuck up. Oh, and
then also, what was I gonna say?

488
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:03,980
Uh, how unreal was that? But
that Patriots Broncos game,

489
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:06,620
I guess it's unreal if you're on the fuck
at winning side or if he didn't give a

490
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:11,170
shit who won or not. Um, unreal.

491
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,550
I watched that game flying.
I was on Virgin Airlines,

492
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,260
who by the way,

493
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,220
they have this five minute music video
for is great is that airline is when you

494
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:25,240
get on that plane,

495
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,840
rather than have them announce like
this is how he put on a seatbelt and the

496
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:32,530
mask, which usually takes live
human beings like a minute,

497
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,740
they made like a five minute video

498
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,400
that tries to have all the like people
dancing and singing and then auto tuned

499
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,900
voices.
And I gotta tell you,

500
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:48,740
it is one of the most horrific things
I've ever heard and it's played at such a

501
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:52,820
volume. I had my fingers in my ears and
I was humming and I could still hear it.

502
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,000
I heard it on the way out and
the weight on the way back,

503
00:31:56,001 --> 00:32:00,140
I just gave into it and I just watched it.
And um,

504
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,770
I don't,
you don't,

505
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,400
you don't really annoys the shit out of
me is people who dance with an attitude.

506
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:11,230
Look on their face like they think
that they're fucking amazing like it.

507
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,530
I'm not saying that I don't
respect the art of dancing,

508
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,890
but what is with that look on your face.

509
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,430
You know like you're fucking Gronk.

510
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:25,630
Koski and he just dragged fucking the
entire secondary over the goal line.

511
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,740
What are you doing? What? Cause
you did a little Shim Sham. Huh?

512
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,390
Cause you're shaking your left shoulder
while your right toes doing something

513
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:36,700
else.
Like now you have this look on your face

514
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,020
like line up across

515
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,970
in your reading the defense.
What is the,

516
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,040
what is with that fucking look people
have on their faces when they dance night,

517
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,410
I think did Fred Astaire
had that look on his face?

518
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,000
When you're dancing there's only one
look you should have on your face and it

519
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:59,710
should convey roughly. Ooh. All right.

520
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,490
Stop looking at me like you're
going to take my wallet.

521
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:03,800
Okay.

522
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,240
I th I just don't fucking under.

523
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:10,241
So it's five minutes of that combined
with like auto tune and that fucking robot

524
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:14,810
dancing that I,

525
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,250
I just don't with this fucking
look of attitude. And then rapping,

526
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,360
they got some little girl
fucking rapping,

527
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:26,370
like sounded like dice
when he makes fun of women.

528
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,480
Okay.

529
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,730
About how to put a seatbelt on and it
goes on for like five minutes as you sit

530
00:33:32,731 --> 00:33:35,280
underneath these aquarium,
TJ's lights.

531
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,220
Okay.

532
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,970
The same ones that they
have at the w hotel. Um,

533
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,250
other than that it's great because you
get to just sit there and watch TV.

534
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:49,610
So anyways, when I got through the
whole fucking a put on your seat,

535
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,930
that's it. Rock, whatever
the fuck they was singing.

536
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,330
Oh, just wasn't fucking end. So, um,

537
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,080
I actually,
I was watching the Patriot,

538
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:07,100
I watch all the giants game and then I
want went into the winter to the Patriots

539
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,710
game right before we
were about to make a 24,

540
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:14,240
21 got off the plane and
somehow it was already 24, 21.

541
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,590
And I went by the bar and I score,
saw a score to make it 28,

542
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:22,970
24, sorry, 24, 21 and then 28, 24.

543
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,770
And um,

544
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,300
okay.

545
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,760
It was in state and then the whole way
back from the airport versus he was

546
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:33,680
texting me the updates. And right as
I got home, I saw the replay of the,

547
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,120
uh,
of the punt

548
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,660
with a guy inadvertently touched it
because he didn't hear Welker tell him to

549
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:44,250
get out of the way. But uh,
what a fucking game. And um,

550
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,090
yet another reason why
you don't leave early,

551
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,900
but I don't think that that
was a definitive example
of what Brady and Manny can

552
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:57,840
do. Cause I thought the elements
played such a fucking role in the game.

553
00:34:57,841 --> 00:35:01,410
But I will say this Brady
is 10 and four and 14.

554
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:02,910
Matchups against Peyton manning.

555
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:06,540
So I am done with that argument.

556
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,790
All right. If you want manning, go
ahead. You can, you can have them.

557
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,660
I will take Brady any day,
all day.

558
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,940
You know, Brady doesn't even
have that look on his face.

559
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,090
Neither this Peyton manning
that these fucking dancers have.

560
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,190
Is it trying to tell me how
to put on a fucking seat belt?

561
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,040
Did people who liked dance too,
they just get sick of getting beat up.

562
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,070
So now they feel like they have to take
it on and now they have to have a game

563
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:35,930
face.
Um,

564
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,730
I was just watching it like,
when did Kevin Garnett start dancing?

565
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,840
I don't understand. Oh, that's not Kevin
Garnett. That's just somebody dancing. Um,

566
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,070
I'm so exhausted from watching that
whole fucking game and traveling around.

567
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't know what to say. I'm not going
to try to rub anybody's nose in anything.

568
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,830
It was at the end of the day,

569
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:02,790
an unbelievable win and just a regular
season fucking victory. And, uh,

570
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,740
but it was, um, it definitely,

571
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,110
if you watched that game and you still
leave games earlier, you're not a sport.

572
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,840
You leave the game early and
not a fucking sports fan.

573
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,910
I just was watching people,
Clara,

574
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,450
I understood because it was fucking
freezing and you're down 24. Nothing.

575
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,710
I understand if you're down 24,

576
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:26,670
nothing at the half and it's
fucking like absolutely freezing,

577
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,110
disgusting. And you with your little
boy or your girl and they're cold,

578
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:34,610
they want to go back to the car. I
get that. All right? But if you're a,

579
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,830
and you're standing there in the fucking
stands for the love of God, all right?

580
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,530
If the offensive lineman can be out
there and short sleeve shirts, you know,

581
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:51,030
you can't tough it out and you mighty
Mac with your fucking mittens and they

582
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:56,031
leave or they watched one of the
historical comebacks in New England sports

583
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,700
title town.
It's just an unbelievable run.

584
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:05,460
Every time you think you've seen the last
great thing that's going to happen and

585
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:08,070
then it's going to go back to the way
it was, another great thing happened.

586
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:12,180
So I feel very blessed as a sports
fan so far. They go, they go,

587
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:14,490
great fucking game.
And this is the thing too.

588
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,740
I don't think as much
as that was a big wind,

589
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,950
that doesn't mean shit
when the playoffs come.

590
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,570
Cause we're going to have to go into
Denver and at the end of the day to use

591
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:25,980
that overly used expression,

592
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:30,270
Denver could come back and beat us in
January and then who gives a fuck that we

593
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:34,960
beat them in in November despite the fact
that it was unbelievable victory. Um,

594
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,860
I mean,
shit that happened with the jets.

595
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:41,190
We absolutely raped the jets and December
and then a month later we lost to them

596
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:44,610
at home. So who gives a fuck? Um,

597
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,200
they're both great quarterbacks and the
both great teams and who gives a fuck?

598
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:52,770
It was an amazing God damn game. I can't
believe he came back and won it. And A,

599
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,750
I'm done arguing the Brady manning thing.

600
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,280
I think the numbers speak for themselves
as far as the way I look at the numbers.

601
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,020
And,
uh,

602
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:07,430
I think they both played each other
enough times with all different kinds of

603
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:11,370
teams. Loaded teams, patched together.

604
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,290
Teams like our fucking defense last night.

605
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,730
I'm so fucking sick of them two talking
about how many injuries we have on

606
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:20,250
defense and then they go and like,
they absolutely just,

607
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,630
just ran right through the guts of that
Patriots' defense. It's like, Oh yeah,

608
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:27,330
the one word yet where the
guts were already ripped out.

609
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:31,320
There's no guts left in it. Well,
there are, cause we won the game.

610
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,760
I'm not saying that people are out there,

611
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,450
but do we start started four
rookies yesterday. I it just,

612
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,350
you got to have a guy as good as
fucking no, Sean running the ball. Yeah,

613
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:45,730
he's going to rack up some fucking yards,
although over 200 is an excusable.

614
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:50,110
So whatever. All right, let's
uh, let's get on to the,
uh, the questions this week.

615
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,840
See, I think I handled
that really well. Help you.

616
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:56,610
I don't rub your fucking noses
in it unless you jets fans.

617
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,220
Um, all right. Response to
last podcast or Yankee fence,

618
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,380
respond to the last podcast.
Uh,

619
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,680
this is in response to the item
mentioned on your last podcast,

620
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,000
the brother that had the 16 year old
sister who was dating a 22 year old.

621
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,440
Okay? All capital
letters. This guy writes,

622
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:22,010
the brother needs to stay out of it.
All right?

623
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:24,500
So for those of you who
didn't listen last week,

624
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:28,970
there was a guy who is 16 year old sister
was dating this 22 year old dude and

625
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:31,670
he was questioning,
do I knock this guy the fuck out?

626
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:35,810
Do I say something to my
sister? Do I somehow get my
parents to wake the fuck up?

627
00:39:35,811 --> 00:39:40,030
What do I do? All right, I gave my
advice in. This guy is saying this,

628
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,580
he seems like he's speaking
from experience or this
woman, whoever wrote this,

629
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,270
the brother needs to stay out of it.
I met with a lady,

630
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,010
I met my now husband when
I was 15 and he was 20.

631
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:57,800
Well, you little fast tramp.
You couldn't even drive a car.

632
00:39:57,801 --> 00:40:02,450
How did you even meet a 20 year old, Huh?
Oh, you standing on the street corner?

633
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,940
Eh?

634
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,150
I'm sure you're a nice person.

635
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,780
Sorry. Um, you were 15 and he was 20.

636
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:25,970
Did your plane crashed?

637
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:29,660
And he was stuck on an island and it
was like that blue lagoon or some shit.

638
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,690
He said we started dating just after I
turned 16 and we got married when I was

639
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:40,731
20 and he was 25 we have now been
happily married almost 25 years.

640
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,660
Oh, that's a nice story. It may not
work out this way for this guy's sister,

641
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,130
but it also might work out to and ended
up being a stronger relationship than

642
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:52,080
any relationship this guy might have.

643
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,190
It's none of the brothers
business stay out of it. Okay.

644
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,323
Hmm.

645
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,740
Miss, I respect your point of view
and what happened to you. All right.

646
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,540
Well let me ask you this.

647
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,540
Yeah.

648
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,250
If you have a daughter and she turns 16
and some 22 year old guy starts sniffing

649
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:14,760
around the house, are you going to
just sit there and be like, well,

650
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:18,820
my husband was 20 and I was 15 you know,

651
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,570
I gotta be honest with you.
The difference between 20 and 15,

652
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:24,190
a 15 year old is a fucking,

653
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,930
I can't quite say a child,
but there was a massive age difference.

654
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,090
Forget about the legality of it.

655
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,270
And most states other than Mississippi,
I'm

656
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,850
sorry, I'm fucking with
you guys. Um, 22 to 16.

657
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:46,701
I mean,

658
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:50,120
you're talking about somebody who's in
the middle of high school dating somebody

659
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:54,620
who's graduated college. Ah, that,

660
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,390
I dunno. I Dunno about that. All right, I

661
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,690
look, can you at least understand
why this guy, is that upset

662
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,630
and have you ever watched to catch a
predator? I mean that there's not like,

663
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:16,631
there's not like evidently a
zillion fucking creeps out there.

664
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,110
How many seasons have to catch a
predator? They did. They do. I mean,

665
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:25,010
you would think like the amount of people
out there that are going online trying

666
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:27,830
to meet underage women. You
wouldn't think that. I mean,

667
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,080
I would like to thank

668
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,250
that there's maybe 40 people doing that,

669
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,590
but there isn't.
There's a bunch,

670
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,910
hundreds of thousands of fucking
creeps out there doing that shit.

671
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,120
So this guy is supposed to stay out of
it and roll the dice that maybe this guy

672
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,840
is a good guy like your husband. Well,
all I can say is I hope that you're right.

673
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,461
You've had,

674
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:59,570
fortunately you've had more this in this
than I have because I would not want to

675
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:04,571
have experience in any shape or form in
this and I don't think my family would,

676
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,360
um, stay out of it. There would
be major fucking problems.

677
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,980
There'll be major fucking problems. There
would be. It's like, Dude, you're 22.

678
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:20,000
What the fuck is wrong with you? How
did you even meet my sister? You know,

679
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,130
how are you, how are you meeting 16 year
olds? You fucking creep. I, you know what?

680
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,060
Maybe I'm ignorant here. Why
don't you write back again?
I want to hear the story.

681
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:32,220
How you guys met,
you know,

682
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,860
was he teaching you how to
add and subtract? Sorry.

683
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,020
The jokes are just too easy.
All right.

684
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,090
Thanksgiving Day special Billy Crocker.
There's a new one.

685
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:48,380
Betty Crocker. Billy Crocker. I
liked that and I like to cook. Oh,

686
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,263
that's a good one.

687
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,200
Love your intensity when it comes to
bringing something to the table on

688
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:57,920
Thanksgiving. Absolutely.
No Pun intended. It's,

689
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,720
it's really a no brainer.

690
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,190
Get good at making something and get
to a point where your automatic oh,

691
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:07,100
he's talking about, yeah, like I
was talking about a few weeks ago,

692
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,450
when Thanksgiving comes around,

693
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:12,950
you got to have that dish that you just
fucking can make and you throw down and

694
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:15,530
you take it to another level.
All right?

695
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,870
Everybody else should be doing
the same thing. And then the end,

696
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:21,830
that's the Thanksgiving meal.
Um, so this guy goes, yeah,

697
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:25,040
you should get a dish downs where
your automatic. How hard can it be?

698
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,480
A you'll, you'll never
been x. You'll never been.

699
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:33,390
You've never been expected to step out of
your skillset. If you're baking breads,

700
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:37,710
no one will ever expect you to
bring the cranberry sauce. Uh,

701
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:40,800
what should go to this year?
What's Nias specialty?

702
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:47,080
What's my Goto this year? How
about the whole fucking meal? Dude,

703
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:50,440
I'll tell you right now. You guys
stick. I'm a fucking a one trick pony.

704
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,300
I can make you a Turkey dinner.
Was stuffing mashed potatoes.

705
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,130
My gravy game is getting better.

706
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,880
I got to work on my gravy game and
I know that's crucial. All right.

707
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,380
But my fucking, ah, my mashed potatoes,

708
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,400
not a fucking lumping
them all right enough.

709
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:14,110
Bato to make you slag off the chair. Um,
as they say in New Orleans, that's bad.

710
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,410
New Orleans accent. I admitted
my stuffing. Go Fuck Yourself.

711
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,040
All right dude.
You know,

712
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:23,560
you don't understand the recipes that
I have access to all of my recipes.

713
00:45:23,561 --> 00:45:28,210
Start with melt a stick of butter and
a third, a cup of Chris. Go in a pan.

714
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:37,000
Okay. So, you know, it's
delicious. Um, yeah,

715
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:37,834
my stuffing.

716
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,573
MMM.

717
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,040
I don't my mashed potatoes or the shit,
but knee is African American,

718
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:48,070
so she likes more sweet potato. So
I don't, I don't think they, uh,

719
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,720
that side respects mashed potatoes
the way they should. Okay.

720
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:57,100
I feel like my potato, my, my,
my United colors of Benetton,

721
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:01,210
whatever the fuck it is. Respectful
for sweet potatoes and mash potatoes,

722
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:04,000
I think I'm a little more mature.

723
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,530
Okay.

724
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,390
Then the lovely Nia. Um,
what's Nice specialty, uh,

725
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,470
Nias she's just great at everything.
She's one of those people that I,

726
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:18,110
I'll be out in the kitchen like,
dude, what the fuck? I'm starving.

727
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,910
But she'd be like, what do you
[inaudible] she comes out there and like,

728
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,110
she knows she's got a couple of
things on her arms and I dunno,

729
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,180
I'm eating spaghetti or I
don't know what the fuck.

730
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:30,950
I mean she somehow just throws it all
together or make some ridiculous omelet.

731
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,410
Okay.

732
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:37,050
Um, she's actually a true cook.
I'm a little more robotic. Um, mmm.

733
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,180
Okay.

734
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,810
I think I'm going to become a,
uh, a great cook or a better cook.

735
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:44,930
The way I became a better comedian where
at first I was a joke writer and I was

736
00:46:44,931 --> 00:46:48,530
trapped in my act and then I learned
how to Improv and she's kind of just

737
00:46:48,531 --> 00:46:50,130
watching her.
She kinda as she cooked,

738
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:52,850
she's tasting it and doing all
that type of stuff where I just,

739
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:58,040
they said to leave it at 58 minutes, it's
been 15 minutes and I take it out. Um,

740
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,550
pies, I kind of got the whole thing
do from start to finish. My, uh,

741
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,480
my appetizer game is terrible.
In fact,

742
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:13,090
I don't even know if I know how to
make one. I have no idea, but do what?

743
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:14,800
I can make a pie from fucking scratch.
Okay?

744
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah.

745
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,200
I can look at you and tell you what all
your fucking problems are as I'm making

746
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:24,010
the pie crust and not even look down
once I can just feel the texture.

747
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,580
You know what I'm saying? That's how
many fucking Pi's I've made. All right,

748
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,160
and I'll take debt

749
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,610
pie someday and I'll bring it to
your fucking house. All right,

750
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:36,250
and I'll take a whole hunk of it just in,
I'll just shove it.

751
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:38,920
Write down your throat and these nothing
that you're going to be able to say

752
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,860
other than thank you for that experience.
All right.

753
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,920
As of shaking up the can of
whipped cream to give you a facial.

754
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,670
You know what's funny about this?

755
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,290
My attitude like cooking is the same
as like those dancers with this stupid

756
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,000
fucking looks on their faces.

757
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,400
Take that fucking look off the Goddamn.

758
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,560
Unless you just dunked on somebody.
Okay.

759
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,410
Unless you have a loaded fucking
pistol pointed at my face.

760
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,320
You take that fucking look
off of your God Damn Grill.

761
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,260
Is She a fucking moon walking across
the stage? Like I'm in awe of you.

762
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,890
I'm not saying it's not a,
not a great skill to have,

763
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,560
but what you're doing versus the look,

764
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,430
the look on your face is so far down
the fucking street compared to what the

765
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:28,240
fuck you doin.
What is that?

766
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,210
Yeah.

767
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,280
All the way back to those Janet
Jackson videos. Hi Miss you much.

768
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,630
And she'd have this fucking look in her
face as she's putting her fingers in and

769
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:43,710
she's hopping around. And it was amazing.
Visually. It was amazing to look at.

770
00:48:43,711 --> 00:48:47,160
But why do you have that
fucking look on your face?

771
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,750
Why are you all dressed in these army
uniforms? Like you're fighting in a war?

772
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,120
All right. Get back to the way
it was. All right, everybody.

773
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,190
Five, six, seven, eight Chanel. You know,

774
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:05,390
I just realized that Shamiel
shemozzle Lavar Yiddish words.

775
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,620
I never knew what it was.

776
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:10,130
I thought it was Jewish guys that ran
the beer company that they worked for.

777
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,190
And I know I'm not
pronouncing them correct. Uh,

778
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Shamiel is a kind of guy I guess spills
a drink and is Shamar Shemas I can't say

779
00:49:20,361 --> 00:49:21,350
unless I sing the song.

780
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,590
Shamiel schmozzle a shemozzle
schmozzle is the guy spills it on.

781
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,870
How funny is that? There'd be tell you
guys so much. I love Yiddish words.

782
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:32,330

because I wanted to learn some more cause

783
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:35,650
they're fucking hilarious and
they're fun to say. And uh,

784
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:40,250
I really liked Jewish humor, but uh,
I actually looked up and it was like,

785
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:42,140
I knew already knew 90% of them.

786
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:44,690
There was so many that I was
using and I didn't even realize,

787
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,490
did I already talk about this or did I
start to talk about I don't give a fuck

849
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,610
And now we're back to the
back to the lettuce. Um,

850
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,820
holiday friend Billy. Oh, uh,

851
00:53:58,821 --> 00:54:01,340
I've been seeing this girl
for about a month and a half.

852
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,420
Handful of dinners and some sex.
Very nice.

853
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,690
You like to eat? You'd like to
fuck. Who doesn't like doing that?

854
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,590
This guy's over here like, Hey, what
do you want from me? She's super cool,

855
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,260
but I'm emotionally unavailable.
Oh,

856
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:19,700
you son of a get a bad father
bed. Parents. What happened?

857
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,383
Huh?

858
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,760
You get thrown in a burlap sack and
beaten with a read like fucking a Dr Evil.

859
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,770
What happened to you?
Um,

860
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,830
he said I got too much stuff going
on with work to be thinking about a

861
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:35,280
relationship. However, I'm
enjoying this casual situation.

862
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:39,330
She seems to be happy as
well. Oh Jesus, dude, you're
going to break her heart, man.

863
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:40,690
Okay.

864
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,940
Women don't look at the Sh
this shit the way we do.

865
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,290
She seems happy as well because she's
probably thinking it's going somewhere is

866
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:51,880
what I'm guessing. And then one day can be
like, yeah, you know, I'm not feeling it.

867
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,160
And then she's going to start crying
and it'd be like, what the fuck?

868
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,640
I thought we were just fucking,
and then she,

869
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,970
that's all you thought this.

870
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,293
Okay.

871
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,420
We went, oh, we got ice cream.

872
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,540
Do you know anyone? It's like,
just pictures, Seinfeld crying.

873
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:11,120
That's what you're going to hear.
Um,

874
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,020
however, I'm enjoying the casual
situations. She seems to be happy as well.

875
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,990
So what do I,
what do I get her for Christmas?

876
00:55:19,991 --> 00:55:24,280
That doesn't make it look like I've
made room for her toothbrush. Dude,

877
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,320
you shouldn't get her
anything for Christmas.

878
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:32,760
Don't get her fucking thing for Christmas.
Don't fuck her until after Christmas.

879
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,840
Why are you filling up her heart with
hope? Don't do this. I've done this.

880
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:40,470
You're going to hurt her. He goes, I
was thinking about some small things,

881
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:44,910
a book and maybe a sweatshirt from
this place on the beach that she likes.

882
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,970
Oh well isn't that thoughtful

883
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,670
to get her a pack of Fig Newtons,
like share a package of those.

884
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:57,550
Let her know where you stand. He said, ps,

885
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,090
the last gift I bought a
girl was a few years back.

886
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,810
We've been dating for three
years and she cheated on me. Oh,

887
00:56:04,811 --> 00:56:06,910
we had been dating for three
years and she cheated on me.

888
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,990
I found out over thanksgiving, and when
it came time to give Christmas presents,

889
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,420
I handed her a frame with a poem.

890
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,920
The first part of the poem was super
sweet. She was getting emotional.

891
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,330
Then she got to the last line,
which red after these words,

892
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:25,840
your heart's feel heated,
but stead,

893
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,500
I'm going to piece because bitch,
you cheated.

894
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:34,020
Holy Shit.
Wait a minute.

895
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:41,240
Is that a true story? I don't even care
if you made it up. You have to write back.

896
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,240
I want to hear what happened.
What the fuck did she say?

897
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,590
Jesus Christ, Dude. That's like,

898
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:48,740
yeah,

899
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,060
I'd expect like, oh, that's like,

900
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:51,843
okay,

901
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,640
that's really deep, man. That's really
clever. That's really intelligent.

902
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:57,400
That's a kind of thing a woman would do.
You know?

903
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:00,820
We're usually just knees and
elbows, like what? You know,

904
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,720
just start screaming at them
because thing, you know,

905
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:09,721
you were in a full Nelson by some other
fucking jerk off dragging you away and

906
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:13,840
you're in the right. That's really,
uh, that's really amazing. Um, I would,

907
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,890
I would say I would say this,
uh,

908
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:25,490
oh wait, this is my podcast
person texting me right now,

909
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,400
trying to call me right now
and he's getting on a plane.

910
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:32,850
So that's why this podcast is late. All
right? And also I had to do this radio.

911
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:36,690
Took a fuck yourselves, right?
It's the holiday week. Come
sit in here. My slippers.

912
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:41,050
What are your thoughts? Um,
my thoughts are as you're,

913
00:57:41,051 --> 00:57:42,170
you're really going to hurt this woman

914
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,830
cause I feel like you haven't had a
conversation with her. You said, you said,

915
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:48,221
however,

916
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:53,221
I'm enjoying this casual situation and
you said she seems to be happy as well.

917
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:57,970
So that indicates to me that
you guys haven't talked,
sat down and talk this out.

918
00:57:57,971 --> 00:58:01,390
And I can guarantee you if this
woman is any of that with thing,

919
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:04,540
like the women that I've dated,
it's already too late.

920
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,830
All right. Um, she might
be happy thinking like,

921
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,370
Oh wow, he's taking it slow.
He's really getting to know me.

922
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,730
You know, he got me a sweatshirt from
this place on the beach that I like.

923
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,020
He's paying attention to me.
He is noticing things about me.

924
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,470
You know what it is do you are actually,
you're actually a relationship guy,

925
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:33,600
but this other woman ruined you and you
got to get that hate out of your heart

926
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,520
or the defensiveness audio heart before
you should be messing around with

927
00:58:38,521 --> 00:58:40,710
somebody like that. Right. Right.
Now what you should be doing?

928
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:46,280
It's just going out and just,
I dunno,

929
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,560
working on yourself while

930
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:49,770
yeah.

931
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,170
Fucking everything that moves or,
or maybe not.

932
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,090
Okay.

933
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:56,150
It shouldn't be going like don't hurt
this. I don't know what's going on.

934
00:58:56,151 --> 00:58:59,540
Cause this is still very vague, but don't
hurt this woman because that last one,

935
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:02,990
her, yeah, I've made that mistake.
It's a bad, it's bad dude. And I,

936
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:07,460
and I know I'm not judging you for being
in that situation because you're a guy

937
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:08,930
and you shouldn't understand them.

938
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,580
But now that I understand them
a little bit more, uh, you know,

939
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:17,240
um,
you're headed for a fucking,

940
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,600
if I had to guess you're headed for
a rough or shortly after Christmas,

941
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,071
you know when she goes,

942
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:28,550
you want to meet my parents that I could
wear this sweatshirt that you got me

943
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:31,610
from the place in the beach that you like,
you know,

944
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,440
and she'll bring that up right after she
just blew you and your Saturn and you'd

945
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:37,590
be like,
yea no,

946
00:59:37,591 --> 00:59:41,280
I was going to watch the holiday bowl
instead with some buddies of mine get to

947
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:44,100
watch the outback steakhouse.
Steak House fucking bull.

948
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:45,370
Okay.

949
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,610
And then she'd be like, well,
wait a minute. Why? Why?

950
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,110
Oh, I, I don't understand.
And then he'd be like,

951
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,630
and then you're going to be starting
to sense like, well, what do you mean?

952
00:59:55,631 --> 00:59:56,464
You understand?

953
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,900
I just invited you to meet
my parents and you're like,

954
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,950
you don't want to meet them.

955
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,533
Huh?

956
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:08,170
I a little, a little offended. I mean,
these, these are, these are my parents.

957
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,330
I sounds kind of awesome.
Joe Starts hanging down.

958
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:18,080
He in understand what she's saying.
I said, Ha, okay. And you're like,

959
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:20,120
and then she starts crying.
And then if you're like,

960
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,980
most guys should get mad
because you're uncomfortable.

961
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:24,600
All you got to fucking cried out.

962
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:29,450
Say something.

963
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:35,983
Oh yeah.

964
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:41,340
Fucking rolls into a snow drift. I'm
telling you, dude, you, you don't,

965
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:44,140
you don't want to go down this
road. I, I got a bad feeling.

966
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,420
Okay,

967
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,610
I've got a bad feeling about this one man.
Um,

968
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,340
just make sure that she's enjoying
this the same way you are,

969
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:53,940
dude.

970
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,760
Who wouldn't like to be with the super
cool girl that you don't have to fucking

971
01:00:56,761 --> 01:00:59,610
be emotionally involved with
WHO's coming over and banging you?

972
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,760
Now let me tell you something,
dude, this is not 100% on you,

973
01:01:02,761 --> 01:01:06,630
so don't feel guilty because she also
hasn't sat down and had the conversation.

974
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,490
Okay?

975
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,660
Maybe she has her baggage.

976
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:11,470
Maybe she sat down and said that to
some other guy and it scared her away.

977
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,660
She said, okay, now to
south, did I bring up,

978
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:19,470
hey is this guy said
[inaudible] have a lot of data.

979
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,810
Um, coffee shop girl,
dear illiterate cunt.

980
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:31,220
I'm not illiterate.
I just not good at reading out loud.

981
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,890
It doesn't make me a literate.
I can still read the words.

982
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:35,790
Okay.

983
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,650
Did that, did that just sound like
somebody illiterates I'm smart.

984
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,780
Fredo all right. I'm a
young guy. Oh my God.

985
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:46,320
Some 21 year old kid just
called me an illiterate cunt.

986
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,370
And you know what?
I got to take that on the chin.

987
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,250
I got to sit here at my locker
at the end of the reading game.

988
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:56,880
I take full responsibility for that loss.
I've got no one to blame, but myself,

989
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,780
I'm a young guy,
21 and I have kind of,

990
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:04,860
and I kind of have a thing for a chick
who works at my local coffee shop.

991
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:08,760
Please tell me she's not 16. I don't
want to read another one of these. Uh,

992
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:12,570
the idea of chatting her up while
she's working always seems weird to me,

993
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,910
mainly because I know she has to listen.

994
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:18,780
Just give me some quick tips so I
don't come off as a Weirdo. Love the,

995
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:23,550
and thanks dude. Are you fucking kidding
me? This is the perfect situation.

996
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:29,330
All right. Oh, she works
at the local coffee shop.

997
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,920
Oh, I thought you worked with
her. Fuck, that's the perfect,

998
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:35,240
that's the perfect situation.

999
01:02:35,241 --> 01:02:38,540
If you work with somebody that
you're into as far as you know,

1000
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:42,710
being able to talk to him,
it's not weird at all. And uh,

1001
01:02:42,711 --> 01:02:44,930
you can make them laugh and that type
of thing, then they get into you.

1002
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:45,880
But then the bad thing is,

1003
01:02:45,881 --> 01:02:48,980
is then you start fucking somebody you're
working with and you've got a pretty

1004
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:51,620
good chance that you're not gonna make
the playoffs with that one, you know?

1005
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,050
And you're going to have to rebuilt and
it's going to be ugly and you're going

1006
01:02:56,051 --> 01:02:56,930
to lose your fan base.

1007
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,360
And the fan base will be other chicks
that worked that you probably should have

1008
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:02,660
been fucking instead of that
whore. But anyways. All right,

1009
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,250
so you're walking into this coffee shop
and there's a girl there working there

1010
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:12,960
that you like and you don't want to
start because it's going to seem weird.

1011
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:13,321
All right.
Well,

1012
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:18,321
what's weird about that is to try to do
it in line is you're really dealing with

1013
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:24,090
a, a, a short period. It's like a vine.

1014
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,360
You're going to try to hit on her in
the span that it takes to sh to watch a

1015
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:30,000
vine. You liked that,
you liked that reference.

1016
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:34,740
Trying to be hip to the DUBSTEP fucking
generation is dub step already over.

1017
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:39,180
Have you moved onto something
else or Shabbat for,

1018
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,940
for um,

1019
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:48,780
that fucking look on your goddamn face.
Alright,

1020
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,490
I could break you in half like a pencil.

1021
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,820
Will you stop looking at me like you
can kick the shit out of me while you're

1022
01:03:53,821 --> 01:03:56,820
dancing? Maybe that's what it is.
Maybe that's just the funny stuff.

1023
01:03:56,821 --> 01:04:01,050
Just something funny about
it. Attitude, dancing. Um,

1024
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:04,200
can you guys send me some clips to some
of the funniest attitude dancer you can

1025
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:07,110
find?
So maybe put some together

1026
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,080
right?
They go,

1027
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:13,050
you know what I love is when you guys
take clips from my podcast and then you

1028
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:16,020
play the audio underneath
like some of the, the, uh,

1029
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,980
the animation that people have done is,
it's fucking so creative like that one.

1030
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,340
When that guy did the one for,
and I sang that song,

1031
01:04:23,341 --> 01:04:26,730
do you know what it means
to Miss New Orleans?

1032
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:28,890
That's where my baby goes.

1033
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:31,920
And the guy did the whole animation
of it and I was talking about somebody

1034
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:35,280
throwing up and when the
word throw up came in,

1035
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:37,980
it looked like it was launched
out of somebody's mouth,

1036
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:41,640
like at Arctic [inaudible]
really creative. So how bout uh,

1037
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:46,860
as I'm talking about these people
dancing, just have, just put,

1038
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,520
come on you guys. All you fucking
youngsters, you know how to use computers.

1039
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,430
Just split the audio underneath
and just have that kind of dancing

1040
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:58,760
over the top. Like that's
the video. I don't know how
to say technically. Anyways,

1041
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:02,390
let's get back to this thing. So he,
all right. First thing you gotta do

1042
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,390
is a I would you got to
drink your coffee there.

1043
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,620
Does she come around?

1044
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:11,300
Okay.

1045
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,250
This is so hard. How do I give
you advice? All I can give you,

1046
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:18,070
I can't tell you what to say because I
never know what to say until I'm there in

1047
01:05:18,071 --> 01:05:21,970
the moment and something pops in unless
she's really good looking. And then I,

1048
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:24,190
at that age I would just get
fucking intimidating. It'd be like,

1049
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,380
how's just going to sit here? And
you see he might bran muffin. Um,

1050
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,900
when would you do,
I don't know if,

1051
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:36,210
do you got something coming up but you
can invite it to, this is what I would do.

1052
01:05:36,211 --> 01:05:39,780
I would come there frequently enough that
she starts to recognize you. All right.

1053
01:05:39,781 --> 01:05:42,510
And then ease your way into kind of
no one or I guess I would do that.

1054
01:05:42,511 --> 01:05:44,070
And then you have something
if you've got a fucking,

1055
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,440
whatever you kids do nowadays.

1056
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:47,770
Okay.

1057
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,131
You know,

1058
01:05:48,131 --> 01:05:51,400
if there's a big ecstasy shipment coming
to town and you're going to meet the

1059
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:54,460
truck there with the glow sticks and he
got an extra pair of glow sticks that

1060
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:56,460
you could hand to her.
Uh,

1061
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,133
yeah.

1062
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:03,060
Maybe you could do that
something where I'm just flailing here.

1063
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,310
Don't, don't fucking ask me
coffee. Shot of what it did.

1064
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:07,670
I never picked up any girl that
worked at a fucking coffee shop.

1065
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,400
I was good on the subway in New York.

1066
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:15,640
But that was because they would always
be some weirdo doing something weird and

1067
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:19,090
then you could just lock in
with the other person, you know,

1068
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,510
like look at this fucking maniac
and then you could make something,

1069
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:23,080
say something funny about that.

1070
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:28,120
You'd make them laugh and then you
were in that the gym coffee shops,

1071
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,260
that's out of my wheelhouse.

1072
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:34,960
So I would just say go there enough
where she starts to recognize you try to

1073
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:38,860
extend the conversation each time you
order and then blah blah blah. But,

1074
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,800
but the thing is you can't keep coming
in there cause you really going to look

1075
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:46,000
like a creep. So I would say within
three visits, give yourself three visits.

1076
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,180
Yeah,

1077
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:51,020
on the third visit you just
got to fucking asker. You know,

1078
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:53,830
if she's seen anybody and it
have something to invite her to,

1079
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,800
that's going to be a fun thing.
Don't just be like,

1080
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:58,480
oh he's willing to take y'all show time.

1081
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,760
And maybe I could pull it out
and you could just look at it.

1082
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:03,970
You don't have to touch it. Don't do
it like that. Have something to too.

1083
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:04,880
Okay.

1084
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,713
An event,

1085
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:11,270
ladies like the events and I don't know
what they're into what your age, but um,

1086
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,850
I dunno the first time it's too weird.

1087
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,920
You got to have unreal
game that I don't have,

1088
01:07:18,921 --> 01:07:20,390
so I can't fucking give you advice.

1089
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:24,860
Second time she's getting to know you
and the third time you go for it, right.

1090
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:30,410
Swing for the fucking fence.
Just say, look, Cutie Pie.

1091
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,650
I don't work here. All right.
So I know this is well,

1092
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,020
what am I supposed to do? I'm attracted
to you. All right. Fuck Sakes.

1093
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:43,110
Put Down the God damn coffee
and, and come to me to, to the,

1094
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:44,430
to the burning man thing.

1095
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:49,470
I got plenty of Sunscreen
and ecstasy and uh, you know,

1096
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,810
and it's not a sex thing. I mean, I would
hope it would eventually turn into it,

1097
01:07:53,811 --> 01:07:55,170
but more in like a lovingly thing,

1098
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:58,850
like the kind of thing where I wouldn't
tell my friends what we did because I

1099
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:00,560
care for you kind of thing.
You know,

1100
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:04,850
maybe we lay in the dirt and roll around
next to that thing that's on fire.

1101
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:05,803
Right?

1102
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:12,980
I have no coffee shop game. Hey,
anybody out there of coffee shop game?

1103
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:18,560
I don't drink coffee. That's the
thing. All right, it's fucking gross.

1104
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:22,160
It tastes like dirty water and it
burns my mouth so I don't fuck with it.

1105
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,230
And that just takes all that coffee
shop pussy right out the fucking window.

1106
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:31,760
They always just seem like the coffee
shop people to me always seemed like

1107
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:36,380
hipsters, like they just were
over everything, you know?

1108
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,480
So if you're over everything, you're over
everything. The fucking Grand Canyon,

1109
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,860
you're over that.
My dumb ass is coming in there with the,

1110
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:49,100
you're not going to be over that
lack of pigment a. All right.

1111
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:54,020
The mall. Billie holiday. Very
nice. I am going on all a day.

1112
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:57,850
I'm going to Italy. I'm going
to miss thanksgiving. Um,

1113
01:08:57,851 --> 01:09:00,890
what's your plan of attack
when you enter a mall?

1114
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,000
Are you on a mission or
are you a window shopper?

1115
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:11,140
Do you have a favorite gift you've ever
been given and what's your go to Mall

1116
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:16,370
Food Panda Express. Taco Bell's sparrow
pizza. It's spiraled. Pizza sucks.

1117
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,970
It always looks good, I'll tell
you. But it really fills you up.

1118
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:23,430
I usually go with the chicken parm or
shown and that, that one a little scary.

1119
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,980
Then I get on the plane and they start
farting into that fucking flotation

1120
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:32,510
device beneath me. Or perhaps a
fancy sandwich from Obam Paul.

1121
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,290
They don't have, there's
nothing fancy about that other
than the fucking name. Um,

1122
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:41,150
all bond pan. If you're still living in
the 90s, always making fun of the place.

1123
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:46,160
Thanks and gobble, gobble, go fuck
yourself. All right. My plan of attack.

1124
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:50,390
When I enter a mall, I only go to a
mall when I need something, that's it.

1125
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:54,770
And I know what I want and I know where
it is and I go in there and when it's

1126
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:58,670
not there, I'm like, oh, what
the fuck? And then I leave. Um,

1127
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:03,450
I do not window shop at malls.
I hate malls.

1128
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,790
It's just all those fucking people and it,
it just makes me,

1129
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:12,230
they're just depressing. When I was
younger, it was great. You walked around,

1130
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:15,620
there was all these fucking,
I was like, what you did?

1131
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:21,020
You go to the mall and then you ran into
girls that you were in your grade and

1132
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,840
they'd be like, hi, Bill.
And I'd be like, hi.

1133
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,210
And I'd walk away my face all red.

1134
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:34,160
And then it was like, Whoa, why didn't
I say thought that I hate myself?

1135
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:37,400
And then I went, when? Then where
would I sit down and eat? Um,

1136
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,560
I don't like Panda Express. Uh, Taco Bell,

1137
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:46,760
no fast food. Mexican food. Why
don't you just play Russian roulette?

1138
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:49,820
That's Taco bell is Russian
roulette for your ass.

1139
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:55,460
I'm spiral pizzas. Same fucking
thing. Where would, where would I go?

1140
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,890
Well, if I had to choose smaller
as I go to, I'd go to sparrow. Um,

1141
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,860
that's usually some barbecue thing.
I Dunno.

1142
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:09,090
You know what I hate is when they had,

1143
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:13,980
they'd have that little sweet and sour
chicken on the toothpicks and then that

1144
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:17,670
overly smiling Asian women would come
over and ask you if you wanted one.

1145
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,040
Yeah.

1146
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,870
It's just like, didn't you like poison
the toys? I don't want to eat that. Right.

1147
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,190
How Archie bunker was that I just don't
like, I just fucking creeps me out.

1148
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:32,360
That you're walking around with food.
Like where,

1149
01:11:32,361 --> 01:11:35,610
where was that? Where did
you get that? You know,

1150
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:38,130
you're on this side of the counter,
like on that side.

1151
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,550
I already know there's enough health
code violations at sparrow pizza,

1152
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:45,550
Taco Bell and Panda Express. Enough
rat turds in that shit that, you know,

1153
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:47,010
I should run out of here right now.

1154
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,200
But now you're on this side
where people are sneezing.

1155
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:52,200
You're on this side of the sneeze
glass walking around with that shit.

1156
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:55,200
You don't even have a covered stuck
with a little fucking toothpick.

1157
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,780
And then you've got that other thing
over there where people stick their use

1158
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:02,410
toothpicks. Well, you get that
fucking glazed chicken out of my face.

1159
01:12:02,411 --> 01:12:05,570
This smiley be it.
Um,

1160
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,060
yeah.

1161
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,420
Yeah. I'm too old to eat at those places.
When I was younger aid at Mickey D's, Oh,

1162
01:12:10,421 --> 01:12:15,110
ate McDonald's hose and Mcdonald's
guy a Kentucky fried chicken cold.

1163
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:18,380
I can never eat it hot. That grease when
it's hot, it makes me sick to my stomach.

1164
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:22,190
When it's cold, it's fucking ecstasy.
And I would melt into the rug,

1165
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,400
into the rug like I was
on in train spotting. Um,

1166
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,640
I'd like friendlies back in the day,
get myself a nice burger,

1167
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:36,170
melt in a fucking Jim Dandy, nice.
3000 calories to the fucking hat.

1168
01:12:36,171 --> 01:12:39,170
And then I walk out of there and go play
Frisbee football because that's what

1169
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:43,040
you did back then with my fucking
white sox yanked up to underneath,

1170
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:47,120
underneath my Patella. Um, Ken Patella.

1171
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,350
All right. That's the podcast
for this week. People, I
don't know what to tell you.

1172
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,460
All right. I hope you guys
have a wonderful thanksgiving.

1173
01:12:54,461 --> 01:12:56,470
My European tour is about to start.

1174
01:12:56,471 --> 01:13:00,160
I'm going over to Italy and speaking
of going to like the first bowl ever,

1175
01:13:00,161 --> 01:13:01,540
I'm going to go to the coliseum.

1176
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,210
So if you're in Italy and
you're going to be over there,

1177
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,180
look for me in the coliseum.
Um,

1178
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:11,320
it hasn't even hit me yet. Then
I'm going to be, I actually,

1179
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:14,890
we landed Charles de Gaulle
airport in Paris and then we,

1180
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:20,200
we fly over to Italy and
it's an unbelievable, it's
something to give thanks for,

1181
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:22,900
it's an unbelievable privilege that,
um,

1182
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,530
I could do what I do for a living and
enough people come out to see me that I

1183
01:13:27,531 --> 01:13:31,820
can take the lovely Nia with
me over to, uh, to Italy.

1184
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:36,910
And so thank you to everybody who's come
out to my shows this year and all the

1185
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:40,850
years past. Um, and uh,

1186
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:43,790
I'm really looking forward to giving
everybody their money's worth over in

1187
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:47,630
Europe because I plan on doing
this for the rest of my career, uh,

1188
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:53,590
doing stand up and traveling
over to Europe and I'm
going to tour Australia next

1189
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,460
year and Canada, the Canada
one's going down in March and a,

1190
01:13:58,461 --> 01:14:01,700
we're working on those dates right now
and I just planned to keep on expanding

1191
01:14:01,701 --> 01:14:06,680
it. I'm hoping to also do New Zealand
and a, I know there's a Gig in India.

1192
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,240
I mean,
why the fuck wouldn't I go?

1193
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:12,250
I want to go over them and
see what that's like, right.

1194
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,860
Tokyo and all those places I plan on, you
know, you only go around fucking once.

1195
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,680
And I really believe that when
you're dead, you don't go anywhere.

1196
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,990
I think he just go in the fucking ground
and you make the soil rich for other

1197
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:28,570
living things.
So

1198
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:34,890
if you've got a comedy club, I'm fucking
going to try to hit it before I die.

1199
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:38,380
Something. I want to see the Great Wall
of China. I want to see all of that shit.

want, you know, something.

1201
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:45,340
Somebody came up to me from Saudi
Arabia and gave me some currency.

1202
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,600
It was really fucking cool. It said 50.
I'm like, Dude, you give me 50 bucks.

1203
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:50,021

and I can still 15 bucks.

1205
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,060
