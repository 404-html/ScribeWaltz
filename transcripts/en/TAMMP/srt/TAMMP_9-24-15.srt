only the pride of trend.

The best looking guy on long island.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, Dude,

Tell you what's up as a new
CD. Yes. Said is dropping.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,200
I believe that's all the rappers and the
kids say hopping in less than 24 hours.

15
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,810
Yes. And it's called
night at the stand. Yes.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,460
Because it was taped live at
the stand at this stand. Yeah,

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,820
we'll do it live. I didn't want to do
live, everyone's like live at this,

18
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,430
live at that. And I was like, you know,
I'm just gonna stick to Knight. Knight.

19
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:14,901
It's a stamp.

20
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:19,510
What did she do pre recorded pre
recorded at the Smith that Stan,

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,410
you know what was only like three,
three comics.

22
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,660
So I don't even think I would get
that joke. I a pre recorded wasn't it?

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,170
Me Mean he's making fun of it saying like,

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,810
oh you liked that little piece that
the uh, the piece of Shit TV's on.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,290
That's a little art deco. Yeah. And
the TV is way too small for that piece.

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,450
It's unbelievable. That's like a
toupee. If I had a little yeah,

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,900
but a small to pay at my
giant Charlie Brown had,

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,290
that's what the fuck would look like.
That TV over there.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,820
Me and [inaudible] had
been going to a Texas. Um,

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,170
I got here Sunday night and Monday. Right.
So as people know last week after my,

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,500
my 72 day run, I think I came up a
couple hours short of 72 hours. But uh,

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,980
I did 72 day cleanse because somebody
told me it takes 72 days to cleanse your

33
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:06,360
liver. And somebody told me on
Twitter it goes to it. It's 72 hours.

34
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:09,900
She fucking dope. I heard was
40 days, so I don't know. Yeah,

35
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,200
everyone's knowing that Jesus walked
through the somebody who was like 40 days

36
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:17,300
is when your liver is fully recovered.
Now 40 days is Noah's Ark with the,

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,450
with the, uh, with the shrubs. I wonder
why I fucking now and the yaks, you know,

38
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,090
you know me dude. I do not, I don't
drink for two, three days and I'm like,

39
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:27,790
I'm good. Let's go. Right. Yeah. Cigars.
I didn't, I didn't see me. So let's,

40
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,130
let's back up here.
Okay.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,130
Those are what we just did was we
threw out all a bunch of numbers.

42
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,910
We've got to figure out what
these mean, right? 40 days. Yeah.

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,590
That was a Moses 40 days and 40 nights
he wandered around. Was it Abraham?

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,340
I bill and he led the Jews out of
the forest desert and find freedom.

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,790
And I do. I was one of those, cause I
didn't go to CCD. I didn't, you know,

46
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,050
my father always hard and I always argue
it's going to rain for 40 days and 40

47
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,010
nights duty.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,830
Only thing I know about Noah's Ark because
he took a bunch of animals on a ship.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,330
How much fucking was going on that ship?
He's got a male and a female.

50
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:07,880
It's fun and it's been a nightmare on
that ship shit everywhere. Animal Shit.

51
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,070
And they never see that
out of all the stories.

52
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,770
I didn't know, it just came
out like, did you ever see,

53
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:19,330
you ever hear how Joe Rogan's bid on that?
Joe Actually took the time,

54
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,880
which is why I love his act.
He actually took the time to research,

55
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,720
which I never do. How many species?
That's just just what we know.

56
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,350
How many species are on the planet.
Really? Yeah. I'd say it was,

57
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:33,640
it was well into the millions
and he would've had to
have two of each and he had

58
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,240
a guy like,
I'm not going to do it.

59
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,620
It just ended with this moron
guy just going like, oh big
ones. That fucking boat.

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,030
Just completely,

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,470
it's one of those religious arguments
that the other person would just say,

62
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,420
you're going to go to hell. I'm
praying for you. Cause they,

63
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,290
they would have no way to, there's no
robot that, that it's what anyways, Paul,

64
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,060
you know you're a tough guy
for me to hang out with,

65
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,280
cause I get along with
you so well and had a,

66
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,270
you'd like to smoke and drink and go to
the fucking I hop and all that and got,

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,930
dammit. That's what we've been doing it.
But let's just back up for a second. You,

68
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,500
you are a very big influence.
You're a bad influence to do them.

69
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,570
You're a bad influence.
You put this on me know,

70
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:15,490
because I see him here to promote your
album and you're going to do this to me

71
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,000
now I do it. You're one of those
guys where as soon as you go, yeah,

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,390
like when I know you're in, it's fucking,
dude. You're hard to keep up with.

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,910
Here's the thing about bill,
when you drink with bill,

74
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,690
when he really wants to drink,
it's just, it's never a no. Yeah.

75
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:31,260
And do you want to do another shot? And
you just go, you get that look. Yeah.

76
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,130
And once you do that, dude, I woke up,
I miss my kids. I woke up, it woke up,

77
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:40,210
my wife was ready to fucking divorce
me dude, because, oh that's right.

78
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,840
You kind of make,
you just kept going and I was like,

79
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:47,860
I'm not saying no to when I'm in. And we
were hammered first period of the game.

80
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,070
We went to the first one
that we were drinking.

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,400
We were particularly pint
vodka is that dude did.

82
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,740
That was the night you got to
to do George Stephanopoulos.

83
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:01,330
George Stephanopoulos can. It was
fucking Jeff Gordon. Oh, that's right.

84
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,540
You were a good friend. You Go
Virginia. I am not letting you drive.

85
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,340
You cannot drive it.
You know it's going to put,

86
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,980
you were so afraid of your
wife's taking your head off dude.

87
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:11,110
You are like movie drunk and I said Paul,

88
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,210
just lay down here for a
couple hours at least get even,

89
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,810
I can't let you drive there. Just sit
down. Smash cut. My phone's going off.

90
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:23,440
I look at seven Oh nine I was supposed
to be an hour north to get my kids and my

91
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:27,670
wife's going whereby I don't even want to
get it was, it was, it was bad. You know,

92
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,790
where have you been with the phone and
then dude, I did. You saw it though.

93
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,480
You did. Is He did do is,
yeah. You took some mustard
off for fastball. I did, yeah.

94
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,650
I sent her a cute text. Yeah.
Yeah. Put the blame on me. Yeah.

95
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,270
I told her I was a good son
and my friend help me out.

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,530
He took muster up for fastball.
He had to look out for it.

97
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,560
That was like that guy last night when
I got into that with that lady in the

98
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:52,120
crowd and we were really getting into
that whole debate about the wage gap and

99
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,240
then I looked over and I saw the guy
she was with their husband or something.

100
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,970
I felt so bad. I was like, oh my.
I was like, oh I was just like,

101
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,880
I heard you say that and I was laughing.
Yeah, that's great. I was like,

102
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,580
you got to drive home with her and
she's going to act like you said it.

103
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,940
And I just would say, and
I, I tried to take a little,

104
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:11,120
I felt bad for that guy cause
he was sitting there and
staring at me like, dude,

105
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,930
like really? I heard you say,
listen, the ride home going
to suck. But it's, it's me,

106
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,910
not him. He didn't say any of
it. That's right. And I said to,

107
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,780
it's just to let you know, while I was
saying that he was shaking his head going,

108
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,710
wow, I don't agree with this. I did
what? I could really shake his hand.

109
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,450
Now of course he didn't. Right. Well I
hope he's not listening to this coffee.

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,940
Then I was trying to somehow,
you know, I felt bad.

111
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,050
I felt like I did a Colby Bryan, you know,
Shaq does it too. You know what I mean?

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,510
It's dry.

113
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,590
When the fuck am I dragging him enough
fucking guys that are scared of their

114
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,960
women. It's fucking a
disgrace, isn't it? It is.

115
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,080
Unless you dating like Rhonda Rousey or
somebody would think I would be scared

116
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,250
of Ronda Rousey winning respect. I was,
what's enough? I was a Ronda Rousey.

117
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:52,520
I'm be like, dude, I gotta
get home. Rhonda said,

118
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:54,530
be home by 11 I ain't
fucking with the snow due.

119
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,380
My buddy interviewed her and she
has that thing where she's like,

120
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:00,860
she did that thing where she was like,
listen, I eat hot links with extra.

121
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,060
She goes, it was great. She goes,

122
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:05,690
I eat hot links with the extra hot
sauce and blue cheese. And she goes,

123
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,300
and if you're a man and you do ranch
and not blue cheese, I'm done with you.

124
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,510
She goes chunky blue cheese. And
that's what I'm saying. Okay.

125
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:14,210
So then he goes no repetitive back
to you to put her in her place.

126
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:19,010
I think it's just, you know, walk
in software out to who? Fuck that

127
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,020
Pussy Shit. I know she does it,
but I'm just saying, you know,

128
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:27,350
we all were guys where you're going to
piss her off and you know, it'd be funny,

129
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,800
a guy who starts to step up to her and
as soon as he sees that fucking neck

130
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,260
flare up, he's like, I have kids.
So here I going to go through,

131
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:36,200
I wanted to do a bit imitating,
like dating her.

132
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:39,110
I just knew my body couldn't take it
because I was going to be imitated getting

133
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:43,130
the argument and I was going
to flip over the stool.

134
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:44,510
You know like she does the arm bar thing.

135
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,650
Joe Rogan was backstage at the comedy
store trying to show me how to do it

136
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,380
without hurting myself and I'm just like,
dude,

137
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:54,650
I'm not going to do this every fucking
night. It would be fucking hilarious.

138
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,920
And I was going to be in the arm bar,
just call real mature.

139
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,070
Then when she goes for the chunk
of steel,

140
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,520
that panic yet when you can't breathe
there would have been fucking hilarious,

141
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:12,200
but it was just the level of pain that
I was going to have to go through to do

142
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,760
it.
It might be something I might,

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,880
I'll wing when now they've kind of said
the whole dirty your clothes and shit,

144
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,670
but just like, yeah, if she
was actually like abusive,

145
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:23,240
just you know what it might be. We
fucking brutal. Oh my God. Yeah.

146
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:26,840
She's a tough chick man. She's awesome.
I love her fights. I was saying,

147
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,120
cause you're a big box and god,

148
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,160
you were talking about how guys are
actually saying she's the first,

149
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,950
let's go home and let's watch the site.
The first female,

150
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,420
pretty much athlete that I've ever seen.
God, the guys are like, we're going home.

151
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,970
Look where we're getting the rousy fight.
Like that doesn't ever happen before.

152
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,030
It never fucking happened
before we was that Laila Ali,

153
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,750
Leila Ali was like the boxing
champion. She was great. She fucking,

154
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,720
she kicked the shit out of everybody.
But it wasn't like a, like Rousey's just,

155
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:50,931
you know,

156
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:55,000
she just goes in there like fucking like
fuck Tom Hardy did in the shit and then

157
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,230
to warrior. Remember that? Do you
remember that? Do you remember that? Uh,

158
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,900
that fight Tyson had,

159
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,380
where he knocked that guy out to
skinny guy who thinks he looks old now.

160
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:09,000
He looked like he was in
that movie carwash. Oh, well
Mitch Mitch, Blood Green.

161
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,650
He had that fucking Afro
Leftover on the 70s. Yeah, right.

162
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,490
And he fucking, when he got back
up and Tyson came running up,

163
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,250
it looked like he was like Dave Parker
trying to throw it in from the warning

164
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,780
track except what was it?
Overhand right.

165
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,750
And the guy just kind of like
try to turn his head sideways.

166
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,970
I saw a fight on ESPN and
it's actually on one of those,

167
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,980
a great knock out videos on youtube
with this woman did this to this to this

168
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,250
other woman dude.

169
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,340
And I thought she fucking killed
her and that was probably the best.

170
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,520
Like I actually tried to keep up with
whoever that fighter was like I'm gonna

171
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:42,480
Watch this woman fight again.

172
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:46,260
Cause you know I never seen a woman
with this kind of punching power until,

173
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,810
you know, Rhonda came along like
that kind of dominance suit,

174
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,730
this big goofy white girl. Right. And she,

175
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:57,330
she just fucking, she
hit her, knocked her out.

176
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,010
Like it was the full shot cold dude.

177
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,050
It was one of those things to
grafting and start counting.

178
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:05,260
He was just waving and the
girls stood over her, Jesus and,

179
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,030
and fucking like pelvic pump or something.
That was the only thing.

180
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,290
What was that about her, the
fight was just like, Yo, you know,

181
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,600
you might've killed a man, go
easy, go to your neutral corner,

182
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,760
standing over doing
like she did everything.

183
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:20,550
But you know that then that shit that
people do now where you're knocked out in

184
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:23,330
the street and someone takes that cell
phone picture like fucking two inches

185
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,170
from your face. She did
everything but that uh, um, but
yeah, there hasn't been, um,

186
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,570
it hasn't been anyone like us. So, uh,
I dunno. I Dunno how boxing, boxing,

187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,320
boxing stinks. And I used to be, you know
me, I used to talk shit about you. US,

188
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,790
I'll be the first who, a minute I just
talk shit about UFC. I'm like, fuck that.

189
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,920
I want to see dudes barefoot. It's just a
blood bath. I got to tell you that they,

190
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,500
they're already getting,

191
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,690
when they were in the guard looked
like they were ready to have sex.

192
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,800
I'm fucking riveted now by that card to
the fights before rousing that night.

193
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,160
It was unbelievable. Yeah. Fucking
guy's face was just like a fight.

194
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:55,370
It was like a faucet of blood
comes out and he's just,

195
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:59,250
a fight is fucking unbelievable. It's if
it, oh, there was a couple of great ones,

196
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:02,850
dude. It was blood all over that undercard
hell yeah. There was a couple like,

197
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,820
I don't know how to fuck you. Dig
Heads fucking wide open. I was shy,

198
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,630
dude.
You when Dude,

199
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,420
let me go get stitched up and I'm going
to go get my real estate license. Ah,

200
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:14,670
dude.

201
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,870
Then the guy's nose was so broken that
he still fought with it and then he got

202
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,540
hit so hard with it already
broken and they had to stop.

203
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,990
But it was fucking brutal, man.
I don't know. It didn't say, oh,

204
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,720
what the fuck are we debating on the
way up here where we said it'd be a good

205
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,870
podcast. Oh, we can't talk about
that. God dammit so much shit.

206
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,950
And you just can't talk about me, man.
What the fuck are you talking about?

207
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,300
Oh yeah, the one thing to
the other thing. Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,120
It's not buck the land I wanted to
buy. I was on the way up there. Yeah,

209
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,300
I mean fucking Alaris so we're driving
up between Houston and Dallas and this

210
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,360
big sign it says 648 or
680 acres.com so I go,

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,650
I go look up that website. I don't know
what is 680 acres cost in Texas. Yup.

212
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,310
And uh,

213
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,310
it came out to a little more than it
was like 3,508 was 3,500 Acre Times 681

214
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:04,090
which is the accurate number. And it came
out to be like a two point $3 million.

215
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,330
I'll just highway land land
right across the highway. No,

216
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,810
it wasn't all the way down. I thought
it went in to do, went in a little bit,

217
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,370
but there was another highway
on the other side, right?

218
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,770
35 came on the other side
and I'll 35 away over.

219
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,890
Oh I don't know how deep it went
in, but I was saying like, dude,

220
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:22,510
that's unbelievable and you will live in
Paul's analogy. Cause I was just like,

221
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:26,500
dude, if you buy 10 acres
in Texas, it's 35 grand,

222
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,670
but 10 fucking acres, 600 to
seven acres, that's a town.

223
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,460
That's a small fucking town.
You can be mayor.

224
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,600
I want to buy that and start
my own fucking town. Right.
And you would go in like,

225
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,260
uh, no, no, no, no dude. You know, it's
what I wanted to fucking highway. I mean,

226
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,960
what were you going to do with, you know,
my thing is like guys out here in Texas,

227
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:47,500
like Cuban and these fucking billionaires,
they know that's out here.

228
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,000
They know what's available and it's like
for 2.3 which is a drop in the fucking

229
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,340
bucket, they're probably like,
no, what am I gonna do with that?

230
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,290
It's off the interstate.
Somebody wants to go to a strip mall.

231
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,120
I get a little fucking Dallas,
that's all.

232
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,190
I'm just going to go on a fucking daily,
you know,

233
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,740
far away Dallas's for most people.
First of all,

234
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,200
I'm not acting like I could
just afford to do that. I was,

235
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,480
I was just trying to see how
much land costs out here.

236
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,460
Then I was acting like
I could afford that.

237
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:13,060
And then he's gone into your logic
was, well, Mark Cuban didn't buy it,

238
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,380
so it's fucking bullshit.
It's like,

239
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:18,750
Mark Cuban didn't buy a lot of shit
right now. I know. I didn't know I began,

240
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,040
you know, then you got to worry
about the environmental people.

241
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,860
You got to put up fucking rest stops.
I'd rather you know what you do.

242
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,783
Here's what you do.

243
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,390
You buy a strip mall that's already exists
and you put the best stores in there

244
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,350
and that's all you gotta.

245
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,390
Then you gotta get rid of the
old guy with the shoe store.

246
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:35,500
The fuck do you do that? You get
to evict people. Uh, you know,

247
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,770
you gotta be Harley. He had a right get
it to get into commercial real estate.

248
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:41,680
You got to be fucking
heartless. Yeah, you do.

249
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,220
It was the wood Brown. Oh, here's
another argument we got into it.

250
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,930
Let's talk about, let's put talking
about sports cars now. Phil's argument.

251
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:54,160
Here's your argument. I called you up the
other day and we were talking and I go,

252
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:57,740
dude, a fucking, you know, you said
due to Ferrari or a Lamborghini,

253
00:13:57,741 --> 00:14:02,060
he's just fucking Douchey. That's a
jerk off. And I go, it's not, I go,

254
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:06,400
it's fucking gangster. And you go, no,
because it looks good in the showroom.

255
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,630
No absolute 100% from top to bottom.

256
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,720
That is a fucking jerk off car.
And I'll tell you why.

257
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:18,030
I've never seen anybody do, listen, my
thing, if you take it from the showroom,

258
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,440
you drive it home, right?
And then for the most part,

259
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:24,100
you just put it on a trailer and you drive
it down to the track and you're going

260
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:27,970
around like fucking like Steve McQueen.
You coolest shit.

261
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,630
But if you fucking drive that thing down
the street to the grocery store to get

262
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:35,740
some bananas and pull in
right next to a fucking Prius,

263
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,680
you're a jerk off.
But that's the Prius has guy's fault.

264
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,650
No punishing this fucking guy cause
he's crushing it. No, the fight.

265
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:46,090
Don't know I'm not.
I'm saying what kind of a fucking Paul,

266
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,780
you're going to drive this $200,000 card
down the fucking street with pot holes

267
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,040
and all that shit. The Amish,
that suspension just alone.

268
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,480
I met front little fucking sin hits
the ground. I get it. But Dude,

269
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,780
I'm doing fact that someone like me in
a Prius can rear end you and then make

270
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:03,830
that face that, Ooh, sorry. Face that you
just had 180 grand. I'm telling you Paul,

271
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,790
it's a fucking jerk off. I'm
telling you right now, dude,

272
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,860
if I have $50 million on fucking pulling
up in a Lamborghini Diablo to fucking a

273
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:13,910
Carvel, I don't give a fuck who sitting
academically as Europe car. Now it's not.

274
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm not a jerk off.
I'm a fuck.

275
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,320
Cause you'd be a jerk off enjoying
the fruits of my labor. Do it.

276
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,260
And this is a thing to pull.

277
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,170
You would crash that car because you
wouldn't learn how to fucking drive like

278
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,260
one hour, one hour, one hour, one hour.
You have it wrapped around a fucking tree.

279
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,120
Nah, you did a curve. Do these
all these videos on youtube.

280
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:32,810
Dude,
I'm not,

281
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,540
I'm not saying that I could handle that
fuck at two to five and got that car.

282
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,450
I would take it to a track and
I would hire a guy going, dude,

283
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,430
teach me how to drive this thing.

284
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,110
You can't go from a Camry to something
that goes for miles an hour. All right?

285
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,510
I think the, you're not going to
spin out and let me ask you this.

286
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:51,230
What car is enough for the street where,
where is your line get drawn?

287
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,780
Where as far as elegant a lot of money.

288
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,730
What do you think is not what she
would have to be on a Saturday?

289
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,670
The Porsche level around the house,

290
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,340
anything go beyond like the run
the hundred thousand dollars.

291
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,360
Do I even think some of those
fucking those, those, those 200 day,

292
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,410
you gotta look a $200,000 car
and you drive down the street,

293
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:10,370
your fucking chair cough.
You know, I don't know dude.

294
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,670
I just feel like you are earning Shannon.
I'm not saying you didn't earn it.

295
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,260
I'm not saying he's the guy
with the yacht. A journal. If,

296
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,130
if every other boats of fishing boat and
he's got this fucking thing that he's

297
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,150
out. Nobody takes it out in the ocean. He
fucking pulls into the south of France.

298
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:24,260
He's got fucking superman.

299
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,350
He's not just pulling into car Belk
sort of talking about right now.

300
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,070
If you get it, you have to get the
hard top cause you get the convertible,

301
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,350
the convertible's a chicken,
100% agree.

302
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,060
You can't have any charitable, yeah,
it's a chicken. It's a chip card.

303
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,660
Unless you got one of the older ones.
The older ones that what?

304
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,360
The convertible that are fucking cool.
But I like to be tops, but he stops man.

305
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,480
He tops. She got all of the skin. I mean
it's just, you know, that's like me.

306
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:54,140
Like I see a beer fun. My pasty
freckles. I don't even want to do it.

307
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:57,830
I got to go up to it. Yeah.
Canyons and Greeks. You get
tee tops. It's fucking over.

308
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,190
Oh yeah. I love white cars. The
older I get, the more Italian.

309
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,810
I love what you don't like what?
No,

310
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:07,130
I did a bit sane people who drive
white cars as scumbags, like cars,

311
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:11,040
like BMW, Mercedes. Oh yeah,

312
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,690
they've all dirt on me, Dude. I'm a
black car guy. A black is the color.

313
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,030
I think blacks are color and give a
fuck. People like guy, it gets dirty.

314
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:20,390
Fuck that guy. Man gets a
black car. We need a fucking
blue green. I mean I get it,

315
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,890
but for me it's gotta be black. If I
got a Ferrari tomorrow, it's black.

316
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,020
You're going to get black and I could
get the classic red. Nah, that's chill.

317
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,690
That weird fucking Christie
Brinkley in fucking Dan,

318
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,430
Dan and then a fuck that I,

319
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,100
I haven't settled is I love Ferrari's.
Obviously.

320
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
I think they were an
absolute fucking work of art,

321
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:46,610
but I think the only two places they
look good or in the show room or on the

322
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:50,820
track. Well, what about driving down the
street? What about a hold on a second.

323
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:55,080
What a corvette looks like. Not a street
car either and it's a fucking rocket.

324
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,670
I would,

325
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,650
but I put that in the realm of like
getting yourself like a Porsche nine 11 or

326
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,350
whatever. One of those.
Alright. Alright. Yeah,

327
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,470
that's about as fun as far as you can
go as far as you could go as a vet.

328
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,120
Then you'd say,
dude,

329
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,410
you have buy like a really nice suit and
brush up and get you get an a Cadillac.

330
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,490
Hey, you're all fucking nerve.
You can't even enjoy it.

331
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,720
People texting while driving and you're
riding down the street and like 300

332
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,470
grand you'd drive and basically their
house down the fucking street. Yeah.

333
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,350
Somebody is going to hit you.
Yeah. Now that you know the, the,

334
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,920
I like your point about the potholes
to especially like in New York City and

335
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:30,921
stuff like to do it fucking as a reason
to drive a Ferrari down a fucking

336
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:34,470
regular street is so people can be like,
wow,

337
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,480
look at all the money that guy has.

338
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,030
That's the only fucking
reason you think that though.

339
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:42,150
Do you think some guy's just fucked in
the cockpit of those fucking things?

340
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:46,500
If no, tell down to the fucking
track. You can go 180 miles an hour.

341
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,030
Do when you have a smile on your face.

342
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:52,050
Did that Sunday you'd smile smiling on
Thursday to an upward. Three more days,

343
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,660
three more days. I'm going to
get to do it again. Yes dude.

344
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,040
You don't buy a 200 to 200 fucking mile
an hour car to get on a highway where

345
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,430
the speed limit is 55 it's just fucking
stupid. And then on top of that,

346
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,430
they snow plowed and all this shit
that they didn't fuck the thing up.

347
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,120
Some giant 18 wheelers rubber
off their fucking dude.

348
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,880
I got tires laying in the road. I got to
tell you though, there was a guy by me,

349
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,660
he's got a white for
white or black Ferrari.

350
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:16,170
He drives it on a nice Sunday
afternoon around the neighborhood.

351
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:19,800
It's fucking crazy. Let's be amazing.
And he gets it up to 40 miles an hour.

352
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,780
No, I know, I know, I
hear. I hear your point.

353
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:28,460
But I would never punish myself cause
everybody else can't afford it. No, you,

354
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:29,460
you're missing the point.

355
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:33,720
I'm not begrudging that somebody
has it for the 50th fucking time.

356
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,310
I'm just saying put it on a trailer,

357
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:39,930
take it down to the track and really
drive the fucking thing, you know? I know,

358
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:42,570
but I'm not fucking waiting. I just
want to dry. Want a fucking go out.

359
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:45,900
Why you won't go [inaudible] I want
to feel it. Yeah, yeah. Till my wife.

360
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,810
Come on sweetheart. Let's go. Fucking
lets you know that's, it's stupid.

361
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,280
At that point you might
as well get a corvette.

362
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,440
Save yourself a couple hundred
grand because you don't,

363
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,510
you're going to be able to drive
just as fast. I'd be like, sweet.

364
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:57,080
Do you haven't see those?

365
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,820
Do you ever see those videos when they
show the Lamborghinis and the Ferrari's

366
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:02,080
driving through the country fucking roads?
Yeah,

367
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,040
and they're fucking doing like a buck
80 and all that type of shit too.

368
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,180
That's for the commercial shoot.

369
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:09,930
I guarantee you they got people out there
with leaf blowers and they smooth that

370
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,830
hold. It was like in the day when you
were, when roller, uh, roller skate wins.

371
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:17,860
Skate boarding first came out and
some assholes. Ah, go sweep the drive.

372
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:21,870
I don't want to see because
one little fucking level,
you see a flying. Yeah, dude,

373
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:25,650
you can't go 180 miles an hour down the
street with like tree branches and shit

374
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:28,800
in the fucking wrong. You're going
to go, if you're going to die,

375
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,600
we've got to find out how many
people didn't buy him a year.

376
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,170
I want to know that and look at,
look at them.

377
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm not going to name the fucking things,
but there was that guy in the MMA,

378
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,880
he fucking died in one and there
was a guy from all those, uh,

379
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,010
fast and furious and those supercars dude.

380
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,250
And that was a professional driver
driving that Betty hit his stick. Yeah,

381
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,060
but here's the thing, dude, you
can't be going 130 miles an hour.

382
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,760
I don't give a fuck dude. Like, I
mean rest their souls and everything,

383
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,790
but that's tracking. There
was a box at the track. Yeah,

384
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,270
but even going that fast at a track,

385
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,480
if you're not a fucking
qualified to do it like globe do.

386
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,680
Could you imagine if somebody gave
me a thing of Dominique got to track.

387
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,350
It's like talking to a wall here.
I said I would buy the fucking thing.

388
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:05,220
I go down to the track and I have
somebody teach me how to drive it. Yes.

389
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,110
What I would do, I don't
know dude. I would just,

390
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,100
you'd go out and you go see
the next fucking, I'd go
out and visible. I would go,

391
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:16,840
I would want one sort of valley
it down at the fucking showcase.

392
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,673
Cinema

393
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,880
Sticky gummy bear hints

394
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,290
is work apart. I have total, I
think they were absolutely gorgeous.

395
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:33,910
Works of fucking art and dude, it would
be like, and to drive it down the street,

396
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:36,760
we'd be like buying the Mona Lisa
and hanging it up in a cabana.

397
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,820
That is an air condition
son getting on it and shit.

398
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:43,180
It's just fucking ridiculous. Uh, yeah.

399
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,640
Now my kids would fucking ruined it
too. Could you imagine? You know,

400
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,610
you drive down the street and they're
just paving the road for a couple of days.

401
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:51,400
They have the manhole covers up a
little bit higher. Uh, you know,

402
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,540
all of a sudden you turned
down that street. Uh, yeah.
You know, I get it. I get it.

403
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,140
Just say it. You're make a point. I just
don't think a guy, I just don't think you,

404
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,750
I think, I don't think the guys that
do or a jerk off, I will tell you this.

405
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,770
That's why I love the corvette, because
the corvette is the perfect, it's a,

406
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,330
it's a fucking supercar, but it's still
enough of a street car. You know, it's,

407
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:13,240
these still look stupid. If you go those
puddles of fuck you up to an event.

408
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,730
Absolutely. Yeah. Apps, the
fucking movie, Dude. I mean,

409
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:19,600
you can get into a corvette
for like 60 grand, 50 grand,
60 grand. You're in there.

410
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,610
He can get a fucking insane one for
like 90 or 100. Yeah, Dude. Yeah,

411
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,850
that's about it. You can go out there
three and a thousand dollar car.

412
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,760
I would have sound of that
fucking cave in the quarter panel.

413
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,450
Yeah, but what, just a sound above, oh,
that would be sick. Ah, yeah, but in,

414
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,170
in the frost,
you wouldn't feel frustration.

415
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,640
He could never get out of second gear.

416
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,980
I'd be a fucking dope and I get a ticket
the first time of the fucking highway I

417
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:46,870
was,
as I'm talking right now,

418
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,170
you'd fucking peel around a corner
and you would go right up on the curb.

419
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,000
Fucking oil pan.

420
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,300
Plus they pull it up to a comedy club
and then on the way home at night,

421
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,340
I'd fucking ended up going to
a buck 20 getting a ticket.

422
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,730
My wife would fucking kill me.
I'd get like set 12 points in my life.

423
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:04,150
I always ever doing a one 20 in a
Lamborghini or Ferrari and the cop came up

424
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:06,740
like, what's the, what's the right?
What do you mean for that Ferrari?

425
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,640
What's do you mean dope? Look what I'm
driving on the door. What the fuck?

426
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:12,940
He was like, you don't do that and you
want car. Every time you turn the lights,

427
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,530
you have a call. We'd have the fuck
Outta here. Sketch. What are you doing?

428
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,410
We need to come down.
It's a supercar. Yeah.

429
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,860
He caught me sneaking over
those chicks and cannonball run.

430
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,370
You'd have to fucking hope it's a gay
cop unbutton a couple of years fucking

431
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:28,890
button downs. All right, so Paul Versey,

432
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,740
he has a new album coming
out called please buy it,
man. I'm really proud of him.

433
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,250
I'm proud of it. It's uh,
we uh, did it. It was, uh,

434
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,590
April 9th on Thursday. We sold out
two shows. Uh, people came out.

435
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,650
It was great and I'm really
proud of it and buy it, man.

436
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:49,430
It'll be available tomorrow. It's my first
one. It's my debut one. And Yeah, man,

437
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:52,070
I hope I thank everybody.
Did a lot of people pre,

438
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,960
pre ordered it and it dropped soon,

439
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:56,420
so I was kind of nervous when you're
first time you put in something out,

440
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,510
I'm kind of nervous, you know, you'll
be fine. You'll be fine. It's great.

441
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,710
Now you know what? You got Paul,
you've got an asset. You invest,

442
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,400
you invested in yourself. You know
what I mean? Thanks, Bill. Makes a lot.

443
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,380

little bit of advertising here, right?

business as that's supposed to be for me.

446
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,330
Oh,
I guess this is a point to identify.

447
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,390
I should have like reverb on
the pain of hiring, hiring,

448

hiring as a business out of your company's
only as good as the people you hire.

enough to call to find quality candidates.

488
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:55,490
Shaggy fucking cock.
Then put them back on in.

489
00:26:55,491 --> 00:27:00,430
Your Dick will be dry and then go get
yourself a doughnut. Hang it on your Dick.

490
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,120
Jesus.
With this fucking pair of me on,

491
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,550
these are we all know how sexy confidence
can be. Do you find that sexy fall?

492
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,170
What? Confidence? Nah.
You don't find confidence.

493
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,830
Find it arrogant. I was kind
of Bitchy, right? Yeah. In
a woman is arrogant. I take,

494
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:19,210
wait, that's awful, but Sunday where for
men. Oh, okay. Yeah. Then conferences,

495
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,053
I guess,

496
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,250
and that confidence comes
down for being comfortable.

497
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,620
But how great can you
feel if your underwear,

498
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:31,080
it's wrinkled and riding
up on your fucking team

499
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,553
gets it?

500
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,370
Everybody designed it has a
tape and that's why they've
created the world's most

501
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:41,460

daily dose of concept confidence.

502
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,660
You wear underwear every day that Paul,
come on.

503
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,000
If you walk around with saggy underwear,

504
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:48,090
your balls are just staring at the
floor, right? Yeah. No you're not.

505
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:50,160
You're going to ask you actually
ask for that extra buck an hour.

506
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:53,520
You're not going to do it. That's
true. 65 days a year, rain or shine.

507
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:56,850
You need it to be extraordinary within
within an insane price. Tag me on these,

508
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,631
understands this,

509

and that's why they've created the
world's most comfortable underwear.

511
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:08,500
God Damn it. Paul. What do you do?
You feel great. You feel great? No.

512
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:12,530
When you look good, you feel good. No.
When you look good, you feel good. Good.

513
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,850
You look great. When I look
good, I feel great. Oh,

514
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:19,620
you do make me on these
Mandy's no more sweaty balls.

515
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,490
It's a cliche because it's true.
Me.

516
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,240
Andy's understands this and that's why
they design underwear that makes you look

517
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:26,910
and feel fantastic. Please include
all the following points. Well,

518
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:31,650
what the fuck he wrote it.
I'm going to read it. Um, me
undies. System mode. Modal,

519
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,950
modal. How would you say M O. D.
A. L model. M. O. D. A. L. Yeah.

520
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,330
They don't put an accent. They write
it all in lower case. M o. H my doll.

521
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,610
My Dell. Yeah. Mandy's is made from model.

522
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,370
I'll go with that. It's, I already know.

523
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:52,160
He's a fabric that's twice the softest
cotton. Mudhal no fucking nuts.

524
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,680
It's like that tennis
player, Nay Dell. Ah, yeah.

525
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,580
Not The de oh, no doubt. No
doubt. That's what it is.

526
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,350
It's more dal got a go to moves.
Remember that? Mandy's, ah,

527
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:09,490
that's twice the softest, whatever
underwear you're wearing right now.

528
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,960
And he has tons of colors and styles.

529
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:12,810
The only place to get matching
pairs for men and women.

530
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,870
They even released a new
design every month. Uh, I
were fill in the blank design,

531
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:18,900
black stripes tied I et cetera.

532
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,300
Plus we all know that paying for
shipping sucks. So order me undies. Uh,

533
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,400
it has removed from the equation.
So ordering from me and he says,

534
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,420
removed that from the equation.

535
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:32,870
All orders in the U S and Canada shipped
for free. Mian he's Jesus Christ.

536
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,950
Just sold them already.
Me undies even has a money back guarantee.

537
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:37,960
If you don't love your first pair,
you get it to keep it for free.

538
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:42,350
You literally have nothing to lose. Oh my
God, there's one more as one mark, Uber,

539
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:46,670
everybody. Hey, do you like
making great money? Hey Paul,
it was weighted so sleazy.

540
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:51,320
Hey Paul, he liked making
money. Money, right? Oh yeah,
yeah. Come over here. Listen,

541
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,470

I had to share with you.

542
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,030
Don't look around throwing around
driving with Uber.

543
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,530
Duke. Imagine some guy showed
up in a fucking Ferrari, Uber.

544
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,810
Uber's that popular, smarter holes in
the back. Oh yeah, just some board.

545
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:13,580
Rich Kid fucking hate my dad. I'm going
to make my own money. What we're saying.

546
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,040
And then he finally realizes that
everybody doesn't have a Ferrari.

547
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,280
What was that popular smartphone APP
that connects writers with drivers?

548
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:20,390
I take Uber a bunch.

549
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:23,960
Evidently I loved them evidently by the
way and in chatting with the different

550
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:24,351
drivers,

551
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:27,530
some of them have really interesting
stories is why they drive with Uber.

552
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,550
My Bitch, Jack's wife took the kids.
They love being their own boss.

553
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,460
They earned great money. It's easy to
start. You just need a car and a license.

554
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:37,850
Driving. Driving with Uber is great for
anyone who needs flexibility. Parents,

555
00:30:37,851 --> 00:30:41,720
this is a really easy way to work around
your family. Schedule students. Ladies,

556
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,200
you can make some extra money between
classes. Get off that stripper pole.

557
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,020
Now's the prime time to
cash in and drive with Uber.

558
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,840
You'll thank me for telling
you how to get paid every week.

559
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,240
I could be getting into your
car when you drive with Uber.

560
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,770
God knows I'll be hammered.

561
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,860
It's the only time I use them and
think of the lives that they save.

562
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,680
Call to action.
You got a car and a license.

563
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,800
Put a boat to work and start earning
serious life changing money today.

564
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:05,720
Sign up to drive with Uber.

565
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,550
Visit drive with uber.com that's drive
with uber.com drive with uber.com.

566
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,150
All right. Oh my God. Sorry. 31 minutes
Paul, before we get out of here. Yeah.

567
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,770
Thank you for being on and we've got to,

568
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,720
we've got to have your
NFL picks for this year.

569
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,580
A super football picks at the beginning
of the year where my showreel picture of

570
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:27,440
the beginning of the year where NFC Green
Bay packers AAFC Indianapolis Colts.

571
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,640
Okay. You're feeling good
about the packers? Uh,

572
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,970
I I'd say at the NFC
is completely weakened.

573
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,270
I think that I'm Russell Wilson and
you're fucking loud stadium jerk offs.

574
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,570
The Seahawks, I feel like they,
uh, they're not the same team.

575
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,610
The 49 are actually though. They
started slow last year. Yeah.

576
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,720
I mean they got Sham Canceler
Kam Chancellor back at safety,

577
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:50,030
so that's going to help
them. But it's still, I don't
think they're the same team.

578
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,370
San Francisco,
40 niners not the same team.

579
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,280
I could tell you my New York football
giants, as much as I hate to say it,

580
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,290
they're not the same team.
Cowboys Lost Romo.

581
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,880
That's a huge hit at the time to press
the panic button in New York. Uh,

582
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,650
not yet.
But you know,

583
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,490
then we'll see what happens with Dallas
Eagles are not shift Kelly and eagles

584
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:11,540
there. Their little fucking plan hasn't
worked. The only my guy, Sam Bradford's,

585
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:14,720
my guy, I still believe in him.
Do you want to leave it in him?

586
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,250
You've been believing in him for a long
time and do it and I gotta tell Ya,

587
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,410
I hope got one year left
brother before it becomes, yeah,

588
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,370
I saw one of your big picture. So I
was fucking steak house the other day.

589
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,540
So yeah, dude, I take Aaron Rodgers,
you know who's playing good.

590
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,670
Your boy Matty ice over there.
The falcons are playing good,

591
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:32,130
but I still like end of
the day gun to my head.

592
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Aaron Rodgers is fucking
unbelievable. I like him. Now,

593
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,860
here's why be the Falcon fans
can actually chair this year.

594
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:40,220
So they don't need to pump in all
that extra crowd noise. Right.

595
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,320
I've got to throw that in. You know,
if we're going to get out. I don't,

596
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,940
but I don't blame me. Um, but I do it. I
thought Andrew Luck was going to be there.

597
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:49,340
Started out real bad this
year, dude. So I don't know.

598
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,940
And you guys with the fucking shit.
I should've known better every time.

599
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:55,460
I think the Patriots are going to, not
that I thought they were going to take us,

600
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,420
but fucking with that deflate gate.
Brady's like fuck you. Seven touchdowns,

601
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:02,360
two games. I mean, it's a joke.
It's a fucking joke, dude. Yeah.

602
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,850
They'll come up with something.
Jim would say,

603
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,800
we'll come up with some other
ticky tack Horse Shit to say.

604
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:11,750
That's why we beat them by 50 fucking
points. Yeah. Yeah. He's a baby. He's,

605
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,730
yeah, but let's look what's
going to happen. I mean,

606
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,300
look at Brady's doing already
to having people learn,

607
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,930
but it's early having people learn
to push a patriots. Yeah, just keep,

608
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,750
let them do it. It's great. He's offended.
Then they get the US against them.

609
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,460
It solidifies the team.
It's fantastic. I'll do,

610
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,960
one of the funniest
things was when you guys,

611
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:31,940
after that fucking spygate when you guys
went into buffalo and it was like the

612
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,440
night for the guy that was paralyzed.
It should,

613
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:36,880
they have them on the big screen to
you guys won like 55 to 10 or so.

614
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,820
It was so crazy. And they as Bella check,
cause he was so defiant after spike,

615
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:41,660
it has check.
They're like,

616
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,930
why are you going for it on fourth down
near the goal line when you're up 21

617
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:48,050
points. And he goes, you know, it's only
three touchdowns. Like he just fucking,

618
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,940
he was oh yeah, he doesn't
give a fuck dude. Yeah he does.

619
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,580
He definitely does not.
Well a unfortunately. Dude,

620
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:58,970
we got to wrap this up so fucking quickly.
Uh, you've been crushing it, Paul,

621
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,270
with the new stuff on stage. No thank
you. I mean you'd be at best stuff.

622
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,550
You just keep getting better.
I appreciate it man. You know,

623
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,660
I knowing the level of applause you
get before I go. Well, you know,

624
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,730
you don't get open or applause. Uh,
if I appreciate it man. Well Dude,

625
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:13,370
I have been fortunate enough.
Let me make you uncomfortable now.

626
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,150
I've been fortunate enough, that's the
whole idea. Why a compliment, by the way,

627
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,730
by the way,
I just got to save.

628
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,740
You guys are coming out to Dallas or
Toronto bar is full of San Antonio level.

629
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,920
They last night I literally was like,
how are these people not tired?

630
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,120
Judge the fucking act out the new bit
with the, I don't know. I get into it.

631
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:35,590
Let people come and see. But
yeah, it's been a lot of fun
and uh, yeah, it's, it's,

632
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,120
I've learned from the best
man. It's a, and we w what
are we doing on Saturday? Oh,

633
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:43,720
then Saturday we're going to the
UT. Oh, come on. Oh No. Yeah, yeah.

634
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,300
I'll come home and cook them horns.
Thank God the net play at Tcu to see good.

635
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,680
Come on. Frogs come out. Frogs. Yeah.
And they show up when they dress.

636
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,320
Like they were born with
silver spoons in their mouths.

637
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:56,930
So immediately they're just annoying.
I'm sure the nice piece people,

638
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,540
but they fucking were like
these blue dress like jr Ewing.

639
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:02,490
Remember that showed Dallas.
Yeah. Way Back in the day. Yeah.

640
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,720
It's like that minus the hat
and they have these dumb shoe.

641
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,260
I found the Texas longhorn fans when
we went to the red river rivalry.

642
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:12,890
I've found them fine. They were
cool when they do the horn thing.

643
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:16,980
I felt way better than Allah. Vans were
cool too. Yeah. Alabadle the fans. Clay,

644
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,560
the Texas a and m fans who,
cool.

645
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,940
You didn't like Alabama fans
because the kid was in a low for,

646
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,630
and then we got into that. I almost
got into that fight with that kid. Oh,

647
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:27,220
I can't deal with, I can't deal with that.
Uh, that fucking like that Jorge rate.

648
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,750
Look at a game.
Fuck you.

649
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,640
My Dad's the a fucking head
of the division and about
to fucking chick that jerk,

650
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:37,320
the guy off in a real quick,
I don't want,

651
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:42,000
there was a chick and she was at a fucking
football game and she will look out

652
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:45,420
for a guy. What happened was her
boyfriend went to go get beers in,

653
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:48,570
his guy was sitting there and he kind
of put his hand on her leg and she said,

654
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:51,330
I was really creeped out,
but I kinda liked it.

655
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,870
So she didn't look at them and apparently
she jerked him off until he finished.

656
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:57,570
Right when the guy came out,
she was never kind of creeped out.

657
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:59,300
She's covering her fucking ass.

658
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,480
So she sent a letter kind of
game does that other guy has,

659
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:05,640
she said a letter out and she
goes, hey, if you know who I am,

660
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,590
I was the girl sitting next
to you and this and that.

661
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,200
And I kind of liked it and I want to and
I'm reaching out and like fucking tried

662
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,350
to reach out to them. And like, right
when the guy fucking busted in his pants,

663
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:17,340
she fucking, the guy boyfriend came back
with peers. Could you fucking imagine?

664
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:21,240
Wait a minute. Yeah, dude, did he at least
have a winter coat to the people doing,

665
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,140
sitting right behind?

666
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,480
They don't notice it until I got a
bunch of fucking animals at a game.

667
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,880
She probably just had the fucking hand.
They're doing it. You know what I mean?

668
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,370
It's fucking crazy. And she fucking
like reached out to the guy.

669
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,780
He fucking imagine that. But we're,
well, we're lucky. We're lucky.

670
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,790
Here's the last thing I'll say. I
know we got to go. The one thing that,

671
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,790
and this is not against, you know, I
mean, I love my wife too, you know,

672
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,500
he is hilarious.

673
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:48,330
I sorta got any story about women
or anything within two seconds.

674
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,500
You just gonna be like, you know, he's
actually right now not to do it. Do.

675
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
That's a great sooner. I love
my wife. Okay. I love my dude.

676
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,210
Great for what you want to stay.

677
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,530
But the fucking thing that irks the shit
out of me is where the lucky he sold.

678
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,860
Oh my God, what? What are you
doing without her? He's so lucky.

679
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,280
Won't he do it out or how have I driven?
That's I said,

680
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,540
how have I driven not going
into accidents? How have
I not gotten pulled over?

681
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,490
How lucky you know what in
the back of their heads,

682
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,560
the what they're trying to do. Paul, when
are they lucky? He's a fucking great guy.

683
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,280
They can't do that. Why?
Yeah, they can't get no,

684
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,250
because we have so many options.
Paul, you understand that?

685
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,750
Do you understand that when like
you know we get later on in life,

686
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,570
you get divorced at 50 Paul. Okay.
With what you're doing and everything,

687
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:34,810
you got a shot. It's still
fucking tagging the 30th 32 Sam,

688
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,050
once they hit a certain age,
they get ready to,

689
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:40,470
are you going to bang a 50 year old woman?
No.

690
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,950
And you just went through a Rolodex of
famous women uterus sitting there. God,

691
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:47,640
I fucking do this. Yeah. This
is how we're wired. I think.

692
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,220
I know and I think I even really
even know what I just said there,

693
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:53,880
but it sounded really dumb,
I think. I just think women,

694
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,880
I just think women think men are lucky.
I just think they put themselves higher,

695
00:37:56,881 --> 00:38:00,000
dude. Sometimes I think it's really
fucking selfish. I think you know,

696
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:00,600
it'd be great.

697
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,270
When's the last time anybody's wife
listening to this podcast right now?

698
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,180
When's the last time anybody's wife
grabbed your fucking hand look in the eyes

699
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:08,940
and said, you know something? I'm so
fucking lucky to have somebody like you.

700
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,510
You know what? I'm so lucky. It
doesn't, it doesn't fucking happen. No.

701
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,830
That usually happens if once you give
them the cold shoulder cause you're onto

702
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,450
whatever game that they're fucking
planes true. Then they come back,

703
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,270
they're like cats,
same fucking thing.

704
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,500
The cat's been all country around
the house. She just be conceded that,

705
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:27,180
that thing right back and all of a sudden
they're fucking weaving in and out of

706
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:31,590
your legs. It's exact same fucking thing.
If you're nice to them, Kimmy. Yeah,

707
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,770
but yeah, they just fucking look at you
like a piece of shit and I love, I love,

708
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,940
I love when you, when people go,
what would you do without her?

709
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,580
You know what he'd be doing without,

710
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,230
you know exactly what I would
be living in some studio now.

711
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,980
He'd be living at some
studio, like a bachelor with
a fucking, oh, he'd be awful.

712
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:49,000
You know what he would be do you saved
him? What, what would you be doing?

713
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,000
What would I be doing?
I think,

714
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:56,260
I think I would be smart enough at this
age to know not to buy a leather couch

715
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,760
cause I hate in the summertime,

716
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:59,740
the sound of the back of
your legs getting off of it.

717
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,200
You've got to always make sure
the acs at a certain level,

718
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:06,130
so it still go with like
this type of material for a
fucking guy would have that.

719
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,520
I would have all the fucking
sports packages, right?

720
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,850
I build a drum room already know what
I do. I think, give me a fucking,

721
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,260
why would I do to listen to my wife?

722
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,430
My wife would indulge in drinking and
smoking and all my hobbies. That's,

723
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,030
that's what would be like my wife has been
amazing to me and she's fucking great.

724
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,260
But I, and she's helped me with a lot
of things. Um, I think I would smoke.

725
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,520
I think I'd smoke a lot more than I do
because I smoke cigars a lot and I'd

726
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:33,190
think I'd smoke more. You
had to be smoking life force
third. You're an animal.

727
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,300
Yeah, Dude. I, I think I smoked for
cigars the first two days of the tour.

728
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,470
I tried to smoke too with you and the
next flight and the next day, dude, I,

729
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:43,290
I felt like I had stood behind a bus.
Yeah.

730
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,730
I can't believe I smoked one the next
day with you just because you were doing

731
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,840
it. I was like, dude, I
didn't even enjoy it. No.

732
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,160
I think my wife has definitely
made me calm down with some things.

733
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,740
I would drink a lot more.
I'd probably be a lie.

734
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,970
I'd probably be out of shape more.
I mean, I'm not in great shape,

735
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:59,080
but I think if I was alone, you know,
it was hilarious. We went too hard. Uh,

736
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,810
like we always do the
first couple of days,

737
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,750
now we were supposed to go to a movie
on a relaxing day off and we go,

738
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,321
you know what,

739
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,940
let's go get Tex Mex for lunch and
we'll just have a 10 hour elbow seat,

740
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:12,820
black matte, and then we'll go see black
mass smash cut two hours later. You know,

741
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:15,190
I did the movie. I know, fuck the movie.

742
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,600
We're doing shots at Don Julio fucking
Tequila and were drinking all fucking

743
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:22,480
night. You sitting at a
sports bar and they had like,

744
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:24,850
they had baseball on
the Yankee game was on,

745
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:28,360
they had some soccer on the name of the
replay and then they had this just like

746
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:31,660
fails like youtube fail.
People fall into choices and shit.

747
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,930
And I was just the first part, I'm going
to leave this to go see a movie. Oh yeah,

748
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,510
we've got those tacos. I'm still going
to go see black mass without a doubt.

749
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:40,420
But I mean I'm, yeah, and I want to see,
I want to see it too. It's been good.

750
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:42,610
But we were good last night.
We were gonna let you know.

751
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,980
The funny thing about you last night where
like I don't give a fuck what anybody

752
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:47,560
says, dude, I'm going home. Listen, I
don't care. You know, if you want to go.

753
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,840
And I was like, no, I'm with
you too dude. I'm tired too.

754
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,240
And then all of a sudden in between shows,
she just got you.

755
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,460
Just give me that look and I know
you're gonna you know what that means.

756
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:57,190
And they got and he goes, Oh
boy, second wind. Oh yeah, no.

757
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,080
Once I go out and have a
good show and I feel great,

758
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,920
I want you want to go out and you have
a couple of parts. Well fortunately,

759
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,020
and unfortunately I got a lot
of friends here in Dallas,

760
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,570
so I don't know how good I'm going to
be tonight, but I will tell you this,

761
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,750
when a, once I get to this one,
when I get off the road, uh,

762
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,090
I gotta get back on it because,
cause what,

763
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:16,510
some students took me three months to get
in shape and I sorta got fucking three

764
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:17,650
weeks.
I'll give it all back.

765
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:20,890
So I got to make sure Jesus
Christ what the are in here.

766
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,450
Well thank you for having me.
Yes,

767
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:27,280
no worries Paul versus these
albums tomorrow drops tomorrow.

768
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:32,310
I had to stand now available on iTunes
and a band camp and a soon to be on

769
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,400
Amazon and Spotify and thank you to
all things records for doing the right

770
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:40,880
thing, all things comedy. But the record
label is all things record, so thank you.

771
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,720
Prerecorded life, Paul
Verses. All right, let's see.

772
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,090
Um, this is what I did this
week. People, I came home and uh,

773
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,750
I don't know what the
fuck I was supposed to do,

774
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,470
but I walked into my bathroom and I saw
that I had a leaky faucet immediately I

775
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:33,740
got excited because I was like,
oh my God. I was like, oh my God,

776
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,080
there is a problem.
All right,

777
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,990
this is a problem and I know how to fix
it. I know how to fix that motherfucker.

778
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:46,610
All I do is I unscrew that little thing
that the faucet handle pops right off

779
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,690
and then right underneath it set thing
that looks like a fucking spark plug.

780
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,740
Right? Pull that thing out, this
little Washer, you take it out,

781
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:59,570
you stick a new one in Bam. And you
reverse the process. I've done it,

782
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,890
I've done it like five times
since I've been in this apartment.

783
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:07,160
And by five I probably mean to,
but we're going to say five.

784
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,700
Okay.

785
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,120
Reality was probably too, but I feel
like I've done it like five times.

786
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,400
So I walk in there, bring in
my little toolbox, like a fair,

787
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,940
I bring in and that little red one
little fire engine, red toolbox.

788
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:23,550
And I come walking in,
you know,

789
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:26,970
looking like the puppet that I
look like and I open it up, right?

790
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:31,170
Grab my Allen wrenches, unscrew that
little fucking thing. And here I am.

791
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,030
It took the screw up. I did everything
right. I put the towel right up,

792
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:39,120
down in the sink, right over
the, uh, the drain mouth,

793
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:40,680
so I wouldn't lose it down there.

794
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,490
I put the screw white where I knew it
was going to be right in the little area

795
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:49,260
where I brushed my teeth. Everything's
going well so far. All systems go.

796
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,240
So I unscrew the fucking thing right?
Everything's good.

797
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:57,200
And I go to take the handle off.
Lo and behold, it won't come off.

798
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:02,210
Seems a little fussy. So I, I
start jiggling it a little bit.

799
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:04,820
I started tugging at it. I go,
wait a minute, Bill, wait a minute,

800
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,280
let's not break anything and turn this
easy. Repair into something bigger.

801
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,470
So what do I do? I go on to youtube
already getting embarrassed going,

802
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:17,060
I already know how to
fix this fucking thing.

803
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:20,570
I was going to show off that I know how
to do this. So my girl could be like,

804
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:24,800
oh my God, you're so, you're
funny and you're handy, right?

805
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:26,540
And it would just fill up my ego.

806
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:32,080
So I go on the fucking
youtube how to a leaky faucet.

807
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:35,110
And every motherfucker on there,
they're on scrolling a little screw.

808
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:39,970
The handled pops right off and they're
onto the job. So I'm like, son of a bitch,

809
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,510
maybe there's some sort
of a gunk in there.

810
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:47,590
So I started tugging it a little fucking
harder. And in the back of my head,

811
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:51,010
it keeps going. Don't do this,
it's going to break. Don't do this.

812
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,160
I start looking at it going,
did I,

813
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:58,270
did I take a wrench out or
was there something else I
had to fucking unscrew it.

814
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,150
I just can't figure it out.
And finally what happens?

815
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,490
I lose my temper and I go, I'm yanking
this mother fucker rough, right?

816
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,200
What happens? Snap the God damn
handle. Snap the fucking thing off.

817
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,410
Like halfway down,
part of the threads are in there.

818
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:18,370
It's this old vintage
fucking faucet handle.

819
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,840
So I had this simple God damn
job. Oh, halfway through.

820
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:26,980
I called my fucking dad to death to
figure out how to do it and I was already

821
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:29,050
pissed. Which is funny. Isn't that funny?

822
00:45:29,051 --> 00:45:32,830
When he calls somebody at midway through
a job, you know, he's just hanging out.

823
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,950
He's a psycho. Hello Mike. Yet bill,

824
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:40,330
I'm trying to fix the fucking faucet
and he's just like Jesus. Easy, easy.

825
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,240
You know, you just hit the ground
running, screaming at him. Oh I,

826
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:47,970
you know what you want to do?
Their bill is, yeah, you want to,

827
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:51,910
why you want to unscrew? And I'm
like, I fucking did that already.

828
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,860
I already did that. I tried to do it. When
he go out and jiggle it, I jiggled it,

829
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,850
you know? And I yelled at him so much, he
started getting mad and he's like, well,

830
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:05,480
fucking call a plumber. I'm like, I'm
not going to fucking call a plumber.

831
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:09,140
I'm a goddamn leaky fucking
faucet. And he was like, well,

832
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,170
I don't know what to tell you.
I said, fine, I'll call you
later. He goes, all right,

833
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,850
goodbye. You know? So that was the
upside of it. I got a little father,

834
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:21,830
son, quality time, quality time
in there. So what do I do? I say,

835
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:23,870
fuck this.
I got gotta,

836
00:46:23,871 --> 00:46:27,540
I got a God damn screwdriver and trying
to force the whole time I'm going one

837
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:32,420
step that I miss. What did I do? Did I
just push this up here? Sorry about that.

838
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:35,770
I'm like, what's step that I just
fucking miss? So as you know,

839
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:39,590
was always my temper does mean,
and what do I do?

840
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,180
I fucking Yank this thing off.

841
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:46,181
It snaps off and now I still have a
leaky faucet and I have half a God damn

842
00:46:46,491 --> 00:46:51,350
handle. So, of course, you
know, the male ego, I can't
say anything to my girl, right?

843
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,190
I just fucking walk out, head down to
feet. I look, you know what I look like.

844
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,970
I look like fucking Peyton manning in
the third quarter of a playoff game.

845
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,250
I got that Peyton face,
you know,

846
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:05,060
I ended my chin strap and I'm already
looking for somebody to throw her under

847
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:06,650
the bus to blame it on,
right.

848
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,450
I start blaming my landlord because he
likes everything all fucking old rather

849
00:47:11,451 --> 00:47:13,340
than just,
you know,

850
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,710
putting the blame on my shoulders and
being a fucking leader. So like I said,

851
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:19,730
I walk out of there.

852
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,220
That's the only thing I was missing
was a Peyton Manning Jersey.

853
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,460
As I walk out my stupid sweaty forehead
and I just walk out and I wait for Nia

854
00:47:28,941 --> 00:47:30,610
to it,
right?

855
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,570
And she comes in and she
knows I've been flipping out.

856
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:38,020
She heard me yell at my dad
about a Washer, you know,

857
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,470
stupid fuck another
three minutes of my life,

858
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:45,370
I'll never get back because
of my dumb ass temper. And uh,

859
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,270
she goes in and immediately comes out.
She's like,

860
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:54,040
what happened to the
sink was are you like,

861
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,670
are you halfway through the
job? Nope. It's done sweetie.

862
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,490
Still leaks and now there's half a handle.

863
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,340
Anything else you need
me to go take care of?

864
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,680
Here I am the man about the house. So, um,

865
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:12,460
anyways, so I've gone on, I've
gone on Ebay, I've gone everywhere.

866
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:16,510
I'm trying to find, it's not a
really unique, a faucet handle.

867
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:19,690
It's just an older one. And out of
respect for the guy who owns this place,

868
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,910
I want to get a new one.
Does anybody,

869
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,120
any podcast listener and my loss and in
the Los Angeles area know where I can

870
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:29,760
find?
Do they have all the Zeros?

871
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,330
Is there a Fred Sanford House out here
that just so I have a bunch of old faucet

872
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:36,280
handles? That's what I need to know. Uh,

873
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:41,270
I have pictures of my damaged faucet
handle up on the, uh, the MLM,

874
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,640
podcast.com,

875
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,560
the official fan page of the Monday
morning podcast. And once again,

876
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,950
it's www.themmpodcast.com.

877
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:54,750
People seem to be having problems
sometimes finding it and uh,

878
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,120
anybody out there that
knows how to fucking do it.

879
00:48:58,121 --> 00:49:00,250
If you could look at it and
tell me where I went wrong,

880
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,280
even took a picture of the goddamn
screw where I unscrewed it.

881
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,030
What else would be holding it in?
I don't understand it.

882
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,380
Obviously you don't understand it,
Bill. You fucking broke it. So, uh,

883
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,230
I'm embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed.

884
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:17,440
It's one of the first things I learned
how to do and plumbing and I was beyond

885
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:20,620
excited. I probably talked about
it three years ago on the podcast.

886
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,870
For those of you searching in the
archives, um, I don't want to have this,

887
00:49:25,871 --> 00:49:26,411
this is a lot,

888
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:31,411
but what kills me about that is
that is a microcosm of my life.

889
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,010
It's like there's an obstacle.

890
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:41,260
I learned how to defeat it and then
I walk away and I completely forget

891
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:44,800
everything that I've learned.
And then fucking six months later,

892
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,540
I'm in the same situation.

893
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,260
I lose my temper and the
thing blows up in my face.

894
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,120
And uh, you know, I'm 43 years
old. So who's kidding who,

895
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,720
when did you say I'm beyond
the halfway point in my life?

896
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,460
You've got to think that.
I mean, 86 years, you know,

897
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,470
that's long enough for
a curse. Everybody. Um,

898
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,610
I think I'm going to make it into my
nineties that I want to hear everybody

899
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,040
talking about my temper and how
it's causing high blood pressure.

900
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:19,320
Go Fuck Yourself. I go for hikes. That's
how I even the salary level it off.

901
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,063
Yeah.

902
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,900
We've got, oh, let's do it. One one up.

903
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,560
Why don't we do the rest of the
youtube videos for this week.

904
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,640
We got some great ones.
That will be@themmpodcast.com.

905
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,570
Please remember to type in the,

906
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:14,670
we'll have all these youtube videos
right there for you so you can just sit

907
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,490
there surfing the net. All
right. This is a great one.

908
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:22,491
Texas man gets a $330,000 home for $16.

909
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,940
This, this is one of the
greatest stories I've ever seen.

910
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,830
This guy found a loophole.
Basically,

911
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:38,280
the guy who owned the house
declared bankruptcy. He took off.

912
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,750
Then the bank had it and I can't remember.
I only watched the video once.

913
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:45,180
There's something about this,

914
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:50,181
this loophole in Texas where if a house
is abandoned for a certain period of

915
00:51:50,311 --> 00:51:52,860
time,
you can file this form.

916
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,400
It costs 16 bucks and
you can claim the house.

917
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,390
And this is what this guy
did, right? It gets better.

918
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:06,230
Everybody on the block is pissed because
they paid like 330 $350,000 for their

919
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:10,530
fucking houses. Houses,
sorry. At this guy comes in,

920
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:14,340
he pays $16 for a house. So it
brings the value of their house down.

921
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,990
So they want him out of there.
Not only for that reason,

922
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:22,350
but I'm also guessing cause it's a
black dude and they're all white.

923
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,790
Just I'm telling you, it's like
when I watched this, I'm like,

924
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,440
this is the greatest beginning.

925
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:32,820
It's like a pilot episode for
the greatest fucking Sitcom ever.

926
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:38,340
Like the amount of characters that you
could have. It's a fucking TV show.

927
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,610
So basically what this guy has to do,

928
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,290
he has to stay there for three years
and and that the people on the,

929
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,470
you got to watch this video that his
neighbors that trying to get them for

930
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:50,430
everything,
they're like,

931
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:55,050
well we just think he should pay for his
house like everybody else. It's like,

932
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,080
you know what? What? What
sort of a team player are you?

933
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,800
Just because what you signed yourself
into indentured servitude to these piece

934
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:07,560
of shit bankers.
One Guy,

935
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,140
one guy gets out of it.

936
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,040
It doesn't have to become a fucking
slave to these assholes and you can't be

937
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:17,850
happy for him because he found a
loophole because he did his homework.

938
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,160
If you read a body,
you could have owned two houses,

939
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,180
you could have sold your house and then
moved into the other one for 16 bucks.

940
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,090
Quit hating on the guy.

941
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,640
I think it's the greatest
thing ever considering these
backers took this bailout

942
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,890
money. They don't eat. They don't,
not only do they not know where,

943
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,920
they don't know where it is, the can't
say where it is or who even got it.

944
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,070
And the,
the breaking this guys,

945
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,930
that was like a billion trillion fucking
dollars would have this guy 330 grand.

946
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,720
You're mad at that guy.
He's a fucking genius.

947
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,640
You know what I would do
if I lived on that block?

948
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,540
I would give that guy a fucking Goddamn,

949
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,530
I don't know what I would
make them a Bundt cake.

950
00:53:56,531 --> 00:53:59,560
Whatever the fuck you supposed to do,
I'd welcome them to the neighborhood.

951
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:01,600
Okay.

952
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,670
Aye. Aye. And I'd be like,
listen to, can you do me a favor?

953
00:54:04,671 --> 00:54:08,420
Can you read some more documents?
And if you come up with some other shit,

954
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:13,430
I would love if you could find a
loophole that somehow affects my life.

955
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:17,960
Like, like there's the, the totally
overlooking this guy's talent.

956
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,550
You know,
you know what's funny about that guy,

957
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:23,870
that black dude and moved into that thing.

958
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:28,871
If he was actually on TV screaming about
how I bought a house for $60 half the

959
00:54:32,241 --> 00:54:36,530
people on the fucking street would call
the one 800 number in order his God damn

960
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:40,220
book. You know? And then if
it turns out to be a scam,

961
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:41,470
okay,

962
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:45,490
you'll never see the guy again,
right? The guy is on your block.

963
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,580
He's right there.
Go over it.

964
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,493
Learn from them.

965
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:14,390
All right, here we go.

966
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,980
Hey, Bill. I met with this
girl for a year and a half.

967
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,990
We broke up for about a month recently,

968
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,440
and this month she dated another
guy from April to May. This.

969
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,780
Okay. That's plenty of
time. Um, to do the deed.

970
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,210
Sometime around the beginning of May,
she started texting me and calling,

971
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,790
begging for me back.
She told me she didn't want,

972
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,050
she didn't do anything with this other
and she wasn't thinking when she said Yes

973
00:55:42,051 --> 00:55:43,640
to going out with them.
Also,

974
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:47,240
she told me in this month of being
together that they didn't do anything

975
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:52,100
sexually. All Jesus, he said that
himself. I like how this man thinks.

976
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:53,330
Uh,

977
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,590
we've been back together for about a month
now and we recently have signed a one

978
00:55:57,591 --> 00:56:02,040
year lease on an apartment
together. Oh Gosh. Uh,

979
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:06,860
about a week ago she told me that she
did have sex with this other guy multiple

980
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:09,410
times. Oh, Jj says this.

981
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:13,190
I'm just reading word for word what he
wrote here and she thinks she may have

982
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:15,170
gotten an STD from him,

983
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,500
so that's the only reason
why she came clean.

984
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,360
Oh Jesus did I mention that me and her
are 19 and the other guy is 32 you know,

985
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,340
dude, you're 19 I can see
how this happened to you.

986
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,650
She failed to mention this to me too and
failed to mention that she thinks she

987
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:40,540
has an STD before we had sex
multiple times. Bear back
when we got back together.

988
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,530
I don't know what to do.

989
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:46,450
I'm stuck in a one year lease with a whore
and I might have an STD. What do I do?

990
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:48,460
Sorry. This is long. This is what you do.

991
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:51,130
You stop having sex with
that woman immediately.

992
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,930
You and your relationship with her
immediately you go out and you get tested

993
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,250
immediately. I bet you don't
even have it. I bet you don't.

994
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,440
Okay. If you've got herpes,
it's going to show up. Right?

995
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,170
I'm going to shut the fuck up
because I don't really know too much.

996
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,350
If you got gonorrhea or you got syphilis,
it's you have,

997
00:57:10,351 --> 00:57:14,830
you have fucking urines going
to hurt. Something's going
to happen. All right. Um,

998
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:20,680
I think what happened was she got back
together with you and then somewhere she

999
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:24,220
lied saying that,
um,

1000
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,030
she didn't have sex with this
guy and then all of a sudden she,

1001
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:31,580
something happened. Did
you got HPV? I Dunno.

1002
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,170
What the fuck something award a soar.

1003
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,450
Something popped up and she said,
Holy Shit.

1004
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:41,800
She went to the doctor and found
out she got an STD. All right.

1005
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:44,890
So now she has to fucking tell you.

1006
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:51,150
Okay. Because, uh, Jesus Christ,
this is such a fucking mess.

1007
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,560
This is such a mess because you know
what this girl is, she's too young to be,

1008
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:01,370
to be like, uh, she's afraid to be alone.

1009
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,240
The second you break up,

1010
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:05,450
she goes out with somebody else and
not just goes out and bang somebody.

1011
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:09,080
She goes out and has like a fucking
relationship with this guy. All right?

1012
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,010
Then immediately runs back to you and
then signed a one year lease so she can

1013
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:16,400
fucking feel safe. And now she's with
you. And now she drops this bomb on you.

1014
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,840
This is what you do. I don't know
if he can get out of the lease.

1015
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:25,130
Is your landlord a guy?
If he is,

1016
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,300
have a face to face with them after
you get tested and tell him that.

1017
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,900
And maybe you'll luck out and just
say, dude, can you do me a solid?

1018
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,300
Can you do me a solid? The very
least, if you can't let me out,

1019
00:58:38,301 --> 00:58:42,050
can you let her out? I don't want to
live with this girl for the love of God.

1020
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:46,190
Maybe you can get out that
way. If not, you know,

1021
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,500
I say you walk,

1022
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,040
do get yourself tested.
You know,

1023
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,070
get yourself tested and then fucking walk.
All right?

1024
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:06,160
But this is such a fucking
harsh lesson to learn.

1025
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:10,400
You just don't have unprotected sex.
You just don't.

1026
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,190
Okay.

1027
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:15,910
You just don't and you don't sleep with.
I know you didn't know she was a whore,

1028
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:19,930
but just in general,
you just don't fucking do it.

1029
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:25,140
You just do it. Just don't
do it. All right? Just,

1030
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,550
just don't do it. All right.
That's a fucking horrific story.

1031
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:34,260
I hope it works out good for you.
Um, you saying you might have an STD,

1032
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,920
so I'm guessing you're doing the typical
guy thing where you're not going to the

1033
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:41,220
doctor immediately. Go to the doctor,
get yourself tested. All right,

1034
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,070
drop to your knees and thank
God when it comes back negative,

1035
00:59:44,071 --> 00:59:47,040
which is what I'm thinking it's going
to happen and everybody on the podcast,

1036
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,880
how about we all say a collective prayer?
All Jesus for this kid.

1037
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,510
All right, let it come back negative.
Let it come back clean dude,

1038
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:57,780
and just get on with your fucking life.
All right?

1039
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:04,300
Please tell me this. Horror
is paying rent. Jesus Christ.

1040
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:07,730
I mean Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
Then you got to [inaudible].

1041
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,570
Now you're gonna have to fucking break
up with her and then you'll live in in

1042
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:15,570
the same place. Oh my
God. What a nightmare.

1043
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:21,460
Then he got to meet other girls. Fuck
that dude. It's only a year. Your Life.

1044
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:25,240
You're only 19. Jesus Christ. A lot
more worse things can happen. All right,

1045
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:28,170
I'm sending you positive vibes.
It's coming back. Negatives,

1046
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,210
have a fucking talk with,
with the least guy.

1047
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:36,211
Tell him you're fucking shovel his
driveway every time it snows until 2018 or

1048
01:00:36,281 --> 01:00:39,820
something. Just let me Outta here. I gotta
get Outta here. I gotta get Outta here.

1049
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:45,390
All right, please. For the love
of God, let me out and uh, and,

1050
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,520
and have at it with her, but whatever
you do, wear a condom. All right.

1051
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:49,354
Good luck to you,
sir.

1052
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:05,120
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1053
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:20,530
[inaudible] [inaudible].
