1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,870
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:08,820
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, April 11th,

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,320
April 11th,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,960
2016 what's going on?
I worry. Yeah, it's a,

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:19,320
it's Sunday night to Sunday evening.

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,750
I'm in the house all by myself.
Uh,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,610
the lovely Nia had some business
meeting or some shit she had to go to.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,550
Um, it's show business. I
know what you're saying.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,920
You guys all live in the normal
world. You're thinking like, wait,

10
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:36,350
my wife says she's got a business meeting
on a Sunday night at fucking yeah.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,590
Surpass a certain hour. That means
she's out there banging somebody.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,900
I know.
That's what you think.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,720
But I'm in show business so it's totally
normal for them to go out that way.

14
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,640
What the fuck happened to
the high hat over here?

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,390
I told you I got my little fucking
practice set up there. What the fuck is

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,130
maybe Cleo was playing it
when I wasn't here anyways.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,210
Any she um, yeah, so she's out.

18
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,160
So I'm going to try to
knock this out cause uh,

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,460
I gotta be at work on Monday
for something. For some reason,

20
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,880
I still can't say whether
what it is or what's going on.

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,710
Hopefully. Uh, so yeah, you know
what it is. You know what it is.

22
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,990
Maybe you don't know what it is.
Maybe you don't listen to every week,

23
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,160
but you know what it is. So I gotta
be at work on Monday and uh, oh,

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,990
Billy fucking,
uh,

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,940
clean living ever since
I got back from Canada.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,140
Oh, Canada, you punch a freeze and cuts.

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,150
I got just got back from there. And, uh,

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,190
I kind of realized that when I
go on the road with the fellows,

29
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,270
we act like we're on some sort of
bachelor party. I don't know what it is,

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:50,130
minus the fucking who is everything
else. Uh, we basically, uh,

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,540
you know, we booze and we smoked cigars
and that thing and it's just, yeah,

32
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,050
it takes a lot out of me
and I got a bunch of shit I gotta do.

33
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,400
So I kind of need to be clearheaded
as opposed to the usual, you know,

34
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,130
usually when I got nothing going on
in my life. I mean I can fucking,

35
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,540
you are going to have a few.
Right.

36
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,460
And I can wake up the next morning
like fucking eggs or something. Right.

37
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,900
I can be in that mindset, but
uh, as of right now, I can't, so,

38
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:20,610
um, I have not done anything. Haven't
touch shit. I haven't fucking,

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,200
I haven't drank,
I haven't smoked a meeting pretty good.

40
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,650
Uh,
even laying off the internet porn,

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,520
I mean it's just fucking over actually
got this time magazine that was about

42
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:36,390
Internet porn and how it's like
fucking people up, you know,

43
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,890
especially like kids, you know,
when they first like just the shit,

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,040
the Schmooze kitten home, this shit
you can see on the fucking Internet.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,010
I can't believe nobody's stepped in. I'm
not saying somebody should step in, but,

46
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,230
um, you know, I gotta tell you if, if,

47
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,390
if they knew what the fuck the
Internet was going to be when it was,

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,790
whenever Al Gore was inventing
it back the eighties.

49
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,850
Um, I'll never said that.
I said that I was at,

50
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,680
I was involved in the email
chain, whatever the fuck
he said. That fucking guy.

51
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,500
Remember when his campaign was over,
man,

52
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,620
when he was dancing around and all
sweaty and all that shit and how he just

53
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,460
looked like he was so fucking
relieved that it was over. Um,

54
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:25,120
what a thing to go through running
for president. I just saw a clip,

55
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,570
a Hillary Clinton. I have not been paying
attention at all, but Jesus Christ,

56
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:32,830
what the fuck happened to her?
She looks like Earl fucking weaver.

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,730
She's like Earl weaver.
She was doing something right.

58
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,570
She was standing in some black
church, right? Baptist church.

59
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm going to assume you know, I don't
think it was a Jewish synagogue there.

60
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:48,400
Whatever the fuck they could temple
she's or there's green shoots.

61
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,610
You just like yelling the
shit she was going to do.

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,410
That's the only time a politician goes
near the black community is when they're

63
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,650
running. They fucking,
they swing by the church.

64
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,270
They make a whole bunch of promises and
then they get in the fucking limo and

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,470
they go, let's get the fuck
outta here. Fuck out of dodge.

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Then they go over, they do a town meeting,
talk to all the lunch pail Louise.

67
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,710
Right. Then if they, if there's even
those people left in this country,

68
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,000
if you fucking make anything,

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,420
they get over there and they
say roll up their sleeves.

70
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,030
That's when you know they're
talking to the working man.

71
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,260
They take off their sport coat and
they roll up the sleeves, you know,

72
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,840
like they going to build something
rather than just go out there and say the

73
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,070
exact same bullshit.

74
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:37,360
They just said the Baptist church with
more of a fucking lunch pail swing do it

75
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,810
right. And the whole fucking
thing. It's just gross.

76
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,540
I don't know anybody sits there
and watch that shit, but um,

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,273
okay.

78
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,910
The latest thing that I become fascinated
with is I completely leave whatever

79
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,090
the fuck I was just talking about. I'll
come back to it. The clean living thing,

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,680
who wants to listen about clean living?
It's the most boring shit ever, you know?

81
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,620
Anyways.
Um,

82
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,920
okay.

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,210
I become fascinated with
how super rich people,

84
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,000
okay.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,320
Avoid paying taxes.
Just fucking fascinating.

86
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,880
It's one of those things,
you know,

87
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,500
it's like you got to respect
it on just certain level.

88
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,090
It's just the brilliance of it.

89
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,110
And then there's a certain level of balls
that that takes because you're fucking

90
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:25,820
with your freedom anytime you fucking
with taxes, you know what I mean?

91
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,770
Fucking what the government, anytime
you get doing that, I mean, you know,

92
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:33,170
why is it that, I don't know. What
the fuck is that a federal thing?

93
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:35,650
I guess if you're not paying your
federal income tax yet, Bill,

94
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,240
that would probably be a federal crime.
I Dunno.

95
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,070
I always hear you got
to cross state borders.

96
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,790
Do you get to like not pay taxes and
then leave your state before it becomes

97
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,830
federal? I don't know. I don't
know these things. But anyways, um,

98
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,180
just the balls in it takes and the,
uh,

99
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,740
I dunno, I don't like people physically,
other people, that type of crime.

100
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,980
But when there's something
like robbing banks

101
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,530
or tax evasion or even a good
old fashioned fucking scam,

102
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,320
if there's like a,

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,510
like an amazing level of thought behind
it on some level, you got to respect it.

104
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,790
I think,
you know what I mean?

105
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,970
Like I remember a long time
ago there was some fucking guy,

106
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,380
he figured out how to rob parking meters.

107
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,700
Yeah, they were allegedly,
it was impossible to do.

108
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:36,810
So this guy figured out how to
fucking do it. It's amazing.

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,810
And he did this shit.
This is back in like the 80s or some shit.

110
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:42,150
This guy figured out how to
do it. So it was way, way,

111
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,560
way easier to not have everybody
breathing down your fucking throat.

112
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:47,521
You know,

113
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:51,150
people will be having eggs watching
you fucking robbing a parking meter.

114
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,300
They didn't have a fucking
smart phone on them.

115
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,310
They just be sitting there going,
it's fucking got guy.

116
00:06:57,311 --> 00:07:00,420
Just is that Guy Robin and parking meter.

117
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,230
Oh his shit. The fuck. See that?

118
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,180
Everybody see that?
That was it.

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,300
That's all in fucking happened
rather than some dope shit.

120
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:15,930
And they're filming you and you were
arrested before you even get home.

121
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,280
All right.
And then the fucking local newscasters,

122
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,670
they always got to do some sort of
fucking bad pun. You know what I mean?

123
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,120
I'll tell you, this guy's life is
freedom is now going to change. You know,

124
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:33,150
they do that. Some are, they get away
with that and I'm like fucking newspapers.

125
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,310
Like they can have the
biggest fucking puns ever.

126
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:39,910
And everybody thinks it's great.
You know? I don't know. I,

127
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,350
I can't even think of one right now.
Yeah. But uh, whatever, you know,

128
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,560
you sit at home and you think about it,

129
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,850
you said you're a fucking cubicle
instead of doing your goddamn work,

130
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,730
you think of one. So anyways, this fucking
guy figured out how to do this shit. Um,

131
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,610
and of course the parking meter
gods were beside themselves.

132
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,100
You know what I mean?
It was like one of those Scifi movies.

133
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,600
We're like the titanic movie land.
Not even God can sick it.

134
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,350
That's so they will like,

135
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,150
not even God could get the
fucking quarters out of
this meter. This may, right.

136
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:09,480
That's,

137
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,140
they were talking all kinds of shit to
this fucking guy figured out how to do it

138
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,900
and you'd think you'd like a high
whatever, man. You too. Well,

139
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:17,280
what the fuck are you
going to do with that?

140
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:20,970
We'll do this fucking meters
all over the city. So this guy,

141
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:24,570
anytime you wanted a drink, if you
wanted a fucking sandwich, he, his guy,

142
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,980
he had it perfect.

143
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,050
It was like his own ATM machine before
ATM machines, he just walk up, bank bank,

144
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:35,670
boom. He had a sack of fucking quarters.
You go down to the bank, you go here,

145
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:39,850
can I get one? Some of the rolly
fucking things there, right? Yeah, sure.

146
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:44,410
They don't give a shit. Nobody gave a fuck
back then. Nobody was paying attention.

147
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,930
They were trying to pay attention
but not not to that type of shit.

148
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,060
So this guy would roll the fucking
quarters, you know, roles enough quarters.

149
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:52,900
Next thing you know,

150
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,610
he gets himself out of how the fuck you
get all those quarters down to a car

151
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:58,350
dealership.
I have no fucking idea.

152
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,020
Although I talked to some drug
dealers about how they fucking, um,

153
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,260
or a guy of new drug dealers.
Let's be honest at bill,

154
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,320
let's not act like that news guy saying
that you were in the war and then you

155
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,071
were in a chopper,

156
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:11,850
Assam Shit next to the chopper and you
didn't really fucking see it. Okay.

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,290
You took a fucking helicopter tour
one time. You weren't even in Iraq.

158
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,200
Whatever the fuck he said, I don't
pay attention to shit. So anyways,

159
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:23,250
I was talking to this guy and basically
how back in the day when drug dealers

160
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,990
was still driving around and flashy cars,
cause when I heard nowadays they,

161
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,430
they don't even want to track
that level of attention. Um,

162
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,250
how it used to be was anything,

163
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,890
any cash deal that was over 10 grand
grant had to be fucking reported.

164
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,440
So what these drug dealers would do was
they would go out and they buy a car

165
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,940
worth nine grand for cash and then they
drive it around for like a fucking week.

166
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,550
And then they traded in
for a car was 16 grant,

167
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,270
maybe get seven for theirs and then
they throw another fucking night at the

168
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,870
other car. Now they got a $16,000
car. I drive around for a little bit.

169
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,540
You fucking trade it in or $23,000 car.

170
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,230
They give you a fifth whatever and so on
and so forth til you trade your way all

171
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:11,490
the way up to whatever fucking
car you want it. Um, it just,

172
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,490
I just look at that shit. It's like, I
mean, that's not the, the deepest thing,

173
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:18,940
but that's the way my brain would work.
I'd be like, well, it goes so good.

174
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:22,500
I drive a piece of shit.
Then what's the point of dealing drugs?

175
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,190
Right? Or I just say, fuck it.

176
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm buying a Ferrari and I'm want to
drive it until they catch me fucking three

177
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,410
weeks later. Um, by the way,

178
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:37,320
the Ferrari I like is the Ferrari
California. That's the old man.

179
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,110
Once the fucking gt, the grand
touring one, right. I don't know.

180
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:41,880
You ride around in some Batmobile,

181
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,130
just gimme one that's shaped like a
fucking Jaguar from back in the day,

182
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,740
you know,
or maybe a Toyota supra,

183
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,500
those fucking things from the 80s. I
remember this sky loaned me his, well,

184
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,770
he used my truck to move and I,
Brandon,

185
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,660
I'd beat the shit out of his car and
he'd beat the fuck out of my truck and we

186
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,200
both got a cars back and he's smelling
rubber and I'm seeing all kinds of

187
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,770
scratches all over my truck. And we just,
Eh, it's kind of a fair deal, right?

188
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,310
And then we both got arrested for
drinking and drive it months later.

189
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,970
But that's a completely different
story. I know. I'm all over the map.

190
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:17,460
I'm doing this late night and I
don't want to be doing it right now,

191
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:21,840
but I got shit to do in the morning.
So anyways, it's fucking guy.

192
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,910
You know,
if he had half a fucking brain,

193
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:31,770
what you do is you keep your day job,
right? Keep your fucking day job,

194
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,540
and then, you know, for
anything miscellaneous,

195
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,240
she gets to go to the parking meters,
right?

196
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,390
And what you do is you start
storing up on the quarters.

197
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,940
Then every once in a while,
right? You just start,

198
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:45,120
you start washing the money
with you fucking cat. I know
what you do. You fucking,

199
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,030
you go into stores and stuff,
who gives a fuck? Right?

200
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,470
You just use it to get yourself a
better TV. But what is this dope do?

201
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,460
He gets fucking greedy.
I didn't even buy a fucking story goes.

202
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:00,310
All I know is he just started hitting
every fucking God damn parking meter

203
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:00,910
around.

204
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,060
And next thing you know he's sitting on
like a fucking $2 million in quarters

205
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,410
and he ended up getting busted. But
there was a part of it. I liked the guy,

206
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,530
you know.
So anyways,

207
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:16,150
this gets me to the super rich on how
you know all that shit about the Panama

208
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,620
papers and all that type of stuff.

209
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,620
I was talking to another friend of mine
who's a fucking lawyer and I was like,

210
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,150
how does that work? Like how do you
get your money out of the country?

211
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,410
And then once it's out of the country,
how do you make sure nobody steals it?

212
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,890
Like what happened to Johnny
Depp's character and blow?

213
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,230
And then once you have
it out of the country,

214
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,320
how do you get it back in without
just getting taxed all over again?

215
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:44,230
A busted and he said,
basically this is it.

216
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,580
And he broke the whole fucking thing
down. All right. Or as far as I know,

217
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,850
he broken aspect of it down. I know all
you guys are sitting in right now going,

218
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,830
Oh gee,
she's going to try to explain to him,

219
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm going to try to explain some shit
that was just explained to me and I don't

220
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,240
really know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

221
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,170
So let's get rid of one myth right out
of the gate. I remember a long time ago,

222
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:05,680
a friend of mine had a fucking landscaping
business and he already had a truck

223
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,980
and he went out and he bought
this giant fucking, you know,

224
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:11,800
one of those things with the dual wheels
on the back and this fucking giant

225
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:16,390
Bedley you put cattle in it, right?
And I was like, holy fuck man,

226
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:17,690
how much is that thing costs?
And you know,

227
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,510
it was like the 80s it cost like 25 grand,

228
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:23,620
which was a lot of fucking money back
then. Right? Um, for a truck, you know,

229
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,340
it's like 10 grand more than you pay
the 25 30 grand or some shit. Right?

230
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,580
I was like, Holy Shit Man, you can
afford that. And he was like, yeah,

231
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:34,700
it's a write off. That's what a
lot of dope safe. And they, they,

232
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,700
it is a write off,
but what they think is,

233
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:40,120
is that they can write
$30,000 off of their taxes,

234
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,560
which you can't.
What you can do is you can write off,

235
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,580
it's a write off as far as that 30 grand
that you just spent in that truck is

236
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:53,260
untakeable all right,

237
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,650
it's sitting in whatever you made
that money you made 30 grand.

238
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,980
If it's just sitting there and you
don't put it back into play as far as

239
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,510
reinvesting into your business,

240
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,250
the government will tax you at the end
of the year. You know, on that 30 grand.

241
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,340
And let's say you're in
like a fucking a whatever,

242
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,300
20% tax bracket that you'd,

243
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:16,120
you'd have to give the government
fucking six grant. Right?

244
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,800
That's it. So the people
more on steak, oh,

245
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:23,200
I get to write 33 in the end of the year.

246
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:26,440
If I owed 40 grand in taxes
and I bought a $30,000 truck,

247
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:30,070
I get to take $30,000 off on my taxes.
You wouldn't,

248
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:34,330
you just be able to knock off six grand,
right? You're not even knocking it off.

249
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,060
You just not getting taxed on that.
Does that make sense?

250
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,630
Probably doesn't cause I explained it.
So anyways,

251
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,070
when you have your own business,

252
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,100
what you're trying to do is you're
trying to come up with as many fucking

253
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:52,390
writeoffs as you possibly can't.
Many expenses,

254
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,140
everything you possibly can to
lower your, your basic, your,

255
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,270
uh, whatever your income as far
as what is going to be taxable.

256
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:04,580
So say you made fucking a hundred grand.
All right?

257
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,520
Your gross to a hundred grand.

258
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,760
The net is what you're left
with after your expenses,

259
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:14,761
you try to fucking come up with as many
God expenses as you can to get that

260
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:20,080
hundred grand is far
down as zero as possible.

261
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,800
Ideally you wouldn't want to pay any
fucking taxes as far as these people look.

262
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:28,030
But the bottom line is you can only do
it so much and if you write off too much,

263
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,350
the IRS is going to show up and be
like, what's this fucking, you know,

264
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,340
60 grand for fucking cheeseburgers,
blah, blah, blah. You tried to write off,

265
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,460
you need going to get busted.
All right?

266
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,580
So what these fucking
super rich people do is,

267
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,310
the first thing they do is they get the
fucking money out of the, out of the,

268
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,630
out of the country

269
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,310
because the IRS has jurisdiction
doesn't go beyond the borders.

270
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:54,970
So what they do is they just create a
company that doesn't exist. It just,

271
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:59,140
it's just on paper, right?
So say you make $100 million,

272
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,310
right?

273
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,750
What you do is you go to a country that
doesn't give a shit about America and

274
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,900
let you use it as a tax shelter. You just
come up with some incorporated thing,

275
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,140
like who gives a fuck ink,
right?

276
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,740
And then you just have that company bill,
your company,

277
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,400
a consulting fee for
$100 million or whatever,

278
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:21,580
the whatever of the hundred billion,
30 40 50 whatever.

279
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,250
You don't want to pay taxes
on whatever you, whatever.

280
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,200
And then you write a check to
that company that doesn't exist.

281
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:32,140
That's really you.
And then you send it out.

282
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,970
So now it's out of the fucking country.

283
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,390
Okay.

284
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,970
And then what they do is
they open up like 10 other,

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,060
these fucking shell companies and they
have those other companies build the

286
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:44,000
first company. And then the
third one bills, the second
one, the fourth 1 billion.

287
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,760
It's just got the monies fucking gone.

288
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,760
Now the IRS could come in and you'll be
like, what the fuck did you pay somebody?

289
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:54,080
$100 million consulting fee.
And then you're telling me,

290
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,300
okay,

291
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,230
you paid somebody
$100 million as a consulting fee.

292
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,170
And then you just look at him and go,
yes.

293
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,230
And evidently there's nothing they can
fucking do about it. So then I was out.

294
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,790
I go, all right, so now it's out
of the country and then this,

295
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,630
it's in this other country. How the fuck
do you protect it? And they, and he goes,

296
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:22,631
well you those countries where these
tax shelters are there in on the scab.

297
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,990
So you just kicked them
10% of the hundred million,

298
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:30,350
you give him 10 his fucking whatever you
can negotiate. We'll just make it easy.

299
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:33,170
Here's 10 million bucks.
So what I, you know,

300
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,850
I'll give you 10 million rather than the,

301
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:38,540
given the government fucking 50
55 60 million at a 100 million,

302
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,990
I'm still fucking up 45 million.
All right.

303
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,700
So then I was like, all right, so
now how do you get the money back?

304
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,760
Because if you know you bring
the money back is to the bank,

305
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:52,520
they're going to consider
that earned income. Like
where the fuck did you get it?

306
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,740
And this guy was like,
they,

307
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,980
they bring it back into the
country in the form of a loan.

308
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,580
Okay.

309
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,050
Loans aren't taxable, right? Like,

310
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,570
if you get a fucking loan
cause you already paying
interest on it and everything,

311
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:06,180
they don't tax you. So they just
bring it back in the form of a loan,

312
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:09,450
whatever the fuck you want to do.
I want to buy a $10 million house.

313
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,990
You have this Shell company that's 10
times removed from the one that you paid

314
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,760
for the consulting fee.
Right.

315
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,760
And they can't follow the
paper trail because it's in
a different country. Right.

316
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,760
You just bring it back into the
country in the form of a loan.

317
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,573
MMM.

318
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,580
And then you go buy a fucking
house. And I guess, I don't know,

319
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:30,120
you pretend to make payments on the
loan is forgiven by this shell company.

320
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,250
That's still you.
I know.

321
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:36,840
I just glossed over that and if
anybody has more information on it,

322
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:40,350
I find it absolutely fascinating.
There's all, there's other ones,

323
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:44,280
they just pretend that that's
their main business, um,

324
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,830
that shell companies.
So they just act like it's doing the,

325
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,740
I don't know that that's,

326
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:52,920
that's as far as I can remember that
what he told me and I found that shit

327
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,720
absolutely fucking fascinating
because at the end of the fucking day,

328
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,340
as far as what they're doing,

329
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,740
I know they're fucking over
you and me because you know,

330
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,770
the school systems go down the shitter
because they don't have enough money.

331
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,780
There's a lot of potholes
is all kinds of stuff.

332
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,400
You can't take care of
your homeless people.

333
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,140
You can't build another gleaming
structure for a fucking sports team.

334
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:14,980
Whatever the fuck it is.

335
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,793
Uh,

336
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,530
the end of the day is fucked up is that,
is these people who are criminals,

337
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,340
they're stealing from other
criminals. As far as my, uh,

338
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,300
conspiracy theory goes to the IRS. It's
just a bunch of fucking crux. Anyway,

339
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:32,134
so I made they,

340
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,090
it's kind of fascinating watching these
two giant powerful entities fuck with

341
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,800
each other, you know, meanwhile,

342
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,233
yeah.

343
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,520
When the cross hairs, you're
in the crosshairs and we're
all paying Elvis taxes

344
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,560
and that goes Hillary Clinton's
screaming and some Baptist church.

345
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:56,090
Is she talking about that shit?
Because she is it,

346
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,290
because when you bring
the fucking money back in,

347
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,480
you just don't bring it
in and go out by yourself.

348
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:04,800
You fucking Ferrari California. What
you do is, I mean, you do do that,

349
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:05,430
but what else should,

350
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,880
what you also do is you walk around with
nice water cash and you go, oh, hey,

351
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,550
chief of police. Oh, look
at that Birdie over there.

352
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,810
And as he looks over your stuff, a fucking
wad of cash in his pocket, you know,

353
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,140
and then I'll, oh, is it
an election year? Yeah.

354
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:22,170
Let me get a take 2 million on Trump.

355
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,090
Give me 2.5 on Hillary and a fuck it.
Give me 500 grand.

356
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:31,390
A Bernie Sanders. What do you mean he's
not taking any money from guys? Like make,

357
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,100
oh, is that right? Oh, well, you
know, whatever. He won't get it.

358
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,710
And if he does, uh, you know, I'll give
3 million to, well, you know, silence.

359
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,220
That's what the fuck they do. And that's,
and that's how they, they, you know,

360
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,980
I don't know.
I'm convinced of that.

361
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,390
I'm convinced as far as
like standup comedy goes,

362
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:54,391
you know why they're always giving a
shit is because a standup comedians just

363
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,950
organized.
Okay.

364
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,230
And we donated to the campaigns
of people running for two,

365
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,380
the democratic and the Republican parties.
Right.

366
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,950
And then we bought a little ad time on
CNN and on Fox News and all these major

367
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,490
networks.
If we did that,

368
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:17,020
you'd never see another comedian getting
in trouble for doing a fucking Caitlyn

369
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,430
Jenner joke
anyways.

370
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,260
If anybody has any more information
on that or they can talk about, I,

371
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,050
I don't like if it's really
dry, I just like, um,

372
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,280
I'm fascinated with people that do shit
like that. And then they go to bed,

373
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:34,760
no one what the fuck they're doing.
And they got to be thinking at some point,

374
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,010
like the wolves gotta be coming to the
door at some point. Hang on one second.

375
00:21:40,011 --> 00:21:43,950
I got to answer this. All
right. So I'm back. Of course.

376
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:47,850
I completely forget what the
fuck out where I ended off. Um,

377
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,700
but what I really learned when I was,
you know,

378
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:54,330
listening to this lawyer telling
me all this shit, um, oh,

379
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:57,070
I know I seen the balls at that takes
to go to bed at night knowing one at any

380
00:21:57,071 --> 00:22:00,210
point. Like, all of a sudden the fucking
feds are gonna kick in your fucking door.

381
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,700
But I think that these guys
are like the smarter ones.

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,600
And when you watch like American greed,
what I noticed when I watched them,

383
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,040
all of their fuckery was within
the borders of the United States,

384
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,970
which you just, I mean, if you, I
guess if you're too dumb to know,

385
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:18,840
you don't realize you're not going to get
away with it forever. But like, once I,

386
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:21,030
um,
after talking to this guy,

387
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,290
it just seems like anybody who just
tries to have their entire illegal entity

388
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:32,730
within the borders of one country
is, uh, you're just on borrowed time.

389
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,450
So I think when you watch American greed,
what you're really seeing is,

390
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,560
is the hacks of, uh, you know,

391
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:42,870
you always see these fucking idiots.
They buy a house,

392
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,930
they get all these fucking cars and
they have some strippers come over.

393
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,140
Oh my fucking laptop.
Oh,

394
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:53,370
that was a laptop hitting hardboard
floors. Come on. Come on baby.

395
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,650
Come on. Come around. You're all right.
Hang in there and help us on the way.

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,640
Fuck yeah.

397
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,540
Ah, you fucking motherfucker. Steve
Jobs is laughing somewhere right now.

398
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,230
He's laughing at me cause I got to give
him money and he also know this can be

399
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:14,090
another little kids. Get to
put it together. All right.
It's saved. It's saved. Um,

400
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,510
okay.

401
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,590
So anyways,
uh,

402
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,850
let's read a little bit of fucking Ad
Shit here before my screen goes dark.

403
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,200
Hang on a second. I find
that shit. I find it, um,

404
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,270
I find all that stuff fucking amazing.
It's really, really interesting.

405
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:33,080
If you just remove yourself from it,
the humanity of it or whatever, uh,

406
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,570
and all the people that it's affecting
and kids not getting better school books

407
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:40,090
and shit. If you just look at
the fucking game that's going on,

408
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:43,270
it's really fucking
interesting. All right. Oh Shit.

409
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,140
We got somebody new here. We got somebody
new. This is Joe Rogan's company,

410
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:51,230

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,240
Joe Rogan experience podcast.

412
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,080
He might recognize him from a g,
I don't know,

413
00:23:57,081 --> 00:24:01,670
the first 200 UFC paper views.
Um,

414
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,790
one of the best standup comics
I've ever seen. All right.

415
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,840
Here's this company on it.

416
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,730
On it is a health and wellness company
focused on inspiring peak performance

417
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,620
through unique products and actionable
information. I can already tell you,

418
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,850
this is written to smartly,

419
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:20,870
so I'm going to fuck this up with strategy
from leading professional athletes

420
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:22,080
and medical practitioners.

421

Practitioners on it has focused on
creating earth grown nutrient based

422
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:32,330
supplements and foods as well as
unconventional fitness equipment.

423
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,070
All based on the latest science
research on conventional fitness.

424
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:40,730

Um, oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.

483
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:27,030
I got to bring it up. My
Boston Bruins, unfortunately.

484
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:33,240
Um, after a big, big win
over the Detroit Red Wings,

485
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,940
uh, got beat down by
Ottawa, six to one and a,

486
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,150
we're out of it. You know, it's funny,

487
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,790
we'd beat Detroit the game before
and then because we lost Detroit,

488
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,820
get in and do you know,

489
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:48,990
there was actually a certain amount
of fucking red wing fence that we're

490
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:52,860
actually talking shit, the smart ones
were going, hey, thanks for losing.

491
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:57,110
And then the other ones look
good fucking 26 years in a row.

492
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,780
We've been in the playoffs.
Yeah, it's impressive.

493
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,200
But this year you backed in like
a bitch. You went in. As far as,

494
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,060
I don't know what you fuck.
I mean,

495
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,620
because it team that you couldn't even
beat when it counts two days before,

496
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,880
you know who fucking manhandled you.
I don't know what you're excited about.

497
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,560
You know, you like the fat chick who
got, you know, fucking ass to the Prob,

498
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,400
you know, you're all exceeded.
She just wanted to be there.

499
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,030
Who's getting know you're there for the
fucking buffet and then you go and home

500
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,210
crying.
That's what I'm predicting for Detroit.

501
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:34,530
Your makeup's going to be running
by game three of the first series.

502
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,420
I'm fucking with you.

503
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,370
I have no hate for anybody that's
in the playoffs this year. Uh,

504
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,500
I think I'm going to one. And
I've always liked Detroit. Um,

505
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,170
cause when I was growing up
they never won shit. Yeah.

506
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,850
Big thing is they had one it since
1955 with Gordie Howe and um,

507
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,030
they weren't in the middle
of a 40 year drought. Um,

508
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,530
before they got a team
around Eisenman and Nah, man,

509
00:29:57,531 --> 00:29:59,180
that was what great times watching hockey,

510
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,490
that fucking avalanche Redwings
fucking rivalry. That was the best.

511
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,080
It was the first time when I lived in
La and the games came home at five and I

512
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,510
totally got back into hockey and
you get all this original six oh,

513
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,030
is to burst up. Sorry.
Buchard Yada here. So, um,

514
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,340
so this year I think in the
east, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

515
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:27,500
I'm gonna root for two fucking teams this
year in the east and the West. Uh, the,

516
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:31,900
I'm rooting for the capitals to push
through to get to the finals and a,

517
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,540
as much as I liked the kings and the
black hawks, just to switch it up,

518
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:39,980
I'd love to see the Dallas stars or a,
the St Louis Blues,

519
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,110
you know, somebody different, you know,

520
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,340
Saint Louis Blues who's kidnapped fans
have been waiting for fucking ever.

521
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,570
They have been in the league.

522
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:51,620
They're part of the expansion
six that came in 1967.

523
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,120
All right.
The NHL was a 16 league.

524
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,070
Um, before that, right
after the depression,

525
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:03,200
there was a lot of people that I didn't
realize this either. There was a,

526
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:04,880
there was a bunch of other teams,
not a bunch,

527
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:08,690
but there was like fleece
for other fucking teams are
something that all folded

528
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:09,441
after the, the, uh,

529
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:13,340
the depression and the six that survived
and became known as the original six.

530
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,710
Um, so in 1967 sixteenths
came in. Can you name

531
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,510
off the top of my head? Let's
see. There was the flyers.

532
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,280
The penguins.

533
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,840
Okay.

534
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,440
The North Stars. Oh, Jesus.

535
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,980
The California golden seals.

536
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,920
Ah Man. I used to know this
off the top of my head. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

537
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:45,390
wait, wait. Capital's didn't come
in until the early seventies. Fuck.

538
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:50,280
Make St Louis Blues. Jesus Christ. It
just brought them up. One more. One more.

539
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,260
Was it a Seattle team?
Cleveland Barons.

540
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:57,990
It's with the fucking golden seals became,
didn't they?

541
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,810
All the fucking La kinks.
Yeah, the La Kings way.

542
00:32:03,811 --> 00:32:07,320
The fuck out there. And that was
funny when for the Golden Seals,

543
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:12,330
like folded or to Cleveland,
they went to Cleveland.

544
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,870
Just like the dreams of all the
sports fans there. They did.

545
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:20,850
They just fucking died. A slow,
miserable death. And I'm like,

546
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:24,570
that franchise just died out.
Nobody bought it and went nowhere.

547
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:29,460
It just went to Cleveland and fucking
died. So for the longest time,

548
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,780
the only game in town I'll fucking west
was the king's every fucking road trip

549
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:40,650
they had was like at least a three, four
hour fucking Denver didn't have a team.

550
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,860
Vancouver didn't have a team.
Edmonton, Calgary, they had nothing.

551
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,970
They were just out there by themselves,
you know,

552
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,890
basically fucking whatever
actresses couldn't bang.

553
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:57,500
A Los Angeles dodger are an la ramp.
That's basically, they got sloppy thirds.

554
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,350
That's what was going on. So
anyways, yeah, we lost. So, uh,

555
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:06,450
graduations to the flyers and the fucking
red wings. There was two spots left,

556
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,210
t three teams vying for it.
And uh,

557
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:13,380
we didn't get in and like clockwork,
the day after,

558
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:14,310
we don't get in.

559
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,800
What Boston sports writer who doesn't
watch hockey do you think piled on

560
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:24,690
immediately? And I as always calls
for the wrong head to be chopped off.

561
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,490
Good old Dan Shaughnessy the
noodle headed [inaudible] himself.

562
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,200
Who doesn't watch hockey,
doesn't like hockey chimes in,

563
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,770
something's gotta be done.
It's time

564
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,130
based on what Dan, all the hockey.
You never fucking watch. Hello Julian.

565
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:48,900
This was actually one of his
finest coaching performances
of the year of, I mean,

566
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,320
of his career.
They traded the entire fucking team away.

567
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Basically they treat it was what they
got rid of over the last few years.

568
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:03,180
Tyler's Sagan,
um,

569
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,340
Johnny Boyd Shuck Doggie fucking fresh.

570
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:11,300
They're fucking Milan. Lou
Cheecha was just, I was like,

571
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,650
we got nothing. We got nothing
left. I now know looking Marshawn,

572
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,260
we got Bergie was still had
shower shower's older now,

573
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,290
but basically coos can do
anybody fucking watches hockey.

574
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,030
Looked at the Bruins who was like,
you know what,

575
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:28,390
this is a rebuilding year and
all the way up to like mid March.

576
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,500
Clo Julian had this, this rebuilding
year team was the third seat.

577
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,040
Everybody was bunched together.
We hit a bad patch, you know,

578
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,220
went out West tough fucking run. We
lost some games and next thing you know,

579
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:43,700
we were fighting for the playoff lives
as they say. And we didn't win. I mean,

580
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,780
I mean, I don't know if
you get, I would get,

581
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,000
if anybody's heads going
to get chopped off,

582
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,940
you chop the head off whoever
made all those fucking trades.

583
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,500
But you know the bottom line is the guy
who made the first half of those already

584
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:00,290
got his head chopped off and then you got,
was it Michael O'connell?

585
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,230
You've got to give this guy a chance,
right?

586
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,340
You can't just go one and
done a fucked up with deputy.

587
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,220
They just cave Clo Julian of fucking
watch. We're having the most Vic,

588
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,740
the most wins ever have any Bruins coach.

589
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,660
He got us our first fucking
Stanley Cup in like, what was it?

590
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:22,010
Almost 40 years and then what? A
couple of years later, he doesn't,

591
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:23,470
not a coach hockey anymore.

592
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,780
Okay.

593
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,220
Why is it time Dan Shaughnessy
why is it time?

594
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,160
Cause it's too early
in the baseball season.

595
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:36,430
He got nothing to write about his guys
forever calling for somebodies head.

596
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,680
You know what Dan, you don't want
to take, it's time for you to do.

597
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:42,370
It's time for you to stop writing about
hockey or maybe watching maybe fucking

598
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:46,780
five games at a goddamn season.
Unfuckable fuck that guy.

599
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:49,750
I swear to God at the end of the day,
I think he's from New York City.

600
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,260
The way he just tries to pull apart
fucking teams. It's unbelievable.

601
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,143
You know what I mean?

602
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,680
He's like somebody with some
mob guys Goumarre that they
ended up having a whack,

603
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:03,250
cause she can't keep her
fucking mouth shut. Oh Jesus.

604
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:07,420
Pillco wheezy on the guy's just
trying to sell. So fuckin pay bus. Um,

605
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,820
I don't really hate Dan Shaughnessy.
I don't know the guy,

606
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:11,440
but I can tell you right now,
uh,

607
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,500
he's one of the few people that
looks less athletic than me

608
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,570
anyways.

609
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,230
Any who as I as I was
talking about earlier, um,

610
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,630
I've been doing the whole fucking clean
living thing since I got back from a yet

611
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:35,370
another lost bachelor party.
Weekend Slash standup dates run with,

612
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,780
uh, with my buddies. Yeah.

613
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,503
MMM.

614
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,580
First he and Bart. Nick and a,
so this whole week, no booze,

615
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,400
no porn, no cigars, nothing. I got the
cigar. I think I got that thing on,

616
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,890
on fucking lockdown.

617
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,833
MMM.

618
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,560
I don't have them in my house.
I think about do,

619
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:59,930
I don't think about doing it as much and
I only had one cigar in March and I'm

620
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:03,870
gonna try to just have one
this month, although, um,

621
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,583
okay.

622
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,271
Yeah.
Look,

623
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm thinking about only having one and
then I'm also thinking about having a

624
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:10,410
fucking cigar night over here.

625
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:14,820
I might do that because
I have like fucking,

626
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:15,870
okay.

627
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:20,220
I Dunno about 10 cigar friends.
Unless you smoke cigars,

628
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,560
you don't know what that means.
But it's just people that call a,

629
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm going to smoke. You
want to come by, right.

630
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,780
So all of a sudden I have 10 opportunities
a month. People call me a, come on man,

631
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:31,830
come by and smoke and smoke. And next
thing you know you smoked in like seven,

632
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:32,760
eight, nine, 10 of them.

633
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,800
So I'm going to invite all of them over
to my house the same fucking night and

634
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:41,610
I'll smoke one cigar with all 10 of them
rather than smoking one each with 10

635
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,570
individuals. How does that math work?
Right? Then I'll create a shell company.

636
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,033
Um,

637
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,630
okay.

638
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,500
So anyways,

639
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,980
so I bought this time magazine on watch
an Internet porn and how it's fucking up

640
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:53,990
kids like the,
you know,

641
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,880
the amount of shit that they see before
they even get their first fucking hand

642
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:59,280
job. It turns them into light,
these fucking sociopath.

643
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,590
And I got to admit reading
some of the articles,

644
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:03,930
like I could relate to a lot
of the shit that was going on.

645
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:08,730
So I'm really just going to fucking
going to try to stop that cold Turkey.

646
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,420
You know,
I got to stop looking at that shit.

647
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,340
Fuck, I'm sorry. See this clean lists.

648
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,470
What clean live does
free at 10 30 at night.

649
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,440
I'm fucking Yani all ready
to go to bed right now.

650
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:26,580
Get my fucking jam jams and here and here.
I am supposed to be there for you.

651
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,520
You guys are sitting there at work.
The last fucking thing you need.

652
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:30,870
You probably already had a doughnut.

653
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,900
You're going to sick a sugar crash
here in a minute. And here I am,

654
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:37,550

00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,123
so

656
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,450
what else can I talk about
here? Oh yeah, clean living.

657
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:46,750
If you try and have some clean living,
do not watch the Lemmy documentary,

658
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:49,860
which I just watched for the second time.
Um,

659
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,960
makes you want to have a couple
of drinks cause you like,

660
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:57,040
look how long that guy fucking lift
all this shit that he did. You know.

661
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,650
Fuck you're good. All
right, 39 minutes in.

662
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:07,280
I could do the last 21 minutes here
without yachting. Here we go. Here we go.

663
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,180
All right. Um, by the way,

664
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:14,060
I don't for a people
out there, uh, you know,

665
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,370
I mentioned some of the
helicopter shit. I did. I did.

666
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:17,670
I tell you I finally did that,

667
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,490
that Solo flight that I wanted
to do from long beach and I,

668
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:26,780
I went through the Bravo airspace with
the plane's taking off over you. You know,

669
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,050
at lax, came right around,
looked at the house,

670
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,870
flew over the fucking house that they,
uh,

671
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:38,710
the horses head from Godfather right down
sunset over to El Monte and then back

672
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:41,030
to, um, oh,

673
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,030
I did tell you that because that's when
I saw the old guy fall off the fucking

674
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:48,560
scooter. I'm sorry. I thought, I
didn't think that I told you that one.

675
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,420
I was just thinking about
that shit the other day.

676
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,820
Of course my fucking headphones go
out and what they would have fucking,

677
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:57,230
I knew it. I fucking knew it. I
knew that was gonna happen. Um,

678
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,521
so anyways,

679
00:39:59,521 --> 00:40:04,470
I was at the comedy store on Saturday
night and I was trying out this, uh,

680
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,230
this new chunk that I've been fucking
with for the last couple of months.

681
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:12,210
And I finally got it down. I said
it, it's perfect as I could say it.

682
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:16,320
Of course I didn't, I didn't fucking know
I didn't tape. Of course I didn't tape.

683
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,540
Why would I take that would've
been the smart thing to do,

684
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:23,370
but whatever I said it, so I'll
get it, I'll get it back. And, um,

685
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,250
I felt fucking great about it.

686
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:30,690
And then today I got text messages from
two different comedians telling me that

687
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:33,930
they love the new shit that I was doing.
It, it just, I just made my fucking day.

688
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,750
So I'm really excited about,
uh,

689
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,450
getting that shit together because I want
to do another special this year. And,

690
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,800
um, I got some stuff on
my act. That's funny,

691
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:48,510
but I just feel like the topics have
been done before so much try to like,

692
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:53,450
you know, you know, push that shit to the
wayside. Maybe that'll just be on the,

693
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,330
some of those topics. We'll
just be on like the, uh,

694
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,590
when I released the vinyl of
the Madison Square Garden Show,

695
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,570
I'll just keep them on that one.

696
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,660
There'll be some extra jokes that won't
be the same material. I don't know.

697
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,770
I'm just excited about the,
uh, the next few months,

698
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,960
how that Shit's going
to turn out. But, uh,

699
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,240
before we get into the
questions this week, everybody,

700
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,030
I have to give a shout
out to rogue fitness,

701
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,210
whoever dental was listening
to the podcast. I was
breaking that balls. You know,

702
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,310
I'm making a gym. I'm paying somebody
to build a gym for me out my garage,

703
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:30,210
a little gym there in the back. And I
got all my shit through rogue fitness.

704
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:34,370
They just had the best shit out there.
And I was just joking with them that, uh,

705
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,090
you know, how dare you not send me Free
Shit. I didn't even ask him for it.

706
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:42,110
He just immediately came to the podcast
breaking the fucking balls and they

707
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:43,820
listened to the one where
there was me and Nia,

708
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:46,610
Nia told me to get the
regular looking weights,

709
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,940
just the ones that look like iron
or whatever. And I wanted the,

710
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,610
I wanted the color for once and
she thought that they were corny.

711
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,110
So all of a sudden I just
got this shipment of these
colorful weights and I was

712
00:41:57,111 --> 00:42:00,130
laughing going, Oh man, I must have
fucked it up. I got the colorful ones.

713
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:04,070
So I wrote them trying to ask how
to send it back and they said no,

714
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:07,670
we listened to the podcast and they sent
me some free weight and they sent me a

715
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:10,790
tee shirts. I, you know, rogue
fitness. I was fucking around.

716
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,850
You didn't have to do that. You
guys are solid man. And I'm,

717
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,100
I can't wait to uh, you know, use your,
your equipment cause it's, you know,

718
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:23,720
it's great. Made in the USA. All good
stuff. Oh look who's here. The busy body.

719
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,870
The lovely Nia. Did you
get some Thai food? Yes.

720
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,870
Did you grab a mic or do you want to eat?
Do you want to eat?

721
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,320
I got another, uh, 17 minutes here.

722
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,750
17 minutes to Mike's were in
the closet. Oh, why don't you,

723
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:43,790
why don't you sit down and help
me through with the questions.

724
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,840
Why do I hook it up? Cause I am, I am a,

725
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:52,700
I'm actively doing the podcast
right now actively. Oh,

726
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:57,580
Jesus. You know, if he going to
be in a mood like that. Oh Geez.

727
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,800
Is
What's that?

728
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,630
You just walked out on
me anyways. All right,

729
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:07,430
well I'm going to start
reading the first one then.

730
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,630
You don't care. All right. Oh,
by the way, you know something,

731
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,970
I was taking my dog out for a walk today.
You know,

732
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:21,830
we were walking up into the park there
and this is before she puked and I

733
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:25,730
decided to turn around and come home.
She started nowhere. She started yakking.

734
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,560
Uh, made me feel bad. I was like,
Jesus, I hope it wasn't something I did.

735
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,470
It wasn't hot out or anything.
Um,

736
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,590
another Yale has a very sensitive stomach.
Well,

737
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:39,500
another fucking group of people come up
the second they get to the end of the

738
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:41,180
park,
they just fucking don't say what park.

739
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,780
They go to the fucking park and they
fucking take the leashes off the fucking

740
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:48,510
dogs come right up to my dog. And they're
like, yeah, no worries. Don't worry.

741
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:52,450
She's friendly, she's friendly.
It's like, my dog isn't my dog.

742
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,120
My dog is ignores other dogs.

743
00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:00,310
It chills and then we're like, when
you are bugging my dog, it doesn't go.

744
00:44:00,311 --> 00:44:03,310
It never has the, hey, can you do
me a favor? Can you knock it off?

745
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:05,170
It immediately just grabs you.
Like,

746
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:09,100
remember Friday the 13th when Jason was
under the Cot and grabbed that dude's

747
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:11,750
head and reached up, I guess it
was the chicken, the first one.

748
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,370
I met a dog tonight who just
didn't like anybody and I've,

749
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,430
but I realized quickly what it was his
owner was holding him and anytime anyone

750
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:23,410
came towards the honor, like,
oh, hey, oh, what a cute dog.

751
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,840
The dog was stark rally and I,

752
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,040
and it's so funny because he said to one
of the people, oh, pet him. And I'm like,

753
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,310
no, your dog isn't,
doesn't want to be pet.

754
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,690
It growls at everybody.

755
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,120
And I think the dog was protecting the
owner. So anytime, you know, like I said,

756
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:41,340
anyone that came towards him,
he started growling, but right.

757
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,240
He was so clueless that he was like, oh
he's fine, just pet him. And I'm like no,

758
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,850
no, you can't pet the dog. If it's ground
at people. I cannot judge him. Our dogs,

759
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:55,480
a psycho dog went to bite me like it
actually kind of like put, it's the,

760
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,620
its walked across the fucking Bro.

761
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:00,590
I went over and it put its,

762
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:05,280
it's put my finger in between its teeth
and didn't chomp down. But it was,

763
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,510
I was yes, but it was a biting behavior.

764
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,540
So a little dog man with
little dogs with people.

765
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:17,010
They'd be riding around in convertibles,
you know, like a corvette or some shit.

766
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:20,820
All right, let's, let's leave
in 11 minutes. All right.
So can you want to do one,

767
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,620
one question? Yeah, let's do it.

768
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,620
All right, job. Hey
Billy. Baret um, I, we're,

769
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:29,900
I'm working part time
job and I have a problem.

770
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,580
Let me see if there's a
relationship one here.

771
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:37,200
Why can't old boyfriend, can I not
be involved in the the job one? Well,

772
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,280
I just feel like I always
give the guy advice.

773
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,900
Well, maybe it's time to shake it up a
little bit less. So it's trying to do,

774
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:50,270
have you given some lady advice
on some relationship? Huh?

775
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,850
Oh God. Are you going to
go on a feminist rant here?

776
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,110
You know women can answer other fucking
questions too, you know? Yeah. All right,

777
00:45:57,111 --> 00:45:59,600
let's get another question that doesn't
have to do with relationships. Hey,

778
00:45:59,620 --> 00:45:59,870
you know,

779
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,810
I'm trying to give you a nice softball
here in front of the lob it over the

780
00:46:02,811 --> 00:46:07,790
fucking place. A fucking
softball. Anything Person
Rolling your head? Here we go.

781
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,160
When all reality show me there.
All right.

782
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,710
I'm working a part time job and I have
a problem related to it. All right.

783
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,770
The job is I work at a fucking ice cream.

784
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,600
It's at an ice cream place in my town and
the second time I worked there a while

785
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,880
back,
I had a godawful shift.

786
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,480
I didn't have all the kinks of the job
worked yet and I was working with someone

787
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,050
I didn't know, which made me more
nervous. The night quickly became, uh,

788
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,100
you know this word Koffka esque
parade. Who's calm? Who's that?

789
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,620
Oh No, he's a writer. Is he a philosopher?

790
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,190
I'm going to have a
particular political view.

791
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,750
I think he died in a boating accident.

792
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,170
Whatever. Mommy, Inez. Kafkaesque.

793
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,940
Joseph Kafka. I think he's a one
of those. He's like a philosopher.

794
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,990
J Lo no, four. She goes on tour.

795
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,820
I'm not going to lie and say I know
exactly. Who can we Google it though?

796
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,530
I really feel like it's a Joseph Kafka.

797
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,460
We just read the fucking
question. Oh, right. Okay.

798
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,430
The night quickly became a Kafka
as parade of a horrific errors.

799
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:24,240
I screwed up, orders, stock things wrong,
et Cetera, and by the end of the night,

800
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:29,120
my coworker was audibly and visibly
disgusted with me and she should have been

801
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,920
John's Kafka. Okay. Sorry. Chairman.

802
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:38,550
Language writer of novels
and short stories. Who is?

803
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,121
Oh my God.

804
00:47:39,121 --> 00:47:43,680
He died the day after my birthday
and therein lies the tragedy.

805
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,720
All right. Here we go. All
right. Put down your phone.

806
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,060
Try to align what car I was going to
say. It's surreal. I was right. Yes.

807
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,010
I'm not entertaining.
Sorry.

808
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,570
Entertaining for people.
Kafka ask elements often
appear in existential works,

809
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:07,320
but the term has transcended the
literary realm to apply to real life

810
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:11,040
occurrences in situations that
are in comprehensively complex,

811
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,620
bizarre or a logical where
we go Franz Kafka. All right.

812
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,250
Okay.
Okay.

813
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,950
All right. So the ladies or the lady
is, was upset with him and he's saying,

814
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,430
you know, audibly and visibly disgusted
with me and she should have been okay.

815
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:30,080
She's in college and I'm in high school
so luckily I never had to work with her

816
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:33,830
again after the summer was over
and she went back to her classes.

817
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,860
But even as recently as spring break,

818
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,560
I've heard she's still
talking shit about me.

819
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,330
Yeah. Oh, you heard this all the
way back. She's at some college.

820
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,220
How did you hear that? Yeah, they
were all on the Facebook. Um,

821
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,830
oh Grandpa,
I love saying the Huh?

822
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,960
You guys taking the Molly
those? No, you wouldn't.

823
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:01,730
You wouldn't know Molly, if you are the
grampy like Molly ecstasy, whatever.

824
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,670
It just an old guy thing.
Yeah,

825
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:06,110
that was my dad when he used
to get mad at my sister Christ.

826
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:09,050
Is she on that Internet Internet?

827
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:09,640
Um,

828
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,640
it's almost summer again and I'm almost
definitely going to have to face her if

829
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:19,150
I work regularly. If I do, I know for
a fact I'll fuck things up immediately.

830
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:20,040
Purely from England

831
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,690
anxiety. Hmm. Dude, you should
be like to fucking older,

832
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:28,640
wiser guy crushing it and then you fucking
banger confidence and my friend, wait,

833
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:32,300
what? What do you mean banger? It's
all there. Why didn't you what?

834
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,870
What does it all there? You can make
her a mall. She'd get two straws.

835
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,750
You know why? Cause she's
the older woman. Right.

836
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:42,440
And she has to be tamed by getting
that deck. Is that what it is?

837
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,470
I didn't say that you did.
No,

838
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:51,320
really go after the competence and then
get banger because your life is like a

839
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:56,321
fucking movie from the 19 20th Bill
where the guy is slapping a woman around.

840
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:59,090
I was like, get it together.
See? And she says, oh,

841
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,440
he completely fucked up cosmetic.

842
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,690
This is like one of those
coming of age movies.

843
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:06,900
Warn the begin beginning the
nerds like, Yo, walk away from me.

844
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,170
The nerd is looking at the cheerleader
and she's dating the impossible Dick with

845
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:16,620
the blonde, wavy hair. Somebody
does a fucking triple Lindy.

846
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:18,620
Okay,

847
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,880
Jesus Christ. I went sideways,
Huh? The fuck just happened there?

848
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,230
I said,

849
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,020
cause I'm not going to be able to get
awarded and defense of what I was saying,

850
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,820
right? He makes an ass out of himself
in front of this. You know the soul,

851
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:35,310
the fucking broad. All right.
See, this isn't sexist.

852
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,550
Now you come back, you're a little
older, a little wiser, right?

853
00:50:38,551 --> 00:50:41,850
You're a year older, you still growing,
you filled out a little bit, right?

854
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,680
All of a sudden you're crushing it.

855
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:49,070
He make it a fucking couple banana splits
in a smoothie all at the same time and

856
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:54,650
she's just like, wow, this is it. The
man that I left the year, you know,

857
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,370
the year before, all of a sudden you
guys are working closely. You know,

858
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,980
ice cream is always romantic.

859
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,040
What kind of fucked of advisor
you get given anything and fun.

860
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,463
I'm telling this kid

861
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,040
can shake it off he goes.
If I don't work often,

862
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:13,120
I could lose my job as we've got more
employees than we need and I really have a

863
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:16,030
great setup. Now that I've
learned it, the work is easy.

864
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:20,020
I basically pick my own hours and
my bosses by far the sweetest,

865
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:22,420
racist homophobe I've ever met in my life.

866
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,760
Any ideas besides the obvious murder?
He said your standup is killer.

867
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:30,280
I hope I can see perform
sometime. Yeah, dude, you got to,

868
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:33,430
you got to grow a Dick here,
man. You're the fucking man.

869
00:51:33,431 --> 00:51:38,220
You've been there for a year. You know
what's going on. Just be like a, I dunno.

870
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,650
Just, I don't know. What do you
do? You have a crush on this woman.

871
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,660
If she's not going to fuck you,
then what?

872
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:46,780
Do you care what she
thinks is that bad now?

873
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:50,580
Yes.
What is spiking has to do with it.

874
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:54,150
Does have confidence in yourself
and do the job. Also, this is,

875
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,340
this is a high school
person that's writing in.

876
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,820
This is somebody who's making ice cream
cones and he's scared out of his mind

877
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,460
about some woman who is not
easy and he's not even fucking,

878
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:05,400
he doesn't want to ask her out.
What is the problem?

879
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,390
She's going to yell at you about
the way you put the fucking

880
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,230
cherries or something because
as a job and he's in, you know,

881
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:12,350
worried about how he's
going to perceive you.

882
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,650
Remember what it was like to be at that
age where you know every little thing

883
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,580
you know means disaster and the
bigger picture. Oh, so is he,

884
00:52:20,581 --> 00:52:23,880
cause it's just a job a little bit.
Yeah.

885
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:27,720
I think you're worried a little too
much about nothing. Just do your job,

886
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,270
do your thing,
don't even worry about it.

887
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:33,600
And there's plenty of other
jobs out there by the way,

888
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,080
and he should just be totally,
yeah.

889
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,200
Cocky.
Which she comes in.

890
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,550
What up bitch? Yeah, I'm sure
that'll go over real well.

891
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:50,440
Float. Do [inaudible] kiss
with the little piece side? No,

892
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,910
no honey. Yeah. Ice Cream had to decide

893
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:00,500
we pussy or nothing.
Jesus Christ pushing all the chips.

894
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:04,820
And this is the world series of poker.
All right. Hey there, Billy boy. I'm on.

895
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:08,540
I'm a new listener to your podcast,
but a long time fan of you stand up.

896
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:13,160
I was wondering if you could help me
out with it. A dilemma I'm facing.

897
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,110
So my weed dealer put the moves on me.
My last time I was at her place.

898
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,030
Uh,
nothing came of it,

899
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,330
but I could tell she was trying
to get me to fucker until now.

900
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:27,080
I thought it was weird that she began to
me pot for practically. Yeah, nothing.

901
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,200
Wow.
She's cool.

902
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:34,580
And I've hung out with her at her
place many times to just smoke weed,

903
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,250
just, just as well. I'm single,

904
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:40,670
so I have no problem getting some
strange pussy that falls into my lap.

905
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,570
The problem is that she's a very heavy,
broad,

906
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:48,830
and completely unattractive. Oh, Gigi Age.

907
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:53,260
But she sells the best weed in
the area. Dude, this is fucking,

908
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:57,020
this has all the makings of the
great first 10 pages of a script.

909
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,120
We've established who the characters are.
Oh yeah.

910
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,900
Now we've got the Rabo
super far with this premise.

911
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,140
Yeah.

912
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,340
Oh God. You know what? You know what
I love. You know what I love to do?

913
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,300
You know that guy can help it.
You know that guys just want to fuck you.

914
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,260
Women know that you use it to
your advantage to get shit.

915
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:21,330
And then when we admit that that's what
we want to do. You look though, oh my God,

916
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:22,120
I really,

917
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,780
someone would tell a story about a guy
who was getting thrown pussy left and

918
00:54:25,781 --> 00:54:27,340
right and doesn't know what to do with it.

919
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:30,700
And it's like a coming of age and I'm
sure he's also fighting with his friends a

920
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,160
little bit about like,
what dorm are you going to stay in?

921
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:34,720
And it's just hilarious.

922
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:35,950
Yeah.

923
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,140
He's got this heavy broad
that he's not attracted to.

924
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:42,490
Who's this fucking weed dealer?
Yeah. She's got the best
weed. Yeah. Knows he wants,

925
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:46,520
she wants to fuck them. What was the
rest of the story? Does he want it?

926
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:49,270
This is a fuck. Come on.
Seth Rogan would crush this.

927
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,363
Hmm.

928
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,220
Ah, you are in it. You know what?
You're hungry. You're like him.

929
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:56,280
When that snickers commercial,
I don't know who you are,

930
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:01,300
where Seth Rogan would write a phenomenal
transcendent script that Jonah Hill

931
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:05,340
would act out and it would just be
like, wow, is this what it's like?

932
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,950
What is wrong with you?

933
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,223
Huh?

934
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,990
I like all of those people and I like
those movies. You don't like hot tub,

935
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,280
Chubby and awkward and not know what
to do with your life. Oh, what are you?

936
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:23,420
Why are you being a jerk? I don't
know. You're being a jerk, right? Yeah.

937
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,790
You're hungry. I am being a little bit
of a generic, apologized to Seth Rogan.

938
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,890
I'm also okay. Yeah, you are.

939
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,130
You're a little out of
sorts here. Okay. All right.

940
00:55:33,131 --> 00:55:36,140
You let you burn burning bridges in this
town, Sweetie. Let me tell you something.

941
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:37,310
Those bridges don't come back,

942
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,870
but she sells the best weed in
the area I don't want. All right?

943
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:46,070
I don't want to not fucker
and then ever cut me off,

944
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,150
but at the same time I feel that I,

945
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:54,430
if I do fucker then I'm no better than
an addicted crack whore doing a line off

946
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:58,940
some fat guy's Dick.
Maybe. Uh, so guess what,

947
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,960
when it comes down to what do
I fuck my ugly drug dealer for?

948
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,910
[inaudible] oh my God.

949
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:08,780
What do I just question or do I just
find a new dealer was super urban.

950
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:13,460
Pay More money. Thanks. Hope all
is well with you ginger. Fuck.

951
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,550
Cause she had ginger. Fuck. Um,

952
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:18,010
okay.

953
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,230
Have you ever heard the expression
don't shit where you eat?

954
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,150
Yeah.
Don't fuck your weed dealer.

955
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,210
Yeah. Don't just don't fucker.
This is a business relationship.

956
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:32,100
Keep it business like lie and started
talking about how we as a girlfriend.

957
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:36,420
No, just buy weed from her and
like just let it be business. Yes.

958
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:39,270
Stop Smoking with them.
And also like,

959
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,060
I mean maybe she's
desperate for your cock,

960
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:43,890
but maybe you're like reading into it.

961
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:49,160
She might be trying to fuck you
and the next dude, so she's, she's,

962
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,730
she's a drug dealer. She's hustling.
She's hustling for like customers.

963
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:55,590
She's hustling for Dick.
Like don't get excited.

964
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:00,610
You know you're not the only one bra.
So you think, yeah, but she's given

965
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,060
away for next to nothing. If she does
that, she's not gonna make any money.

966
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,570
True. She's making it
another way is, I dunno,

967
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,960
I feel like just don't
fuck your weed dealer.

968
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:15,100
That just sounds like a disaster written
all over it or get yourself a really

969
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:18,940
good connect.
Now have that in your back pocket.

970
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:22,480
So if you do decide that the only reason
why you would fuck your weed dealer is

971
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,030
if you actually want to fuck her.

972
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,490
Not because you're so desperate
for the best we'd ever have.

973
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:30,460
You really had the best weed
and like your entire city.

974
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:35,070
Probably not so calm down.
Don't matter dealer. Uh Huh.

975
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,730
I mean, you know, you kind of enter
the habit. You're not just going, hey,

976
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:42,240
can I get a hit off that when you fucking
go in there week after week to the

977
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:43,160
point that the [inaudible]

978
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,850
weed dealers are a dime a dozen though,
there's, it's not like a specialty,

979
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,980
but just say this fucking chick is
the vcs buying so much weed off.

980
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,500
If she's developing feelings for,
she's not,

981
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,550
he might be cute. Jesus, you might have
a little crush, but like it's not that.

982
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,260
It's,
my point is it's not that serious.

983
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,620
Don't fuck your weed dealer unless you
want to have a problem with your weed

984
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:09,820
dealer and you didn't want to cheat. You
don't want to have a problem. Trust me.

985
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:13,900
We dealer wants to fuck one
of her customers. Course.
I completely believe it.

986
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:17,500
I'm just saying just don't, don't
go there. It's not worth it.

987
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,230
That's my bottom line. She's usually
not this grumpy. You guys all right.

988
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,480
The grumpy old boyfriend,
texts wife.

989
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:31,290
Oh, Billy cheese balls. Where'd
that come from? I don't know.

990
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,510
It just fucking make up names
for me. Oh, okay. All right.

991
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:37,500
Very happily married for 25 years to
the hottest wife and mother of our three

992
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:38,220
sons.

993
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,570
She's in spectacular shape and beautiful
while on vacation in palm springs.

994
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,440
Bang. Right. Just scape herself in shape.

995
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:53,510
Yeah. We're visual animals.
We're visual animals.

996
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,403
I know

997
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,530
there's a reason why all those gay
guys are walking around with six packs

998
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,030
because they know what
they're trying to attract.

999
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,530
Yeah.
Don't bring the gaze into this.

1000
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:05,730
Do you think all those gay guys wanting
to go to the gym that much? They have to.

1001
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,520
If they don't, that's the end of the Dick
Train and they know it. They know it.

1002
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,290
All right. So anyways, uh,

1003
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,590
while on vacation in Palm Springs,

1004
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:23,650
I caught a glimpse of her phone
screen and saw a text from PB.

1005
00:59:23,651 --> 00:59:26,950
Pb was asking,
how's the weather?

1006
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:32,320
So I asked her who PB is after a
little persuasion. She replied,

1007
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:33,280
it's Dave.

1008
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,820
Dave is a boyfriend from her high
school years and he is a former fiance.

1009
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,900
This is awful.
She promised it was nothing.

1010
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:50,080
I asked if they had seen each other
underneath a different name though. Yeah.

1011
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:55,110
That's pretty suspect when you have
the presence name saved under an alias.

1012
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:01,120
The B was PB mean. Wait, there's a penis.

1013
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,210
Brilliant. Brilliant
Penis. She's dyslexic.

1014
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:10,050
Penis, Babe. Penis,

1015
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,640
Pussy Banger.
Maybe.

1016
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,210
I'm sure it's something between the three.

1017
01:00:19,211 --> 01:00:22,090
It was a capital p and then a lowercase
B. I don't know why he did it. All right.

1018
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:26,060
If you guys have any suggestions
what PB would stand for? Come on.

1019
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:30,720
What social media is
all about? It goes, uh,

1020
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,220
she promised it was nothing.
I asked if,

1021
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:37,210
if they had seen each other or
slept together. She said, no,

1022
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:42,670
I believe her. Okay. Oh, Jesus.

1023
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,710
It's a pharmacy up fiance. Does
he mean now? I guess now or maybe.

1024
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:51,430
I just want to believe her. She is
otherwise a very honest person. Well,

1025
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:55,990
I sent Dave a text and here's what I said.
Oh,

1026
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,210
beautiful.
I'm only going to say this once.

1027
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,580
You're nothing but a sleazy cock sucker.

1028
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,780
You've crossed the line of decency.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1029
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,900
Or better yet go choke
to death on some poor.

1030
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:13,450
Something that he's Dick. Wait,
what? So it's a, it's a homophobic.

1031
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,100
He was upset. Okay. Never
communicate with my wife,

1032
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:21,130
capital letters ever.
If you pursuer in any way,

1033
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:25,150
I'll cut your dick off with a rusty saw
blade and shove it down your throat.

1034
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:30,220
I hope you're getting the message here.
His reply understood.

1035
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:33,970
This is the less text
name and numbered deleted.

1036
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:39,100
My question to you is,
was I harsh enough with team

1037
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,660
and I'm not sure what to do with Bob.
My wife,

1038
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:48,520
she deleted him from our context
and she said she has no need to ever

1039
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:51,460
communicate with him again.
What are your thoughts?

1040
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,193
Wow,

1041
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:58,920
I think you need to let it be then.
I mean I that was,

1042
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:03,120
I have to say that was masterful.
All that text that he sent to PB,

1043
01:02:03,121 --> 01:02:07,740
Aka Dave. I think he got the
message with that one now.

1044
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:09,060
What do you think?
Uh,

1045
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,320
so do you think she banged him? No,
she was probably sending, flirting,

1046
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,230
borderline inappropriate text messages.

1047
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:25,810
No ebay years. Those beautiful the day I
took you to prom. Like that type of shit.

1048
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:31,850
Why are you, why we went on the left
side than that? I don't fucking know. I,

1049
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:35,500
the recent
Bill Barr?

1050
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:40,550
Probably what it said some like that's
what you're making because you know how

1051
01:02:40,551 --> 01:02:43,570
you are. You probably would've said
some inappropriate shit over text.

1052
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,250
I mean that's what, yeah.
Is that what texting is?

1053
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,520
It's what is, how do I, how do I,

1054
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:56,510
how do I get to the texting to us?
Well, lose weight. How texting works.

1055
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,730
All right. Advice from a, for
a fellow ginger. Oh, moving
right. Moving right along.

1056
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,030
Right along fellow ginger from Finland

1057
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:05,943
here.

1058
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:10,840
I have a decision to make and would
appreciate some advice from a wise and

1059
01:03:10,841 --> 01:03:14,890
experienced man like you.
Ever since I was a kid. Oh,

1060
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,920
you've just every fucking thing.
Ever since I was a kid,

1061
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:19,630
I've wanted to be an airline pilot.

1062
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:24,400
I'm 19 years old and I'm graduating
from high school in December. Yes.

1063
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,830
Here we finish high school later.

1064
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,100
I was just going to say, is that when they
graduate from high school and Finland?

1065
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,020
Yeah.
Then you

1066
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,410
guys in Mirka. Alright. I've,

1067
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,080
I have till the end of the year
to decide what I want to study.

1068
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:42,850
I've always had a plan after
high school. I would want to, uh,

1069
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,950
go to a flight academy and become a pilot.

1070
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,310
But now I've started to question if that's
what I really want to do for a living

1071
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:51,460
living. I mean an airline
pilot is an incredible job,

1072
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:55,300
absolutely love flying and we get to
travel a bunch of seal kinds of amazing

1073
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:56,290
places,
et Cetera.

1074
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:01,650
Plus I would get to the sun every day
without burning my Nordic ultra pasty,

1075
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:07,870
pasty skin. Um, the
captain makes six figures,

1076
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,780
which is plenty enough for
me since I'm not into money.

1077
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,590
My only problem with being a pilot is
that I would never be completely free,

1078
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:19,680
meaning that for the rest of my life
working for some other douchebag, uh,

1079
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,430
would, would decide for me when I
can come to work and where I can fly.

1080
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:29,050
The idea of being tied up to a company
and having some con making all the

1081
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:33,460
decisions for me scares the
shit out of me when I'm older.

1082
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:38,380
I want to be able to do
things on an impulse without
asking permission from, uh,

1083
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,950
some capital letters,
other men also pilots.

1084
01:04:41,951 --> 01:04:45,250
But you're just over there taking
pictures of shit. And you, um,

1085
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:49,710
also pilots spent a lot of time away from
home and someday when I start a family

1086
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,060
and have kids, I want to spend as
much time as possible with them.

1087
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:53,650
So that could be a problem as well.

1088
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:55,750
Flying planes for living
would be a dream job,

1089
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,990
but we'd get in the way of my other
dream of being completely my own man and

1090
01:04:58,991 --> 01:05:02,140
free. What do you think? Should
I go study something else? No.

1091
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:05,020
What you should do is still
be into the aviation thing.

1092
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:08,380
You just figure out a way to do
what you want to do within aviation.

1093
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,290
Okay. I will equate it to the job
that I have. I am a standup comedian,

1094
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:17,110
which opens up all these doors
into the entertainment world,

1095
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,950
which a lot of them you think you want
to run through until you get to the other

1096
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:24,520
side. And then you realize what you're
talking about is like, holy fuck,

1097
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,670
I thought I had the world by the balls.
If I got this,

1098
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,990
I thought I would be the pimp.

1099
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:33,640
And then you realize that you're
actually the whore. So you have to,

1100
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:34,474
um,

1101
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:39,730
what I would do if I was you is I
would still go to flight school.

1102
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:41,110
I would learn how to fly.

1103
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:46,150
And then what I would do is rather
than going flying for some commercial

1104
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:49,630
airline, there's gotta be some
other cool shit that you can do,

1105
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:54,010
like flying for site, seeing tours.
You're not into money, right?

1106
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,430
Maybe you do that.

1107
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,020
Maybe you ended up having that business
and other people fly for you and you get

1108
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:02,710
to fly around. Um, what
other jobs are they?

1109
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:04,420
There's fighting forest
fires and you know,

1110
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:08,410
you do that and like helicopters and
planes and that type of shit. Yeah.

1111
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,020
Um,
listen,

1112
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,980
just by being a pilot already,

1113
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,680
you got some sort of
renegade spirit in your,

1114
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:22,681
so I'm sure there's plenty of fucking
jobs that you can get in aviation.

1115
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:26,410
I think it pretty much any job there's,

1116
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:30,430
there's a way to be in the matrix and
then there's a way to be outside. Like,

1117
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:34,630
you know, he's a renegade, that one, you
know, don't get tied down with that guy.

1118
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:38,430
You can definitely do it.
Right. What do you think? Yeah.

1119
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:42,760
So he should still be a pilot to do you
love to fly. It's what you want to do. Um,

1120
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,900
but you know, there's, there's all kinds
of shit you can fly for fucking airline.

1121
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:50,140
Make your money and then leave
and then go do something else.

1122
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:54,380
Like start your own business. I Dunno,
you're laughing at me right now.

1123
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,840
He's 19.
He's got the whole worry he's got,

1124
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,700
he's got the world by the fucking short
hairs and all. Sounds it all sounds good.

1125
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,830
I was listening to a
podcast from wild back then.

1126
01:07:02,831 --> 01:07:05,830
You were shitting on the
NFL having games in London.

1127
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,950
He said those games a huge things for us.
European football fans.

1128
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:12,670
And believe it or not, there are tons
of football fans here in Europe. Uh,

1129
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:15,910
the Games always sell out and I fell.
Football sells out there. Who knows?

1130
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:19,210
All right, here's new. Who, whose,
here's the last one. I'm stuttering here.

1131
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,390
Okay. Guess what? I just
time traveled in the podcast.

1132
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,140
Let me give you a second to just wrap
your head around this because I know it's

1133
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:30,460
always weird when this happens.

1134
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,090
I actually finished out the podcast
with the lovely Nia with my fucking

1135
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:38,860
batteries wore out and I didn't
even notice we had a nice debate.

1136
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:43,540
She fucking trashed me. Ah,
what are you going to do?

1137
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,890
Um, so let me, I don't even
know where to pick up here.

1138
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:51,430
I got two more reads to do and I think
I have another question. I'm not sure.

1139
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:56,140
So let me, uh, all right.
Dollar Shave Club. Everybody.
I know this is fucking weird.

1140
01:07:56,141 --> 01:08:00,850
Sorry to just slam your fucking brain
against the inside of your skull there.

1141
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,910
Um, all right. Dollar Shave Club.
It's Monday morning. Not by the way.

1142
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:08,480
That's why I sound a little more fresh.
No Yon and for all freckles.

1143
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,371
All right.

1144
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:14,371
Do I always Shave Club
dollar shave club.com has a
special offer for new members

1145
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,620
who today you'll get a free month of the
executive razor when you buy a tube of

1146
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:23,050
Doc Dick calvers I got to still,

1147
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,100
I'm going to say Carvey for
the doctor cabbies easy shape.

1148
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,310
Whenever I hear that executive razor, I
just picture, he's like, you know, you,

1149
01:08:30,311 --> 01:08:34,040
you have the dress shirt on with boxers
and then you'd dress socks with sock.

1150
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:38,660
Garters just shaving with it.
I'll go to a fire so much time.

1151
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:39,710
All right,

1152
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:43,990
this is the first time they've ever done
something like this and once you tried

1153
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:46,070
dollar shave club.com,
you'll be,

1154
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,070
you will become a proud member
like millions of others.

1155
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:52,840
One reason is because they deliver amazing
razors right to your door for a third,

1156
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,210
the price of what?
Greedy razor corporations charge.

1157
01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:01,250
That means when you join DSC dall sheep.
Um,

1158
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,250
you can afford to shave with a
fresh blade anytime you want,

1159
01:09:04,251 --> 01:09:06,470
which feels fantastic.

1160
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:10,250
You'll get a first class shave when you
use the executive blade without hurting

1161
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:14,750
your wallet. What Martin
Sheen, you're looking at manor.

1162
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,820
Didn't judge another man by
the size of it. I mean that,

1163
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:22,490
that fucking Michael Douglas greed
is good movie Wall Street. All right?

1164
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:27,491
Another reason is Dr Covey's easy shave
butter using it with the executive makes

1165
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:32,630
the blade glide gently for the
smoothest shave ever. Dr Carver's.

1166
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:35,090
Shave butter isn't your
average shave cream.

1167
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:39,200
It's a unique conditioning formula
with high quality natural ingredients,

1168
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:43,340
leaving your skin unbelievably soft
and smooth. Jesus Christ. We got it.

1169
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:48,830
How many times you can see how
smooth it is, like a baby's ass. Uh,

1170
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,470
call to call to action.
And right now,

1171
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,770
new members who buy a
tube of shave butter,

1172
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:58,460

Take advantage of and it's only available
by going to dollar shave club.com/

1174

shave club.com/bar dollar
shave club.com/burp um,

1175
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,560
MVMT watches.
All right,

1176
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:15,110
it's been a few weeks since I cracked
open these sharp looking movement.

1177
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:19,250
Watch and I'll spend a couple of months
stop putting words in my mouth. Uh,

1178
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,380
all right.
As promised,

1179
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:25,610
the quality's watches are there for an
awesome price in the style department.

1180
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:30,611
The compliments I get on this thing are
really unbelievable considering I don't

1181
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:34,190
wear it now I'm wearing it.
Describe your watch. Well,

1182
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:36,110
I'm wearing the fucking watch.
I always had,

1183
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:41,570
cause I'm a grownup and I can afford a
watch because I spent 24 fucking years in

1184
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,180
strip malls. I can actually
afford one. But back in the day,

1185
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:48,260
I'm going to Redo this copy. All
right. When I couldn't afford a watch,

1186
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,800
when I stayed in that broken bed,
net fucked up,

1187
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:54,230
cabin up and chill coot
Charlie's and Alaska,

1188
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:57,170
I would have worn a watch like this and
they would've been like, God damn it,

1189
01:10:57,171 --> 01:11:00,820
this guy's a pro. I hope
they gave him a good bed. Um,

1190
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:03,500
if you hadn't had the chance to
experience how movement will, uh,

1191
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:08,020
how a movement watch fits
around your risks, this is
your chance movement. Watch,

1192
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,020
watch his start at just 95 bucks.
It looks like a $700 watch.

1193
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:13,560
I'm not gonna lie to you.
See,

1194
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:17,560
when movement cut out the middle
man with the huge big brand markups,

1195
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,980
the price of a stylus watch
finally got affordable.

1196
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,820
Imagine that a watch with
a d with department store
quality for fraction of the

1197
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:27,860
price movement has grown organically
purely by supporters. Like you said,

join there more than 1 million social
media followers and get a movement watch

1219
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:45,300
The last question that I actually did
with the lovely Nia and now we're fucking

1220
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,890
wage gap myth.
Uh Oh,

1221
01:12:49,891 --> 01:12:53,280
did this spark a debate a deal?
Dear Billy Baru,

1222
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:56,640
I was one of the fortunate and
audience members of your epic terrorist

1223
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:59,250
performance. You crushed it. My
opinion. Thank you very much.

1224
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,270
He said the wage gap statistic.
Um,

1225
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,780
he said I wanted to bunk a myth for
you. The wage gap statistic. You know,

1226
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:11,700
this is thing right now that they say
that a woman gets paid less 79 cents less

1227
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:15,150
to do the exact same job is a guy which,
you know, my opinion is fucked up.

1228
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:16,650
The job should pay what should pay.
Right?

1229
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,400
So this guy says the wage gap statistic
that you hear about all the time is

1230
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:24,720
simply the average earnings of
men and women working full time.

1231
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,890
It does not take into account
different job positions, hours worked,

1232
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,040
or different jobs.
It has nothing to do with the same work.

1233
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,610
It has nothing to do with discrimination.
In 1963,

1234
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,740
the supreme court passed
the equal pay act,

1235
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:41,250
which makes it illegal to pay
different wages for the same job.

1236
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,040
If you still don't buy that,
then consider this.

1237
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:47,160
If a company could legally
play pay women less money,

1238
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,130
do you think those greedy
Kuntz would ever hire a man?

1239
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,890
Some decent points there. Uh, once I
pulled this wage gap threat thread,

1240
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:58,590
a whole bunch of other feminists
myths started to unravel,

1241
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:03,150
but I just wanted to shine a light on
this topic. Well, okay, lets you know,

1242
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:07,860
I'll have to look all of that up. I never
looked up the equal pay act, but um,

1243
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:13,850
if they're still able to make the
numbers work then wouldn't that say,

1244
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:18,940
did guys get the better high paying
jobs then done then does it become that?

1245
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:24,260
I'm just asking. All right. Um, that's
what I would guess. So why don't know.

1246
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:27,380
Evidently, I have some readings to do
and I think a lot of feminists do too,

1247
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:30,140
that just jump on the bandwagon
and I'll look up the equal pay act.

1248
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:31,783
MMM.

1249
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,070
I don't know who the fuck knows.
I mean,

1250
01:14:34,071 --> 01:14:36,810
one of the dumbest fucking ways to
get somebody to listen to your goddamn

1251
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:40,760
opinion is to just sit there and be like,
you got it better than us.

1252
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,940
You're life is fucking easy.
That immediately puts the
other side going, like,

1253
01:14:43,941 --> 01:14:48,830
you know, an f fuck you. Fuck you and your
procedure. You know, my fucking life. Cz,

1254
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:50,690
I just dealt with this, this,
this, and this. You know,

1255
01:14:50,691 --> 01:14:52,460
it just puts people into that mindset.

1256
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:54,203
MMM.

1257
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,870
I Dunno if that whole fucking yelling
and screaming and shit. You know,

1258
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:02,890
believe me as a yeller and Screamer, I
know it doesn't make people listen to you.

1259
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:07,390
It just makes you, people just go, oh my
God, I want to get away from this person,

1260
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,010
or that person's a fucking lunatic.

1261
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,070
That's been my experience
trying to convey ideas

1262
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,560
since I was a little orange,
had a child.

1263
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,193
MMM.

1264
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:22,360
I don't know what's going on. Okay.
At the end of the day, people should,

1265
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,370
the job should pay what the job pays
and the best person should get it,

1266
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:31,530
but sadly that is never going to happen
because there's always going to be the

1267
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:34,350
boss's son.
There's always going to be the hot chick.

1268
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,020
There's always going to be the racist,
the homophobe,

1269
01:15:37,021 --> 01:15:40,920
the person who comes in with a southern
accent, you're up north or vice versa,

1270
01:15:40,921 --> 01:15:44,340
and somebody mentally still fighting the
war. I think southern people are stupid.

1271
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:48,900
You can't. The only way to take the
human element out of it is to gradually,

1272
01:15:48,901 --> 01:15:51,150
slowly but surely dumbed down,

1273
01:15:51,151 --> 01:15:55,840
human beings make everything automated
and you slowly replaced them with free

1274
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:59,970
thinking robots, which is basically
what's going to happen. By free thinking.

1275
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:04,971
I mean they agree with the upper 1% and
not even the upper 1% the upper 1% of

1276
01:16:05,461 --> 01:16:08,460
the 1% that doesn't even show up,
you know?

1277
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:09,630
Okay.

1278
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,260
There's a lot of,

1279
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,930
remember all the blue blood money and
everybody kind of knew how much money they

1280
01:16:12,931 --> 01:16:17,010
had and now they all say that, oh
they gave away a lot. You know,

1281
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:20,880
the rocker fellows or you know, they're,
they're fortunate is, and what it's worth,

1282
01:16:20,881 --> 01:16:25,680
they use to be the Vanderbilts that are
only worth like $75 million. Now. I mean,

1283
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,514
that's,
I don't know,

1284
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:30,090
there's all these stories out there that
there's families that are so fucking

1285
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:34,080
big and powerful. They are above any sort
of borders and they fucking, you know,

1286
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,090
when they traveled by yacht,
it's only like,

1287
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:39,060
it's like their little navy and they just,

1288
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,850
I love conspiracy theory
and they just float around.

1289
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:46,080
They pull up to the dock and the comp
countries just come out and give them bags

1290
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:49,860
of gold and then they just disappear.
It's like waterworld except you know,

1291
01:16:49,861 --> 01:16:52,620
without the, uh, you know,

1292
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:56,250
I don't know if they still have all the
amenities cause the world hasn't flooded

1293
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:59,160
over yet. Does that make
any sense? You know,

1294
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:01,290
I think that's as good
a spot to stop sending.

1295
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:08,480
Uh, my apologies for a fucking
up the podcast this week. Um,

1296
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:14,450
you guys have a nice couple of fucking
days and can I end on some more drum nerd

1297
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:18,870
shit. I told you my, uh, drum
teachers taking me through, um,

1298
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,100
that sting album,
10 summers tales of,

1299
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:26,450
of that has the great Vinnie call Uda on
it and how they played in all these odd

1300
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:26,781
times,

1301
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:30,920
but they wanted to imply for four time
and he finally taught me on that seven

1302
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:34,160
days, which is in five, which I love. Uh,

1303
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:36,260
he finally wrote out what he
was doing on the high hat,

1304
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:39,920
which is basically he's playing
that it's four, four against five.

1305
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,140
He's playing five underneath,

1306
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:45,260
but he's implying four in the high yet
and a off to all these fucking years of

1307
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:47,060
trying to figure out how to do it.
He finally,

1308
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:51,770
he just wrote out one line of it
and now it makes sense. Um, to me,

1309
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:54,200
and it's basically on the high hat.

1310
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:59,660
I just still count and five,
but you just count,

1311
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,430
you know, underneath it. If
you listen to what you're
counting. One, two, three, four,

1312
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:09,380
five, one, two, three, four, five.
[inaudible]. One Dent that fucking shit.

1313
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,670
But on top,

1314
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:15,290
how it works for me is you just,
you just,

1315
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:20,180
I still counted five. I
just, you're thrown in. He
counted is like eighth notes.

1316
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:25,181
So one and two and three and four and
five and one and two and three and four

1317
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:28,970
and five.
And the first time through Ux sent one,

1318
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:33,500
three and five and the second time
through you accent too in four.

1319
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:37,310
Try that. That's the way I've
been doing it. Now granted,

1320
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,590
this is massively filtered down

1321
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:47,090
from a professional drummer to a standup
comedian who cannot read out loud.

1322
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:52,310
Um, all right, that's it. Go fuck
yourselves. I'll talk to you on Thursday.

1323
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:53,270
L check yet.
