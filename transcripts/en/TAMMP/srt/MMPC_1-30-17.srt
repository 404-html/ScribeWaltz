1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,183
Hmm.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,500
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:05,680
It's bill burr and it is time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:10,060
January 30th, 2017 what's
going on? How are Ya?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,800
Um, as you can tell by my, my
little slightly more relaxed tone,

6
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,820
my kid's asleep downstairs so
I, I can't scream. I can't yell,

7
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,740
I can't rant and rave.
Oh, I can do those things,

8
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:25,160
but I have to do it in
a controlled manner. Um,

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,410
that's what I have to
do, you know, cause the,

10
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,550
the dynamics of the house changed a little
bit and I know what you think is so,

11
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:32,500
Bill, does that mean the dynamic
is you'll probably catch,

12
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:35,590
is going to change a little bit? Yeah,
just a little bit, but nothing crazy.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,380
You know,
like listen to me right now,

14
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:41,860
you would have no idea that right before
I got on this podcast, I just meditated.

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,040
I meditated for 10 minutes,
I shut it down.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,500
Let's focus on the sounds in the room now.

17
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:51,970
Gently let those go away and focus on
your breathing. I did that 10 minutes.

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,590
I guess it's helping me out.
Um, you know, I had one,

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,680
one meltdown this week.

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,160
I was trying to figure out how to put
the fucking car seat into the car and I

21
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:04,990
swear to God, dude, like the level,

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,510
the level that they have overdesigned
those things is insane. I swear to God,

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,820
I hope auto racing,

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,300
they should put those fucking drivers
and car seats and then nothing would ever

25
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:19,810
happen to them. I couldn't figure out
how to get this effing thing in there.

26
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,580
And I did I just say Effient. Yeah.
I'm trying to learn how to, uh,

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,950
the kids influence.
It's coming in.

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,110
I've been cracking me up
by doing it going, hey,

29
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:35,290
quit talking s and just, you know,
abbreviate incarceration to her.

30
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,020
It's hilarious because all she's
ever heard we do is just, you know,

31
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,420
curse my brains out.

32
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,180
And I was making a laugh last night
because we were laying in bed when we

33
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,160
watching wheel of fortune with
a beautiful baby between us.

34
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,900
And I was just doing what I always do.

35
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:54,610
I was trashing all the contestants
and all and everything on there.

36
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:57,100
Read, uh, you know,

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,670
I to say about the wheel of fortune,
man,

38
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,300
dead dare fucking some
stingy cons on that show.

39
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,650
When I give it comes down to the,
to the Dang whoever that one of the three,

40
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:13,420
that one when they go over and then you
try to win some big money to get him for

41
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:17,660
one big hit for like 50 or 60
grand, those puzzles, they,

42
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:22,180
they're practically impossible.
And the clues throw you off.

43
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,630
Okay.

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,330
They had one,
they said a phrase,

45
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,690
okay,

46
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,510
they go, this is a phrase, we'll give you
these letters. And of course, you know,

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,070
none of them show up. Right? Then you
pick some in a few of those show up.

48
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,940
This was the phrase,
our first voyage.

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,270
Okay.

50
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,340
That's a phrase.
I mean technically it's a phrase,

51
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:45,410
but if you're going to say it's a
phrase that should be something like,

52
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,780
like to me a phrase,
it's somewhere between,

53
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,780
you know, an expression and a, you know,

54
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:59,080
just some random shit.
Right? That's a phrase.

55
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,950
Yeah.

56
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,170
Does that make any sense? Like
an expression, a, a, you know,

57
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,060
fucking stitch in time saves nine. Is
that an expression? Instead of Soliloquy.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,330
I don't know what that is. Okay.
But I know that's not a phrase,

59
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,660
that's something else, but I don't know
what that is. But a phrase is Jared,

60
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,430
some calm eight check please.

61
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,220
Yeah.

62
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,620
You know, don't fucking touch that. I
don't know. I can't think of a good one.

63
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,630
But you know what I mean?
Our first voyage is afraid.

64
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,630
Technically it's a phrase Pat Sajak.

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,570
I never realized they,
they always fuck the person over.

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,700
They tried to limit the r s and t's in
it because they know everybody's gonna.

67
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,340
Okay.

68
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,310
Gonna guess those ones, I don't know.
And he always pulls the car down so,

69
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,550
and they give you like eight seconds
to solve it. You don't get it in.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,420
Then he always pulls out some
ridiculous amount of money. Oh,

71
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,270
that was for going to be for 90 grand.
Very stingy.

72
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,580
But what do you expect?
Cause I remember back in the day they are,

73
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,920
when they had the shittiest
prizes on that show,

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,600
it's almost like they didn't want
you to be happy when you left.

75
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,540
So as much as I'm a joy in that show,
I don't know.

76
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,930
I'm starting to just getting ready
to move on to a new game show.

77
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,860
Um,
Jesus Christ in my fucking tired.

78
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,550
I don't know how the hell I'm
going to get through this hour. Um,

79
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,830
cause then I got to run over.
I'm doing Conan O'brien tonight.

80
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:19,460
Everybody please tune in to hide my
standup special that comes out tomorrow on

81
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:24,380
Netflix, my fifth one called walk your
way up. I know what you think of bill.

82
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:28,010
Why don't you call it walk your way
out. Well, if you'll watch the show,

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,870
you'll understand how about
that. But if you guys could,
um, you know, social media,

84
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,050
the whole thing up and uh,

85
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,200
just let people know to check the
thing out so the dream continues. Um,

86
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:44,150
I would really appreciate it. Um,
I'm very proud of this one. I hope,

87
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,790
I hope you guys like it too.

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,700
I had a great time doing it and we shot
at this beautiful venue called the Ryman,

89
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,190
which is the original place where
they shut the grand ole Opry.

90
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,230
Then a couple of floorboards
left from the original,

91
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,230
um, stage. So when you walk on those,

92
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:04,700
those are the same ones that
Elvis Johnny Cash. Yeah.

93
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,470
You know a bunch of other white guys and
fucking Minnie Pearl who walked down.

94
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,304
Hank Williams,

95
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,600
Hank Williams jr I acquire
you have Jeremy and jr

96
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,990
um, I told you guys I've got
satellite radio finally in my car,

97
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,490
if they're all those years of being on it,

98
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,540
on the opie and Anthony show way
back in the day, XM satellite radio,

99
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,280
way back in the day. I never had it and
I didn't realize how fucking great it is.

100
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:31,560
And I've actually gotten a little bit
into country music, but it's sad. Um,

101
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,530
Willie Nelson roadhouse channel.
I like the old stuff and the new shit.

102
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,920
I just don't fucking, I
just don't, I don't get it.

103
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,320
I'm not into it at all.
It's gotta be somebody.

104
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:45,680
There's no fucking way you can have
an entire genre of music and not have

105
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:48,950
anybody today doing it. Well, um,

106
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,870
but who knows. So I haven't
done shit this week. People,

107
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't have any jokes. I don't even
know what the fuck to talk to you about.

108
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,580
Been watching Celtics and Bruins Shit.
I was so tired the other day,

109
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,840
my daughter was crying.
Um, my wife was holding my,

110
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,180
my daughter and I walked over
with the pacifier to try to

111
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,790
quiet the kid. And I literally walked up
and tried to put it in my, my, my, uh,

112
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,750
my wife's mouth. She laughed thinking
I was fucking around when I was like,

113
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,830
oh sorry.
Sorry.

114
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,000
Because when I walked over she was
talking and I'll always thinking was make

115
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:27,110
that noise stop. And I tried
to stick it in her mouth. Um,

116
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,611
so anyways,

117
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:32,060
so I'm starting to understand why
so many parents are so are so conti.

118
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,590
Yeah.

119
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,050
To people who either don't have kids
or they're about to have kids and they,

120
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,770
they, I dunno if they're not
nice people, they really aren't.

121
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:45,720
And I'm gonna try not to be that person.
I'm not going to resent someone who,

122
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,370
who doesn't have kids because they
have free time that I no longer have.

123
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,990
That's such a fucking,
I dunno,

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,850
it's a weird thing,
you know,

125
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:58,120
when you have a kid cause you get to
experience this new level of love and then

126
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:00,790
you also get to see this other
side of people just like, ah,

127
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,840
they would just fucking,
I dunno. I don't know.

128
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,760
I ran into yet another person. I'm like,
dude, you can have no free time either.

129
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,220
I have no freak type of pocket door.

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I went to a drum lessons Saturday and I
went to the Nhl all star game on Sunday.

131
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,800
You know what the rest of my time was
fucking, you know, daily with the kid,

132
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,330
but I'm still doing shit.

133
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,803
Yeah.

134
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,010
You know what's up?
I think a lot of fucking people,

135
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:29,330
they didn't do shit before they had a kid.
They don't have a fucking hobby.

136
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,910
They don't have anything that they're
passionate about. I don't know what it is,

137
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,960
but they're miserable. Cons.
I got to get away from him.

138
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,870
You know, I just had a buddy of
mine say, hey, congratulations. I,

139
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:44,600
I'm thinking about having
a kid, you know, next year.

140
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,790
I just said, that's great. It's your
experience. Don't talk to parents.

141
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,320
They're not saying people,
myself included, just, you
know, it's going to be great.

142
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,350
Have a good time. Be Nice if people did
that. Huh? But why would you do that?

143
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,800
Why would you do that when you can't get
somebody you're fucking resentment out

144
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,590
on a completely innocent person.

145
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,260
When I'm going to start bitching about
this shit, uh, I think I've made my point.

146
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:15,450
So anyways, I'm selling more
shit. Oh, I'm selling more shit.

147
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:18,650
Everything's on the chopping block.
Um,

148
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,960
okay.

149
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,580
I got that John Bonham drum kit that
I have that 71 Ludwig green sparkle.

150
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:27,940
And I'm actually toying with the idea
of selling that fucking thing because I,

151
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,783
um,

152
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,770
okay.

153
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,420
It's just too fucking big for me. It's
not comfortable playing it. The symbols.

154
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:38,530
I don't even like the sound of
them. It's not my sound. And I did,

155
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,590
I did the stupid fucking thing that every
weekend warrior want to be hobbyists

156
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:48,880
musician does.
I'm going to buy Eddie van Halen Guitar.

157
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,300
Then I'll play like Eddie
van Halen. No, you won't.

158
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,450
You'll just be a dose with an Eddie
Halen Guitar who is an Eddie van Halen.

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,950
So I made that mistake. So I'm
actually thinking about, um,

160
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,950
actually I toyed with the idea,
but then I,

161
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,890
I went in and I looked at the
drums and it's so beautiful.

162
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,970
I don't know if I can fucking
do it, but, um, I dunno.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I would rather get a drum kit that may
be set up for fucking how I'm built.

164
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,021
I swear to God,

165
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:24,021
I played that thing out on the comedy jam
twice and I to go from the rack Tom to

166
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,970
the floor,
Tom said 26 inch bass drum.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,560
It's so you gotta take like a taxi to go
from the rack or just the way I'm built.

168
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,310
So to get to the fucking,
from the rack to the floor,

169
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:39,450
I always go via the snare just to give
me that extra split second just to get

170
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,400
over the fucking thing.

171
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,180
I don't know how this Barnum guy did it,
but you know, it's not working for me. So,

172
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,840
um, I'm thinking of
getting rid of that and uh,

173
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,500
and going out and buy maybe like a Gretsch
or something like that with like a 22

174
00:09:55,501 --> 00:10:00,270
inch kick instead of a 26 and have a 14
inch floor Thomas that I have and that

175
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:00,961
has a rack.
Tom,

176
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,800
I think that I always like the 14th floor
I noticed is some fucking nerdy drum

177
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,750
shit.
But um,

178
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,130
yeah I think I want to do that and
get them out of the fucking house.

179
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:14,490
I'll fuck a final fucking studio space
for like a couple hundred bucks a month.

180
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,850
Now I just have a brand new kit cause
that's the only thing that stops me from

181
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,160
setting that thing up cause it's
a vintage kid. I'm like Oh my God,

182
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,730
when somebody steals it,
it's irreplaceable. But
if I buy a brand new one,

183
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,560
brand new symbols, get a little bit
insurance, you know, 50 bucks a month,

184
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,590
I walk in there one day somebody steals
it adds just fucking get another one.

185
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,060
Cause there's still making them,

186
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,290
I'm trying to get out of their disease
of like an old shit. I love old shit.

187
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,010
But then you get it and it just becomes
this fucking thing when it breaks.

188
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,220
Oh my God, how the fuck am I going
to try and find the parts for it?

189
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,120
They come up on my body guard
and the big dude from, uh,

190
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,520
from m power.

191
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:53,550
What is your major malfunction with the
fuck was that called full metal jacket?

192
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,610
Remember that guy? He played the, uh,

193
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:00,810
the dude who protect the kid
from meatballs anyways, he
had a fucking motorcycle.

194
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:03,400
There was some little piece of the
carburetor, they couldn't fucking fight.

195
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,080
So of course because it's a
Hollywood movie, you know,

196
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,330
because it's a Hollywood movie,
you know,

197
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:12,390
they go into a junk yard and the
little nerdy kid finds it, you know,

198
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,160
and then that's they're
the little bonding moment.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,280
I would tell you guys how much
I hate that when I watch, um,

200
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,670
TVs and movies, TVS, TV shows and movies.

201
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:28,671
I hate the fucking convenience of
how everything fucking works out.

202
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,560
Um,
I also,

203
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:36,561
like two nights ago I was doing stand
up at the comedy store and I was talking

204
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,240
shit about being a white dude.
You know,

205
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,410
cause it's funny cause you're
not allowed to do it. You know,

206
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,330
every other group of people could
be proud of their accomplishments.

207
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:49,080
But we can't wait to this camp because
of all the horrific shit that we've done.

208
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:52,610
Wipes out any sort of accomplishment.
So jokingly saying like, you know,

209
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,600
we did this as a dad, we went to the
moon and then this woman yells out here,

210
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,790
figures go see hidden figures.

211
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,410
I'm just saying,
you know,

212
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,770
I cannot stand people that go see a
Hollywood movie and think that they just

213
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,100
read a history book.

214
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,890
It's, it's just fucking like, and
then they think they're informed.

215
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,480
It's like you're not informed. You watched
a movie. I told you guys that shit.

216
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:21,670
Do you know their movie sully?
When that thing came out,

217
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:23,500
they wanted to make the copilot

218
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,900
an alcoholic just to raise the stakes.

219
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,430
And the real guy who's really alive and
still flies had to like threatened to

220
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:35,880
sue or something. It'd be like, guys, he
can't fucking put that out there about me.

221
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,470
I'm not an alcoholic.
I have a career in commercial aviation.

222
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,250
You can't start floating it out to the
world, then I'm a fucking alcoholic.

223
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:45,750
And then they were like, oh, all right.

224
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,030
So that's all I'm saying.
Okay.

225
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm not saying that there weren't some
people doing some math and all that.

226
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:57,380
Just don't fucking, my only thing
about that, this is myself included,

227
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:59,600
don't fucking come after
me when you've never,

228
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:02,600
you never heard of those people and
all you did was go out and go see the

229
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,180
fucking movie and start
coming to me like you,

230
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,220
like you went to fucking graduate school.
So I had formed with that.

231
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,860
I probably went too hard. You know, I
brought up that guy who fucking, you know,

232
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,670
that dude who figured out that
when you're out in outer space,

233
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,050
then if you perspire that your,

234
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:21,350
your sweat would boil and you would
literally boil and your own sweat.

235
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,080
So that his space suit was
literally like a giant radiator.

236
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,970
Some dude figured out
that that would happen.

237
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,490
Figured out that that would fucking
happen before we even went out there.

238
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,820
You know? Where's that guy's movie? Huh?

239
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,190
Well,
where is it?

240
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,170
Oh, Jesus Christ. What else? Um, so
yes, I went to the NHL All star game.

241
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,480
Um,
three on three is crazy format.

242
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,800
I think you know that going in the right
direction because everybody knows that

243
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:58,600
all star games are mind numbingly boring.
The baseball ones pretty good.

244
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,720
Basically I would say baseball's
the best all star game.

245
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,010
The NBA All star Game I guess
is sort of fun cause everyone,

246
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,930
nobody is going to play d and
everybody's going to dunk.

247
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,860
So it's a little interesting.
But I'd say the baseball wants the best.

248
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:16,150
So the NHL is trying to figure out,
you know, a format on how to make,

249
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:19,120
there's competitive and
people to give a shit.

250
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,590
So they take like all four
divisions and I can only,

251
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,840
I didn't even understand the format.
He played like five minutes,

252
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,900
then you played another five minutes and
then two other divisions came out and

253
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,450
you played five and five
and then the winter,

254
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,170
those two then played in the finals.
I don't know how to fucking thing worked.

255
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,410
Um, where'd you play?
Two 10 minute periods.

256
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,390
I was at the game and I couldn't figure
out what was going on. And it was,

257
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,770
it was unbelievably quiet
when he was in there.

258
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,680
They should have played the
first five minutes, five on five

259
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,040
and then the next one, you know
something. There's no way to make an all

260
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,540
star game exciting. That's just
basically it. Cause you know what though,

261
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,150
they just have too much to loose back.

262
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:01,340
I'd be no sub at Ben when they
all start games are great.

263
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:05,540
We're back in the day when professional
athletes also had like off season,

264
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,374
day jobs.

265
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,410
Yeah.

266
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,880
Like he played for the Cleveland browns
from September till the end of December.

267
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:15,460
And then the rest of the year
you were like pouring concrete.

268
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,690
Like those lunatics, they
gotten shaped by, you know,

269
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:24,250
being the Jackhammer guy on a road crew.
Um,

270
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,430
I bet then then they had some good games
because then there was probably the

271
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:31,150
pride of like our conferences better
than your conference and Blah Blah Blah

272
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,880
Blah Blah. But uh, there's just
too much money at stake. But, um,

273
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,720
it was still fun to go down there and
see all that type of stuff. But, um,

274
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,730
and that's was part of my nerd,
you know,

275
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,960
fandom thing that I have.

276
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,040
I've now been to every all star
game except for the baseball one.

277
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,430
So now of course with my fucking OCD,
I have to,

278
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:53,140
I don't even know what I'm going for.

279
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:54,920
Okay.

280
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,390
Going to all of these fucking games
at this point. But um, I dunno,

281
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,390
you know what's cool about it is it
keeps me going to different places.

282
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,980
Okay.

283
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,960
You know, cause at some point
I want to go to that. Uh,

284
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:09,380
I've been to one golfing major in,
in order to go to all four.

285
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,330
The first three are not difficult. Well
the US Open and the PGA or not difficult.

286
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:18,260
You can get fucking Texas. The fucking us
open at golf. I mean they just animals.

287
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,350
Yeah. When you watch that golf tournament
and you hear those people screaming and

288
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:25,150
yelling,
it sounds like the third show.

289
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,970
It's some shit fucking comedy
club on a Saturday night,

290
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,140
just a bunch of drunks and then I can a
police anybody cause they want to make

291
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:35,270
their money off selling a booze.
Um,

292
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,580
the masters is the hard one
because they don't sell tickets.

293
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,970
And here's a heads up on that.
The first time I did it, you have,

294
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,380
you get like these badges that are given
to the members and they're not supposed

295
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,460
to sell them, but they all
do. And everybody kind of
looks the other way, right?

296
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,740
So then you go to these
brokers that have these badges,

297
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:56,950
you pay way too much fucking money
for them and you show up at somebody's

298
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,750
fucking house.
This is what happened to me.

299
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,270
Okay.

300
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,580
And, uh, the first time I did it,
I went with two people and we,

301
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:07,920
we lucked out and we got the
badges mean Versie we went in 2010.

302
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,080
Then a few years later we went to go
again and I brought five fucking people to

303
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:15,040
the same people's house and they said,
ah,

304
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,960
there was a mix up with the badges and
then the lady who was going to pay us

305
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:23,940
just fucking goes, I'll be right back to
go get them. And She just fucking left.

306
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,300
And that's the last time we saw.

307
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,580
And then the husband just waited
us out on the front yard and uh,

308
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,370
and I was just out the money and
they completely fucked us over

309
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,170
and I lost a ton of money as
did a number of other people.

310
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,610
And we were talking
about trying to remember,

311
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:43,950
we were standing outside the
house just waiting for them.

312
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,110
The neighbors came walking by going like,

313
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:49,860
God or they screw you out of the badges.
Yeah, they did that a few before. And,

314
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,290
um,
you know,

315
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,610
just started having fantasies
about burning down their
fucking house and all of

316
00:17:56,611 --> 00:18:01,290
that type of shit. And then, um, I dunno,
I just Kinda let it go. And you know,

317
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,100
it's funny
is every time I let it go,

318
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,900
like fully just let it go
and just be like, you know
what, I did get to go to it.

319
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,530
Part of buying scalp tickets is every
once a while you get fucked over.

320
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:16,580
It happened me at a ravens game one time.
Um,

321
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,590
I ended up buying some tickets that were
stolen season tickets and they kicked

322
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,600
me out of the fucking stadium and then
I had to buy another pair of scalp

323
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,990
tickets to get back in.
I mean it's, it happens,

324
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,340
but what's funny about that?
Um,

325
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,350
okay,

326
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,980
the one I get fucked over at the,
uh, the masters and I bought,

327
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,830
I bought five of those fucking things.
So I was out a lot of money.

328
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,750
What was funny about that is every time
I go to let it go,

329
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:47,270
cause I remember him saying, the guy said,
dude, if you don't give him money back,

330
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm going to suit. I'm going to sue you
and blah, blah, said all this stuff.

331
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:54,400
And then the guy, little
Elmer Fudd looking fucking
dude, just get who you are.

332
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,410
You near Gichon mood
back in with his fucking,

333
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,760
there's other fucking
fat. Fuck. I was going,

334
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:03,911
well,

335
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:06,400
well how much money you got your pocket
from the other ones give me that money

336
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,420
and he gives you ain't give me that money.
Come get it. Let's see. You try, right?

337
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:15,421
It was like one of those moments and
there was like five of us and we could all

338
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:18,210
beat the shit out of the guy.
But you know what's gonna Happen?

339
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,600
You're gonna beat the shit out of him.
Okay,

340
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,420
then we're not going to get them money.
We're going to go to jail.

341
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,020
They're going to sue us for assault.
There's just no way to win.

342
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:30,570
The only way to win a fight,
once she passed like high scorch,

343
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,740
once you become an adult,

344
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,690
the only way to win a fucking fight is
you have no money and you have nothing to

345
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,940
lose and you're homeless.

346
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,050
That's the only way to win it because
then you're going to get arrested and

347
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,840
you're going to go to jail and at least
now you've got a place to stay for the

348
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,580
night,
get some meals.

349
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,850
You don't have to beg for food other
than that you're going to fucking loose.

350
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Cause I sat there and kept trying
to do the math going how the fuck,

351
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,030
you know,
having those violent things and you know,

352
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,700
I'm sure there's a fucking
tire iron in the car.

353
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:06,320
If I smashed both these guys over
the fucking heads. What's APP,

354
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,250
which I'm not going to do. I've never
done anything even remotely that violent,

355
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,340
but you're so fucking mad.
Where are you getting fucked out of money?

356
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:16,240
You start having these fantasies and
just cause it makes you feel better.

357
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,450
I'm just thinking of caving in
the side of their fucking heads.

358
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,620
I just kept trying to do the math on how
we would get away and you just can't do

359
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,140
it anymore. You know, back
in the day you could do that.

360
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:31,020
You could jump on your horse and fucking
right away it was over. You know,

361
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,720
it wasn't some minor with the cell phone
fucking camera and you've horse had a

362
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:39,650
license plate on his fucking tail and
you were screwed. You had done, um,

363
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,421
you know,

364
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:45,200
somebody following you what the fucking
drone and there was just no way. Um,

365
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,110
there was no to do it other than

366
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,850
just take my loss and then I
was going to cook, quadruple it.

367
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,090
And um, and God knows what else, you know,

368
00:20:56,091 --> 00:21:00,740
and the kind of people that would do
to us what they did to us. I was like,

369
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:03,590
what would they do in a court of law if
I was actually guilty of doing something

370
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:07,060
to them? You know what I mean? So
I let go of it. I said, fuck it.

371
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,810
It's a loss. Who gives a
shit? We'll make it up.

372
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,570
We'll come back at some other
time. We'll go, go again. Fuck it.

373
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,810
And every time I would go to let go
of it, you know, start to let go of,

374
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,740
would start to let go of it.
Fucking Paul Versey. Okay.

375
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,620
The half Sicilian part of him who can
never forget anything like that would call

376
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,570
me up.
And just get me fucking off.

377
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,960
He kept me all riled up
again. I'd be like, Paul,

378
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,771
you've got to stop doing.

379
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:41,540
Then he would sit there calling
me up like he's Sammy the bull.

380
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,290
If Sammy didn't fucking sell out
and I'm fucking the other guy there,

381
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,280
what does it, what are the Teflon
don there almost sit Giuliani,

382
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,070
um, Gotti, John Gotti,

383
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,860
and he would call me up just telling me
what he was going to do to that guy's

384
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:55,694
house.

385
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,110
And of course he did door, hey, he's
not going to do it. He's married,

386
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:03,980
he's got two kids.

387
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:07,700
But he would call it a call me up
and I would get me going again.

388
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,730
He did this for fucking years
now it's just a joke now.

389
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,760
It's just like once a year he'll
call me up and be like, hey dude,

390
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,580
not for nothing. But I thought about
this again the other day. I was thinking,

391
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:24,581
not even fucking saying anything to you
and just going down there and then just

392
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:28,530
calling you up and being like, hey bill,
it's done. It's done. And I go, yeah.

393
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:29,251
And right there,
right.

394
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,950
That you'd call me up and then
you'd say something over the phone.

395
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,070
And because it's not illegal now to listen
to people's phone calls right there,

396
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:38,010
we would get caught. You have to
weed, you would have to do, Paul is,

397
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:41,220
you would have to go down and do it.
Know that you did it

398
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,310
and then not say anything to me ever
until one day maybe we were out to fucking

399
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:48,260
see in international waters.

400
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,220
And then even then we'd have to go to
back to the back of the boat when the

401
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:55,580
engines were on. You'd have to put
your hand over your fucking mouth,

402
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,380
like fucking Joe Pesci and Deniro and
casino. And then you could tell me,

403
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:05,150
oh by the way, I burned down that
guy's fucking house. MMM. So many.

404
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,890
I mean, how the fuck I
got onto that, that store.

405
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:09,520
I don't think I ever told you guys that
story cause I was so fucking mad about

406
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,710
it for years. Um, oh,

407
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:13,780
I know what I'm talking about is just
talking about going to all these different

408
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:17,620
games. Um, so be beware of that.

409
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:20,320
If you ever go to the masters,
unless you have a really good hook up,

410
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,250
if you just going to buy from a a
regular person, try to keep it at two.

411
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,230
Because what happened,

412
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:31,010
because we were a group of five and
they didn't have enough badges, uh,

413
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,770
they decided like,

414
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:36,490
we're going to have one group fucking
pissed at us rather than having,

415
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,210
you know, you know, three groups
of two fucking pissed off guy.

416
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,390
I forget how many we had. It was just
like, all right, we're just gonna have,

417
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,300
this is one group of people that will
bitch as opposed to having like, oh yeah,

418
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,540
they fucked me over. They fucked
my group. They thought my groups.

419
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:53,420
I was just just as complainant. Actually,
I think there was one other couple to,

420
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,393
I dunno,

421
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,650
I got to stop talking about it cause
it's gonna give me fucking mad again.

422
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:58,550
Those goddamn cuts

423
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,100
you nail.
You murdered.

424
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,710
Oh God. Oh, fucking elbow fund.

425
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:07,640
Any other the fat fuck redneck,
this stupid orange shirt.

426
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:11,900
I still remember these big guy.
He has his big fucking beer belly.

427
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,570
Oh my God.
Uh,

428
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,680
the beautiful sound of a bat
hitting all that flesh. Oh,

429
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:21,050
that would have been to heaven.
But you know,

430
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,230
that's not what you're supposed to
do as an adult. And who's can, no,

431
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,630
I've never done that to anybody.
And I would have been like,

432
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,000
I would have alligator armed it and
I just would have made them mad.

433
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,920
Then he would have smothered
me with all that fucking

434
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,600
hillbilly fat and I would've lost

435
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,910
and it would have been out the money
that I'd be leaving with grass stains all

436
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:43,380
over myself. Uh, it would have been
horrible. All right. Sherry's berries.

437
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,553
Barry

438

for your love, like no other.

439
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,440
Oh, that's right. Valentine's Day's coming
up. I'm so fucking sleepy to my kid.

440
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:57,820
Last night got up, uh, I started
to fall asleep around midnight.

441
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,260
She got up at, I get up at 1257, one 10,

442
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,060
two [inaudible] three or something.
Then she went to four 30,

443
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:09,400
which was unbelievable.
Just get that extra 30 minutes.

444
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:12,100
Then she went to six
and for whatever reason,

445
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,340
she sleeps from like 6:00 AM
to like nine or like nine 30.

446
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,710
And I just know at that six o'clock one
that when I change their diaper and I

447
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:26,950
get her all settled down again, that I
can actually just think it's, it's fine.

448
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:28,450
That's where the podcast is.
A little late here.

449
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,770
I thank God I'm a standup comedian.
Okay, you people that actually have jobs,

450
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:36,790
we have to fucking get up at eight
30 in the God damn morning to go dry.

451
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:37,750
I don't know how you just don't,

452
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:40,250
not off in traffic and drive
into a fucking guard rail.

Valentine. Everybody has two arms,

457
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:56,970
two legs and a head this year.

458

461
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:14,520
You know why? Because we have
a kid who was eight days old.

462
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:17,330
She still let me go to the NHL All
star game. How about like that?

463
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,940
What quirks do you love?
Um, oh, I don't know.

the food or the fridge and putting

your neck that you feel your belt being

undone? Oh, this is going to

604
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,330
let's get into some of
the reads for this week.

605
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,370
I might come up a little short for my
usual hour everybody cause I got the cars

606
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:42,200
coming at noon. No, Billy has
not fucking done anything yet.

607
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:45,140
I got to get ready to do this
fucking show. Um, all right.

608
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,440
Oh, you know what? I didn't bring
up. I've been watching of course,

609
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:50,070
been watching him.

610
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,730
The Celtics and the Bruins and all that
Bruins had a big victory against the

611
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:57,990
penguins before the all star break.
Granted,

612
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:01,830
Malkin wasn't playing, but it was still,
we had played a great game and uh,

613
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:03,990
I have to go down to nothing,
if I remember correctly.

614
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:08,400
And then the Celtics had been playing
great and a big win against the bucks.

615
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,430
Um,
the fuck did they beat right before that?

616
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,160
I watched like every one
of them I really enjoy.

617
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:18,670
I can't believe I'm back into NBA
hoop. Um, okay, let me get to, um,

618
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,790
let's get to some of the reeds
here for this week. Uh, oh,

619
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:28,270
Superbowls celebrations there.
Billy bloodhound after.

620
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,060
Don't ever tell you guys how
much I love a bloodhound. Ah,

621
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,670
the fuck that amount of dogs
that I fucking love. But
I love that dog. You know,

622
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,240
they just got that chilling out vibe.

623
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,510
Any you gotta love a house cause all
you have to do is go and they do it with

624
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,310
you. That's it. That's all I need.

625
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,930
That's all I was looking for this
Valentine's Day. Okay ladies,

626
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:56,550
if you really love your husband or
your boyfriend, right? Just get,

627
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,800
get them a bloodhound.
Do you know?

628
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,230
And then you can be as crazy
as you want to fucking be.

629
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:04,170
And all he has to do is just every once
in a while be hanging out with his dog

630
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:08,940
when you're not around, you know, he
just looks over him. Hey Buddy, buddy.

631
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,353
Right.

632
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,960
It does it with them and it
just makes you feel good.

633
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,470
Maybe it's just me. I don't know. I heard
you mentioned bloodhounds last week.

634
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,020
I know you're not looking
to get a dog anytime soon,

635
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,140
but when you do definitely
consider a bloodhound.

636
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,830
They're unbelievably unbelievable
with real young kids.

637
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,700
I've had to, uh, with
both my kids. Anyways,

638
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:37,500
my question is if you ever have been to
a Superbowl that's they're great with

639
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:42,060
kids. That's good to know. Um, by the
way, I keep getting updates with cleo.

640
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:45,660
She's doing great. She's loving her new
family and everything's awesome with her.

641
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,523
And uh,

642
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,300
I might do a show at some point in the
vicinity of the new people that have the

643
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:54,870
dog just to visit and say hello.
I Dunno if I should do that or not.

644
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:57,940
I don't know if it'll
fuck the dog up or a,

645
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,690
I feel just make me sad all over
again. I don't know what, but I still,

646
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:03,030
you know what the fuck
I just look at like,

647
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:07,300
that's one of my kids and she's gone off
to college and every once in a while I

648
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:09,690
check in. How about that?
Anyways, my question is,

649
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,740
have you ever been to a super bowl
or hung around for the week before?

650
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,460
Seeing what all the action is like?
Uh,

651
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,940
my friend asked me if I wanted to go this
year, but I'd rather watch it at home.

652
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:25,380
I like to watch sports alone. Loved
you. One cowherd. Go pats. Um,

653
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,510
all right, here's the deal.
Uh, I have been to two bowls.

654
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,060
I went to the, uh, the Patriots when
we played the Green Bay packers.

655
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,280
Remember that?
And Brett fat

656
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,860
fucking through that touchdown pass and
then took his helmet off and ran like

657
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,810
half the fucking football field.

658
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,970
Cause his agent told him to do that and
give us a big astronauts smile when you

659
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,050
do it right.

660
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,803
MMM.

661
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,280
That was cool. Just to be like the
first time you go to a super bowl,

662
00:37:58,281 --> 00:37:59,600
if you ever lucky enough to go to one,

663
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,610
there is that thing that you
can't believe you're right.

664
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:05,270
The thing that basically
most of the United States is
watching that you're there.

665
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,050
Um, and I remember going
down there, it was,

666
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:15,760
uh,
it was in New Orleans and,

667
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:19,090
uh, and it was just all the patriots
fans were a bunch of drunks.

668
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:22,480
And then of course the Wisconsin fans
who are the same level of drunks,

669
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:25,540
but there's just something about
Wisconsin, like the Midwest,

670
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:30,160
there's a certain level of common decency,
decency,

671
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:33,460
I don't know what it is.
I Dunno if they just don't go as hard.

672
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,070
It's weird times you see him though,

673
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,850
then they're more animals than east
coast people. But you know, it's, it's a,

674
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,970
it's an ugly thing, you know? Uh,

675
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,060
east coast sports fans were lunatics.

676
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:49,270
So we're all up there screaming and
yelling on one of those balconies.

677
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,070
Fucking hammered down on
Bourbon Street. Right. And, uh,

678
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,810
John Kerry walked by
and everybody was yelling that John Kay,

679
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:01,060
John Kay, what do you think about
the pages? Blah, blah, blah.

680
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,800
And he just looked up and he had
this big phony smile. Like, I,

681
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,030
this is like an act out. You're
not going to get it. But you know,

682
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,780
you know that stupid like old school,
like, you know, let's go get him.

683
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,470
And you liked sort of like do
the, the, you make a fist, right?

684
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,350
And You Kinda, you kinda
act like youth, you know,

685
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:20,880
maybe throwing a baseball to
home plate. You're like, yeah,

686
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:24,550
they kind of do one of those, well he
did it. He did it like slow motion.

687
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,660
He made the fist,

688
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:29,980
he paused and he just went and they
kind of throw it like that really slow.

689
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,540
It was so fucking weird.

690
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,750
He was so detached from his own body
and I'm convinced now after I saw Bill

691
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,070
Clinton do it, that they
just know people are, uh,

692
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,220
taking pictures of them so that they
don't even give a fuck about interacting

693
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:48,280
with you. It's all about what you look
like in the paper. That was that time.

694
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,890
I told you a long story,

695
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:54,550
but I ended up Bill Clinton
when he was still president.

696
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,770
This is pre getting impeached and all
that shit. He came down to Boston and uh,

697
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,870
one of my friends wanted to
go down and see the motorcade.

698
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,540
I didn't want to fucking go.
My buddy didn't want to go.

699
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,120
He convinces us to fucking go.
He's going to buy lunch three guy,

700
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,570
five fucking right. So we fucking
go down there. He's all excited.

701
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:13,870
He just wants to see the motorcade go
by cause he'd saw swatch so much of that

702
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,600
JFK shit. Um, you know,

703
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,270
he just wanted to see a motorcade
and that's like a big deal to see the

704
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,730
presidential motorcade. I can admit
that was pretty exciting to see.

705
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:26,140
So they start coming down the street and
right before they get to us, we're like,

706
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:27,250
finally,
here it comes.

707
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,890
He's going to see the motorcade drive
by then we get all fucking go home.

708
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:32,770
You can buy us lunch. Right.
Right before they got to us,

709
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,800
they made a right turn to go into this
alley right before they got to us,

710
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,240
like, you know, probably
like 50 yards up and like,

711
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,470
oh you gotta be fucking kidding me.

712
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,790
And this dude was so into like no
one politics. He was just going like,

713
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,560
oh don't worry, he's just going to
go in there. It's a woman's college.

714
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,640
He usually speaks on average
from 50 to 65 minutes.

715
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,960
I'll go run and get us some, you know,
a couple slices of pizza, whatever.

716
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,071
So we go fine.

717
00:40:57,071 --> 00:41:00,340
So he fucking takes off and we're standing
there and all of a sudden the secret

718
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:04,270
service starts walking down the street
telling everybody we were up against

719
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,940
those little police little sorts things.
Sounds get your hands up.

720
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:08,290
He ends up in the morning.

721
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:12,280
Kade starts driving w who's
walking down the street?

722
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:17,260
Fucking Bill Clinton with Ted Kennedy
and somebody else. Ted Kennedy was first.

723
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,470
I think I already told this story dude.
His fucking head,

724
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:23,440
I swear to God was the size
of like a fucking safe.

725
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,540
I've never seen a head that big of my
life. Like I literally went to like, yeah,

726
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,450
both your hands up so the secret service
could see your hand and it was just

727
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,900
sorta high fiving people.
Um,

728
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,550
can I say walk by remembering that Bill
Clinton comes by and every time like,

729
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,780
oh to President Bill Clinton
and he wasn't saying anything.

730
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,760
He just had both his hands up.

731
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:47,690
He was slowly walking and just
imagine smiling with your mouth open.

732
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,160
Like yeah, like you were doing
that. But your face was just frozen.

733
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,320
He was just walking past all of us doing
that and everybody was yelling to him.

734
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,740
Everybody was saying stuff and he
did not say anything to anybody.

735
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,480
He just had that Ah, fucking look
on this face with both his hands up.

736
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,350
He looked like a fucking crazy person.
But then the next day,

737
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:10,550
the front page of the paper,

738
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:13,120
you see the guy and he's on the
front page of paper like Ah,

739
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,900
and it looked like we were
all having a great time.

740
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,700
I thought there was something wrong with
them. Also, I will tell you right now,

741
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:23,600
dude, these softest fucking
hands of any guy ever,

742
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,480
ever, he has not done a fucking days
work of manual labor in his life,

743
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,680
baby stuff. Now that I have a
daughter, baby soft fucking hands.

744
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,560
That's how it gets the ladies.
That's what it is.

745
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:38,990
He puts one of those soft
baby hands on your shoulders.

746
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,430
It takes out a cigar and it
is game set match. So anyways,

747
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,100
he fucking does this shit.

748
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,500
Then they jumped in the car
and then they fucking leave.

749
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:54,610
Everybody's freaking out and then then
it's just over and people just start to

750
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:57,980
walk away and leave.
Okay.

751
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:01,340
All of this took less
than like 38 seconds.

752
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,613
Okay.

753
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,470
Because the secret service was not going
to have to present and exposed to the

754
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:11,090
public for that long. Um, so anyways,

755
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,840
he jumps in the car, they
leave everybody's like,
like high off of, Oh my God,

756
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:17,780
I shook the president's hand.
Hoe Pig was Ted Kennedy's head.

757
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,180
That takes about a minute for
people to be like, what the fuck?

758
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:25,181
And then people just start walking away
and then like 15 seconds after that,

759
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,290
my buddy comes walking up,

760
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:31,730
the dude who wanted to see all of it
and he just sees everybody has left.

761
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,250
I remember he was biting into a slice
of pizza and he kind of stopped his bike

762
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,510
and he just looks over and he
goes, I missed it, didn't I?

763
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,780
And I just looked at him and I felt bad.
I was like,

764
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,710
I shook his hand and he
goes, no, you didn't.

765
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,640
And then my buddy was a total pothead,
was galloping around sideways,

766
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:52,280
like in a circle, just screaming. I said,

767
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,800
ah, that was such a fucking
sad quiet ride home.

768
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,340
And we would try not to fucking laugh.

769
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,900
We just started laughing after awhile
and he just refused to believe it.

770
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:08,330
But the details we had,
he knew that it was fucking true.

771
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,790
And then the next day in the paper
he saw, cause we saying like, dude,

772
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:14,720
he wasn't saying anything. I'll
never forget that. He just was like,

773
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,070
ah,

774
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,030
but without like that said noise
he should have been making,

775
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,100
but he wasn't making that noise.

776
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:24,860
He just had his mouth open with his
fucking hands up in the next day.

777
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:28,880
In the paper though, he looked like
a champ. The man looked like a champ.

778
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:31,680
All right. Um, Jesus,
I was a long way to go.

779
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,260
What was I talking about the first
time I went to Superbowl? Yeah.

780
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:36,060
So we went to it and uh,

781
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,420
Bill Parcells fucked us over that year
cause that was his whole fucking stupid

782
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:42,270
thing like you will be cooked to do you
get a little bit below the groceries

783
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,190
because what's his face?

784
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,760
Robert Kraft overruled him and
said you should take Terry Glenn.

785
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,580
Okay.

786
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:54,140
And fucking bill Parcells ego
couldn't fucking handle that. Right.

787
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,310
And then he proceeds to tell the team
that he's leaving and then he put his

788
00:44:58,311 --> 00:45:01,310
fucking house up for sale before we even
played the Goddamn game was one of the

789
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,040
most selfish things. If
that's true, that's the no,

790
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:06,560
that's the room of what the fuck happened.
And then, you know what kills me?

791
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,230
He fucking goes to coach every place else.
He goes to coach.

792
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,370
Who does he bring along with them?
Terry Glenn.

793
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:13,250
Okay.

794
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,090
Unreal. Unreal. But whatever. Um,

795
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,260
let's plow ahead here. Uh Oh.
And then the second time I went,

796
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:26,261
I went to the Patriots versus the
ramps and we won that game obviously.

797
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,440
And uh, when it last second and
then I was just like, you know what,

798
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,840
every time the Patriots go,
I'm going to go to the super bowl.

799
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,750
So the next time we played, which was
either against the panthers or the eagles,

800
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:38,720
I can't remember. I
think the panthers, um,

801
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,820
I was going to go, but the next day, um,

802
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:49,210
I had like a six or 7:00 AM call
time to do that Chappelle show,

803
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,470
sketch a world series at dice

804
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,120
as the first time I met Charlene
Murphy and all those guys.

805
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,010
And so there was no way I could go and
I was, you know, it was all upset like,

806
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,620
Oh man, I'm going to miss the game and
blah blah blah. But I got to tell you

807
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:09,190
that Sunday night when the game was
over and in, the Patriots won, you know,

808
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:13,330
and I was sitting on my futon and my
fucking poor excuse for a one bedroom in

809
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:15,220
New York City.
I remember when the game was over.

810
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,930
I've watched it with a couple of
friends and they were leaving,

811
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,510
the game was over and I still had like
two grand in my pocket cause that's

812
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,660
basically back then what you were
looking at drop and like if you could get

813
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:25,991
tickets,

814
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,800
we'd like 1500 bucks plus the hotel and
all the travel and everything was gonna

815
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:30,790
be another 500 bucks.

816
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:35,830
The end of the game when I still had
two grand in my pocket, I was just like,

817
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:38,980
yeah, you know what? This is
better. I went, I saw him lose.

818
00:46:38,981 --> 00:46:40,780
I know what that feels like.
I went,

819
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:43,390
I saw him when I saw him when
their first one in the last play.

820
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,980
It's never going to get better than that.

821
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,920
I'll go again some day when I have a kid.
So some day my daughter,

822
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:51,640
if she wants to go, I'll take her.
But um, um, if you've never been,

823
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:55,630
I would definitely go to, it's
worth going one time. But you know,

824
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,760
I was kind of all set back.

825
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:00,100
This is back when I still just
had the regular square TV.

826
00:47:00,101 --> 00:47:03,010
Forget about the flat screen now with
the surround sound and all that shit.

827
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,470
I don't know. Plus, I don't know.

828
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:10,210
I just like watching the game rather
than a, you know, I don't like everybody.

829
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,360
All that shit talk and when
your team loses or if you win,

830
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:15,460
watching your fans talking
shit to other people,

831
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,420
it's just like we didn't have anything
to fuck it. Do it, do with it, right? We,

832
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,700
they got lucky or we get fucked.
What are you going to do? All right.

833
00:47:21,701 --> 00:47:26,230
Paranoia or legit worry. Um, okay.

834
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,400
Uh, hey. Hey, Bill. Birla check.

835
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,790
Uh, congratulations on your new
baby. Huge fan of the podcast.

836
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,440
I'm a 30 year old naturalized citizen who
immigrated from South Korea when I was

837
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:42,750
10 as an immigrant and
now a proud American. Um,

838
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,080
I'm writing to you in regards to the
current state of messy affairs going on at

839
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:51,620
the White House. Why do you
guys ask me this shit? You know,

840
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:54,140
I'm just a comedian, or am I,
I'm going to solve this problem.

841
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:58,940
Do you still think that hill dog would
have been just as bad as our current

842
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:02,180
president? Uh, with Trump's reaction?

843
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:06,500
I'm not so sure anymore.
Hillary might've been corrupt,

844
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,800
as you mentioned in your previous podcast,

845
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:11,540
but I believe she would not
have taken such a radical,

846
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:15,050
brash action based on
intolerance and hatred.

847
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:16,980
Yeah.

848
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,870
I'm not to that level,
but they're going to keep the war's going.

849
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,400
You haven't noticed cycle.
Obama said he was going to end the wars.

850
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:24,890
He was going to shut down Guantanamo.
None of them did it.

851
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:25,930
Yeah.

852
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,460
They're not going to do it or I can't
get into this type of shit. I look,

853
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,010
if you believe that,
that this government,

854
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,600
the governments act on what
is right for people, you know,

855
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:39,310
rather than money.
Everybody,

856
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,200
everybody passed a certain
level moves on money. That's it.

857
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,650
Same thing in my business. Okay.
Why don't they make better movies?

858
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:51,340
Because they want to make money.
Why? There's so many cliches,

859
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:53,920
whether there's so many shitty wants.
It's the same fucking thing. Um,

860
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,310
do I think Hillary would do
something like that? No, I do not.

861
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,060
I don't think that she would
do something like that,

862
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,790
which you do a bunch of other evil things.
My point in all of that shit, okay.

863
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,600
When the amount of shit that Trump got
during the election about being evil in a

864
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,960
horrible fucking person,
I never disputed any of that.

865
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:16,270
But everybody was acting like
Hillary was a good person.

866
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,710
I say to that she wasn't,

867
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,380
and I was trying to get people
to look at other options,

868
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,810
which nobody's going to do
because they just go, oh,

869
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:26,650
that's a waste of a vote because
you're not going to win anyway.

870
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:31,120
So my thing with the American voters
is you get exactly what you fucking

871
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:35,740
deserve. If you don't have the
balls to not fucking to do,

872
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:36,800
not vote for the,
the,

873
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:40,540
the representative of the Republican and
the Democrats who've been fucking you

874
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,160
over since the day you've been born.

875
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:48,510
And try to get outside of this and try
to pick somebody from a different fucking

876
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,520
party that actually wants to call
out bankers and calls out a corporate

877
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:59,110
corruption and deregulation and
pharmaceutical companies and fucking,

878
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,780
uh,
genetically altered food.

879
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:06,460
All of that shit that never gets
fucking brought up with the fucking,

880
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,110
the two guys who were,
you know,

881
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,030
the man or the woman or the two guys
usually that are in the fucking, the,

882
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,380
the showdown between the
Republican and Democrat.

883
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:17,710
You get what you fucking deserve.
So this whole fucking thing now,

884
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,800
because Trump's such a colossal fuck up,
which everybody already knew.

885
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,320
Okay. Um, for you now look at
Hillary being like, well, you know,

886
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:30,710
it's like you're looking two serial
killers and Hilary Barry's the bodies,

887
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:34,250
you know, fucking under a house and Trump
leaves him out in the fucking street.

888
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:37,820
Therefore you'd rather have Hillary.
I mean, if that's, I don't know.

889
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:39,540
Okay.

890
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,620
But I, I can honestly tell you, you know,

891
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,150
just my own feelings that
she's not a good person.

892
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:48,450
Trump is not a good person there too,
horribly selfish fucking people.

893
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:53,640
And I think a lot of people got caught
up in the fact that with Hillary's

894
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:58,200
fucking genitalia and the
whole thought of, Oh my God,

895
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:01,110
if there's a woman president,
what does that mean for fucking women?

896
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,500
It's just like every president
in my lifetime has been a guy.

897
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:09,370
What does that meant for me
as a guy? Nothing. It doesn't
mean anything like that.

898
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,460
That's like that disease in my business.

899
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,640
When you're a struggling artist and
then all of a sudden you get a manager,

900
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:16,920
an agent, you start thinking,
when I could put my feet up,

901
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:19,470
I don't have to work anymore. Yeah, you
do. You're always gonna have to work.

902
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:21,660
You know why?
Because nobody gives a fuck about you.

903
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:25,560
And I hate to be so fucking bleak, but
it's the truth. Nobody gives a shit.

904
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:30,000
What Trump is doing is fucking
horrible. It's not surprising. It isn't.

905
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,841
In a weird way.

906
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,930
It's actually causing a bunch of people
to rally and push back against him.

907
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,870
He's so fucking radical that I
don't think he's going to survive.

908
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,320
He's going to do a bunch of fucked up
shit to like the midterm elections and

909
00:51:40,321 --> 00:51:44,640
he's going to be so fucking on a hand
that people just going to run all the way

910
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:45,690
to the other side of the boat.

911
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,290
That's what always happens the same
way after eight years of Bush, oh,

912
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:52,740
let's all now let's all run over to the
guys with the blue ties and the Blue

913
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,160
Bras and you still get fucked, and then
everybody runs over to the other side.

914
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,800
So whatever.
I'm trying not to be preachy here,

915
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:00,720
but like you kind of get what you deserve.

916
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,500
If you're going to go through the insanity
of continuing to vote for whoever the

917
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:10,590
Democrats or the Republicans are
going to give you at that level,

918
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,120
and you're not gonna,

919
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,360
you're not gonna start at least voting
for these other people to encourage more

920
00:52:15,361 --> 00:52:18,720
people to run outside of those two
fucking parties. Other than that,

921
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:23,490
I don't know what to tell you. All right.
I'm done ranting here. Anyways. He said,

922
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:26,790
I remember on Conan you said everything
will be the same under Trump.

923
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,150
I really hope to God that you are
right, dude. You know something.

924
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,520
I'm getting so much shit for that
Conan thing. You know something.

925
00:52:32,521 --> 00:52:34,170
Next time there's an election like that,

926
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,220
you go on the day after the fucking thing
and try to find some sort of a fucking

927
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,580
angle,
you know,

928
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,050
like it's my fault the day after
the election that I say that,

929
00:52:46,051 --> 00:52:49,530
that Trump gets in. Okay. Everything
has been the same under Trump.

930
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:53,130
For a guy like me and for most fucking
people, if you're Muslim, yeah,

931
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:57,630
you're fucked. That absolutely
fucking changed. Okay.

932
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,880
But they were not showing those people.

933
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,880
They were showing a bunch
of white women crying.

934
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,810
That's what the fuck they were showing.
You know? And then they go, oh,

935
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:10,260
the fucking planned parenthood and all
of that type of shit. I mean, I don't,

936
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,790
I don't fucking know.
I mean like,

937
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,720
I think people fucking hate Trump and for
whatever reason they want to yell at a

938
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:19,560
comedian. So continue
to yell at me. You know,

939
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,240
I told you they were both pieces of
shit, but you know, after the election,

940
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,340
I don't know.

941
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,450
I just thought a lot of the screaming
and yelling and fucking crying was,

942
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:31,860
was a little much.

943
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:32,660
Yeah,

944
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,320
it was a little fucking much.
I understand you disappoint but crying.

945
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,920
It's just one so fucking pathetic.
All right.

946
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,360
Okay.

947
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,320
You don't like the guy do what the
fuck he can to fight back against them.

948
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:48,680
You don't just fucking breakdown crying
like somebody took your toy away.

949
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,980
I Dunno.
Maybe I'm too fucking not on a cynical.

950
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:53,893
MMM.

951
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,850
But I've gotten so many tweets
you really don't get, yeah,

952
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:59,460
you get a bug to shit
change when Obama came in,

953
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:04,140
but did it really fucking change,
you know what I mean?

954
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,950
Cause I guess for me actually true
change what they would tell me.

955
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,640
Where exactly do my
federal income taxes go?

956
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,820
Where does that go? If it goes to
the fucking IRS and they are not,

957
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,830
they are a private corporation of bankers.

958
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:24,690
They are not connected to the government.
Where does that fucking money go?

959
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,420
Do the people at the upper echelon
of the fucking Federal Reserve,

960
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,400
do they actually even bother paying taxes
considering they're paying themselves?

961
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:42,120
There's a nationwide heroin epidemic
that people are saying was created by the

962
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:44,670
pharmaceutical companies,
was not even fucking brought up.

963
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:45,740
Okay?

964
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,740
They genetically altered our food,
which is evidently so fucked up.

965
00:54:48,741 --> 00:54:52,280
They got to try to force other countries
to do it and they're fighting back

966
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:55,010
against them because they don't want it.
Inevitably,

967
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,630
it's so fucked up that these people,

968
00:54:56,631 --> 00:55:00,860
they don't even want to be forced to
label food is genetically altered cause

969
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:03,020
they know people aren't going to buy it.
There's all of that shit,

970
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,340
all of that shit.

971
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,910
Not only did not change under a
president with a blue fucking tie,

972
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,790
it continued to get worse.

973
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:18,880
So now when a guy like Trump
does something so, so obvious,

974
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,600
now everybody's all, oh my God,
this guy's out of his fucking mind.

975
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,580
Like this last guy.
I mean,

976
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:28,140
I'm not saying Obama is a bad fucking guy,

977
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:31,650
but like it wasn't he just continuing
on with the fucking warmongering and all

978
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:35,120
of that shit. Am I out of my mind? Maybe
I'm out of my mind. I don't know. See,

979
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,770
I don't know bill. Maybe
I'm paranoid, overreacting,

980
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,280
just like those crazy liberal fucks out
there, but I really do feel worried.

981
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,090
It's one of those gut feelings that
simmer deep down into your soul. I mean,

982
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:49,710
come on. Even Gorbachev just said
the world is preparing for war.

983
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:51,150
Okay?

984
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,970
Yeah, absolutely. But I don't think
that's because of Donald Trump.

985
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,840
Okay.

986
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,490
I just think he's yet another guy.

987
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:59,623
And if

988
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,070
they say the world,

989
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:02,900
okay,

990
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,600
the world is not Donald Trump.
It's a bunch of fucking people.

991
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:07,970
Okay?

992
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:12,070
You know what it really is? I don't.
I don't give into fucking hissy fits.

993
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,960
You don't think clearly.

994
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,910
You're breaking down crying and just
screaming that the fucking sky is falling,

995
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,660
falling. Then you're not going
to make any rational decisions.

996
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:24,100
There's a of groups that

997
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,120
are going to help out those people's at
the airport that you can give money too.

998
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,960
You can do shit like that and you can
give money to them and you can pray to God

999
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:36,040
that they're actually gonna use it on
him and not use expense accounts and go

1000
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:40,030
out and buy themselves a fucking corvette.
So I don't have any answers,

1001
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:43,600
but I will say this to people.
You got to stop looking,

1002
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,950
you know?

1003
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:46,860
Okay.

1004
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,790
I Dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno what it
is about standup Comedians, but we,

1005
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,700
for some reason,

1006
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:55,050
our get our feet held to the fire more
so than people who are actually in the

1007
00:56:55,051 --> 00:56:57,570
governmental positions.
Um,

1008
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:58,710
okay.

1009
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,011
You know,

1010
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:03,000
you want to get mad at me because of
what the fuck I said on the day after the

1011
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:07,620
fucking election on Conan, by
all means do that. But, you know,

1012
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:11,340
I bet there was how many of those fucking
women at that women's fucking rally,

1013
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:16,050
how many of them you think actually voted?
You know what I mean?

1014
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:21,120
All it is fucking outrage.
Where were you on election day?

1015
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,560
I mean, there's been, there's been people
who've got busted bitching about Trump.

1016
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:30,670
They didn't even fucking vote,
you know, but, uh, whatever,

1017
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,440
give me shit because I joked around when
it was like a fucking funeral out here

1018
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:38,980
in Hollywood.
I was just trying to calm people down.

1019
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,680
I just see, you know, you see a bunch
of adults crying on television. Yeah,

1020
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:45,580
it's unsettling.

1021
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,040
Okay,

1022
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,030
this is what it thinks that it happened.

1023
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,600
I think this guy is going to go fucking
sideways and then he's going to go

1024
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,750
sideways. The midterm elections,
what's going to happen? He says,

1025
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,860
just going to get a bunch of fucking
Democrats in there to maybe level this guy

1026
00:57:58,861 --> 00:58:01,020
out. But in the meantime
they'll keep deregulate,

1027
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:05,100
deregulating the banks and all of that
other shit. And in the end of the day,

1028
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,220
guys like Trump will be able to build a
golf course in a fucking pipeline under

1029
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:12,630
and over any native American
land that they want to.

1030
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,820
That's what the fuck they want
to do. Peep, they're so rich,

1031
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,590
they find the government to be in

1032
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,890
nuisance. That's what the fuck
you're dealing with. And um,

1033
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:25,990
I don't know if that's what I think. All
right, so there you go. And once again,

1034
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:29,520
I don't read or pay
attention, so fuck off. Uh,

1035
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,420
and God bless the United
States of America. All right,

1036
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:34,660
advice from a new fellow dead.
Hey Billy boy, congrats to you.

1037
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,190
And the lovely Nia on the new baby.

1038
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,370
My wife and I welcomed our
first son about five weeks ago.

1039
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,030
People would try to give you
too much advice early on,

1040
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:45,960
but I've discovered the only secret,
uh,

1041
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,930
you need to know about babies
is that snap suck in zippers.

1042
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:53,190
Rule baby's shit all damn day a.

1043
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,690
See you're taking onesies
on and off all day.

1044
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,980
He don't need the added frustration of
fumbling with dozens of snaps to get a

1045
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:05,830
one C's. So get onesies with zippers
and that's all you really need to know.

1046
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,260
Congrats. And go again and go
fuck yourself. That's a great one.

1047
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,360
That's actually great.

1048
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:13,870
I'm going to use that because I dealt
with snaps all last night. Um, all right,

1049
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:17,860
selfish girl friend advice.
Hey Bill, you're gruff.

1050
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:19,610
Okay.

1051
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,830
Hey Bill,
you gruff ginger Bollix

1052
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,970
I love the podcast. Brutally honest.
It's great. You're like, whoa. Anyway,

1053
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:29,330
I got a girl who most
of the time is great.

1054
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,740
Uh, she's really hard, really smart,
really fun. They always start this way,

1055
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,150
but every so often she just seems totally
fucking selfish. Most of the time.

1056
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:42,170
I totally mile her Meyer, her ethics
slash morals important. Right? Yeah.

1057
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,693
So she's human.

1058
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,940
Most of the time she's cool and every
once in a while she's just got this thing

1059
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:50,330
you don't like. Well, we celebrated our
third anniversary yesterday, by the way.

1060
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:54,770
I'm 28, she's 27. We went out to a Sushi
restaurant for a bit of a celebration.

1061
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,720
It gets time to pay the bill.
And I say,

1062
00:59:56,721 --> 01:00:00,470
I'll pay in cash if she
transfers me her half.

1063
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,130
Oh God, Dude. He goes,
from that moment on,

1064
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,430
on the night was all silent
treatment till we started arguing.

1065
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:13,540
Then it went back to silence
till we went to sleep. Yeah.

1066
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:17,350
Cause that's that weird thing where
it's like you're celebrating your

1067
01:00:17,351 --> 01:00:22,130
anniversary, but for some
reason you have to pay. Um,

1068
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,750
yeah. That's where all the feminism
goes out the fucking window right there.

1069
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,640
That's always a great sleep when
there's an unresolved issue.

1070
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:34,630
Uh, I'm not even a big believer
in the guy just paying,

1071
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,090
I'm not a big believer in the guy
just paying the bill, but okay.

1072
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,380
On special occasions it's done. It's the
done thing. So I'll go along with it.

1073
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,330
But I didn't this time because the week
before my laptop fucked up and I had to

1074
01:00:48,331 --> 01:00:51,660
sacrifice my TV,
my camera's stuff and media center stuff.

1075
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:56,640
I love to make enough cash to get a decent
replacement so I can work slash keep

1076
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:58,710
applying for new jobs.
Also,

1077
01:00:58,711 --> 01:01:01,650
I've been between jobs and money's
a bit tight right now. In short,

1078
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,270
it's not been a great week.

1079
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:07,860
You'd think she'd be a bit understanding
about it given the circumstances,

1080
01:01:07,861 --> 01:01:11,190
but no. Hey, you'll make an all
decent points here. Anyways,

1081
01:01:11,191 --> 01:01:16,050
we had a fight about it.
Um, when quiet again,

1082
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,560
then we did what we do sometimes and
just let it go rather than either ups or

1083
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,710
either of us having to
apologize. Oh, that's not good.

1084
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,110
She says the argument was me not
treating her like a lady. I see.

1085
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:31,920
This is his fucking, I dunno, this is
this thing that you can't win as a guy,

1086
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:33,570
you know,

1087
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:37,500
they want to be treated just like a guy
when it's something good is at stake.

1088
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:40,910
But when a bill comes, like
I'm a lady, I say it was about,

1089
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,910
it was not about me paying for everything.
I'm up til the bill.

1090
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,350
We were having a great time.

1091
01:01:46,351 --> 01:01:49,380
I was psyched about a call for a
great job I had gotten earlier.

1092
01:01:49,381 --> 01:01:53,010
She was psyched for me.
Then she throws a fucking moody,

1093
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:58,011
like a fucking infant who's toys been
taken away because I want to split the

1094
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:02,040
bill. I don't know, maybe I'm insane.

1095
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:06,690
My friend says it was a school boy error.
I don't think we're kids in a bit,

1096
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:11,220
in a bit of grownup consideration
called for this situation. But anyways,

1097
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:16,140
have at me, if I'm being a
moron, give me both barrels. Um,

1098
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,130
dude, uh, all of this shit

1099
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,640
that you said to me, you
need to say to her. I mean,

1100
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,730
minus the fuck's in some of the
other stuff. Culinary child.

1101
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:28,200
I wouldn't do any of that,
but um,

1102
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,430
okay.

1103
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,731
You know,

1104
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:33,390
your relationship is going to be a lot
easier if you start communicating. So, um,

1105
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,450
yeah,

1106
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,640
maybe you could a preface
it with, hey, you know,

1107
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:40,940
I know we're celebrating our anniversary.
I know I'm supposed to pay as a guy,

1108
01:02:40,941 --> 01:02:44,840
but I'm kinda tight. Can you blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. I Dunno.

1109
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:45,990
Okay.

1110
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,823
I know I just,

1111
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:47,990
okay.

1112
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:51,410
I don't, I don't get all of that
shit wear. Why the guy has to pay.

1113
01:02:51,411 --> 01:02:55,630
It's your relationship and the
woman never pays. You know,

1114
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,590
if you notice all the advertising,
hey, Valentine's Day's coming up.

1115
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,380
It's all about what the
guy has to get the woman.

1116
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:04,723
MMM.

1117
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,500
That's something you don't hear
what the fucking woman's March.

1118
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:12,501
Just basically how the male
female relationship is set
up is that the guy should

1119
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:17,760
just be constantly showering her with
money and gifts because she had the

1120
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:21,300
decency to, uh, you know,

1121
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:26,280
spend her time with you.
It's like her time has value.

1122
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:30,900
Yours does not, you know, I
don't get it. It's like, Hey,

1123
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,910
I can be fucking doing other things too,

1124
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,670
rather than the ones you've
talking about your day.

1125
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:37,170
Same as you've got to listen to me.

1126
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,600
It's not our works. Anyways,
cigar recommendation. Hey,
they're a freckle tits.

1127
01:03:41,601 --> 01:03:45,530
I had been sober and more importantly
off the cigarettes for over a month now.

1128
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,150
Graduations to celebrate this,

1129
01:03:47,151 --> 01:03:50,570
I decided to treat myself to a nice
cigar while I watched your new stand up

1130
01:03:50,571 --> 01:03:53,570
special on the 31st. Any
recommendations on a good smoke? Thanks.

1131
01:03:53,571 --> 01:03:54,970
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,

1132
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:56,703
okay.

1133
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:59,200
Well if you're off cigarettes,
I don't know why he'd smoke a cigar,

1134
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:03,900
but if you're going to, then you don't
have access to a Cuban cigar. Um,

1135
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:05,990
okay.

1136
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,980
I like those.

1137
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:08,730
Okay.

1138
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,140
The Aurora emeralds.

1139
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:11,400
Okay.

1140
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,380
And I like, uh, this, um,

1141
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,950
the Davidoff Nicaraguan adverse,
he turned me on to and the Casa Magna,

1142
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:23,550
the, uh, the torpedo one's got the two
bands, I forget which one it's called.

1143
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:28,110
I like those ones, but I kind of
quit smoking to be honest with you.

1144
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:31,500
I think I'm done with it. I might have
the occasional fucking cigar, but uh,

1145
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,160
you know, now that I'm getting life
insurance and it's just like, all right,

1146
01:04:35,161 --> 01:04:37,080
I got to get this
nicotine out of my system.

1147
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,820
So I can pass the fucking
test and everything.

1148
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:43,050
When I saw the difference in rates,
just even being a passive smoker,

1149
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:44,560
I was just like, wow. Uh,

1150
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,600
they obviously know that this means
this shit's gonna fucking kill you.

1151
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:50,460
So it was kind of like, who am I fooling
here if I just cleaned myself up?

1152
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:54,510
So I think I'm kind of done. Like,
I'll smoke a cigar. I'm okay.

1153
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:56,640
Okay.

1154
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,480
I don't know. I'll smoke a cigar. What
you suppose towards an actual moment

1155
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,800
as opposed to just being like, ah, man,

1156
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:06,830
I always smoked cigars and now I'm kind
of feeling that itch to smoke when saw

1157
01:05:06,831 --> 01:05:09,680
smoke one. But anyways, I got to get
running here. I gotta go do Conan.

1158
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,050
I'll say some more shit
probably about politics.

1159
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:15,710
And then you guys can now give me shit.
Like I'm the one fucking running things.

1160
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:19,400
I told you a long time ago.
I don't read a that's it.

1161
01:05:19,401 --> 01:05:21,890
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday. Bye.
