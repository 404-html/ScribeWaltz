1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,810
Okay.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,190
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,550
March 19th,
2012

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,600
and like the line,

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm fucking cold out here in Los Angeles.

6
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:22,880
If you're wondering about the
weather report yesterday, um,

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,630
cold does not bug me unless I'm
in Los Angeles. Then it bugs me,

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,340
you know, from and Cleveland
Farm in Boston. If I'm a
New York, if I'm in Philly,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,900
I don't give a fuck if it's
cold, I'll put on a park. Right?

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,690
But when I'm out here in la,
it really bothers me.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,070
It's just something annoying about
being cold while looking at a palm tree.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,960
Just fucking bugs the shit out of me.
So it doesn't make any sense, you know?

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,700
Okay.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,570
It's like seeing a skinny Santa
Claus. It's like, what are you doing?

15
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,430
I thought you were just
supposed to be a tub of shit.

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,950
How can you be jolly if you're in shape,

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,290
if you haven't met a jolly
skinny person? You know, there's,

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,120
there's a certain level of being
fat where you just find you just,

19
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,200
I dunno,

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,620
I don't know if you just psyched because
you're eating cookies and you don't

21
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:19,040
give a shit,
but you can still tie your shoes.

22
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,390
Like that's that level of
fat you want to be at. Well,

23
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:25,220
you're eating pizza and
you're eating cookies and Yay,
you have fat. But you know,

24
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:28,340
you put on a sweater and you
go, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. All right,

25
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:31,730
you got rosy cheeks and nobody cares.
Nobody's looking at you.

26
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,340
Nobody's judging you.
But then when you go beyond it,

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,450
when you go beyond it is when your
stomach comes out from under neath that

28
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:43,010
sweater and everybody can see it. You
know, but you can't see it, right?

29
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:46,130
Cause you're so fat. And uh,
even when the wind blows,

30
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:49,940
you don't notice it because you're all
warm with all that blubber. You know,

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,800
there's that, there's a, there's a
fucking, I don't know, there's this,

32
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,570
there's a sweet spot of being fat.

33
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,540
Okay.

34
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,430
Where, where no one's making funny being
fat and you're eating, I'll shift food,

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,490
but nobody's trashing you. So I guess
it out. That's what makes you jolly,

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,820
you know, oh, I get to eat all this
shit food and nobody's judging me.

37
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,380
Then once you go beyond it, then
you start fucking crying. You know?

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,960
I'm one of those reality shows
I don't want, I'm talking about,

39
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,440
I don't even want to be doing this
podcast right now. I'm going to get,

40
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm not even lying.
I'm only going to lie to you.

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,320
I can't even spit it out
and fucking exhausted.

42
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,990
But I got a bunch of Shit to do tomorrow,
which is today.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,930
By the time you listened to it,
you know,

44
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,980
I really don't feel like doing this shit.
So it's going to be quick.

45
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,340
I'm getting right to the fucking point.
All right.

46
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,810
I already solved why certain
levels of fat people a jolly,

47
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,010
you know right there.
If you guys weren't so selfish,

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,150
that could take up your whole
fucking week. You know? But not yet.

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
You guys keep it coming.

50
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,440
Okay?

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,230
You like, I'm blaming you guys
for this thing that I started.

52
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,240
I just realized I even looked at
it half of this fucking crap here.

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,580
So what happened this week,
Bill? What did you do this week,

54
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:10,270
Willie? I, I, um,

55
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,500
I didn't do any fucking standard.
I think maybe I did stand up this week.

56
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,760
I'm on vacation people,
I'm still on vacation still on vacations.

57
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,870
You guys sit there and you work
putting in an honest day work,

58
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,790
make it somebody else's dream come true.

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,890
The dream evidently was to stick everybody
in these little fucking cubicles.

60
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,790
Everything would have fire hazard or
cubicle is what if there's a fire in your

61
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,940
little doorway, you know,
there's no other way to get out.

62
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,160
Where are you going to do?
Shouldn't that be another doorway to the,

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,650
to the cubicle next year?

64
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,470
Do you have a little
latter on the front of it?

65
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,090
We climb up and over your terminal.

66
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,010
Why are you still sitting in that
fucking thing surrounded by plastic?

67
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,960
They can't give you anything.
How bout like,

68
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:04,210
can they make your mouse may not have
like wood or maybe some sort of precious

69
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,440
metal to somehow act like they
give a fuck about you on any level?

70
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,943
Yeah.

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,940
Do you know why? I have a, uh,
I live in this old house now,

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,820
this old houses fucking old,
this old houses, old wiring.

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,720
This old house says fucked up plum
in and Billy's got to pay for it.

74
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,160
Eh,
houses,

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,640
got little garage and
I got a big fat truck.

76
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,050
And every time it is, I
started saying, God damn, fuck,

77
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,320
I can't fucking get it in the garage.
So you know what I did the other day?

78
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:43,100
I said, hey, who knows how
to make garage doors wider.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,110
And I found somebody, I
found somebody on, uh,

80
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,340
make my garage doors wider.com and the
person came over and they made my garage

81
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:55,790
doors wider and I backed
my fucking truck in there,

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,960
you know,
fucking like butter.

83
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,710
So you guys don't have,

84
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,860
listen to me bitch about that
against an opposite and they go on,

85
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:07,730
this is fucking great. You know,
I can put my truck in there,

86
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,380
I don't have to worry about it,

87
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,903
you know,

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,240
and there's no problems.
So what do I do?

89
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,600
I fucking jump in the Prius c of the
day, you know, the ying and the Yang.

90
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,890
I got the gas guzzler and I got the, Oh
my God, it's like a tree kind of car.

91
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,090
So I'm going to go down and watch some
final four fucking action and would have

92
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:29,670
a march madness, whatever
you call it. And uh,

93
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,090
you know, as you guys know, I'm
not a big fan of basketball.

94
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,150
I love the first 97% of it.

95
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:41,151
It's that last 3% with the 58 timeouts
and the fouls and the commercials.

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,490
You know,
I watched the game today.

97
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:48,450
It was one of the worst
sporting experiences I've
ever had. I watched St Louis,

98
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,490
uh, the Saint Louis fairies or something
like that. There was some sort of a,

99
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,210
the gremlins versus the,
the Michigan.

100
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:00,800
Okay.

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,390
Okay. 20 minutes. First half,
20 minutes. Second half.

102
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,350
Okay. The first, I don't know,

103
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,630
38 minutes of the game or not even 37
minutes of the game. I don't know what to,

104
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:16,310
it seemed like it took 90 minutes
to play is flying. And I'm like,

105
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,690
this is why I love college basketball
as opposed to the excruciating,

106
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:25,640
48 minutes of NBA hoop. And then what
happens to final fucking three minutes?

107
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,830
I swear to God it took 50 minutes to play.

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,700
Okay.

109
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,690
Jesus Christ, they're
up by seven. It's over.

110
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,430
Wow.
Wow.

111
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,540
That took 0.8 seconds off the clock
goes little lied for a one. And what?

112
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,460
Okay.

113
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,830
Fucking guy misses the ball.
He throws it down. Right?

114
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,250
Fucking files another guy.
Right?

115
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,890
Okay.

116
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,080
Fucking I,
I had my shoes on.

117
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,220
I'm trying to leave cause I gotta get
my buddy a ride cause I got shit to do,

118
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,910
but we want to see the end of the fucking
game and I swear to God the final 45

119
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:05,750
seconds, it took like six
minutes to play, 45 seconds.

120
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,930
And I know every once in a while somebody
can hit that big shot and everybody

121
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,530
goes, oh shit in a
buffalo wild wings. Right?

122
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,550
And then you slutty waitress comes over
with a ref shirt tied off, you know,

123
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:23,440
just done at the teddies cleavage
showing, hey guys, how are ya?

124
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:26,500
You want some more wings?
Did we win?

125
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,660
Yay.

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,480
Stick the legal tender
in my RFS, please. Right?

127
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,180
I know every once in a while you
have one of those things, right?

128
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,580
But you know what, 99% of the time
in basketball that doesn't happen.

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,870
And you just sitting there letting
six months, six minutes to your life,

130
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,300
go by to watch 45 seconds of action,

131
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,873
you know,

132
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,700
I dunno. So anyways, so I go to a
buddy's, my house buddy's house,

133
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,830
a buddy of mine's house. There we
go. It's actually an apartment.

134
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,740
What do you have to
exaggerate, bill? You don't,

135
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,610
why you're trying to enhance your life.
And I go fuck yourself. All right?

136
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,140
So I drive over to his apartment,
right?

137
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,860
And he lives in this part of the city
where there's no fucking parking.

138
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,290
And I'm really trying not to lose my shit.

139
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,110
I'm trying to control my temper.

140
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,620
Okay.

141
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,340
Cause I don't want to be this guy.
I really don't. I'd like to be that.

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,470
I'd like to be jolly.
I like to eat some pizzas,

143
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,770
some cookies now my stomach hanging out
underneath my sweater and nobody gives

144
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:31,910
me shit about it. Right? Oh um, so

145
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,780
yeah.

146
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,600
What am I, so I get my fucking
Prius and I drive down the road.

147
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:41,190
I can't find the parking. So I say fuck
it. You know I'm going to park at a meter.

148
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,770
So I park at the meter and I reached
into my little fucking console to get out

149
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,740
my little Baggie,

150
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:51,741
a quarters and oh and I forgot the not
there cause that cunt broke my fucking

151
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,960
window in my driveway,
broke the window,

152
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,940
my fucking car and stole a bag of
quarters. We say good, this Dosha,

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,860
right. And then I have to
pay for the fucking window.

154
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:05,460
So I pull up to the meter and I don't
have a Goddamn, I don't have any quarters.

155
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,360
I don't have any quarters.
Sorry guy.

156
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,530
Evidently I have to use my credit card.
Something I don't like doing.

157
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,490
I don't like using my credit card on a,
you know,

158
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,960
in a parking meter on a parking meter.

159
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,670
I don't like doing that because there's
a record that I was there. Okay.

160
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Now I stick that thing in and that takes
a lot of stuff off the table for me.

161
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,360
Okay. I can't like get into a fight
with somebody and he pulls a knife,

162
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,910
we wrestle for it and
he falls on it and dies.

163
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,120
But I have no connection
to him and you know,

164
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,930
and I can't just fucking leave
without getting caught. Right?

165
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:46,170
I can't call somebody a cunt. This
does. I mean, I can do all that stuff,

166
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:50,580
but there's that, that the paper trail,
he was there. No, I wasn't. Yes you were.

167
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,190
We got your credit card.
Well, I didn't call her a con.

168
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,950
Why'd you lie about being
there? All right. Listen,

169
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,340
am I being charged with anything?
Because if I am, I want a lawyer. If not,

170
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:04,910
I'm fucking leaving. All right? Remember
that first 48 that's what you say.

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,990
So anyways, so I've got to use the fucking
credit card. So I use a credit card.

172
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,570
All right?
All I can get is two hours of time.

173
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,470
There's an hour and
something on the meters.

174
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,950
So I'm trying to pave the 20 minutes.
It's all fucking confusing.

175
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,380
I gave them two hours
of time for 20 minutes.

176
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,330
So go on and walk in this guy's fucking
apartment. I watched the Goddamn game,

177
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,280
right? I'm thinking two hours is
going to be enough. Timeout, timeout,

178
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:30,860
file, file, file, time out, all
that fucking bullshit. Right?

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,560
But time I figured out what's going on.

180
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,580
It's three and a half hours late and I'm
like, God, Jesus Christ, you're an idiot.

181
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:39,440
Bill. You've forgotten. You've
parked at a fucking meter.

182
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,850
You're going to have a ticket, right?
And I come walk it down the street

183
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,250
and I'm walking up to my car.

184
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:52,251
What do I see the fucking meter
maid who's a guy pulls up.

185
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,750
I still call them meter maids.
Even if it's a guy,

186
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,480
you know what kind of a
fucking man does that job?

187
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,890
I don't give a shit if it is a recession,

188
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,040
go break into somebody's Prius
to be a man about it, right?

189
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,910
I see the fucking meter maid man pulls
up and right as I'm there and I'm

190
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,500
laughing my ass off going,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

191
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,400
I got away with it and I jumped in
my Prius and I drive away. Wa Ha ha.

192
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,570
Laughing my ass off. Call up my buddy gay
wouldn't believe it. I got there, right.

193
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,780
It's a fucking blah, blah, blah.
Yeah, you had to be there, right?

194
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,710
I'm all thinking this is the fucking
greatest story ever. All right.

195
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,480
Put My car in the fucking driveway.
I don't know what I did after that.

196
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,990
Came inside at a couple of whiskeys and
I yelled at everyone in the House that I

197
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,330
love, you know, typical evening for me.

198
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,800
So the next morning I wake up and I
looked at the side of my car and evidently

199
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,700
somebody hit hit my fucking car. I'm
driving away last night, you know,

200
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,590
I'm driving away thinking, oh, look at me.

201
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:48,020
I've got to wait from the
fucking meeting maybe.

202
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,550
And somebody caved in the
entire side of my fucking car.

203
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,020
Okay.

204
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,853
Yeah.

205
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,770
I don't know what it is about.
My Prius has just fucking,

206
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,870
every fucking three days,
somebody smashes into it.

207
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,180
I just can't keep the dead side of it.
You know?

208
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,660
I'm not one of these douchebags who gets
a fucking car and when something breaks

209
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:07,720
you just say fuck it. You leave it
that way. And next thing you know,

210
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:10,270
you look like Lamont drive it
over to Fred Sanford House.

211
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,350
I'm not going out like that. Even if it is
a Prius, I'm keeping it nice. All right.

212
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,710
I get the fucking thing detailed.
Yeah.

213
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,170
I don't give a shit. I get to fucking
interior shampooed I keep it nice.

214
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,440
Not riving around some, you
know, sorry. Bad enough.

215
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,300
I'm driving around on something that
it has bicycle tires on top of that and

216
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,220
have fucking Denson it all right.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,860
I've got an image here of
people I'm trying to keep up.

218
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,420
Ah, Christ. I'm so fucking tired right
now. I don't want to do this. God Damn,

219
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,200
I didn't, what the fuck I'm
talking. What am I talking about?

220
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,710
That's how you guys are.
So Sandra Bernhardt this weekend,

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,960
I didn't do any standup.
I went down and, uh,

222
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,640
Whitney and her momma went down and we
saw Sandra Bernhardt down at the La Jolla

223
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:56,280
playhouse or something like that.
And uh, she's fucking awesome.

224
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,160
God Damn Rock Star.
You know,

225
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:02,430
it's kind of a cabaret thing was she
would sing songs and that type of stuff.

226
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,330
You know, and I think I was the only
straight guy. They're under the age of 45.

227
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,290
But I loved it. I actually wished
that she would do more standup.

228
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,240
She was fucking hilarious and a,
I don't know,

229
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,340
she was just,
I don't know,

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,380
that perfect kind of just not giving
a fuck. Just an absolute beast.

231
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:26,790
I've always been a huge fan of hers and
uh, so if you get a chance to see her,

232
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,340
I definitely fucking recommend it.

233
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,160
Yeah.

234
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,750
The fuck was she gonna she went off on,

235
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:35,980
she did like fucking 10 minutes on
Gwyneth Paltrow just trashing her.

236
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,570
It's phenomenal. And all
his shit about, you know,

237
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:46,460
watching TV and make it fun as
Cindy Crawford's stupid Cindy serum,

238
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,760
all that Shit I did.
It was phenomenal night.

239
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,160
I actually got to sit and watch somebody
else do stand up for once you don't

240
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,600
stood in line. Bought a DVD for Nia.
Right. And then stick out my ana.

241
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,500
But convenient though. All right.
Did that, took a picture? You know,

242
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,250
I had a little fan boy night.
It was nice.

243
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,090
Okay,

244
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,920
and so mass holistic cave in
the side of my fucking car.

245
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,940
Oh Jesus.
What the hell am I talking about?

246
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,910
I don't know what I'm talking about
anymore. You know? You know what?

247
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,170
I think it's time for people.

248
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,780
I think it's time for a fucking
commercial new this week, a blow pops.

249
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,210
You remember those things at the ice
cream man used to sell those red,

250
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:31,660
white and blue rockets teaches
the girls how to suck Dick. Nice,

251
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,340
right? Well, they're on sale
people. They're on sale this week.

252
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:39,800
If they're an ice cream truck comes by,
you just mentioned this podcast.

253
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,520
He just yell out,

254
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:46,521
my sister's already sucking Dick and
I'll give you 10% off a blow pop.

255
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,200
All right. Nah, what the fuck am I
talking? Sorry, I don't have the,

256
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,970
I don't have the copy in front of me.

257
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,900
Where the hell is it?

258
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,870
Okay,

259
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,990
the fuck is wrong with it.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,040
Why wouldn't I have any of this out
there to see advertising schedule here?

261
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,860
What do we got? stamps.com again, do I
really need to go through this again?

262
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,140
stamps.com everybody, you
know, you know the deal.

263
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,610
How would you like to have the post
office and your own apartment? But Phil,

264
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:18,670
I don't think,
relax.

265
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,810
I don't mean literally
stamps.com everybody.

266
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,420
Have you ever been sitting around rubbing
your balls at one in the morning going,

267
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,680
God, I wish I could put a
stamp on a letter. Well,

268
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:33,370
with stamps.com that
dream is now a reality.

269
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay, so why don't you call
Oprah and start crying about it?

270
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:41,680
Because your dreams have
come true. All right? Look,

271
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:45,070
no one wants to go down
to the post office. It's a
dangerous place to go, okay?

272
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:48,490
Every six weeks somebody is down
there doing something crazy, right?

273
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,470
There's always some homeless guy,
you know,

274
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,120
holding the door for you as you walk in
and then expects you know that you're

275
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,420
going to pay him on the way out.
Like that's how life is.

276
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,140
Like that's how quickly you get
a return investment. You know,

277
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,120
like, I couldn't open that door
myself. You filthy son of a bitch.

278
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,210
Why do you want to deal with death again
about when you go in there and there's

279
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:12,850
some old lady trying to mail
or dentures to Cincinnati,

280
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,670
you don't want to stand behind that.
How do I weigh it?

281
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,330
Or It'd be nice if you had a scale in
your own apartment, a house, a dwelling,

282
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:21,850
or even your cubicle.
All you gotta do people's,

283
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:26,650
go to stamps.com you can buy and print
official us postage on your own computer

284
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,980

the top of the homepage,

295
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,580
you'd type in burr that stamps.com
everybody enter birth. How was that?

296
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,570
Was that a nice read?

297
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,250
I think it was like there was just
enough comedy in there while I got the

298
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:24,320
information out to um,

299
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,520
oh Jesus. So anyways, I live in this
old ass house. All right. And uh,

300
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,870
whoever lived here before, I don't think
it's the people right before the people,

301
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:38,470
for them, people for them.
This is a great old house.

302
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,280
And the great thing about having an old
houses, they have these old fixtures,

303
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,290
doorhandles hinges,
other handles, you know,

304
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,360
would carbons, all that type of
stuff. That makes the thing unique.

305
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,760
You know what the worst is,

306
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,130
is when somebody lives in the house before
you and they don't fucking appreciate

307
00:17:56,131 --> 00:18:00,180
it. And what they do is they take
all those wonderful features.

308
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,400
They take 'em out and they go down to
home depot and they buy some plastic hunk

309
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:07,800
of shit. And he used that as a God
damn door handle. Well, you know what,

310
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,390
that's not how I roll.

311
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,250
Am I really going to talk about
brass door handles at this point?

312
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,780
Is that how far the fucking podcast
is? Com. I got a fucking door handle.

313
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,490
It's made out of brass and it has
90 years of Schmutz on it. Okay.

314
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:29,690
Fatty Arbuckle banged a whore up against
it probably sometime in the early

315
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,310
thirties and that what's from that horse?
Twat is still on the door handle. Okay.

316
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,040
And I went out and bought myself a little
fucking kid and I'm trying to Polish

317
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:40,851
that thing today.

318
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:45,620
And I realized how annoying it must have
been to work for rich people back in

319
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:46,454
the day.

320
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,880
We had to polish up their candelabra
has in their fucking spoons in it.

321
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:55,640
Tea Cups.
Oh my God.

322
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,560
I would fucking rub my balls on all their
fucking forks and everything before I

323
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:04,160
put them in the drawer. And there's
no way these people didn't do that.

324
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,990
There is nothing more annoying.

325
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,970
And I know these people back in the day
had no idea what an iPad was. You know,

326
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,620
they had no idea what it'd be like to
have live streaming porn on some little

327
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,130
fucking plastic box right on that table
where they could rub one out whenever

328
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:23,690
they wanted to. I realized it was a
simple time, you know, back in the day,

329
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:27,890
like an apple was a dessert, at least
according to my research, it was,

330
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,550
remember that back in the day he'd watched
those Tom Sawyer movies and they'd be,

331
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:34,990
hey, whitewash my fence and I'll
give you an apple boy. Oh boy,

332
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:39,950
you're fucking apple kid. Couldn't believe
it. I don't understand. You figured.

333
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:41,870
Then there was a whole bunch
of apple trees all around.

334
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:43,580
Why don't you go climb went
up, you'd dumped. Fuck,

335
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,000
you wouldn't have to paint the fence.
It's you really thought about it.

336
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,500
But then again,
he was an orphan.

337
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,840
It wasn't Tom Sawyer and orphaned was
the huck Finn. I don't fucking know.

338
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:57,470
What am I talking about?
Anyways, to be back in the day,

339
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,740
just have to sit there and shine up all
these fucking rich people's bullshit.

340
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,150
You know,
I bought this you that you can't afford,

341
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,240
make it even Shinier and you've
got to sit there doing that.

342
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,970
You know the same motion
over and over again.

343
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:14,600
The fucking your knuckles swelling up,
right?

344
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,540
Just sitting there,
you know going and I always to,

345
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,260
I always want to drive a stage coach.

346
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,590
And that dream just never happened for
you and that you are your whole fucking

347
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:27,580
life. You got to sit there and
shine spoons, not wash them.

348
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,160
You got to wash them and then
he got a fucking shine him up.

349
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,691
Let me tell you something.

350
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:35,710
I fuck with this brass door handle
for about 20 minutes. And I was like,

351
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,460
you know what? Fuck this. No, I didn't.

352
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:42,760
I went on Youtube and actually looked
up how to shine a breast fucking door.

353
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,160
So now I'm going down to the
fucking hardware store in
tomorrow and I'm going to

354
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:52,180
get some fucking low grade or high grade
fucking Sos pad and I'm going to do

355
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:55,660
that with a little toothbrush tomorrow.
Shine this son of a bitch up

356
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,550
and somehow I feel like it's
going to fill the void. Oh God.

357
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,140
Can you guys fill me slowly going crazy.
Um,

358
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,490
well if you can, I don't give a fuck
a YG. If he been wondering, you know,

359
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:15,350
I've realized that full ever. I haven't
even told you guys how to email me. Um,

360
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,280
it's bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com.
All right,

361
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:23,780
bill at, that's the, the a
with the circle around it.

362
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,430
Like Walt Disney drew it right.

363
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,110
bill@thempodcast.com.
Okay.

364
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:33,380
I said it three times. If you can't
figure it out, go fuck yourself.

365
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,610
I don't need to say go fuck yourself
because we are trying to email me to tell

366
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:40,370
me I gave you the wrong email.
I'm not going to get it. Um,

367
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:45,371
you can either go there or
go or [inaudible] or go to
bill bird.com/contact and

368
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:54,560
contact is spelled the
American way. C o n. T a Ct.

369
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,020
Okay. Not the Hungarian ways that a
fucking moth. You've got damn cons.

370
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,120
I need a uh,
God,

371
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,590
you motherfucker buy an old
house that has such character.

372
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,010
Hang on a second. I'm going to kill
that fucking thing and risk losing.

373
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:12,350
All my Peter listeners.
Hang on.

374
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,840
Yeah, that's it. That's what
happened. That's how that ended.

375
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,120
All right.
I'm back.

376
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,270
One less moth in the house
trying to eat my fucking sweat.

377
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,280
The mothballs work or let's like
ice cubes in the drink of moths.

378
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,140
Do they? Cause I swear to God, I got it.

379
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:41,780
I got mothballs all over the
fucking place and he's got, it's,

380
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,870
I think that throwing them in a high
ball glass as they fucking shout out my

381
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,490
turtlenecks. Um, I
dressed like Dick Cavett.

382
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:52,430
Now did I tell you guys that anyways,

383
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:57,431
the
contact
link@thetopofbillbillboarddotcomisabillatthemandpodcast.com
or

384
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:02,300
billboard.com/contact.
Send me an email. You know,

385
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,280
let me know you listen and do it.
Don't do it. Who gives a fuck?

386
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,840
Do you even give a fuck at this point?

387
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,320
I think a lot of my listeners right
now are just sitting with their hands.

388
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,560
They head on their hand,
just staring off into space.

389
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,770
And I gotta be honest with you.
That's exactly how I feel.

390
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,760
I just don't have time to do this tomorrow
morning. So I'm doing it right now.

391
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,950
You know what I mean? It's Kinda of like
when you're building a toy for your kid,

392
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,960
you don't really want to do it. You
know, you just plowing through it.

393
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,290
You're not even thinking about the joy
is going to have you just trying to get

394
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:37,370
to step eight. We could just finish
this whole fucking thing. Um, you know,

395
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:41,930
last week I brought up, uh, the
different types of cock blocks.

396
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,730
Last week I brought up the announcer that
who can cock block you from across the

397
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:49,520
room. Second, he sees something happening.

398
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,450
Hey,
what's going on?

399
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,380
All right.
That guy,

400
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,030
you know that he goes slowly slide
your hand back down to thigh,

401
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,580
back from out from underneath
the dress. You know, you just,

402
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:06,300
you just felt we have a good time.
So it was another type of cock block.

403
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:09,120
Evidently this person
named the double oh seven.

404
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,950
This is the friend of the girl you're
trying to hook up with or who acts like

405
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:18,180
she's in diff and acts like
she's indifferent about
heading back to your PR or

406
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:22,770
what this the friend of the girl you're
trying to hook up with who acts like

407
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:27,771
she's indifferent about heading back to
your place or staying at the party but

408
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:32,961
is secretly texting 1000 reasons to her
friend as to why they should get the

409
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,940
fuck out of there. Oh that's
the worst. That's right.

410
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:40,140
Why don't you just man up and say I
don't want to bang you. I'm leaving. Um,

411
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,660
so anyways, just cause she's
not getting any attention.

412
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,050
Okay.

413
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,530
She's always got some stupid passive
aggressive look on her face as she's

414
00:24:47,531 --> 00:24:51,640
texting and going on about why they
got to get to Mickey's cause everyone's

415
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:55,930
there. Mikey's cause every once
there. Yeah. It's always, you know,

416
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,760
is there anything worse than
the, you know, it's something,

417
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,800
what do you think is worse?
The Guy,

418
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:04,801
your buddy cock block on you or
the ugly friend of the hot girl?

419
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,520
You Know Martha.
That's cow.

420
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,250
Okay.

421
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,500
You know what,
I wish I did back in the day.

422
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,130
Okay.

423
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,120
Because I always tried to ignore that
person and just keep working on the other

424
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:19,954
girl.

425
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,800
Even though I wanted to tell the the
the fucking ugly one to go fuck herself.

426
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,120
It's always killed me that I never
did because it never worked out.

427
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:32,260
One set girls marathon. Come on, let's go.

428
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,143
Okay,

429
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,220
Marissa, you've had too much to drink
like that one. Like I just wished,

430
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:42,680
just one time I just said, I'm
sorry. No one wants to fuck you.

431
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,200
Sorry. You're athlete. We're
going your personality. Right.

432
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,590
I might as well have done that
because once that fucking God damn,

433
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,390
I Dunno what something big and
hairy. Abominable Snowman. Big Foot.

434
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,580
I don't. What if I was
fucking nuts? So sleepy.

435
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:03,470
I would have had something funny there.
You know,

436
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:06,590
once she starts fucking yell and
Marissa Girl's not going to bang you.

437
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,040
Okay.

438
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,940
You know what I mean?
Shane's snack a bag. Well,

439
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,410
maybe you should just lean into
Marissa just to be like, Hey,

440
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:17,900
let me ask you a question. Why do you
hang out with such ugly women? You know?

441
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,720
Well, what's your deal? What are you
insecure or something? I can't say.

442
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:23,460
What are your insecurity?
You got to keep it about the other one.

443
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,280
Do you have any good looking friends?
Just something.

444
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,920
Just something so you
can go down swinging.

445
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,003
Yeah.

446
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,180
I have no idea. Why am I excited
about the baseball season start?

447
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:39,560
I haven't watched baseball since
David Ortiz flunked some tests and I,

448
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,910
so it was like, you know what? Fuck this.

449
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,160
For some reason I'm
excited about baseball.

450
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,250
Okay.

451
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,930
I don't know why that is. Well bill, we
don't know either. Can you figure it out?

452
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:53,810
Can you say something funny about it? Are
you just gonna just leave it out there?

453
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,600
All right. This guy wants
money. Advice. Jesus Christ.

454
00:26:56,601 --> 00:27:01,580
There's no way I'm making an hour.
This is 27 minutes in and I'm flailing.

455
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,360
Absolutely flailing.
Um, so the damp towel,

456
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,320
um,
which rocky was that?

457
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,760
What was the one was that,

458
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,260
that was the one where Apollo creed
got fucking killed by the Russian.

459
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:26,130
I must break you right.
Those cheap bastards. Um,

460
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,750
money advice bill.
I'm an Otr truck driver.

461
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,110
What the fuck is that off track?

462
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:34,860
Okay.

463
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,140
Betting. What does that o t I
don't know what that is. All right,

464
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,420
I'll take your word for it.

465
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,450
I'm an Otr truck driver and have a
problem with blowing fucking money like a

466
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,284
politician.

467
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,970
I have a wonderful fiance with a great
head on her shoulders and she is great

468
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:54,870
with money. Uh, every time
I see the bank statements,

469
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:58,740
the balance is more and more so I know
she's doing a bang up job with our

470
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:01,230
finances. Well, let me
tell you something, sir.

471
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:06,230
You are one perceptive son
of a bitch. Um, Casein,

472
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,200
another beggar. And I know that
that must be a good thing. Um,

473
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:14,520
so what's the fucking problem
you say? Well, like I said,

474
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,940
I'm terrible with money,
so I got one of them.

475
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,410
I got one of them prepaid debit cards.
He literally wrote one of them.

476
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:26,110
I liked this guy,
talks like Elvis and every Tuesday payday,

477
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,300
my girl puts $50 on there
so I can get groceries.

478
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,160
That way I don't turn into one of these
fat shifts that eats every meal out out

479
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:39,900
of the Wendy's, out of the Wendy's.
Ah, God, this guy is great.

480
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,600
He's man and Dan loaded up at truck.

481
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,990
We go and do what they say can't be done.

482
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,650
We're gonna get some hookers
at the next truck stop.

483
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,510
We ain't can wear condoms and shoot some
drugs and we'll all get fuckin aids and

484
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,820
pass it all around. Um, well,

485
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,820
$50 is good for one week of groceries,

486
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,970
but it's like pulling fucking
and teeth for extra money.

487
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,420
Lock safe for drinks or some rubbers
now like for drinks or some extra

488
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:09,540
curriculars.

489
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,910
Am I an asshole for thinking I deserve
a few extra bucks or what the fuck bill,

490
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,500
by the way, Nia has a sexy fucking
voice and go fuck yourself.

491
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,053
Um,

492
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,610
are you an asshole for thinking you
deserve a few work? Starbucks? Absolutely.

493
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,110
The fact that that poor woman
is legally bound to you and you,

494
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,970
you have no concept of
how to hold on to money,

495
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,270
that would be like,
I mean,

496
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:40,230
you're a guy like you're supposed to
fucking earn a living to support a family,

497
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,710
right?
If you have no concept of that,

498
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:48,450
that would be like if she had no concept
of like how to have a baby or how to

499
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:52,680
blow somebody's, you know what I
mean? Cause that's what their job is.

500
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,300
Sucking Dick and make it
idiot.

501
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,143
Okay.

502
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,570
Ah,

503
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,690
God measured my end of the balls to run
for president after doing this podcast

504
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:10,880
for five years. How, how easy
would it be to take me down?

505
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,933
MMM.

506
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,830
Do.
Why don't you learn about money?

507
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,000
Do you really just want to float around
like with your fucking eyes wide open,

508
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:25,310
just not getting it and don't
you want to understand money?

509
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,660
She's given you 50 bucks a week.
You know why cause you to fucking stupid.

510
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:34,550
He gets 60 and I'm sure you can
crawl under a truck and modify it.

511
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,150
I'm not saying you straight across
the board dumb but to not to not to

512
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:41,420
understand money.
It's,

513
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,720
I swear to God dude is one of
the dumbest things you honestly,

514
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,441
and this is for everybody.

515
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:50,441
It's one of the dumbest things you could
ever do in life is I understand not

516
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:55,400
understanding money up to about 1819 but
once you're to the point where you can

517
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:59,630
go to a library, we can go on the Internet
and you can just just read up on it,

518
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,683
okay?

519
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,770
You don't understand money.

520
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:07,610
You're going to be behind the eight ball
for your entire fucking life and you're

521
00:31:07,611 --> 00:31:11,690
basically going to be an indentured
servant to credit card companies and banks

522
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,920
and your life is going to suck
way more than it needs to. Okay?

523
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,250
I'm not saying that just because
you understand money. When he a kid,

524
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:22,640
these isn't going to shit the bed.
Bad Shit's already going to happen.

525
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:25,760
You don't need to compound it
with not understanding money.

526
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,723
All right,

527
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,770
this woman is the best thing that
ever fucking happened to you.

528
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,720
You don't understand money and you
want monit for drinks and some extra

529
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,280
curriculars. What does
that mean? An eight ball?

530
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,550
If you start with drinks and then you say,

531
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:46,551
I like how safe or drinks or some extra
curriculars like boozing to you isn't

532
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:51,210
even an extra curricular
activity. That's just, you know,

533
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,390
let's like nourishment few.
So I'm,

534
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:59,310
I'm assuming that extra curriculars is
at least a bag of weed or maybe some

535
00:31:59,311 --> 00:32:03,750
condoms to bank some trucker
whore, truck stop whore, you know?

536
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,410
Listen sir,
you got a great fucking woman,

537
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:12,411
but she's only gonna put up with you not
understanding money for so long because

538
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:16,350
at some point she's going
to want a god damn man.

539
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,280
Okay.
Especially once you have a couple of kids,

540
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,430
she doesn't need you
being some adult kids.

541
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:27,431
So I would say read up on money and
you'd understand what a favor she's doing

542
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:30,210
for you. If you, if your
bank balance is going up,

543
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,450
you're doing better than 90% of
the people out there. All right?

544
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,201
So here's a good thing.

545
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:38,850
You got to fucking angel and she's
smart and just read up on money.

546
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,260
All right? She's also keeping
in shape. Go buy groceries.

547
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:45,210
Don't become a tub of shit.
You know,

548
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,050
she's basically without you even
realizing or possibly even her,

549
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,500
she's laying down the gauntlet here.

550
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,250
She's basically saying
in her own cute way.

551
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:56,910
I don't want to be married to
some fat broke trucker. All right,

552
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:57,930
so read up on money.

553
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:02,730
Keep eating your fucking pears and fruit
out there and a and you'll be fine.

554
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,640
All righty. There you go. Alright.

555
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,510
Hyphenating name a bill. My girl
was thinking about hype, uh,

556
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,070
of hyphenating. Did I say
hyperventilating earlier?

557
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,010
I can't even remember. Five
seconds ago. I'm this sleepy.

558
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,060
My girl was thinking of hyphenating
her name when we get married.

559
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,010
I'm not some archaic,
Patriarchal Nutcase,

560
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,750
but I think the whole concept is
absolutely ridiculous for one reason.

561
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,130
First of all, I love that. If you,

562
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:38,600
if you even disagree with some fucking
horseshit a woman's going to do at this

563
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:43,150
point, you always have to say,
no, I'm not some caveman, um,

564
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,480
sort of use goes. I think it's
absolutely ridiculous. For one reason.

565
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,600
Say we have a daughter and our daughter
wants to be like mommy and get her name

566
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:53,330
hyphenated.
Then she will have three names.

567
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,170
If she has a daughter does the same thing,
she will have four names.

568
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,470
Absolutely ridiculous.
Your thoughts? Yeah.

569
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:05,471
I would say that women hyphenating their
last names is basically the same as

570
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,560
that's like their prenup,
you know,

571
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:14,300
so they can just drop you off.
You know, if you get divorced,

572
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:17,390
they can just sort of chop you
off like an appendix, you know,

573
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,300
like you're this thing that
isn't really necessary,

574
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:24,530
but for some reasons it's still there,
but you can live without it, you know?

575
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,280
Um, look, she's either
marrying you or she isn't.

576
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,943
Okay.

577
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,220
Cause I gotta be honest with you when I'm
on the road in some married woman with

578
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:38,360
a hyphenated name comes up to me.
I think I'm 50% in the game.

579
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,570
Hey, I'm not fucking Sarah and
Russell. I'm just trying to fuck Sarah.

580
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:49,490
Anne, why don't you drop
the Russell to not baby? No,

581
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,400
I'm just fucking with you.
What do I think about that? Um,

582
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:54,783
yeah,

583
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,000
I dunno. A woman with a hyphenated
last name to me that's a red flag.

584
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,040
That's a red flag that says to
me that she does want a husband.

585
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,410
She wants a wife.
Uh,

586
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,570
she's going to be a terrible mother
and she's going to focus on her career.

587
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,080
That's what I think. But then
again, I'm ignorant. You know,

588
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,080
what are you gonna be
[inaudible] Zimbalist Jr.

589
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,720
What does a good fucking hyphenated
name doesn't? That chick who, uh,

590
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,670
that raven haired beauty. Who married
Michael Douglas? Isn't her name? Like a

591
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,980
from Zito Jones.

592
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,880
Catherine Zeta Jones Douglas. Is that how
she has it? She just kept her last name.

593
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,160
Look at me and Nia ever get fucking

594
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,970
marriage. She goes, I don't want to take
your last name or I want to hyphenate it.

595
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:46,710
I'd be like, you know, it just, you know,
don't fucking, you know, don't, don't,

596
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,180
don't pander to me here.
All right.

597
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,730
I, you just either you're fucking
taking my name where you're not,

598
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:58,080
you're not doing this fucking hyphenated
shit. Give your own last name.

599
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:58,890
I don't give a fuck,

600
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,890
but our kids are going to have my last
name because I'm the God damn man and I'm

601
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:07,980
stronger than you. That's how it's going
down. I gotta be honest with you. I don't,

602
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,380
that hyphenated name thing
is fucking weird to me.

603
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,010
I think you should either just be like,
look, I'm not taking your, your last name.

604
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,560
And it just be done with it. Or the
hyphenated name is, uh, you know,

605
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,600
I noticed that a lot of chicks, uh, on,

606
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,750
on Facebook do that so they
can get in touch with guys.

607
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:28,170
They used to bang back in high school
and college so he can still be found,

608
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,780
you know, that's what
I think. There you go.

609
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,920
I think she's got a wild streak in her.
I don't think she's ready to settle down.

610
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,200
She doesn't want that barn door to close.
She'll go into the bomb.

611
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,550
Don't close that door. She's going to
start kicking, um, advice. Hey Bill,

612
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,940
I need some advice. Oh, I didn't give you
any way. What do you think about it? Yeah,

613
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:51,750
I think it is fucking ridiculous.
All right.

614
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,510
Just say, look, if I'm going to pay for
your fucking life, who's kidding? Who?

615
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,500
That's what's going to happen.
You got to pay for it one way or another.

616
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:02,400
You are going to pay for it.

617
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:05,100
You're gonna have most of the fucking
financial responsibilities and you're

618
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:09,780
going to die before she does. That's
basically how it goes, you know?

619
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,960
Can you at least just take my fucking
last name and act like you're with me.

620
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,660
Fucking unappreciative son of a bitch.
Advice a bill.

621
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,450
I need some advice badly.
Uh,

622
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,260
I got a fucking delicate situation I'm
working with and I'm not sure how to

623
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:29,350
handle it. I swear to God this is
how this guy's writing. I like,

624
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,830
it's very conversational.
A little pertinent. Uh,

625
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:36,880
first I'm 20,
I'm a 20 year old living with my parents.

626
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,280
My 21st is the 20th.

627
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,950
It's like a math problem for train
leaves at 20 in the 21st is on the 20th.

628
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,270
Um, mid April. I plan
on getting a vasectomy.

629
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,680
I do not want advice about this.
Well, you're going to get judged.

630
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,490
What are you low?
You will those population people.

631
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,640
I haven't gotten laid in
about a year and a half story.

632
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:08,690
Last Friday the ninth, there was a
party at a friend's house. Kelly's,

633
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,860
her parents were out of town
and she was a senior and Ah,

634
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,920
what did I say?
Her name is she of age.

635
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,390
Everyone was drinking lots of fun
parties winding down and we go upstairs.

636
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:24,530
Saturday morning, I woke up in her bed,
we go to breakfast, had a real nice time.

637
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,950
Saturday night, I go over
no party, just great sex.

638
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,400
I suggest a new position.
She loses her mind,

639
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,650
says it was the best sex of her life.
It's a great story so far.

640
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,540
What could go wrong? As we're cuddling,
falling asleep Saturday into Sunday,

641
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I casually suggest that we should
never date and she completely agrees.

642
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,690
Oh my God, this girl's a fucking
angel. What could go wrong?

643
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:52,670
Right back step a little bit.

644
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,910
I broke up with my very
unserious girlfriend and also
a senior at the same high

645
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:03,320
school about two or three
weeks ago saying, I want a
more serious relationship.

646
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,580
Completely true. Uh,
the fucking challenges.

647
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,820
Should I try and keep this thing
going or quit while I'm ahead?

648
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,000
Uh, the only potential
downside is if word gets out.

649
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,500
It would put a lot of strain on the
relationship with one of my extremely good

650
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:23,630
friends. Also, my ex best friend are,

651
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:26,230
I see a bang in your x
best friend's girlfriend.

652
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,970
Uh, do I need to read
the rest of this? Yeah.

653
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,020
Quit while you're ahead,
dude,

654
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,140
unless you don't give a
shit about your best friend.

655
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,980
MMM,

656
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,590
yeah. That's what I would do. I
would get the fuck out. Let me,

657
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:49,840
let me reread that again in case
I messed. Messed it up. Sorry.

658
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:53,170
I'm fucking half asleep here. The only
potential downside is if word gets out.

659
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,920
He'll put a lot of Susan as a, with
one of my extremely good friends. Also,

660
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:58,930
my ex ex,
his best friend.

661
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,930
Dude, I can't do the math on that. I'm
too fucking tired. Itchy. I you obviously,

662
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,320
you're basically,
as far as I can tell,

663
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:12,590
there's a cocktail party right around
the corner and you're on just the other

664
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:16,200
side of the wall banging the bosses. Girl
says something going on it yet, Dude.

665
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,750
Get the fuck out. Pull the ripcord. You
banged her. It was great. You're young.

666
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,500
It's going to be another Ra
that there's going to be others.

667
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,070
Don't worry about it. All
right. All I can tell you this.

668
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:30,830
Don't get a vasectomy so you don't
have to wear a condom. Wear a condom.

669
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,000
All right. Definitely do that. You
don't need that shit. All right.

670
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:38,960
You don't need any of that shit that comes
along with dead fucking level. Christ,

671
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,300
what do we have two guys?
Can I tap out early?

672
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,200
You guys ever go sick early on a
Friday. You go home, I a tummy ache.

673
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,521
I want to go home.
Right?

674
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:50,120
And then you go down to the local bar
and you start fucking drinking, right?

675
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:50,631
Then all of a sudden,

676
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:55,340
some girl in a gene fucking skirt starts
dance a little provocatively and next

677
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:58,400
thing you know, yell and
college. Boy, you're next, right?

678
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,430
Um, God Lord, was that an accused? Yes,

679
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:08,210
it was a Bon Jovi car. Everybody.
I'm blown. Hey, you know what?

680
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:11,990
I think it's time for advertising.
Oh,

681
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:15,710
great timing on this one. Um, oh,

682
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:19,280
amazon.com everybody,
if you're thinking about buying any,

683
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:21,590
let me just get through all the
fucking ads so we can get back to the

684
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:24,650
unbelievably mediocre level of
funny that I'm bringing this week.

685
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,900
amazon.com everybody. All
right. If you think going to go,

you thinking about buying something,
not saying you got it,

687
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,540
but if you thinking of buying something,

688
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,120
all right on amazon.com and you'd like

they give me a little kickback and I
take 10% of the kickback and I give it to

696
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:07,220
the wounded warriors project.
There you go. Bing, Bang,

697

boom.
All done.

helped out the wounded warriors.

699
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,780
And I just realized, you know, we'd be
fucked up is what if I got a Afghanistan,

700
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,160
amazon.com in 10% of it went to
the wounded warriors. You know,

You have the post office in your house.
Okay,

711
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:05,420
you're doing that while you hit

712
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,230
And then if you go to buy a
fucking beanie on amazon.com,

713
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:13,280
you can help out the wounded warriors,
you know,

714
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,330
and helped me make my garage doors
wider. Everybody's winning. Um,

715
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,690
here's something that's really
been doing well. The skate fenders,

716
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:21,524
people are buying them.

717
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,890
People are sending me emails
telling me they're loving him.

718
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:28,590
Tell him to taking pucks in their foot and
they can barely even feel, feel it. Um,

719
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,680
go to escape fenner.com and type
in the Promotional Code Bill Burr,

720
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,990
all lowercase. No, uh,

721
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,250
no space for $5 off scape fenders.
I highly recommend them.

722
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,960
I'm playing hockey tomorrow night.

723
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:46,610
I'm putting them on and I'm going to be
a shot block and motherfucker cause I

724
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:50,480
got protection on my feet. Skate
fender.com. All right, there you go.

725
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:55,340
That's it for those. That's it for
those. And Oh hey, do you see this shit?

726
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,750
Did you see this shit about the
fucking guy who's got the, you know,

727
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:04,760
he went over to, he went over to
Uganda, that Guy Kony Kony 2012.

728
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,870
You see that? You see how quickly
they brought that guy down?

729
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,390
This guy's shines a light on the,
uh, on himself first and foremost,

730
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:19,070
and how he and his child or dealing
with it, which was really bizarre.

731
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,690
I mean,
I don't know about you guys,

732
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:25,430
but it was enough for me to see the boy
soldier crying cause he saw his brother

733
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,040
have his next sliced right
in front of him, you know,

734
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,280
and he goes from that to be a,

735
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,070
now I'm going to sit my son down and
tell him about the, it's like, Whoa,

736
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,450
I didn't even get it.
All right.

737
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:42,611
So anyways,

738
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:45,730
this guy shines a light on this bullshit
that's going on over there and all of a

739
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:47,530
sudden everybody's in
an uproar of a sudden.

740
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:52,120
Everybody gives a fuck about Uganda
and these boys soldiers, you know?

741
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,420
Then all of a sudden the United States
government is going to do with fighting

742
00:44:55,421 --> 00:44:58,960
two wars. We can't even afford to fight
one. Now this guy's bringing this shit up.

743
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,060
Gee, wouldn't it be nice if something
fucking happened that would discredit him?

744
00:45:04,061 --> 00:45:06,910
Next thing you know, a
couple of days later, a,

745
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:11,620
this guy connected with the film from
Dec Kony 2012 gets caught jerking off in

746
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:12,454
public.

747
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,050
Was I the only guy who found that
unbelievably fucking convenient?

748
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,790
I didn't buy it for a second. In fact,
I tweeted, you know, back in the day,

749
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,270
they used to assassinate you. Now they
just do this. You know what I mean?

750
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:28,570
If they can make it look like
we landed on the moon in 1969,

751
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:32,080
you don't think that they can make you
anybody they want make it look like

752
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:35,110
you're rubbing one out in the
fucking parking lot. I don't buy it.

753
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:36,660
Okay.

754
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,700
What that fucking Douche bag was doing,
not douche bag. That fucking self-serving.

755
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,900
Cont there we go.
That's what I was trying to say.

756
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:47,160
What he was doing with that film was
he was putting pressure on the United

757
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,160
States to go over there and fucking
somehow insert themselves into that

758
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:54,600
situation, which would have cost
a ton of fucking money, you know?

759
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,030
But there's no way to be like,
hey, fuck those boys soldiers,

760
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,660
you know, because of the,
uh, the way the coop,

761
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,220
because of what it says in our pamphlet,
you know, give a shit or your week,

762
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:12,360
give us your poor and will exploit
the shit out of them and uh,

763
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,310
let him die of tuberculosis in a
damp apartment. And then years later,

764
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,830
whoever made the most amount of
money gets a statue made out of them.

765
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,880
That's all in our thing.

766
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,180
So we can't look the other way
with these fucking boy soldiers.

767
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,920
So what's easiest thing to do? Just just
make that guy look like a freak show.

768
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,750
Okay.

769
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,300
First of all, who hasn't jerked
off in a parking lot? Honestly?

770
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,710
You know who hasn't done that?
You know,

771
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,820
you fucking girl goes in to change
something. You sit in there, your board,

772
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,950
you can't get any radio reception
cause you know, it's back in the day.

773
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:48,330
He just say, yeah, I'm bored. Right?

774
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,620
He got a girl in your life.
So you know,

775
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:55,430
there's gonna be some sort of Napkins
in the car. What are you going to dope?

776
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:58,790
Right? You got the captain's
chairs? No one could see ya.

777
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,590
Yeah.

778
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,730
Oh, this is taking forever. Hey,
what if I rub one out, right? Yeah.

779
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,130
Everybody's got a fucking camera.
You know,

780
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,890
you know what's amazing is that everybody
hasn't got caught jerking off in

781
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:14,860
public at this point. Everybody's got a
camera in their, uh, their cell phone.

782
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,390
What I'm trying to say people is I
don't buy it and it doesn't matter.

783
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,420
I don't give a fuck whether the guy from
Coney was jerking off in a parking lot

784
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:29,020
or not. That doesn't change whether
or not this boy soldiers in Uganda.

785
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,700
But what's great is,

786
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:35,701
is then the conversation switches from
what's going on over there to low let's

787
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,480
this guide Dylan,
he's he rubbing his deck like we all do

788
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,120
and then everybody would be like,
yeah, but we don't do it in public out.

789
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:49,300
So what that makes you better.
It doesn't make you better.

790
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,300
It just makes you more considerate,
doesn't it?

791
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,390
I mean if you had two people and they
were both shooting heroin and one person

792
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:01,770
had the decency to do it in their house
and the other person does it out in

793
00:48:01,771 --> 00:48:04,950
public, at the end of the
day, you both drug addicts.

794
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:08,550
So if you're really going to sit there
and shit on this guy for jerking off,

795
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:11,280
then you would have to
basically be not jerking off

796
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,220
at all.
Right.

797
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:21,710
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I'm asking you to look into your hearts.

798
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,530
If you have not rubbed one out,

799
00:48:24,531 --> 00:48:28,790
let he who is not rubbed one
out in some sort of pump. No,

800
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:33,130
you'd have a jerked off at work.
God, I'm fucking bored. Excuse me,

801
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:37,370
let me go to the bathroom. Maybe they
think I'm taking a shit standing up.

802
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,590
Right.
Come on.

803
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,740
If you're a guy in your arms along enough,

804
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:50,250
at some point you've jerked off in
some place where you shouldn't have.

805
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,990
You jerked off to somebody you
shouldn't have. You've done it.

806
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,230
We've all been there.
Who gives a fuck?

807
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,730
There's still boys fighting in
wars over this. So you know,

808
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,910
if you want to help out, help
out. If you don't, don't,

809
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:08,430
but don't let some guy rubbing
one out in a parking lot.

810
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,290
Change your mind either way.

811
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,080
You know what they're doing right now
that doing what women do when they argue

812
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,690
when they start to lose is they bring
up other shit and they spin it into a

813
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,630
different room.
And next thing you know,

814
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,130
you're arguing a whole different argument
and argument that they wanted you to

815
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:28,851
fucking argue.

816
00:49:28,851 --> 00:49:32,240
So they knew that they could win rather
than keeping the argument on fucking

817
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:34,430
track of saying,
listen sweetheart,

818
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,630
I don't like the way you fucking
been dressing lately. Okay?

819
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:42,630
I gotten this relationship to treat
you like a piece of fucking meat.

820
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,490
All right? And lately you've
been slacking off. Oh God.

821
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,060
Let me adjust my weight. Maybe the
funnies on this side of the couch. Um,

822
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,730
what else? What do we got here? Come on
bill. You got another 11 minutes? Huh?

823
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,910
You know, I feel like right now,
like if I was in the tort of fraud,

824
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:07,280
I would actually, I would be in
the Pyrenees right now. All right.

825
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:11,300
And My podcast is that one bald
motherfucker with the bracelet.

826
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,580
And he just looked back at
me to see all I'm doing.

827
00:50:13,581 --> 00:50:17,390
He seen my fucking mouth hanging open
and now he's going into fucking second

828
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:20,450
gear and I'm going to lose this stage.
Okay.

829
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,130
Except the Lance Armstrong is
my fucking podcast this week.

830
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,130
If he didn't get the metaphor,
was that a metaphor?

831
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:32,690
It wasn't as similarly
similarly is like her as right.

832
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:40,160
My podcast is like, I always want to say
Greg Lamont. What a Douche that guy is.

833
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:44,030
Greg Lamont. I still can't get over
how he talks trash about Lance fucking,

834
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:48,110
uh, all worth whatever the fuck
his name is. What does it lance,

835
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:52,910
what went lance Whitaker, you
only won seven bike races. Bill.

836
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:57,110
What the fuck you've ever done? Did I
ever even win a bike race in my childhood?

837
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,191
You know,

838
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:02,000
I try to beat my brother one time in a
bike race and that mother fucker always

839
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:05,570
beat me because he had big legs,
you know,

840
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,090
and I had little legs,
little bitchy lakes,

841
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,980
and our driveway was a hill. And so we
don't, and we lived on this busy street,

842
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:19,730
so we'd always have to fucking
stop and then, you know,

843
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:22,730
look both ways and then cross the
fucking streets. So from a dead stop,

844
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:24,710
I can have a good,
I could have a beat this son of a bitch.

845
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:29,930
So one day we'll race and home and I
come up with a brilliant fucking idea.

846
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:33,500
I'm like in second grade,
I know what I'll cross while we're racing.

847
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,660
When he goes to stop,

848
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,130
I'll be all we going up the driveway and
I'll get to beat him and his fucking Bo

849
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,000
Jackson thighs right up the goddamn
driveway. And uh, I swear to God,

850
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,230
I turned around and I looked,

851
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:50,000
evidently I didn't look well enough and
I fucking pulled out right in front of a,

852
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,120
a jeep and all I heard was

853
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:58,070
boom, right. Next thing you
know, I'm fucking upside down.

854
00:51:59,210 --> 00:51:59,810
Okay.

855
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,810
And I vaguely remember seeing the bumper
and feeling the heat of the engine at.

856
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,790
Uh, and then like, I dunno,

857
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:12,410
like two seconds later I was open my
eyes and I was laying across the yellow

858
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:15,080
double line on the road.

859
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:20,081
I was out for like literally like fucking
five seconds long because by the time

860
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:23,720
I stood up to get out of the street,

861
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:27,350
the guy in the jeep had already got out
this big son of a bitch and he was crying

862
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,100
and he came up and he's like,
I'll buy a new bike.

863
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:37,730
My bike was all mangled and all I was
thinking was my dad's going to fucking

864
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:42,290
kill me for fucking up my bike
because that's how it was in the 70s.

865
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,830
All right.
I know if that happened to a kid nowadays,

866
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,280
my parents would have sued the guy in
the jeep for everything he was fucking

867
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:49,850
worth.

868
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:54,320
And then bought me a bicycle made out of
gold and that guy's four o one k plan.

869
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:58,310
Right?
But this was the 70s people didn't sue.

870
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,420
People yelled at kids for being dumb
when they did dumb shit. So I was like,

871
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:05,330
oh my God, they're going to fucking kill
me and my bike's all fucking mangled.

872
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,050
And um, then I went to the
hospital, we'll taxi cab.

873
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:12,920
I told this story before.

874
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:16,250
I remember that I told you I got hit
right on the side of the fucking head.

875
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,840
It happened on a Wednesday.

876
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,630
I remember it happened on
a Wednesday because then I
didn't have to go to school.

877
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,310
The Guy said he has to go to
school for the rest of the week.

878
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:26,400
So I've got Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday off and all was fucked up about me,

879
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,330
was on the side of my head. Puts
you, put your fingers on the side of,

880
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:33,240
get your temples right now, right.
And bite down on your molars.

881
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,960
You doing that already know you feel
that little thing that goes in and out.

882
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:40,590
That's right where I got hit.
So it hurt to chew.

883
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,280
So for four days I was a little spoon.

884
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,890
I didn't know I was just such,
it was fucking awesome.

885
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:54,110
I didn't have to fake sick and they have
to pretend that I was sick and for four

886
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:56,780
days,
which is a goddamn maternity.

887
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:58,570
Yeah,

888
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:02,330
I got to fucking chill out.
54 minutes.

889
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:06,660
Um Oh God, Jesus Christ. I don't know how
you fucking people do this. This is like,

890
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,800
this is like your work week. Isn't
it just staring at the fucking clock.

891
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,500
Um,
or you know,

892
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:17,330
it was make fun of how Bon Jovi can
somehow sell out giant stadiums in New

893
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:22,100
Jersey, but for some reason can't sell
out a, a fucking Denny's. And in Oregon,

894
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,170
I don't even know if that's true.
I just like shitting on him. Um,

895
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,130
somebody wrote and said, hey
bill, I love the podcast.

896
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:31,910
I know one of your vaccine questions of
our age is why the fuck is Bon Jovi so

897
00:54:31,911 --> 00:54:36,230
popular in New Jersey? I get that they're
from, from there by giant stadium.

898
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:41,690
Anyways, he goes, I'm a u s service
members stationed overseas in Germany.

899
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,700
When I first moved here two years ago,

900
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:48,701
I saw a Volkswagen in my town with a
Bon Jovi sticker on the side of the car.

901
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,990
I thought,
Holy Shit,

902
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:55,991
that is one dedicated fan and wouldn't
be funny if VW really made a Bon Jovi

903
00:54:56,151 --> 00:55:00,770
edition of the vehicle while I started
seeing the car elsewhere in Germany.

904
00:55:00,771 --> 00:55:02,990
And finally I googled it.
It's real.

905
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:08,260
The attach photo is a picture I
took on the base of a VW Bon Jovi.

906
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,140
Yeah. And it's not a sticker.
It's literally like the emblem,

907
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:15,950
like on the side of your car.
If it says Prius or Monte Carlo.

908
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:21,770
Right. Um, isn't that funny? That
Chevy named that car. A Monte Carlo.

909
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:27,630
You ever seen Monte Carlo Monte Carlo
that's in France and it has like fucking

910
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,430
like that's all the Illuminati money
in an America. It's some shitty accent.

911
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:36,290
Shitty. It's a good looking car.
Back in the 80s, it was, but come on,

912
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,030
you know there was a poor man's caddy.
It's a poor man's Buick anyways.

913
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,080
They actually, it's, it's the
uh, yeah, like, like whatever.

914
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,760
It's the make not the make
not to make,

915
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:54,780
what the fuck is it? They say make
type. I don't fucking know. I'm sleepy.

916
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,770
It's on the side of the God damn fucking
car. We got a picture of it, everybody

917
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,980
in order to feel like right now,

918
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:06,210
I feel like one of those guys who gives
those double decker tour bus guys,

919
00:56:06,211 --> 00:56:10,050
you know, and I don't know shit about
the city and I will give a fuck.

920
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,490
Somebody hooked me up with a job. I
sort of feel like, um, and it was,

921
00:56:14,491 --> 00:56:16,890
that's the podcast for this
week. Everybody, I apologize.

922
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,410
I take full responsibility.
This, I'm going to do this.

923
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,320
Like when an athlete blows a game and he,
the press is going to trash them.

924
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:28,210
So he just jumps on the fucking grenade
before they throw it in his face.

925
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,990
I take full responsibility for that loss.
Said I didn't, I didn't get it done.

926
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,440
I didn't get it done. All right. Shows
I have coming up. All right, you can't.

927
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,860
I want to be at the dupont theater.
Wilmington,

928
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:43,861
Delaware on March 30th
or March 35th 31st 35th,

929
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:48,100
Jesus Bill, wake up. March 31st

930
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:54,660
the cavalcade of humor continues when
bill burr shows up to Massachusetts own

931
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:58,960
bill Burroughs shows up to the
music hall in Troy, New York.

932
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:04,150
On April 1st I'll be at the Tarrytown
music hall with Paul [inaudible],

933
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:08,790
Paul [inaudible] near Jersey's
own, Paul Versey, who's a,

934
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:12,880
uh,
he's a jets and a giants fan.

935
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:16,960
He's one of those guys, whoever's
winning, he becomes a fan of them. Um,

936
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:21,160
April 27th, I'm doing a college
gig and this is open to the public.

937
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:25,510
This is very rare. This is a
situation that does not occur a lot.

938
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,790
Hence a rare situation. I'm going to
be at a Concord College in Concord,

939
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,870
New Hampshire.
All right.

940
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:37,010
On April 27th and I have all the
links here on a billboard.com.

941
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:40,730
You just click on shows and then you
click on the go button next to the Gig.

942
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:42,070
You want to go to the next thing you know,

943
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,460
you go into the fucking show unless you
girl gets sick and doesn't want it go.

944
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,380
And then you got to eat
the fucking tickets. Renew,

945
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:51,080
resent her when she falls asleep.
You give,

946
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,620
give her paper cuts with tickets
between her toes. Um, June 15th,

947
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:01,910
16th and 17th. I want to be in
San Jose, California. Vacationing.

948
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:07,000
No, I want to be at the Improv. San Jose,
California. June 15th through the 17th.

949
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,690
And if that's,
if that's city isn't enticing enough,

950
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,410
you could then it like the grateful dead.

951
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:17,260
Follow me to another luxurious city,

952
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,620
a place called Ontario,
California,

953
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,400
part of the inland empire that
conquered the middle region of southern

954
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:31,040
California hundreds of years ago.
Uh,

955
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,760
can we get the Ontario
Improv on June 29th,

956
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:37,780
30th and July 1st those are going to be
great shows because I hate that city.

957
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,850
So I will be extra conti and probably a
lot funnier than I am on this podcast.

958
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:46,510
And the last one I have for you, uh, for
you. White trash people. Anybody out?

959
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:51,190
They got a mullet wallet. I
got to, I got back to back,

960
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:56,050
back to back now, July
13th, 14th and 15th.

961
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,620
I'm at the Improv in West Palm Beach.
All right.

962
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,300
And if that isn't white trash enough for
you, I'm going to be in Orlando, Florida,

963
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:08,890
home of Disney world,
the Epcot Center. And uh,

964
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:14,470
the, uh, the day after pill, the
morning after, what do they call it?

965
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:19,510
A Orlando, Florida. And we had the Orlando
Improv September 7th, eighth and ninth.

966
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,930
And finally I'll be at the Bray
Improv September 21st 22nd,

967
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:29,240
23rd. And I know what you thinking while
bill, those are a lot of club dates.

968
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,570
That was a lot of shows you going to
do there. You're kind of fucking old.

969
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,780
What are you doing all those shows for
a while? I'll tell you why everybody.

970
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:39,500
I'm building up my new hour.
All right. I'm building up.

971
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,880
My new are supposed to learn how
to ride a fucking motorcycle today,

972
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:44,730
but it was supposed to rain so they,
everybody canceled it.

973
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,510
So hopefully next week I'll have some
stories about me trying to learn how to

974
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:49,710
ride a motorcycle or something.

975
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:54,540
Hopefully I'll have something remotely
remotely funny few people. Okay.

976
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:57,750
That's the podcast for this
week, everybody. And, uh,

977
00:59:57,751 --> 01:00:01,800
I think it's very fitting for me to end
with the exact amount of energy I have

978
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:06,780
right now in this tone
of voice. All right. Oh,

979
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:09,270
youtube video of the week
for drummers out there.

980
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,200
Why don't you guys look up the drew
groove applied to the modern drum set.

981
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:16,680
Have all these videos up
on the, uh, I'm sorry,

982
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,310
on billboard.com on the podcast page.
There we go.
