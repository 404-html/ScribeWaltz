1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,723
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,760
It's bill burn is time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:10,640
January 18th, 2016.
How's it going out? Why?

4
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:12,630
Yeah.
Uh,

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,610
I am recording this Sunday
afternoon and, uh, in Vancouver,

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,140
Canada doing two shows here tonight.
It's halftime,

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,160
actually third quarter just started
of the Bronco Steelers. I missed, uh,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,540
Seattle and a Carolina. I know that
must have been a great fucking game.

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,120
It kills me. You know, you
never know when your book,

10
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:36,060
the fucking gigs that have game
like that is going to be on. But uh,

11
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:39,960
I imagined that that was as
good as the score looked.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,110
And of course I'm up here in Canada
and uh, I dunno, they don't have,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,560
they just went to boomer and all those
guys at halftime and all they did was

14
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:50,900
interview Cam Newton. They asked him one
question, you know, he didn't answer.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,630
He just talked, didn't give an
answer about anything. They like,

16
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:59,370
what do you think it did?
The, uh, the second half to,
uh, you know, uh, blah, blah,

17
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,000
blah. And he just goes, well, you
know, our offense and our defense.

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,560
And of course the special teams,
you know,

19
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:06,920
everybody's got a job to do when they
get out there and they tried to get done.

20
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,710
And unfortunately today we were able to
get out there and execute some of the

21
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,990
things we'll be working with
all this week. And uh, you know,

22
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,380
next week we've got another person
that we're going to be playing.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,820
I should set a team, not a person who
we had on the team are going to play.

24
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:18,350
I know. We just hope that, uh, you know,

25
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:20,240
we're just going to try to keep
it going because, uh, you know,

26
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,310
we're all trying to win
a championship here.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,230
Yeah.

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,420
And by then you're just like, what
the fuck did I even ask you? Um,

29
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,790
I wonder if, you know, cause athletes,

30
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,400
anything they fucking say they're going
to take it out of context. So they just,

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,430
they get trained to just answer and not
say anything. Just like a politician.

32
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,790
I wonder if you could fucking
turn that off. You know,

33
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,540
if you stay in the league long enough,
if you drive your wife and that's,

34
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,810
you know,
hi.

35
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,220
Well you know,
you're your own a lot of stuff at uh,

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,110
sometimes that stuff gets misplaced at Oh,

37
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,010
you can do is just try to fire on all
cylinders and try to find the things that

38
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:58,870
you could have in a, if you can
find them, you can find them.

39
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:01,990
And if you can't a then you've got to move
on to the next thing. But uh, you know,

40
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:02,530
it was always,

41
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,870
I'm always looking towards the next week
and then another thing that's going to

42
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:06,160
be lost in,
I've just lost,

43
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,540
while we're definitely going to do
everything we can to find it, uh,

44
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,240
the offense defense,
special teams.

45
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,430
Um, anyways, uh, yeah. So
I'm up here in Vancouver.

46
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:23,420
God dammit. It's fucking beautiful
up here. Fucking gorgeous man.

47
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,000
Especially when you live in, uh,
you know where the hell I live,

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,080
which was not designed to have really
anybody living there other than I guess

49
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:33,800
maybe some indigenous people
sending smoke signals, you know,

50
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,730
probably sending smoke signals said,
you know, can you find any food?

51
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:38,564
Cause we can't.

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,250
I'm sick of eating snake and do you
want to get the fuck Outta here?

53
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,380
However the fuck you do
that with smoke signals,

54
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,870
it must have been pretty God damn simple,
right?

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,950
The smoke signals if they even did it
or is that just another Hollywood thing

56
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,830
that they threw a ball? I mean,
how do you even fucking do that?

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,540
I guess she had to go. Obviously
you've got to put the fire out, right?

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,790
How the fuck would you do that? You
know? All right. One big pop for fucking.

59
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,800
She had to know what kind of wood to burn.
What a pain in the ass.

60
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,390
Jesus Christ you.
I'm going to get lost it.

61
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:16,180
I remember getting lost at the
mall before a fucking cell phone.

62
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,960
That was unbelievable. Forget about back
then. If you get lost or you are fucked.

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,800
Okay.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,220
Anybody see a,
what the fuck was that guy's name?

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,640
Oh, fucking red face. Where the ego
done. I mean, how long do you look?

66
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,780
You can't really yell.
You're going to attract wild animals.

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,290
It's walking around the woods.
Hey Eddie.

68
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,640
Eddie the fuck are you.
This isn't funny man.

69
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,960
Anyways, but you come up here
after leaving the desert.
Um, whenever I see at the,

70
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,720
say the desert, I always think
of a that awesome. They're great.

71
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,920
Greg Giraldo rest his soul joke where
he says did that whole thing about, uh,

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,940
how eloquent the words, the
words, the notes were that, uh,

73
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,600
soldiers wrote during the civil war,
you know,

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,280
versus some of the letters from
people coming back from re Iraq.

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,850
Uh, what am I, I can't
remember how the it went.

76
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,860
It's really hard to be out here with
the ball sticking g leg out here in the,

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,930
in the desert.

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,090
And I remember the difference between
desert and desert. Two s's for dessert,

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,350
more calories. Right. There
you go. That's how I do it.

80
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,740
And don't even ask me to spell restaurant
cause I won't even fucking remember.

81
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:40,240
So anyways, I'm up here in Vancouver,
so we go to fucking land, um, and just,

82
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,960
Oh my God. All the lush greenery,
all the lakes, all low water,

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,040
everything we don't have down in La,
beautiful houses.

84
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,980
I guess it's expensive as shit up
here. And they were saying how, um,

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,250
a lot of Asian people, um, you
know, not indigenous foreigners,

86
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,650
you know,
they got to get rid of that fucking money.

87
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,630
They get to wash their money or
I don't know what the fuck it is.

88
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,520
Their government's going to take it all.
So they uh,

89
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,890
use this place up here like a Swiss
bank and they buy like super expensive

90
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,210
places for cash.

91
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,183
MMM.

92
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,870
Which drives the housing market
up. It's fucking nuts, man.

93
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,230
Anytime you go to another country you
just see the shit that they're fucking

94
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,600
dealing with. I just, you know, you always
think like, he come up here, candidate,

95
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,970
it's going to have no fucking problems.
You know,

96
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:27,820
you watch one Michael Moore documentary
that just gives you a complete like

97
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,090
misinterpretation of what the fuck
is going on up here. Um, so they,

98
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:34,920
I guess they had to make some sort of law

99
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,813
mmm.

100
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,270
That you couldn't do something like that.
I can't make him up.

101
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,580
The fucking person told them went all
the way while the way to the fucking

102
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,270
supreme court.

103
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,140
It was like a group of people from Asia
that was so rich that they actually sued

104
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:51,700
an entire country for not letting
them either come into the country or,

105
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,620
uh, by a bunch of shit over here that
drove the housing market and stuff up or

106
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,600
something that, or by their citizenship,
I can't even fucking remember.

107
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,010
But that's the charm of this podcast.
You know, I get a little information,

108
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,430
I barely remember half of it and I
just fucking run with it. That's all.

109
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,050
Um, so anyways, um,

110
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,580
so it went all the way to the supreme
court and then they would just finally

111
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,690
like, ah, yeah,

112
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,630
you kind of have to be from this
country for us to give a fuck about you,

113
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,090
you know, to like win a
lawsuit. So a, see you later.

114
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,630
And that's in an ended, I guess the
lawyer for them new the whole way,

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,760
going all the way up that it
wasn't going to happen, you know,

116
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,410
they weren't going to win it
and he just took that money.

117
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,480
He probably had to sit there and work on
is uh, I'm disappointed we lost to face,

118
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,460
you know, as he took all their
fucking money. But anyways,

119
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,130
so let's talk about NFL
football. What pop pop. Pop Gate.

120
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,120
A car. He didn't get it in.
Um, the fucking patriots.

121
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,160
They want God dammit.

122
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,060
Thank Christ they won then
Christ day one in Seattle.

123
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:03,290
Los Thank Christ. You know, if
we're going to keep advancing,

124
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,840
I just didn't want Seattle to get to
revenge. You can't remember if I've,

125
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,770
if I've already said this,

126
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:10,500
I just didn't want to see Seattle get
the revenge on a bagged up Patriot team.

127
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:14,880
If we come become healthy and they kick
our ass good on them. But uh, you know,

128
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,790
congratulations to the Carolina Panthers.

129
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,410
They gotta be the favorites at this point.
Come on this 16 and fucking one. Right.

130
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,690
Got that young defense then that scared
as shit. They just beat Seattle. Right.

131
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,130
Who knows? But, um, I don't
know shit about football.

132
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:34,010
I've just been so fucking busy, so
I'm, I'm still going to talk about it.

133
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,720
You guys can keep trashing me that I
don't know. Shit. I don't give a fuck. Um,

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,531
and by the way,

135
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:44,090
this is why I never record on a day that
I flew because my brain is even more

136
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,620
all over the place than it usually is,

137
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,400
especially when I got a fucking TV
going on in the background. But uh,

138
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,990
you know, I got, I got too busy
fucking datum. I fly back tomorrow.

139
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:57,830
You got a busy fucking day. So I
apologize if this is all over the place,

140
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,120
even more than usual.
I as a first down for this

141
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,750
fucking 25. Oh, somebody else up here.

142
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:11,230
It gives a shit about NFL football.
I know they,

143
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:15,230
a CFL ends and like is it the end of
November? They have the Great Cup,

144
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,370
which is their super bowl or
is it a December? I don't know.

145
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,480
The people even give a shit.

146
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,060
You ever see the fucking stadiums
for their football teams up here?

147
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,710
It's like you sit in the stands,
you can see your car, you know,

148
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,660
one of those deals where
there's like a fucking,

149
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,470
you watch them kick a field
goal and you're looking at
traffic driving by on the

150
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:38,020
street, like those old
school football stadium, uh,

151
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,460
from like the sixties and seventies.
You know,

152
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:45,110
where they would have like the horse
shoe shaped stadium, which was,

153
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,000
I think what happened with,
with the,

154
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,590
with the football stadiums was when
there wasn't that many people in the or,

155
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:56,580
and also the leagues were small. They
just had sitting on both sides, right?

156
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,590
He had the home side and the
visitors side and that was it.

157
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:01,500
And then as there's more and more
people population got bigger,

158
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,940
the league's got bigger,

159
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,020
then they built end zone seats
that connected both sides.

160
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:11,100
I think they just did it on one side
first. And he had the horse shoe, right?

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,450
Like the fucking Broncos
played in the buckeyes.

162
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,780
A buckeye still called their horse,
they still call it a horseshoe,

163
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,020
even all they fucking closed in it.
And then eventually there was people,

164
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,780
people did so much fucking that
they had to close, you know,

165
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:29,781
and there's so much ESPN
that got everybody fucking
interested in it that isn't

166
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:34,470
even interested in it. Then
all of a sudden Beyonce
singing it fucking halftime,

167
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,520
you know? I mean there's a bunch of people
in the crowd that are excited by it,

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,433
you know?

169
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,663
MMM.

170
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,190
A fucking old ass Rod Stewart
who the fuck they dragon out?

171
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,730
They always usually go
with somebody younger.

172
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,560
They just fucking drag somebody out
who's on their last fucking legs,

173
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,330
like their last big payday, you know,
they just fucking wheel him out there.

174
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,850
Who are they going to do this year?

175
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,230
Okay.

176
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,530
Uh, night ranger. Do you think going
to be like night ranger? A Drake.

177
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,940
That's what I'm guessing. Oh wait,
I think it is Beyonce. You know?

178
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,180
I know cause neo wanted to go to the
Superbowl because Beyonce was there.

179
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm like,
why don't you go see her in concert?

180
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,410
Okay,

181
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,880
you're going to make us go to the fucking
super bowl and then we get to watch

182
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:20,400
her lip sync.
One fucking song.

183
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:23,280
How the fuck did Sean Penn
interview that drug? Lord,

184
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,890
how do you do something like that? And
the government isn't like, Hey, you know,

185
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,090
we're trying to find that guy.

186
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,450
Okay.

187
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,400
You know when you're just sitting
there palling around with them.

188
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,340
Yeah,

189
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,240
probably bought them like fast
times at Ridgemont high DVDs. Right.

190
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,350
For his underground layer.

191
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,193
Okay,

192
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,980
dude, I love Sean Penn as an actor.
But how are your fucking tree?

193
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,360
Are you that you're going to go
and interview that fucking guy?

194
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,300
You know I did.

195
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,810
I'm trying to think how many fucking
standup specials I would have to put out

196
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:07,830
before I could go. I would go fucking
interview somebody in like, well,

197
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:10,740
I guess Isis is actually fight, but
we're fucking with them toe. You know?

198
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,100
I would just say, I'm going to
walk in there with my microphone.

199
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,040
They're all gonna laugh at me and then
they're going to saw my fucking head off.

200
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:22,990
Are we going wars tie me to a chair.
Fucking torture me to death.

201
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,880
That's insane. Hey, good on him.

202
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,440
Okay.

203
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
Also, I don't understand. Is
it El Chapo? That's his name.

204
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:34,580
He sounds like such a gentleman.
Huh? El Che is a good chap. El Chapo.

205
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,003
MMM.

206
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,340
I don't fucking get it man.
What are you doing?

207
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,390
Why, why did he go down
there and interview that guy?

208
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:48,980
Okay.

209
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,660
And like how,
how,

210
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,030
how well does Sean Penn's do?

211
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,730
Okay.

212
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,030
That drug dealers on the run, he's on
the run from our government, right?

213
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:00,830
Isn't this the guy who escaped?
I don't fucking know.

214
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:04,790
You know what's going on is my fucking
Internet won't let me sign on so I can't

215
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:09,660
fucking see anything. I can't see
the fucking highlights. Nothing.

216
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:09,931
You know,

217
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,230
while I'm up here is I fucking got one
God damn channel and a bunch of Tim

218
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,420
Horton fucking commercials,
which is at Dunkin donuts.

219
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,420
See if I can sign on here is an El Chapo,

220
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,180
the guy that like that we would,

221
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,640
that keeps escaping from jail.
Set the Guy El Chapo.

222
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,150
Come on man. Come on. Ah, this
connection is untrusted. Okay.

223
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:31,810
Yeah.

224
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,830
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

225
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,260
There's probably some psycho from
Alberta trying to hack in here.

226
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,230
That seems like their Texas to me.
When you're up here,

227
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,810
it's all fucking oil. Men and ranchers
and Shit. Um, and then you got admitted.

228
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,570
Okay.

229
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,330
10 it seems like it's nice.
You know what I mean?

230
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,790
Like that's they're like business hub.
You know,

231
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,060
I'm just totally judging these just by
doing like driving through and doing a

232
00:12:56,061 --> 00:13:00,830
little bit of standup out here. Like when
I did stand up in Calgary, great people,

233
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,580
but fuck an animal's Jesus fucking Christ.
They were animals.

234
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,120
I don't know if it's cause the place
that we performed out there was like no

235
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,240
carpeting or nothing.
They were fucking,

236
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,760
I think it was coastal cause
it was bring your own beer.

237
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,730
Fucking animals.

238
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,400
I would never fuck with
anybody from Calgary.

239
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:20,900
Okay.

240
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,890
I saw the way they behave when they were
in a good mood. It's excited for a show.

241
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,110
Don't have a fuck with
anybody from Calgary

242
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,010
to Edmonton. It was civilized
category. Jesus Christ.

243
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,850
They had everything but a hooker
swinging from a swing. You know,

244
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,210
back in the old days with the salons
where they had the horse, you know,

245
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,160
way overdressed. Once again, it might
just be a fucking movie thing. So much.

246
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,620
So much of my history is, is
based on that. By the way.

247
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:52,840
I can't get on the fucking Internet,
but for some reason I could fucking, uh,

248
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,940
I could do it over the, uh,
I could do it on my phone.

249
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,870
Let me look up El Chapo here. Like
I said, he sounds like such a champ.

250
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,920
I just think like that English thing.
Chapo.

251
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,420
He's a Mexican chap.

252
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,240
How Mexico secretly launched a
crackdown after Penn met El Chapo.

253
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,260
El Chapo was finally captured again.
That was one day ago.

254
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,880
We'll el Chapo rat out rival cartels.
Corrupt officials.

255
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,700
It's gotta be a lot of stress.
Be In this El Chapo guy. Huh?

256
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,320
Joaquin Guzman.

257
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:29,920
Okay.

258
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,611
You know,
I got to say,

259
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:34,000
he looks like a Mexican Robert
Blake like during the Beretta years.

260
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,220
Now when he says, uh, yeah,

261
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:38,560
that's me who's also on the
phone and it starts laughing.

262
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,280
How else this is when you know
you lived a fucking crazy life.

263
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,970
This is just the front page of this
guy's for if you search this guy's name,

264
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,830
how El Chapo was finally captured
again, we'll el Chapo. I read those. Uh,

265
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,100
El Chapo Guzman.
Sean Penn talks about them.

266
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,090
El Chapo had erectile dysfunction
surgery while on the run.

267
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,080
It's nice to know we took a pitstop,
you know, guy takes care of himself.

268
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,360
How nervous was that doctor
working on that maniacs? Dick? Uh,

269
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,830
El Chapo speaks rolling stone.

270
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:13,420
Sean Penn has terrible regret
about meeting El Chapo. Well,

271
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:14,710
what did he think he was going to meet?

272
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,410
It's going to get some fucking
Sherry's berries. The Hud for El Chapo,

273
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,360
Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.
The truth about the jailbreak,

274
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,330
there's nothing here about, uh, an older,

275
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:33,331
wiser El Chapo puts out a little singer
Songwriter Jesus fucking Christ do.

276
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,200
You don't realize how fucking finished
we are. Just as, as, as, as a,

277
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,370
just as a race, as a race, as
humanity. So I'm trying to say,

278
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,800
she says people were fucking done.

279
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,070
Yeah.

280
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,060
You know,
rolling stone.

281
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,650
Rolling stone this month as
Sean Penn talking to El Chapo,

282
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,660
Leonardo Dicaprio's on the current cover
and they're billing him where he has a

283
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:01,950
plan to save the planet.

284
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:04,820
Okay.

285
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,350
What are we doing? What the fuck is
that government not doing that a list.

286
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,460
Fucking,
uh,

287
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,350
actors have to talk to drug
lords and try to save the planet.

288
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,900
I mean, there's got to be how many leaks
are in the fucking damn at this point?

289
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,200
I don't know about you guys.
That does not make me feel comfortable.

290
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,650
You know what I mean?
Boomer Esiason to, uh,

291
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,960
figure out how to cut a
fucking colonize Mars.

292
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,120
That's the next thing that they're going
to have in the rolling. Rolling Stone.

293
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,830
You don't know why the fuck
do I want to hear that?

294
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Can I hear a scientist?

295
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,953
You know,

296
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,750
how about have a navy
seal interview El Chapo.

297
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,080
Okay.

298
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,880
I don't know, Bill, how would you shut
the fuck up? I, I will. I don't know.

299
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,920
I get unsettled. I get unsettled him.
I did. I have problems with digestion.

300
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,650
Um, I can't even remember what
the fuck I was going to look up.

301
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,680
What was I initially looking
up before I got to El Chapo?

302
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,760
Okay.

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,740
Jesus Christ.
Some of the stories on that guy.

304
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,150
Okay.

305
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,421
You know,

306
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:15,730
it's right up there with that fucking rod
Stewart rumor for way back in the day.

307
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,590
Remember that one? I think it was, I
can't even have rob Stewart over there.

308
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:23,470
Yeah, they find like a gallon
of ges and his stomach.

309
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:27,010
His stomach had to be
pumped, you know, a gallon.

310
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,840
He went to trader Joe's and butts.
I'm a fucking all natural organic fuck,

311
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,790
I'm sorry. Um, you got a gallon
of it. You know, you went to a,

312
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,980
was those, what's that place
where you buy everything in Bulk?

313
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:45,670
Okay.

314
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,090
Fucking whales. They're pushing
around those pallet jacks by Cheerios.

315
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,600
You gotta get a membership to it because
with a C it's not countries. What's the,

316
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,460
what's the name of that shit?
I ain't never go to the fucking place.

317
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,260
Once I had to go in there
and get a membership,

318
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,810
they wanted on this fucking information.

319
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,323
MMM.

320
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,690
Oh Christ. What the fuck is
it called? That coat check.

321
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,770
I'm never going to remember it.
You know what I'm saying?

322
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,560
It just kills the jokes bill when he
can't remember the fucking references.

323
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,680
It just, it absolutely kills it. Costco.

324
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,380
Hey,
what's the cost going?

325
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:25,300
But one of those big fucking a gallons of
fucking Jizz it on a dairy. Chugged it.

326
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,690
Anyway, so there's, here's something
on El Chapo, El Chapo. They said, uh,

327
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
I can't remember, like, just
fucking killed this person.

328
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:36,800
His whole family took their kids and
I just, why I don't believe it though.

329
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,760
He took his kids and then flew him to,
uh,

330
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,800
to Columbia and then throw him
off a bridge. It's like, really?

331
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,460
There's not any bridges in Mexico.
You never know what to believe.

332
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:53,461
But I gotta tell you when you go south
or the u s you do not want to piss

333
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:58,090
anybody off as far as I can tell.
That's some next level shit.

334
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,110
And I could say that because I just
read papers from the United States.

335
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,900
They, uh, that's just,
that's just next level.

336
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,430
Like,
you know,

337
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,550
you're mad at somebody and then you know
how you get your revenge is just some

338
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,220
next, I read that, uh,
killing Pablo one time,

339
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,620
I had to put the book
down like three times.

340
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:19,630
Some of the shit they just
said that the guy did not,

341
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,210
I don't know if the
fucking guy did this ship,

342
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:25,600
but I'm a one times hearing that the guy
had a party night and everybody's out

343
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:30,430
there by the pool standing around, you
know, and uh, what's his face there?

344
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,700
Pablo Escobar standing there.
You know,

345
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,510
everybody's ignoring the weight that
he's putting on as he sits there in his

346
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,720
fucking Hagar action slacks. You
know, you seem to like those.

347
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,940
He's stretched and, uh, you know,

348
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,310
still tucked them in right at the waist,
you know what I mean? Talk to him,

349
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,670
writing the waste. Didn't push the pants
down, didn't do the fucking shirt on,

350
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:54,520
tucked. He tucked it right in. And uh,

351
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,240
they said that he allegedly
filed one of his, uh,

352
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,770
one of the people they don't want to,
it's not as, but one of the maids,

353
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:01,780
I don't know what allegedly was stealing.

354
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,450
So they tied this guy's legs together
and his arms behind his back and they

355
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:11,050
threw him in the house pool
and just watched him drown.

356
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,320
Is everyone was standing
there at the party, you know,

357
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,450
I'd say they must have been a lot of ice
shaking and drinks after that one. Like

358
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,940
so is this a Victorian house?
Pablo?

359
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,070
Mr Escobar. Oh, I want to
go to the pool. Um, yeah.

360
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,530
People get their faces ripped off.
Is it torture or death?

361
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,260
They like peeling their fucking
faces back. This is not funny.

362
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,070
This is not what this podcast is about.
Um,

363
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,770
why is this fucking stealer
Denver game so fucking boring?

364
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,100
Yeah.

365
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,800
Is it, cause I have the sound
down. I just don't give a fuck

366
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,600
the afcs just the walking wounded

367
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,360
Rothenberg is a fucking man. Look at
that guy just getting bumped by Lyman.

368
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,870
He stays in there. That
guy, he has like fucking,

369
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,150
he stays in the pocket like Steve
Grogan use to use to stay in the pocket.

370
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:05,460
Did anybody remember that?
Any old pats fans out there?

371
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,200
You'd fucking sit there and say,
this is back when you could literally,

372
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,200
you could hammer a fucking quarterback,

373
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,370
drive your helmet right under his chin
and then lift them off the ground and

374
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:17,070
pile.
Drive them into the fucking astro turf.

375
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:18,520
Yeah.

376
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,220
Which is like getting tackled in
a parking lot that's been, uh,

377
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,150
painted green and Steve Drogan.
But he would go back for a pass.

378
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,380
It's back when he had that fucking
neck brace and he had such a long neck,

379
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,620
he could still see like six inches of
neck. Right. Even what the neck brace,

380
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,090
and there'd be some defensive lineman
just running full speed right at him.

381
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:40,120
And he, he would just hang onto
it, hang on to it, hang on to it,

382
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,590
and then he would throw the ball and
the camera would follow the football.

383
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:45,940
And right as he let it go,

384
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,320
you'd see just the beginning of that
fucking Lyman drilling them and he'd go

385
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,900
flying right out the right side
of your screen or left side,

386
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:57,010
depending on which way he was going
down the field to Stanley Morgan,

387
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,070
you know, Bruce Francis, one
of those fucking guys, right?

388
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,590
Harold Jackson.
Who else did we have back then?

389
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,640
I can't even fucking remember.

390
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,280
Okay.

391
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,210
Hasselbeck it Hasselbeck whose
son was the one who said, uh,

392
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,700
we want the ball and we're going to score
don Hasselbeck.

393
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:24,000
I think it was his dead. All right.
Anyways, what, where the fuck am I?

394
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,600
Um, yeah, Rothenberg is like that.
That guy stands in the pocket.

395
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:30,690
It takes a fucking hit
and speak in which to, uh,

396
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:34,200
I know there's a lot of Kansas City fans
would probably pissed off at the calls

397
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:39,160
Tom Brady got and the lack of call said
Alex Smith got Ed. Uh, I'm a patriots fed.

398
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,840
Uh, you're absolutely right, but
that is not Tom Brady's fault.

399
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,813
Okay.

400
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,500
And I'm hoping most of you guys at Kansas
City can hear what I'm saying because

401
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,030
you're not as upset because you got to
see your baseball team when the world

402
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,950
series. Right? So you
got that going for you.

403
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,310
Half of you professional teams
won championships this year.

404
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,790
That's pretty fucking good. Right? Um,

405
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,250
Tom Brady earned those
costs. Okay. This is the,

406
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,800
if you want Alex Smith to get
those calls in the future,

407
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,640
in the future,

408
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,560
he has to make the NFL owners
a lot more money than he is.

409
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,880
And that's just a simple fact. And,
uh, people call it the Tom Brady rules.

410
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:25,800
It isn't, it's the superstar rules. You
know, Jordan gets away with the push.

411
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,870
Right. Was the last time you Coby Brian,
what does Colby Bryant have to do to get,

412
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,350
you know, well, he's not healthy anymore,

413
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:36,300
but back in the day you could be standing
in the lane before the fucking game

414
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:41,100
starts and if he runs into you that
they're going to call it on you,

415
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,860
he'd literally have to take,

416
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:46,890
he'd have to fucking tie an ax to the
front of knee and fucking jump into your,

417
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:50,640
cut your head off before, you know,
there was a way to call offsetting.

418
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,190
They would have, it's just,
it's just how it works. But, um,

419
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,480
I have to say as much
as he earned the calls,

420
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:02,230
that one where he was getting sacked
and he switched it to his left hand in

421
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:05,310
throw it and they still gave him
the call was fucking ridiculous.

422
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,270
I even as a page, it's fair, I was
at hall going, Oh, what the fuck?

423
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,880
Give me a break, but
you know, I'll take it.

424
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,620
Of course they'll take it the same
way you would have. Uh, but uh,

425
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,830
I don't care to see as a great team
and they have, you know, Alex Smith,

426
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,140
I think he's going to be a
really fucking great quarterback,

427
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,190
but you got to have it all,
man.

428
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:27,210
He got to have the coach and the
ownership and all that bullshit and lucky

429
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:31,020
enough that we have that in, uh,
in New England. So there you go.

430

00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:58,260
click on the microphone at the top of
the homepage and type in [inaudible],

571
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,150
B u r r and mercifully, that's the end
of me reading out loud for this week.

572
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,653
MMM.

573
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,390
Here's a stat I had to look up
because dom I rera sent me a a

574
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,430
yeah,

575
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,263
a text.

576
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,030
Okay.

577
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,420
I try to drop names here. By the way,
I'm on his podcast this past week. Uh,

578
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,930
Dom Iros sent me a text this morning.
He goes,

579
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,980
how many quarterbacks have
you ever seen in the NFL?

580
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,350
Okay.

581
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:29,350
Have a hail Mary pass throw if successful
Haman Hail Mary pass once in their

582
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:33,650
career.
Forget about twice in the same season.

583
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,110
And uh, I had to go look it up. I was
like, I gotta I gotta find this out, man.

584
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:44,030
I got to find out, uh, you
know, if anybody's ever done it,

585
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,860
cause I was like,
there's no way anybody's done it.

586
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,390
In my lifetime of watching the last 30
something years of watching football,

587
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:55,040
holy fuck. I've been watching
football for 38 years. Oh my God,

588
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:55,874
I'm old.

589
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,080
Okay.

590
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,810
I started watching it
religiously in about 1978.

591
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,330
Um, yeah, about that. 78, 79.

592
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,640
Jesus fucking Christ. Um, put it this way.

593
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,410
The first Superbowl I watched was
super bold 12th and there is 50,

594
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,470
so there you go. Wow. This
is going to be my, uh,

595
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,070
okay.

596
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,100
Well would that be my 50,
not 51st? You fucking idiot.

597
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,020
My 39th Superbowl 50 minus
12. Plus I watched 12, right?

598
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,940
Yeah.

599
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,710
Yeah. So that day. There you go. Yeah,

600
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,560
there's a lot of people right now
actually think I'm wrong, but it's true.

601
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,880
This is my 39th I'm going to be watching
anyways. Let's plow ahead here. Um,

602
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,870
so I looked it up. Successful
Hail Marys. Okay. Um,

603
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,160
there's only one guy that I saw since
they started keeping the stats in 1975,

604
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:54,880
at least on Wikipedia. I didn't go to
the football reference.com which I love.

605
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,543
MMM.

606
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,320
The one guy who's ever done done it
twice since they kept the stats in 1975,

607
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,980
Steve Bart Koski,

608
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,790
Steve Bark Koski and there's no way to
picture Steve our Koski and not have the

609
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:15,260
song,
this song go through your head

610
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,010
walking on a never thought
I could be so free.

611
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,910
He throwing the ball to Bailey,
watch,

612
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,810
choose Johnson and to another guy.
Yeah.

613
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:33,590
He looked like the greatest American hero.
He did it in 1978 against the saints.

614
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:38,591
And then he did it again in 1983
against the 40 niners in the NFC west,

615
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,300
which back then was only four teams.
It was the Los Angeles Rams,

616
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,960
the New Orleans saints,
the Atlanta Falcons,

617
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,490
and the San Francisco 40 niners
quarterbacks or Steve Bark Koski,

618
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,690
uh, [inaudible] 78 seat bark
house. He, Archie Manning.

619
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,070
Yeah.

620
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,820
And I think they had a quarterback
controversy. Pat Haden,

621
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:06,920
Vince Ferragamo back and forth,
uh,

622
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,460
for Vince covert gum. I tried to take the
money and went to the fucking CFL. Oh,

623
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:14,420
Jewish. Never saw him again. And, uh,

624
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,680
it would be Steve to
Burger Jim Plunkett at 78.

625
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,920
I did this with fucking
Joe Bart. Nick, one time.

626
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:26,921
We tried to name all the
starting quarterbacks in the
NFL in 1978 we went around

627
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:32,390
the league. I, so I think it
was a AFC east was Burt Jones,

628
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,400
Bob Greasy,
Steve Grogan,

629
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:38,540
Richard Todd and Joe
Ferguson for the bills.

630
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,040
Okay.

631
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,750
Then it was Terry Bradshaw,
Dan Pastor Reni.

632
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,283
Okay.

633
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,280
Who the fuck was quarterback for the
browns? It was either Mike Phipps or,

634
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:53,770
uh,
Brian's site.

635
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,340
And then the bangles was Kenny Anderson.
Kenny the candle

636
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,390
as Collins were sent.
They Call Him Kenny the candle,

637
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:04,800
cause one blow and he was out.

638
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,730
You ever see that one on NFL films and
they cut the Kitty Anderson. He's like,

639
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:13,670
I'll fuck Collins worth.
Um,

640
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,700
and let's see, it was Craig
Morton. I'll just do the AFC,

641
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:20,100
cause I know this just fucking drive
and everybody not split it. This is my,

642
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:23,400
if I have to do it now, because
now it's in my head. Craig Morton,

643
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,300
was it the orange crush Broncos.
Ken Stabler.

644
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,090
Kenny Snake Stabler for the,
uh, the Raiders. Dan Fouts,

645
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,550
the Great Dan Fouts Air
Corre l with the gadgets.

646
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,463
Yeah.

647
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,000
Jim Zorn with Seattle and then a fuck.

648
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:46,400
There's always the one that gets me.
Who the fuck was with the chiefs?

649
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,660
It was before black lynch
was after Len Dawson.

650
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,320
Who the fuck was the quarterback?
There's a good one for you.

651
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,550
There's some poor bastard in Kansas
City right now screaming it. Yeah.

652
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,500
Who the fuck was it? I even know, I
think like the Buccaneers had Gary hough.

653
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,930
Lynn Dickey was out in Green Bay.

654
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:15,820
Jim Hart was it? How the
fuck do I remember those? I
remember Kansas City, Kansas.

655
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:19,810
See, I gotta look this up. Kansas
City chief quarterback. Hey,

656
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:20,890
it's going to get better guys.

657
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:25,270
I played drums this week
out and I played with, uh,

658
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,470
Colin Hay from men at work, right? I'm
going to tell a story in a second here.

659
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:31,180
Just fucking deal with this here.
Kansas City chiefs,

660
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,560
Qb 1978.
Why do I care?

661
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,970
Why do I fucking care?
Lists of Kansas City chief quarterbacks.

662
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,460
This is fucking made for me.

663
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,730
Who's the last person who fucking went
to this starting quarterback season to

664
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,110
season Jesus. They've had some guys. Yeah.
Joe Montana. Warren Moon. Rich Gannon.

665
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,790
Yeah.

666
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,120
All right. Here we go. Here we
go. Back. Ended up backing it up.

667
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:02,640
Okay.

668
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,810
1970 I, I'd never get this.
Mike Livingston and Tony Adams.

669
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,640
This is the one that
always fucking gets me.

670
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,500
Yeah.

671
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Lenny Dawson left in 1975 and
then Mike Livingston took over.

672
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,493
Okay.

673
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,281
You know,

674
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:24,940
there was a guy who played for the
Bengals that Bill Walsh was talking about.

675
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,940
He only played for one season.
He got fucking injured.

676
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,860
And Bill Walsh to this day still said
he's the greatest quarterback that he ever

677
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:36,090
coached, but he's probably still
trying to motivate or he was, anyways,

678
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,880
he passed away, probably still trying
to motivate fucking Montana or young,

679
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,250
even after they retired,

680
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,620
get them to rake the leaves
better that day or some shit. Um,

681
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,510
I can't remember the guy's
fucking neighbor. That's
one to look up. Uh, anyways,

682
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:53,231
so yeah,
this,

683
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:58,070
this week I did a Greg
Behrendt show at Largo and uh,

684
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,300
it was one of those things too. It's
not quite like the goddamn comedy jam.

685
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:04,360
This was one where they
actually have people, uh,

686
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,980
for the most part it's musicians
coming out and telling funny stories.

687
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,900
And this is something that Greg
did a number of years ago and, uh,

688
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:17,740
he's brought the show
back. And, um, so anyways,

689
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,970
let me, let me get the line up
here so I don't fuck this up.

690
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,100
I did take a picture of it. I'm so fucking
disorganized. I apologize. Um, all right.

691
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:31,850
So it was Colin. Hey, Tom Morello, myself
and Chris Fairbanks and other comedians.

692
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:36,760
So it was two comedians and then
a two musicians. And I got to a,

693
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,740
I got to play with the band,
told some stories,

694
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,560
and I got to play with the band.

695
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:49,060
And then afterwards I got to play
with Colin Hay and we played, uh,

696
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,000
who can it be now, which was a just
beyond a fucking thrilled. And he,

697
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:58,520
he was the nicest fucking guy,
so generous to let me play. Um,

698
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,310
then he had this really cool way that
he wanted to bring me out. He goes, uh,

699
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,870
he just went out there and he's telling
stories. He was fucking hilarious.

700
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,320
And then he just randomly goes, you know,
and I had the weirdest dream last night.

701
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:14,800
I was dreaming,
I was playing a show

702
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,400
and a, I was playing, you know,

703
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:21,160
who could it be now in the crowd
collapse because it's such a huge hit.

704
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,360
And he goes, the weirdest
thing, you know, it, Bill Burr
was on drums, like, you know,

705
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,560
and I just waited a second.
Then I just walked out and sat down.

706
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:31,810
Everybody started laughing and
then he told this great story.

707
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:34,880
I'm not going to repeat the story.
Just it's his story.

708
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:38,060
So I'm sure if he wants to
tell it on a podcast, he kit,

709
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,250
but he tells his fucking hilarious
story that ends with the word cunt.

710
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,140
And he told me after I say cunt,

711
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:52,090
basically you do the drum fill intro
and then we'll go into the song and uh,

712
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,650
let me play it anyway. And I went off,
went off pretty good man. It actually, uh,

713
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,380
I don't know. It's fucking unreal, man.

714
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:04,381
I played like 20 years by myself in a
rehearsal space until it finally dawned on

715
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:07,960
me that I'm supposed to be out
interacting with other fucking people.

716
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:11,890
So now then I've kind of opened
Pandora's box. I just, I told you,

717
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:15,730
I made this rule that I'm
not going to ask to sit in,

718
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:19,420
but if somebody asks me to play, I'm
going to fucking play. All right.

719
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,720
That includes if I come to your
town and if I'm drinking at a bar,

720
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:24,890
if I go out to a bar and
your local band is playing,

721
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:27,070
if you come up to me and asked
me to sit in with your band,

722
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:30,160
I'm going to fucking do it. All
right. I know. And this is a warning.

723
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:41,280
It's a warning. I'm going to do it
and I've got to fuck up. So you know,

724
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,510
if you want a story, I'll fucking do
it because it's fun as hell to me.

725
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,170
And it's weird. I don't feel
any pressure whatsoever because

726
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,610
I'm a comedian. Well, what's the pressure?
He's going to sit down and play drunk.

727
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,580
She's going to stick. Of
course he is. Everybody already
knows it, so it's fine. Um,

728
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,750
plus everybody just looks at the singer
anyways, but it's, uh, it's a lot of fun.

729
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:08,520
And I've been getting cycled
back into lessons and, um,

730
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,640
I told you I've been taking, I've
been taking some lessons. Um,

731
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,260
do you remember long time ago when I
watched that Mars Volta Video and, uh,

732
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,470
I was talking about that drummer who
was Dave [inaudible] at the time.

733
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:25,620
I was going, Holy Fuck, look at this guy's
fucking unbelievable, blah, blah blah.

734
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,960
Well, from doing that, he
must have heard the clip.

735
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:31,440
He reached out to me on Twitter
and Lo and behold, he lives in La.

736
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,150
And every once in a while I go by and
I take a lesson with the guy and uh,

737
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,130
he's a fucking unbelievable teacher and
he's been teaching me technique. So my,

738
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:45,000
you know, I'm one of those guys, I
grabbed the drumsticks the same way,

739
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:48,810
like a toddler would,
would just my fit meaty fucking fist,

740
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:53,811
just right over both of them and it was
causing my arms to be doing all the work

741
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:56,370
and my forum,
if ain't drummers are listening to this,

742
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:59,430
if you have like that fucking,
you know,

743
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:02,280
that pain in your forums and
all that, you know, that's,

744
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:07,370
I was kinda going through that shit and
he is teaching me this technique where

745
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:12,150
you let the stick do the work and it's
holding it in this particular way that

746
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,340
does not seem fucking natural at all.
And,

747
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,640
uh, it has been a motherfucker,
but you know, incrementally,

748
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,410
I've been gradually working
its way into my playing and,

749
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:29,580
uh, it's been, it's totally been worth it.

750
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,640
And we've been going through this
jazz book and I'm like most students,

751
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,300
like I work on something for three
seconds and then want to go onto the next

752
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:43,590
thing so I can have that
sense of accomplishment and
just get through a whole

753
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:48,450
fucking page and a, and I was moving
ahead and every time I'd go to the lesson,

754
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,120
I would still not have the,
the first thing down.

755
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:52,520
Okay.

756
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,940
And I've been taking lessons, you know,
on and off since the summer. I mean,

757
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:59,330
I get busy and I can't go for like
a month or something, but, um,

758
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,910
I'm still on that first page and it
finally dawned on me in the past week that

759
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,850
to be like, dude, just work on this one
fucking thing and fuck everything else.

760
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,950
And I just sort of sat down 15 minutes
a day just working on this thing.

761
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,833
Um,

762
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,260
okay.

763
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:15,860
You know,

764
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,550
make it a little bit of an improvement
and then being fuck having to start over.

765
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,420
And Blah, blah, blah, Blah
and all that shit. And um,

766
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,000
I actually had a great lesson this week
where I think he actually was saying

767
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:28,970
that I was just,
I was finally starting to improve,

768
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,470
which made my fucking
week. So anyways, um,

769
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,480
I even know what the fuck I'm going with
this. I'm rambling all over the place.

770
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:40,800
What are we up to here? 45
minutes. Jesus Christ. Bill,

771
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,170
can we fucking get on with
this here? Um, oh, by the way,

772
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:48,580
somebody told me to watch the
show. Top boy, TLP boy on Netflix.

773
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:49,770
Yeah.

774
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,690
And uh,
I want to Netflix for the life I can,

775
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,110
I can figure out how to search when
I'm on the Internet. I can't fuck it.

776
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:57,360
Do it when I'm on the TV. I don't know.
How do you search when you were on the TV?

777
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,230
If anybody knows? I would
really appreciate it. But
anyways, I'm going to be, um,

778
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,800
I'm going to be a playing
out again this week. Uh,

779
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:09,390
I'm doing that Bonzo bash thing.

780
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:13,350
I'm hosting the Bonzo Bash Co hosting
and I don't even know who I'm co hosting

781
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:17,520
with. It's going to be an Anaheim
this Friday night. And, um,

782
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,341
uh,
Brian Tish,

783
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:24,341
she's wonderful event or all these dramas
that I grew up watching sit down and

784
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:25,860
play led Zeppelin songs,

785
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:29,760
which is going to be the shit I'm going
to get to host it and a with somebody

786
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:31,290
else. It's going to be
fucking awesome. So,

787
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:35,220
and I will be sitting in
for one song once again,

788
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,330
risking total humiliation, which, you
know, I'll probably make an ass of myself.

789
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:43,650
Who gives a fuck, right?
Um, but anyways, uh,

790
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,000
oh,
I knew what I wanted to talk about.

791
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,520
Yeah.

792
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,420
Fucking the Arizona cardinals packers
game. I started to talk about it and uh,

793
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:58,940
you would think last week after watching
that dude on the Bengals intercept the

794
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:03,200
ball and then fucking walk into the locker
room like, well, I guess that's that,

795
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,000
right?
You'd think that these,

796
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,360
these damn kids today, they'd
learned something. Patrick Peterson,

797
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,780
who I fucking love Lsu Kid,
right?

798
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,410
It didn't complete fourth down.
That ought to fucking do it.

799
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,150
Two and a half minutes left.

800
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,210
This guy's walking down the
sideline waving to the crowd,

801
00:47:23,211 --> 00:47:27,860
doing damn near blowing kisses.
To the crowd. Like it's over.

802
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,660
What he's playing pack is
in Aaron fucking Rogers.

803
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,670
Fucking hilarious.

804
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,240
Two and a half minutes of football left
and he's walking around doing that.

805
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:38,074
And what happened?

806
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,220
Two minutes and 25 football seconds
later he gets beat on a jump ball in the

807
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:49,510
fucking end zone on a hail Mary
to send it into overtime. Um,

808
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:56,320
fucking unbelievable. How many times
is somebody going to fucking do that?

809
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,920
How many times are you going to run
down the field? You got the football,

810
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,010
you're not past the goal line.
You already start holding it out.

811
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,880
It don baby slaps it out of your
hand or you're fucking, you know,

812
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:11,440
you have to be a spike. It over
the, you know, over your back.

813
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:16,470
You know that one we had throw it down
over your shoulder and you get big toes

814
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:19,450
across the end zone,
but the ball is,

815
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:21,430
and how many fucking times you're
going to see people do that.

816
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:26,230
I just don't understand why I don't get
it. So anyways, let's plow ahead here.

817
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,800
Uh,
all right here.

818
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:33,160
So the questions are the letters for
this week. All right. Pasta bill,

819
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,930
if you want to get good at making pasta.

820
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:39,931
Of course I do begin with a genero
control those videos on food tube.

821
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,550
All right. I don't know if I
said I'd probably just say right.

822
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,140
It's g e n a r r o and
then the last name is c.

823
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:54,730
O. N T. A. L. D. O. S. No, d. O.

824
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,580
Apostrophe s can tall dose.
Uh,

825
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:01,330
the guy taught me so much I even
wished him a happy birthday. Uh,

826
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:06,250
also pay attention to sorts of flour
you're using cheers to you and your

827
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,190
Mondays. Yeah. What's going on? Some
people use flowers, some people use that.

828
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:13,810
Semolina some people use a
mixture of both. I tell you, I,

829
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,910
I like doing it.
I think it goes back to when I was a kid,

830
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,000
I was one those kids like playing in
mud puddles, you know what I mean?

831
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,110
So it was a,

832
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:21,850
okay,

833
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,720
there's just something about that. I
think that's why like, I like making like,

834
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,120
like pie crust and shit like that.
It's just a big goofy fucking mess.

835
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:36,400
It's fun. Um, but I'll
definitely, uh, I'll check that
out if I can get online here.

836
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,980
All right.
Cooking Asian food.

837
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:40,490
Okay.

838
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,640
All right, Bill, how are you?
You freckled cont Jesus. Jesus.

839
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,050
No happy new year. Um,
huge fan from Belgium here.

840
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:53,340
Nice Bedlam in Belgium.
ACDC flick of the switch album.

841
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,580
How many fucking balls are you
going to drop on Peyton here?

842
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,950
This could be his last game ever.
What are you doing?

843
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:00,640
Okay.

844
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,330
Jesus Christ. And when did shoulder
pads get so small? Let me see.

845
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:08,200
Shoulder pads on. People in the
fucking shoulder pads was so big.

846
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:12,370
The short didn't even cover your belly.
Used to run around with half shirts on,

847
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,390
by the way. Can Grunt, pull his pants
up or get a longer fucking jersey.

848
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,870
You started to look like
a waitress at Hooters.

849
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,950
All right. A huge fan
from Belgium here. Um,

850
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,940
I'm sure it's saying
he showed his midriff.

851
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,390
That's probably the Ron Ron
reference. Who knows, you know,

852
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:35,340
the little ass country that people know,
uh,

853
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:39,170
about because of Austin Powers.
Oh,

854
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:42,710
I thought I knew them from a, I
thought isn't, that's not Brussels.

855
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,620
The muscles from Brussels.
That was the guy who used to,

856
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:50,420
who's the guy used to do the splits.
Now Fuck is the guy's name.

857
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,920
He wasn't a must break you.
He wasn't.

858
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:59,420
Steven Seagal was the other guy
from blood splat gives a fuck.

859
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,123
Belgium.

860
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,300
Yeah. Luxembourg and Belgium. Right,
right. They're a tucked in there.

861
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:12,140
Right there. A battle of the bulge
right there and in France and Germany.

862
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,770
My nuts in between a Amsterdam
in a fucking Denmark.

863
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:18,830
They're Copenhagen.

864
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,020
You get tucked right there staring
at the fucking a bad teeth of that.

865
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,860
The English,
aren't you looking across the channel?

866
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,330
Maybe not enough. Maybe if I had a
map I could find it. Yeah. All right.

867
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:34,100
Love Aptis F is for family. Please
come to our, our freckle of a country.

868
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,470
Uh, dude, I'm definitely
going to go there.

869
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,980
I'm definitely going to go there
without a fucking doubt. I'm a,

870
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,310
and we're waiting to hear about the
second season for F is for family.

871
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:47,330
The pitch went fucking great. Uh, when
out of there, we were all excited.

872
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:51,410
I got a great feeling about it and I'm
going to let you guys know as soon as I

873
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:56,370
find out. Um, I got a
good feeling about it.

874
00:51:56,371 --> 00:51:58,590
So, uh, and I'm definitely
going to do a European tour.

875
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:03,510
I did Australia and Asia last year, so
this time it's time. We had the other way.

876
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,900
I'm going to do a Europe this time and I
want to hit all the countries I've been

877
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:07,380
to.

878
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,230
I'd like to add a few more and I also
want to do a little bit of eastern Europe,

879
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,780
but, uh, if we do get a second season,

880
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,440
I don't know how many episodes that would
be. I would think it'd be at least 10.

881
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,251
And then,
you know,

882
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:20,670
we got to sit down and write them and if
we want to make it as good as the first

883
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:23,700
season, you know, and even
better, which of course we do,

884
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,390
it's gonna take a lot of times. So I
got to kind of figure out, you know, uh,

885
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,040
once they give us the Yay or nay on that.
But like I said, I got a really, really,

886
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,870
really positive vibes. A lot
of laughs in the room and, um,

887
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,410
which is always good. So anyways,
he said, the guy says anyway,

888
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:44,700
I've heard you talking about
cooking more Asian food. I'll wait.

889
00:52:44,701 --> 00:52:49,580
This is a different one. Um, oh,
it's the same guy. Sorry. And He,

890
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,600
this is the same guy from
Belgium because anyways,

891
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:55,020
I've heard you talking about wanting
to cook more Asian food on your podcast

892
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:58,590
since I love cooking as well.
Please allow me to recommend you.

893
00:52:58,591 --> 00:53:02,400
Some Korean cuisine has a
lot of spicy food. Oh yeah.

894
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:07,370
Kimchi and all that stuff. Um, yeah, I've,

895
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:11,400
I've been to those Korean barbecue and
all this stuff. I love all of that stuff,

896
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,750
but to, it's just so different from
the stuff here. I'm really intimidated,

897
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:21,390
um, about cooking it,
uh, which is so stupid,

898
00:53:21,391 --> 00:53:26,000
you know, if I'm on, if I'm afraid of it,
I should just just sit down and be like,

899
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:30,950
okay, let's start with something easy.
How do you make the sticky rice? You know,

900
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:33,860
if you could just make sticky rice
alone, that's the shit, right?

901
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,480
That's the best fucking rice there is.

902
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,640
I don't wanna hear everybody
tell me it's not fucking healthy.

903
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:42,200
I don't give a fuck. You
know, it's fucking delicious.

904
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,890
Korean cuisine has a lot of spicy food,

905
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:50,891
which is great for losing weight since
you tend to be full more quickly and

906
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:56,240
drink more water. Plus a lot of other
health benefits. If you are interested,

907
00:53:56,241 --> 00:53:59,690
please check out. Uh, I cannot,

908
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:04,400
it's m a n G. C H. I on Youtube. Oh,

909
00:54:04,401 --> 00:54:09,050
I've got it. Do this. Uh, I guess
I go, I guess this is a lady.

910
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,580
She's a Korean housewife who
is funny as hell. It learns,

911
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,920
uh, teaches you, you said learns
you how to cook. It's teachers,

912
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:23,570
teaches you how to cook great
traditional and overall easy recipes.

913
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,990
Now you've got to teach me some Belgian
words. I gave you a one there, Huh? Uh,

914
00:54:26,991 --> 00:54:30,280
recommendations are a Belgium words.

915
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:35,900
Belgian eum a rep recommendations
are spicy pork stir fry.

916
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:40,350
Jinxing chicken.
I didn't know how to say this.

917
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,330
It's j. A J. A m. E. O.
N. G. Judge. I'm young.

918
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,480
That sounds like an annoying
character in fucking star wars,

919
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,970
which is black bean sauce,
noodles.

920
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:56,010
Some other shit that I can't say Korean
barbecue, which I bet you've had before.

921
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,790
Yeah, I have. What does that,
the hacky American thing?
Well, I've had Korean food.

922
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:01,230
I went to Korea at barbecue.

923
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:05,400
I literally just said that Japanese
cuisine is mostly salty, sweet,

924
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,260
Umami.
What does Umami mean?

925
00:55:09,261 --> 00:55:13,740
Is that Umami Burger Bender that flavors?
Lots of vegetables.

926
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:18,540
No butter soy sauce, which is amazing
for you. Enrich, enrich, tastes. Yeah.

927
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:20,700
I got to tell you mad people
when I went over the age of man,

928
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:24,120
they will fucking in shape
people adjusted shape over there.

929
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,763
You know?

930
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,840
I bet if you have fat in Asia, they
just mean looking at rich motherfucker.

931
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,190
He must be traveling. He's got
enough money to get to an Applebee's.

932
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,260
I don't fucking a,
I'm too tired.

933
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,350
I didn't want to say Applebee's.
Applebee's is not a fattening places.

934
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,610
It what's a good fat? She said,
I'll just wrap up the podcast. Okay.

935
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,590
If I'm going to be this off right now,

936
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:53,070
what the fuck's going to happen when I
go to do my shows tonight? All right.

937
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:55,470
Now Chinese food,
I don't know a lot about.

938
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,910
A cool to know is that Chinese food
in the states and Europe is not actual

939
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:01,260
Chinese food. No, it isn't.

940
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,860
That's their surreptitious way
of trying to fucking kill us.

941
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:10,650
That's what they're trying to do. They
know we have the bomb, right. They could,

942
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,770
they, they, that China is attacking
us on two levels right now,

943
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,520
giving us food that's going to give us
a heart attack and they're going to fuck

944
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:18,660
with our economy somehow.

945
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,450
Somehow we're tied in with them and
they're going to pull the fucking rug out

946
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,510
anyways.
He said modified for our taste buds,

947
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:27,400
but I'm guessing they have amazing
stuff too. Yeah, I would think.

948
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:28,583
I would think so.

949
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,193
MMM.

950
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,800
No, fuck am I getting
the hiccups here? Uh,

951
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,580
Thai in Vietnamese food is mostly spring
rolls. Jesus Christ, she'd go, oh,

952
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:37,660
went through the whole continent here.

953
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,203
MMM.

954
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,840
We get some water. Oh fuck.
Completely missed the glass.

955
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:52,120
Fucking bad angle here. Um, lastly,
okay. No Thai and Vietnamese.

956
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:53,860
Mostly spring rolls.
Spicy Curry.

957
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,270
I love our guy from fucking Belgium is
telling me about Asian food or you at

958
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:01,240
least Asian,
lots of coriander,

959
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:05,890
which I personally did because
it tasted of dishwasher product,

960
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,680
dishwasher, product. Lastly, if
you really want to go hardcore,

961
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:12,160
try out North Korean food,
it's basically starving yourself.

962
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:16,630
You'll be able to see your ginger pube
Ding Dong without a mirror. Again,

963
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,720
in no time, Pretty Edgy, Huh? Yes.

964
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:22,390
You're making fun of the fact that they
under a dictator that doesn't feed a

965
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:25,480
very edgy, very edgy, uh,

966
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,550
hope this helped go fuck yourself.

967
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,820
Lots of love for Nia and
old [inaudible] audio. Um,

968
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,330
oh shit. I guess I'll
give the shit, you know,

969
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:37,750
I love how Asia stops with people that we
can, you know, it doesn't go into India.

970
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,360
That's also Asia, right? Is in the Middle
East. Isn't that also Asia? Russia,

971
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,210
you know. Anyway, I like that guy and
fucking Forrest Gump. Alright. Hey,

972
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:52,370
Billy Beane,
uh,

973
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,030
been a fan of the podcast for a while now.
Yada Yada.

974
00:57:56,031 --> 00:58:00,710
I need some advice or just a fresh
perspective on what to do. I'm 23.

975
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,050
Ah, yeah. The primary life dropped out
of high school, like a dip shit at 17.

976
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,150
Got My GED when I was 19.
I you back in the game,

977
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:13,070
you back in the game and he decided to
start becoming a productive member of

978
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:17,660
society. Everything was going
good. Paycheck meant uh,

979
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:21,890
the dating pool opened up, tried a
few jobs, et cetera. But now I'm 23.

980
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,700
I quit my job to go to,
to go to school for advertising.

981
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:30,080
Slash art at an artsy college
should probably mentioned
the only thing I'm truly

982
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:32,390
good at. His art, mainly
pen and ink stuff.

983
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,650
Well that's a great thing and he can
make a ton of fucking money doing that.

984
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:41,690
It's just, it's schools generally
speaking, are not geared towards that.

985
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:44,390
Um,
so yeah,

986
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:47,860
you will fucking bored and then you
took shit that you weren't good at,

987
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,710
made you feel like an asshole. You fucking
drop out. You partied for a few years.

988
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,990
Right. Bagged a couple of who is
and now you coming back. Dude,

989
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:01,130
you're fine. You're 23, dude, you're
fine. Uh, that was eight months ago.

990
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,920
I missed the sign.
I missed the sign up date.

991
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:08,360
And just lack the general knowledge
slash support on going about it.

992
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:12,080
I spent six months grinding
the living shit out of drawing,

993
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:16,700
trying to achieve something I might be
able to take some pride in. Didn't work.

994
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,360
I was just going to say, you're being
too hard on yourself. Your next line is,

995
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,230
I'm hard myself to the point where I'm
thinking I'll never be handed a metal is

996
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:29,990
the greatest that ever fucking
live, so why bother? Ah,

997
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:33,070
Jesus, dude. Well listen,

998
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:36,100
Richard Pryor's the greatest of all time
and I'll never come close to that guy.

999
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:40,150
That does not going to stop me. You
just try to see how close you can come.

1000
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,590
Some people you can't pass and
that's all right. You know,

1001
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,860
you just try to come as close to them.

1002
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:53,670
Try to just like try to go as high up
the all time ladder as you possibly can,

1003
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,930
and who knows? If you keep
pushing yourself, that's it.

1004
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,770
You don't know what
your limits are to you.

1005
01:00:01,771 --> 01:00:03,930
You keep fucking throwing
yourself out there.

1006
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:06,570
Especially if you're hard on yourself.
You probably be in way.

1007
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,260
You're way better than you think you
are. You're going to be fine. All right.

1008
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,920
You'd get you're
depressing me here anyway.

1009
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,330
I have since quit drawing and now do
nothing but troll around dating sites all

1010
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,730
day and hooking up with
semi decent looking women,

1011
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:24,420
women as a way to stay positive
and cure boredom. I'm not lazy.

1012
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:27,720
I've done primarily law,
manual labor jobs and no,

1013
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,330
I have the back for,
but Jesus Christ,

1014
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:34,080
I can't force myself to pull the trigger
on anything because I can't be the top

1015
01:00:34,081 --> 01:00:38,610
of the crop of the very God damn best.
I want people fulfilled.

1016
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,440
I've been standing at a crossroad,

1017
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:43,800
my Dick in my hand for nearly a year and
he's sort of vice be fucking amazing.

1018
01:00:43,801 --> 01:00:46,380
Don't hold back. If you think I need to
be ripped a new one, I can handle it.

1019
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,450
Thanks. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah, Dude,

1020
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:52,680
you've got yourself into a completely
paralyzed state here because it's like you

1021
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:56,460
got it. You just bought a guitar and
because you're not Jimmy Hendrix,

1022
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:00,570
within the first two weeks, you're
going to fucking quit. All right.

1023
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,440
If Jimi Hendrix did that, he
wouldn't be Jimi Hendrix. All right.

1024
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,120
All right.
And they'd look just

1025
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,650
okay

1026
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,540
if you,
whatever you like to do in life,

1027
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:15,200
just go out and do it all right and
enjoy it and don't put that level of

1028
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:16,210
pressure on yourself.

1029
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:17,590
Okay.

1030
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,610
Like what was your, was your dad like
the Great Santini is something that,

1031
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:25,360
I'm trying to figure out why
you like this, but like, um,

1032
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:31,270
the reason why he can't pull the trigger
on anything else in life is because you

1033
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,350
actually have a strong,

1034
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:36,190
I think you have a strong sense on what
makes you happy and what you want to do.

1035
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:37,870
All right.

1036
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:42,460
And you know that despite the fact that
you'd be totally negative but you're

1037
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:42,911
drawing,

1038
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:47,860
you know that that's what you want to do
and you have such a passion for it that

1039
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:49,180
you're that hard on yourself.

1040
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:53,520
And then also it's preventing you from
getting a job at the fucking Costco or

1041
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:57,010
wherever the God damn place you're
going to end up fucking working at. Um,

1042
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:58,690
okay.

1043
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:01,600
I would, I don't know if I was
you, I would continue drawing.

1044
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,540
I get into computers and all that.
There's all kinds of stuff.

1045
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:06,190
I've seen people do drugs on computers,

1046
01:02:06,191 --> 01:02:08,530
and they turned that
into building websites,

1047
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,100
which helps to pay for that their studio
and the shit that they really want to

1048
01:02:12,101 --> 01:02:14,680
do this. There's tons of money
to making the arts. Don't,

1049
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:18,370
don't let anybody ever fucking tell
you that there isn't it did you?

1050
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:22,720
Just helping people make
it in show business.

1051
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:26,890
All right?
This p people will get head shots,

1052
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,430
give acting classes and all that.
Just doing that shit.

1053
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:34,690
People make a small fucking fortunate.
So if you actually a talented artists,

1054
01:02:34,691 --> 01:02:38,010
you can actually, you're
going to be fine. Um,

1055
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:42,880
you just have to stop beating the shit
out of yourself. All right? So, uh,

1056
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,400
just pay attention to
that voice in your head.

1057
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:45,640
And when it tells you
you can't do something,

1058
01:02:45,641 --> 01:02:50,470
just tell it to shut the
fuck up basically. Even if
you have to say it out loud,

1059
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:53,950
you don't just make sure you're not
looking at somebody you care about as

1060
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:56,080
they're telling you a story. When you
think of those thoughts, just, you know,

1061
01:02:56,081 --> 01:02:59,530
maybe, maybe say it in your
brain first. All right? Okay.

1062
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:04,390
Advice. No one to relate to cheeses.
He's a fucking gloomy this week.

1063
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:09,400
All right. Advice. No one to relate
to causing loading loneliness.

1064
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,153
Okay.

1065
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:16,030
All right. Hey, Billy batts
love the podcasts you stand
up after it's her family.

1066
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,550
Uh, they all put a smile on my
face. Well, that's great. Okay.

1067
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,580
I'm sensing that all of a sudden
now the smile is going to go away.

1068
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:26,260
I hope you read this because he had under
my problem is I have no one to relate

1069
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,510
to and I fear I might
as well read this year.

1070
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,660
I hope you read this because I've
been doing everything positive,

1071
01:03:31,661 --> 01:03:34,300
but I just can't seem to get
my life where I want it to be.

1072
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,000
It's a bit of a long road, so please bear
with me. Oh, fuck us. It's a long email

1073
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:42,660
dude. You know, I can't read out loud.

1074
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,500
Okay.

1075
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:44,771
All right.

1076
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:48,430
My problem is I have no one to relate to
and I fear I might be co this might be

1077
01:03:48,431 --> 01:03:52,590
causing me
to be lonely in life.

1078
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,330
I fear that if I continue the way
I'm going, I may never get over.

1079
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:01,290
I'm in my last semester of college and
an engineering program and if made almost

1080
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,540
no friends throughout my
entire stay at college,

1081
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:07,860
I am at the top of my classes and I'm
lining up jobs at big tech companies.

1082
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:12,540
Now you're probably managing some point
extra with the pocket pocket protector

1083
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:15,690
and all that. Actually
I was, that's exactly,

1084
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:19,350
that was the picture you were painting,
sir. Uh, quite the opposite actually.

1085
01:04:19,351 --> 01:04:23,040
I had been working out for a few years
now and I have one and I am one of the

1086
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:27,060
Jack to people in my classes.
All right.

1087
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:29,880
So now a picture is that
dude in American psycho,

1088
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:35,460
highly achieving, totally shredded,
cannot relate to human beings.

1089
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,810
Um, I dress well, eat healthy. Please
tell me you don't listen to Huey,

1090
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,130
a Huey Lewis and the news.
Um,

1091
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,600
and always make sure to keep myself clean.

1092
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:52,350
I feel like I might alienate my
classmates from interacting with me.

1093
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:56,070
They probably think I'm just a jock in
their class where it's quite the opposite.

1094
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,220
I'm into gaming,
chess and all of that though.

1095
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,740
Do you like a fucking
a renaissance man here?

1096
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,500
So I figure I might try to
interact with the opposite crowd,

1097
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,640
the Non Geeky people.

1098
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,960
I know a way to meet people is to get out
there and do something. I I like doing,

1099
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:12,660
playing some sport or joining
a club or volunteering.

1100
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,090
The problem is with my
PR program and my work,

1101
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:16,920
I have little time to be doing much else.

1102
01:05:16,921 --> 01:05:21,790
The free time I have is Friday or Saturday
nights that I spent by myself playing

1103
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:25,390
video games or playing guitar because
I have nothing else to do. Well,

1104
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:26,680
you could go out those nights.

1105
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,940
Okay.

1106
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,730
All right. It wasn't always
this way. This is like a movie.

1107
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,780
When I was in high school,
my life was completely the
opposite. I didn't work out,

1108
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,260
eat healthy, work hard or nothing, but
I always find ways to make new friends,

1109
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:41,800
make people laugh and start conversations.
Now that I'm doing everything right,

1110
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:44,360
it seems my only problem is
social. Oh Jesus Christ. Dude.

1111
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:48,400
So you know what you're doing. You just
too busy. I fear once I graduate college,

1112
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:51,580
things will only get worse. I
lost all of my faith, my family,

1113
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,680
apart from my older brother
who was in another country.

1114
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:55,990
So once I graduate college,
I'll truly be alone.

1115
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:00,160
No one to grab a beer with no one to help
me move or anything helped me move or

1116
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:01,480
anything.
Despite all this,

1117
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:04,630
I try to be positive and thankful for
what I have and what I have accomplished.

1118
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,480
Sorry for the long email and go fuck
yourself. Yeah, Dude. You just look,

1119
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:12,360
you already know how to make friends. I
would, you need to make time to do it. Um,

1120
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,390
played video games by yourself is very
antisocial. Uh, playing guitars. Always.

1121
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,240
Cool. That's fun. Why don't you play
guitar with somebody else? Find somebody,

1122
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:25,950
plays drums. I play Bass. Get
together, do some covers, you know,

1123
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:30,600
jam. Fuck around. Get
off, drink some beers.

1124
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,890
Invite some ladies over. You do every
week you just add some more shit, right?

1125
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:40,890
You know, start taking bets. Open your
own fucking a draft kinks. You know,

1126
01:06:40,891 --> 01:06:42,000
maybe start selling coke.

1127
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:47,390
Just keep expanding your
ring of a social interaction.

1128
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,030
I'm obviously fucking with
you, but no, I would, uh,

1129
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,460
there's a bunch of people
that are into video games.

1130
01:06:53,461 --> 01:06:56,940
Why don't you find somebody that you can
play against? Can you do that anymore?

1131
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:01,140
The kids do that or do you have
to go online to do it? You know,

1132
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,000
is that like Corny?

1133
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:07,840
Now doesn't two people not sit next to
each other with an Atari with a joy stick

1134
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:11,710
and the one red button is, are we
past that? I don't fucking know,

1135
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:15,380
but it seems like you know how to do
that stuff. He just got busy. And, uh,

1136
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,220
with all your achievements, you,
you know, sometimes, you know,

1137
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:21,880
when you go after a goal,
some things suffer. All right.

1138
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:24,980
I've talked about this numerous
times when I was on, um,

1139
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,980
you know,
when I was 36 years old though,

1140
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:33,290
I was fucking living alone in a studio
apartment that they called the one

1141
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:36,230
bedroom, sleeping on a futon. I
remember days just going by going,

1142
01:07:36,231 --> 01:07:37,250
what the fuck have I done?

1143
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,800
The only thing I've worked on
is trying to become a comedian.

1144
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,180
Everything else is at the starting
line. And, uh, over the next 10 years,

1145
01:07:44,181 --> 01:07:48,700
I just worked on some shit like that.
So that's all you need to do. All right.

1146
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:52,600
Jesus Christ. I'm starting to feel
like doctor Phil here. Um, all right.

1147
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:55,580
What do we got here?
Third and goal?

1148
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:59,900
Broncos have the ball with three minutes
left and I'll do an a fucking podcast.

1149
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,610
Touchdown Broncos.

1150
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,190
Okay.

1151
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,140
All right.
All right.

1152
01:08:04,141 --> 01:08:08,490
Broncos ne go celebrate and act like
a bunch of fucking idiots when Ben

1153
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:09,600
Roethlisberger has three minutes left.

1154
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,140
Okay.

1155
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:14,860
This one is not over. All right. So what
does this do? This puts them up by five

1156
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,700
people in the crowd
holding up two fingers.

1157
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:21,460
Like the crowd's going to look at them.
Oh yeah. Yeah. We should go for two,

1158
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:25,810
shouldn't we? We shouldn't just be
up by six. Thank you. Thank you.

1159
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:30,790
The you and the fucking a
mezzanine level. Ah, fuck.

1160
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,150
Okay.

1161
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,600
Are we gonna have to go to Denver?
Is this going to be one more?

1162
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,860
One more break? Either way.
This is going to be great.

1163
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:44,540
Either you get to see Brady versus
Peyton manning. One more time.

1164
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:45,900
Okay.

1165
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,540
I'm assuming he's retiring,
which is stupid. Or you get
to see another patriots,

1166
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:54,430
a Steelers matchup with fucking big Ben.

1167
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:59,880
Big Bad. Not Afraid of anything. Big
Bed, both grade teams. All right.

1168
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,380
That's the podcast for this week.

1169
01:09:01,381 --> 01:09:03,630
I apologize that my head was
kind of all over the place.

1170
01:09:03,631 --> 01:09:07,260
I don't know what flying and going
to the fucking airport does to me.

1171
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,073
MMM.

1172
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:12,950
But, uh, it makes me even more
fucking scatter brained. So anyways,

1173
01:09:12,951 --> 01:09:17,240
go fuck yourself and I will talk to
you on Thursday. Okay. All right.
