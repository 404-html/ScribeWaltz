1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,130
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,540
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,230
August 29th, 2016 what's
going on out? Why? Yeah.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,180
Ah, I'm back. I'm back on the time.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:19,020
No more jet lag and all that.
I apologize for the, um,

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,320
I sounded like I was coked up
on my last fucking podcast.

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,090
I was listening to what I was cracking up.
I was like,

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,440
I literally sound like I'm wired out of
my fucking mind, but if I didn't do that,

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:33,390
I was going to fall asleep. Um, so sorry.
Got a little loud. I got a little fast.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,980
I got a little hyper, but um, I
think last night I finally beat,

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,290
I was starting to fall asleep again. It's
seven. I kept falling asleep at seven,

12
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:46,070
then I wake up at two 30 in the morning
and I, that's not a good time to wake up,

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,780
you know, as a person by yourself waking
up at two 30 in the morning. You, you,

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,040
you have nothing to do but your mind
to just sit there fucking with you.

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,510
You know, what are you doing,
Bill? You're getting older.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,280
I don't everything you're supposed
to be doing and you just like,

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,810
you're walking around,
shut the fuck up. You know.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,950
Isn't it amazing how loud your feeder,

19
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,110
when everybody else in
the house is sleeping?

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,480
It's so full at two 30 in the morning.

21
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,560
You can literally like I'll be at my desk
and I'll take a pen out of a glass cup

22
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:21,710
and I swear to God by full,
we'll start downstairs.

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,210
What was that?
Oh that,

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,460
oh I'm sorry honey.
I put a sock on.

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,810
Well can you keep it out of sleeping?

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,590
Everything is so fucking
loud at that hour and a,

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,563
yeah.

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,990
So I've just been a last night I started
to fall asleep again and around seven

29
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:48,750
38 so I just drove down to the Improv.

30
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:52,140
Didn't even do a spot cause I felt
like my head was in a cloud and I just

31
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:56,390
fucking, I just walked around
and talking to people and um,

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,450
you know, it was great. I went
down, I got a fucking salad,

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,040
you know one of those comedy clubs,
Salads. Except this was a good one.

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,490
So I'm back right now cause I got to drop
like fucking 10 pounds before I do my

35
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,650
next special, which is
going to be recorded, uh,

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,030
in Nashville at the Ryman
theater on October 21st. Uh,

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,780
very excited about
that. And, um, you know,

38
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:21,140
I gotta I gotta drop like 10,
12 pounds,

39
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,640
so I don't look like a fucking Billy
fat head on this thing. So, uh,

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,770
last week was the a, all right, I'll start
doing some cardio, blah, blah, blah, blah,

41
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:32,430
blah. Still eat like a fucking
jackass and that, you know,

42
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:36,390
but make attempts to not totally
eat like a fucking jackass.

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,750
And now this week is when,
now it's like, all right,

44
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm going to the grocery store.

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,350
Yeah.

46
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,020
And I'm doing, I'm going back to
my fucking that fucking, I need,

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,260
need to lose weight diet,

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,550
just like a third of a cup of
oatmeal and a fucking egg over easy.

49
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,040
No fucking toast.
None of that bullshit.

50
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,730
Okay.

51
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,920
And what do I have? Have like a
fucking apple between then and,

52
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,800
and then for lunch I have like fucking
Turkey slices and some other bullshit.

53
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,680
And then around four o'clock,
I don't know what the fire of a protein,

54
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,980
like a Turkey patty with a
little bit of fucking salad.

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,270
And then for dinner, a couple hours
later there's another fucking protein.

56
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:17,260
And sometimes I'll just go like a
fuck it sell. It sucks. It's not fun.

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,060
You know, my wife asked me to make
a strawberry fucking shortcake,

58
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,650
so I'm going to do that,
you know, so I'll have that.

59
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:27,350
I always got to have a little bit of
crack on the back burner. But um, anyway,

60
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:29,620
so I'm back into that.
Just going to do fucking cardio.

61
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:34,090
45 minutes of fucking day over there
and hopefully the ship, we'll uh,

62
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,680
start to come off because a,

63
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:39,310
I was disgusted with myself when I
got back from vacation. Holy Shit.

64
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,880
Yeah,

65
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,800
Dude. I was doing that shit, putting on my
socks and making those noises. Uh, uh, um.

66
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,300
Anyways, I want to thank everybody
who came out to, uh, the, uh,

67
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,430
was it the Silver Lake Casino?
Whatever the fuck it is.

68
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:55,460
This silver something casino
up there in Reno and uh,

69
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,270
hey was I write about Todd rex t rex was,

70
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:03,290
I write about Todd rex.
I told you the man was a beast.

71
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,160
I told you he fucking kills. I told you
one of the funniest guys in the country,

72
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:08,270
this fucking asshole.

73
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,230
I say that most endearing way ever did
15 minutes in front of me and got a

74
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,390
partial standing ovation.
Okay?

75
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,970
Okay.

76
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,630
All right. And I'm sitting
there going like, dude,

77
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,780
you're supposed to be opening the show.
Like, hey, how's it going everybody?

78
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,780
Let's get settled into the little
fucking knock knock. Who's there?

79
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,470
This guy did like a closing
set for 50 fucking minutes.

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,190
I heard it from the crowd when they clap,
they didn't want him to get off. Um,

81
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,140
but anyways, we had a, we
had such a great time update.

82
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:40,430
The crowd was fucking amazing.
And I'll tell you an underrated,

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,450
underrated right here and
now is fucking not only Reno,

84
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,820
but Reno is international airport.

85
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,040
Okay.

86
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,560
I don't know why they were all
international. I've never heard him.

87
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,950
But where are you going?
I'm going to Paris flying out of Reno,

88
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,510
like I've never heard that connecting
through Reno and then I'm going to South

89
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,990
Africa. Um, Reno's
international airport, um,

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,710
great food. I, when you walk right in,

91
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,950
this is place across from
where they have all these, uh,

92
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,770
they have all this golf where by the way,

93
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,460
which I am totally fucking addicted to
those polo shirts in the fucking action

94
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:20,270
slacks. You know, can I
just just stop for a second?

95
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:25,170
Can I just want to thank all the F
unathletic fucking people out there.

96
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,600
All the fat fucks.

97
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:30,900
All the people who literally if they
tried to bend down and touch their toes,

98
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:34,920
they do a somersault. I just want to
thank all of you for taking up that gate.

99
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,440
Attempting to walk a couple of
holes and rather than addressing it,

100
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,160
dressing yourself and how
fucking out of shape you are.

101
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,140
You turned around and complained to
the companies that your balls were too

102
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:54,060
sweaty and that your shirt was too tight
because all of your fat fuck complaints,

103
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,050
right is,

104
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,090
is basically created the most comfortable
fucking clothes I've ever worn in my

105
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,090
life.

106
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,090
I wear them all the time now it's that
get comfortable as hell and my wife hates

107
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:10,710
them. So it's, it's, oh,

108
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,100
every time I walk out the fucking door,
my wait, wait, wait. Are you going?

109
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,180
You going to go meet Tiger Woods?

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,840
Other the greatest fucking clothes over.
It's unreal.

111
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,460
You put on one of those golf shirts,
you go to reach for something.

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,770
It just stretches with you.
You feel like you're doing yoga,

113
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:31,190
but you're like just reaching for a donut.
It's the greatest.

114
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,820
If you're not wearing fucking
golf clothes. All right,
let me tell you something.

115
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:39,110
If you're an old fuck, like you're in
your forties, like me, 48 sliding into 50,

116
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,690
you are a fucking asshole.

117
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,170
If you're not walking around wearing
just golf clothing, you know,

118
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,880
and the sweet spot is,

119
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,940
is to just buy the clothing and
not get sucked in to that game.

120
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,420
I'm not saying it's a bad fucking game.
It's actually a fun, it's more, it's like,

121
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:00,020
I dunno, it's like smoking
a cigar with your friends,

122
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:03,650
but you're also walking around hitting
this fucking ball. Um, I have a good time.

123
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:04,391
Anytime I played,

124
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:09,391
just because I do not take it seriously
and I count every fucking stroke.

125
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,050
I don't do any mulligans. I don't say
there's any gimmes I come in and about,

126
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,700
you know, I played nine holes.
I come in and about a buck 30,

127
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,500
you know, and I count every
stroke and I do it loudly.

128
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,200
So all the fucking cheat and
cons that I go out. Well,

129
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:32,450
it's a gimme that's a Mulligan fuck
you're talking about, let's see.

130
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,820
You know something that's the
only fucking, I'm telling you,

131
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,560
it's why it's not as it is. It is.
It's an activity. It's a fucking skill.

132
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,390
Okay. And the guys at the
top level domain in the lase,

133
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,770
they are athletes without a fucking
doubt. But I'm just saying, you know,

134
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,730
Michael Jordan plays a game of
darts. I mean, he's still an athlete.

135
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,410
You know what I mean? Darts is not
a fucking athletic endeavor. Right.

136
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,510
I Dunno. All I know is the
fucking clothes are tremendous.

137
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,710
And um, you know, it was
great. I was looking yesterday,

138
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:11,510
I was actually watching this golf event.
Um, I like watching on Sundays. Like,

139
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,470
you know what I love about golf is how
they try to act like it's this upper

140
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,830
crust thing and you listen to the crowd
and you can hear it with the people

141
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,550
yelling.

142
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,550
They all go to the track like golf
and betting on horses in bowling,

143
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,580
you know they're all fucking kissing
cousins, all of them. All right?

144
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,280
And Boland just is like whatever.
We're fucking bowling.

145
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,010
Eat a fucking grilled cheese sandwich as
your role in it. We don't give a shit,

146
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:37,970
but golf,

147
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,340
golf fans that fucking like that
arrogant in l cut above type of thing.

148
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,020
You know like Democrats,

149
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,280
like Republicans are
the bowlers of politics.

150
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,590
They are not to pretend to be sub. They're
not. They don't give a fuck about me.

151
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,560
They don't give a fuck about you.
And they don't pretend to.

152
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,970
Democrats on the other
hand try to act like they,

153
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:07,200
they actually give a fuck about people
when they get paid by the exact same

154
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,380
fucking assholes. You know, they
keep the fucking war is going.

155
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,630
They know what's up,
they know what's up.

156
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:16,800
They didn't want to see
that 1963 convertible limo
pulling up to the White House

157
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,750
staff.
I don't want to get back in that thing.

158
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,590
You will give them what the fuck they
want or you serve will be taking a trip to

159
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:30,000
Dallas. Um, I know I'm out of my fucking
my, what am I so fucking podcast?

160
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,750
Just relaxed. I don't
know. Fucking read. Um,

161
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,250
but when you listen to the crowd at a golf
event, I'm telling you right now like,

162
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,340
like, you know, you don't, golf actually
has the nerve to fucking pretend.

163
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,350
They think that they have the same sort
of crowd that you find it a formula one

164
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,790
event.
All right?

165
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,640
What you have at a golf event is a
bunch of fat fucking dopes and really,

166
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,910
really comfortable fucking clothes,
you know?

167
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:01,560
And anytime anybody hits the ball,
why they all have to yell at the ball,

168
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,130
get it.

169
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,810
You know, they, he, he, you know what
it is. You know why they yell like that?

170
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,390
It's because there's so
used to being at the track,

171
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,860
yelling at the dog or the
horse getting outcome. Right?

172
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,260
Come on, you're six. What type, right?

173
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,340
You take it to a golf Canada
Golf Event Day. They, that,

174
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:26,260
that's just how they're behaving.
If you really look at the people,

175
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:28,960
if you have time, they're fucking
animals. And this is thing too.

176
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,250
They know their animals and I know that
they know their animals because those

177
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:37,540
fucking assholes. We'll stand
in front of somebody teeing off,

178
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,080
looking down at like you ever see people
like when the subway's late and they're

179
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,340
fucking looking down the tunnel.

180
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,170
They're doing that while somebody is
driving a professional is God forbid.

181
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,130
I can't believe nobody's ever
gotten killed. Good, fine.

182
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,730
I mean I would have, I'd have a fucking
pan if I was a professional golfer.

183
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,400
Like that would be my nightmare. I hit
some little kid in the fucking forehead.

184
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,680
Um, yeah, the fucking
animals. But anyways, uh,

185
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,540
I cannot say enough about the clothing.

186
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,140
So I'm sitting there
watching the event and uh,

187
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,690
one of the guys who of course is falling
apart, they all end up falling apart.

188
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,790
You know what I mean?
All of these golfers,

189
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,660
I don't understand what the fucking
problem is cause I don't play the game.

190
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:26,330
But I just don't understand it.
There's nobody stopping you.

191
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,530
Nobody's getting in your face.
You know, like Tony Romo,

192
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,920
you fucking rolled out and somebody
tackled you and you're broke.

193
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,260
You're broke bones in your vertebrae.

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,380
Okay?

195
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,300
Standing over a fucking ball. You got
a club. Just hit the fucking thick.

196
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,850
What is the fucking problem?
You're already in the winner's circle.

197
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,240
You're already going to win six figures.
Everything else is fucking gravy.

198
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,820
And then he's like, no, you
don't understand dude. Yeah,

199
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,400
it's a game against yourself will
be once you have that one bad shot,

200
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,490
you know you got, you got to forget
about it, blah, blah. It's like, dude,

201
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,320
you're literally
describing life right now.

202
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,483
I love,

203
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,020
I absolutely love oversimplifying the
game of golf because people have such a

204
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,310
passion for it.
And um,

205
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,230
when people really enjoy something
as a comedian, if you make fun of it,

206
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,540
you get to see them get upset.
And for whatever reason,

207
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,770
if you're truly a comic, it, it fills
up your heart. Not, don't listen to me.

208
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:29,430
I'm fucking with you. I think golf's a
great game. It's a fun me look, you get,

209
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:32,340
you get yourself a six of course
light, right? You get yourself a nice,

210
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:36,870
a nice fucking stick. You know, I do that
right now, but I'll tell you right now,

211
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:40,230
I can't do 18 holes.
I can't do what I like.

212
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,750
Yeah.

213
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,810
Do an 18 holes. That's like a marriage.
You know what I mean? I'm going to fling.

214
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,610
I want to do, I want to go to a
fucking par three, nine hole course,

215
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,810
you know? Uh, actually that'll
probably go by too quickly. You know,

216
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,730
from smoking a stick, whatever I do,
your honor, I would just like whatever.

217
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,610
Where am I go? Right. This is how I
would like to play golf. I have a cigar.

218
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,280
All right. I like the fucking
thing I should do. Right.

219
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,670
Set it down. Wherever the fuck I said
I have a, I'll have the little fucking,

220
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,400
they've got to have like a on your bag.
You know what I mean?

221
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:20,980
Remember a Rodney Dangerfield
in Caddyshack. He had all
those extra, you know,

222
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,150
the radio. He had all that
shit. There's no fucking way.

223
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:26,330
They don't have an attachment where you
can have your fucking lit cigar still

224
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:29,900
gone. As you stay, have
you address your ball,

225
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,500
you mean stand over and
get ready to hit it. Um,

226
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,340
ugh.

227
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,160
And those watching those fucking old
fucking people getting down on their

228
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,340
fucking hands and knees when they're
on the green trying to read the Putt,

229
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,070
you're watching their face
getting all fucking red, you know,

230
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:51,440
and you're just standing there
halfway down the fairway. Well,

231
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:56,160
you just fuck it that day.
Jesus fucking Christ.

232
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,250
Okay.

233
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,550
Trying to take a couple of strokes
off my game. Oh, kill yourself.

234
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,840
Just hit the fucking ball. Just be happy.
You're still walking around. All right.

235
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:10,460
You Bacon and cheese on leading.
Fuck. Um, that's another thing too,

236
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:14,930
is then it always ends up getting backed
up or, you know, something that I,

237
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,800
I uh, I just feel too much
stress when I'm playing golf.

238
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,960
There's always that group
of people behind me.

239
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,780
There were always better than me
and I feel like a fucking asshole.

240
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,450
Like I'm ruining the day,
you know?

241
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,150
Like when the few times I've golfed,
I feel the same level as stress.

242
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,890
Like when I'm the first person
and a red light to make a left,

243
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,950
you know,
and there's like five people behind me,

244
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,380
like literally my heart starts racing
because I know that not only is it my job

245
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:48,590
to make sure that the person behind me
makes it through the fucking light. Okay.

246
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,090
Like the, the person behind the person
is that works out here in la by the way,

247
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,750
for all you Boston people, so you don't
fucking almost get yourself killed.

248
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,500
You know that move you do in Boston
with the light turns green and you just

249
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,030
stomp on the fucking gas and
you cut in front of people is,

250
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,750
as far as I know,

251
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,280
Boston is the only area of the country
that does that and it's totally

252
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:13,310
acceptable.
Like as soon as the light turns green,

253
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:17,480
you just stomp on the gas and fucking
cut in front of two lanes of traffic out

254
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:21,350
here. If you do that, you're going to
get killed. Uh, nobody's ready for it.

255
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,320
They're not good drivers and it's going
to be at least three lanes of shit

256
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,740
coming at Ya.
Um,

257
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
my brother came out and visited me one
time and I forgot about that move and we

258
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:37,220
were on like Venice Boulevard and the
light turned green and he stomped on the

259
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:40,890
fucking gas and I just put my foot up on
the dashboard was like Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh,

260
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:41,724
Doh, Doh, Doh.

261
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,990
We made it halfway across and up and,

262
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,360
and he was like, you
know, like when you don't,

263
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,970
like when you're driving and you don't
know what's going on in the other

264
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:55,240
person's freaking out, but you can't
figure out what you get. Like mad. I was,

265
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,930
I was like, dude, dude, dude,
dude, he just stopped me.
He's like, he's like, why?

266
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,470
Everybody's beeping at him. And I was just
like, dude, you can't do that out here.

267
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,670
You can't. And he goes, all right.

268
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:10,330
Then we had to just sit there and everyone
drove around us looking at us like,

269
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:14,980
what the fuck? Anyways, getting
back to the golf thing. So, um,

270
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:15,814
so out here,

271
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,020
one of my pet peeves is fucking people
who's the first people in line. Your job,

272
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,880
you get out into the intersection, you
get out into the intersection, right.

273
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,480
And you make sure that not only the
person behind you, the person behind you,

274
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,400
yeah.

275
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,280
Behind the person behind you. There you
go to fucking cars back. Jesus bill.

276
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,940
You know, that's why I feel like,
like when I'm golfing, I swear to God,

277
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,920
one of these times I'm just going to do,
I'm going to fucking,

278
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,690
I got this Gopro for my birthday. It's
still sitting on my desk just mocking me.

279
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:45,420
Gone. Yeah. You thought you could
figure this out, didn't you bill? Yeah.

280
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,460
He really thought you were going
to use this fucking thing. Um,

281
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,210
I would love to give a fuck in tutorial
on how to drive in La. I really wouldn't,

282
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,850
you know what I mean? And I'm
talking, I just had to behave.

283
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,200
There's too many fucking people out here.
The traffic is fucking ridiculous.

284
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,980
I just really want to do this. I'll even
tell you how to be a good pedestrian.

285
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,420
Alright. You get in the crosswalk,
he fucking hustle. Okay.

286
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,190
You know what I mean? I've,
I've been with walking. Okay.

287
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:17,330
And I see I'm approaching the intersection
and I see that person wanting to turn

288
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,400
in looking at me like,
fuck, you know what I do?

289
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,520
I stopped by wave from throw to third
base coach waving like five cars through.

290
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,420
Go ahead. Go ahead. Cause the
second this thing's turns red,

291
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:33,320
I can just run a crossed,
it'll be fine. Five cars,

292
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:38,321
we'll fucking make it and I'll get
across no biggie or I can be a Douche and

293
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:41,450
just completely not even pay
attention to the situation you're in,

294
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:45,710
in your car acting like I've never been
that guy and just stroll across the

295
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,800
street and I'll fuck at least two people
out of the light. You know what I mean?

296
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,080
You know,

297
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,410
to start when I'm talking about right
now I'm talking about having a little bit

298
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:57,000
of empathy,
which brings me to Colin Kaepernick.

299
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,610
Oh, a segue. I am not going to watch,

300
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,180
um, I'm not gonna Watch
any part of this story.

301
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,560
Only thing. I'm a, I'm just going to
listen to what he says, which is I think,

302
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,394
you know,

303
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,240
I'm not going to sit here and these
fucking assholes on sports radio are going

304
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:18,280
to try to get me all fucking stirred up.

305
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Like what he's doing is going to somehow
bring down this country and second of

306
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:26,470
all,
like I'm going to say I can't,

307
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:30,850
I cannot sit there and listen to a
bunch of people act like they don't

308
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:35,110
understand where this is coming from.
You know what I mean?

309
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,210
This is a good time. I
think. I Dunno, I, you know,

310
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,980
I'm not going to tell you what to do,
but I think this is, for me personally,

311
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:44,290
I'm like, you know what, I'm
a white male heterosexual.

312
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,640
I could basically within reason
do whatever the fuck I want to do.

313
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,540
Here's a guy who was making zillions of
fucking dollars and he still feels this

314
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,130
way. This is, this is,

315
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,650
I should probably shut the fuck up and
listen to what he has to say as supposed

316
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:04,570
to. All of these soapbox cons
saw this person. Like, you know,

317
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:06,680
of course, you know, shows a picture of,

318
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,500
of a soldier who lost both his fucking
legs and writes all this fucking

319
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:14,080
bullshit. And I so wanted to just
tweet to the person and be like, Hey,

320
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:17,580
let me ask you a question. What
sets soldier's name? You know,

321
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,610
what happened to that person?
Are they being taken care of?

322
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,680
Do you know anything about that person?
Well, you just fucking whored out though.

323
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,670
The worst fucking thing that obviously
has happened in this guy's fucking life

324
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,170
is, is for your own political
propaganda. I don't know.

325
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:36,950
I can't even talk about it.

326
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,880
I just can't stand white people who don't
act do act like they don't understand.

327
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,430
Okay.

328
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,730
You know, I don't know.
But you know something,

329
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:47,800
I can't even get mad because
I'm a hypocrite. Everybody's
a fucking hypocrite.

330
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,060
This literally people out there,

331
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,920
they're going to chastise that guy and
act like they don't understand what he's

332
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,470
talking about when,

333
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,940
and completely not in touch with
the fact that if he moved into their

334
00:19:58,941 --> 00:19:59,774
neighborhood,

335
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,980
okay.

336
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,490
You know,

337
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,480
let's just say he was unknown and a black
guy moved into that neighborhood that,

338
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:09,920
you know, how not thrilled they
would be. You know what I mean?

339
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,370
But it says this,
the amount of fucking people out there,

340
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:16,040
it's fucking hilarious if you read what
half the shit that people are writing

341
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,220
this say as guys should be lucky
to in this fucking country blood.

342
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,910
And then in the, in the middle of
that are writing racist shit. Um,

343
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,840
that's why I think this is a great thing.

344
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,360
I think it's great that
he's doing it and uh, um,

345
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,470
it's just a way that to open up by a
little conversation. I mean, I dunno,

346
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,260
as soon as, I don't
think it's, it's, it's,

347
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,260
it's going to turn into a bunch of people
fucking yelling at each other as it

348
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:45,830
always does. And then unfortunately,
nothing's going to get changed.

349
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,300
It's going to be a bunch people
go on my kids in the fucking navy,

350
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,900
my uncle thought, dear
doctor, you're free to

351
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
go back to fucking Swahili,
write whatever the fuck they gonna say.

352
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,070
Completely ignore the fact
that, you know, there was,

353
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,100
there's been an astounding level of
cell phone video over the last couple of

354
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,460
years.
Can you at least admit that?

355
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,180
Have some pretty questionable
fucking slash murderous behavior,

356
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,770
all this shit yet your whole life
that you heard black people saying was

357
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:18,250
happening now this video,
and I'm not saying all cops are bad,

358
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm not saying everybody
black is fucking innocent.

359
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,750
I'm just saying I've seen
a lot of fucking people,

360
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,330
black pinned on the fucking ground.

361
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,600
No hopes of getting up shot the back
of just shot in the fucking chest.

362
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:32,500
So you kid, you know, if you're a
fucking rational yeah. Human being,

363
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,410
regardless of color,

364
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:36,080
can you really sit there and act like
you don't understand where that's coming

365
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:40,790
from? So I don't want to listen to, uh,

366
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,350
I dunno. I, I, you can't fuck it.

367
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,150
You're going to argue with
somebody on their experience.

368
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,450
Let me tell you something. Your, your,
your idea of how your life going is wrong.

369
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,170
And I can say that cause I'm over here
live in my own fucking life. So anyways,

370
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,770
um, I think it's great that he's
fucking doing it and hopefully it,

371
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:07,040
it goes into a, uh, in a,

372
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,830
in a positive direction because, you
know what, I don't, I don't think that,

373
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,940
I don't think any cop wants to go out and
shoot somebody that's innocent either.

374
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,110
You know what I mean?
I don't know what's going,

375
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:20,670
I have no fucking idea what's going on,

376
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:24,630
but I definitely think something
ought to be discussed. You know,

377
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,110
they're now I'm off my fucking soapbox,
but I,

378
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm hoping more people than not won't
respond to this guy with fucking anger.

379
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,980
I really don't think that that's
the way to go about it. Um,

380
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,360
but in my heart of hearts,
I know that that's what's going to happen.

381
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,280
I know he's going to get booed on the
road by a bunch of fucking lunatics and,

382
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,680
uh, it, it's going to be ugly.

383
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,500
It's going to be fucking ugly and there's
going to be people holding up signs

384
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,340
and they're going to make his
life experience about them.

385
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:01,050
Um, which I think is a selfish
thing to do at this point. Okay.

386
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,670
Nobody's saying that you know, anybody
who fights for this country isn't a hero.

387
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,720
Nobody's saying that. I think this
guy's just saying, hey, you know,

388
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,520
my group of people is getting murdered.
You know,

389
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,350
innocent people are getting murdered
in this needs to stop. Uh, how,

390
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,320
how you could be against that,
I don't know.

391
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:24,321
And how you would then somehow wrap
your fucking life into his shit when you

392
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,760
know, at least I can't do that when
I can drive down the fucking street.

393
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,810
You only have fucking hilarious story.
One time my brother in law, right,

394
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,500
was going to move across this country
and he was driving across the country in

395
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,580
this sheer panic.

396
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,610
My wife and my mother in law
had it instantly a sketch
to me cause I'm thinking,

397
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:47,510
Nah,
you drive it across the country.

398
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,630
You got to do route 66, you
know, make sure you hit the arch

399
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,390
and they are in full on panic mode
going, don't, don't drive at night.

400
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,100
Always stop in major cities.

401
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,690
Do not get off the highway in the middle
of major said like they were in like

402
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:07,080
you would think that this,
that he was in Russia and uh,

403
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,513
you know,

404
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,090
okay.

405
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,680
I mean right there,
can you imagine?

406
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:14,830
You imagine fucking driving across the
country and if you get pulled off in the

407
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:18,520
middle of nowhere that it could be a
chance you could get shot to death just

408
00:24:18,521 --> 00:24:20,020
because you're reaching for your license.

409
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,040
And I'm not saying it's fucking
everybody and all that shit, but that,

410
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,900
that is actually a,

411
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,050
something that could happen to a
citizen in this fucking country is,

412
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,820
is pretty crazy. So, um, I dunno,

413
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,090
I already said I was off my soapbox,

414
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,880
but I was instantly just
picturing that as a sketch.

415
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:42,730
That would be like a great Chappelle
show sketch. Now would it be a great one,

416
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,150
Bill? Why I think Chappelle could make
it great. How about that? You know,

417
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,640
just have to really white
guy in the background. Okay.

418
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,320
You got to see old faithful,

419
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,140
you know,
he's big on route 66 Europeans.

420
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,680
I Dunno what propaganda
they sent them over there,

421
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,650
but they are fucking all about,
I've met more God the, and people,

422
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,080
when I go over to Europe that have gay,

423
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,690
they always say you have a
driven route 66. I'm like, dude,

424
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:13,580
I barely know where it is. I know
Santa Monica is a part of it and um,

425
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,460
I want to say it starts somewhere in
Illinois. Does it start out of Chicago?

426
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:19,800
Okay.

427
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,530
I Dunno, but they're all about it.
They're all about coming over here,

428
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,830
renting a classic car.
And so many of them are done it.

429
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:27,480
And they showed me the
pictures. I'm like, fuck,

430
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:31,560
I got to do that when I get out
there and big daddy don garlics.

431
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,360
Um, all right. Let me read a little bit
of advertising here for the fucking week.

432
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,930
Um, all right, go.

433
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,160
You guys had mentioned going to figure
out my fucking podcast cause I have to

434
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:49,590
mutter to myself at the time. I fucking do
this shit. I always fuck it up. Hang on,

435
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:53,160
let me hit pause so you don't have
to go through this torture. Okay.

436
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,050
Just like that. We're back. All right. Um,

437
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,120

the week. Uh, oh, the Tim Ferriss show,

438

441
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,240
which was selected as one
of iTunes best of two 50.

442
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,280
Now,
the Monday morning podcast wasn't.

443
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,440
His show was look how big on being
right now. I could be all upset.

444
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,690
Have a podcast protest. The podcast
has been downloaded by more than 80,

445
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,020
more than 80 million times Jesus Christ.

You know what I mean?

459
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,740
He just appealed to me all the way
down to people who are illiterate.

460
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:21,480
The fact that they had the copy had to
spell out four hour and the name Tim

461
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,960
is that t. E. M I can't find

All right. Frame Bridge everybody,

489

00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:22,840
Well God damn it. You're never going
to do it because it takes too long.

492
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,820
It costs too much money and it's a
pain in the fork and age. Remember,

493
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,930
remember when cameras
weren't part of your phone?

494
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,100
The way we take pictures to change but
the way we frame them hasn't until now.

495
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,000

frame symbol.

503
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,680

You know what I'm going to fucking
do. I got to, I, you know something.

515
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,390
When I was over in England,

516
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,480
I sold out a show and they sent me this
little fucking picture of selling out

517
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:43,780
the, uh, the Apollo Hammer
Smith. So fucking cool.

518
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:47,110
Looks like I sold a million albums or
something as opposed to selling a couple

519
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,560
hundred fucking tickets.
Um,

520
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,490
but of course it came here and
it's all cracked up and I'm like,

521
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:56,200
I don't want to deal with that. Thank
God his frame bridge. All right.

522
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:59,770
Frame Bridge offers happiness
and guarantee their team
gives each item personal

523
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:04,000
care and attention because meeting your
expectations is as important as meeting

524
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:07,120
their own instead of, oh, I think it's a
little less important. The end of the day,

525
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:09,540
you gotta make your money and it can
be homeless. In medicine is Canada.

526
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,870
They just talking pictures instead of
the hundreds you pay at a framing store,

527
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,670
their prices start at $39 in all the
shipping is free. Jesus fucking Christ.

528
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,550
This is too much copy at right now.

532
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:30,980
How many more of these? I've
got to break this up. Uh,

533
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,600
the fuck is it?
What do we got left here?

534
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,223
Yeah.

535
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,980
Ooh,

536
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,950
okay. We got two more simply safe
and MVMT watches. I'll, I'll,

537
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,760
I'll read that shit later. Um,
anyways, let's Talk Formula One racing.

538
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:52,120
Everybody did. Uh, did anybody,

539
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,190
anybody watched the fucking Belgium
Grand Prix? I watched the replay of it.

540
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:58,840
Thank God.
I want to thank whoever texts me going,

541
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:01,960
you watching this fucking race cause I
thought they will off for all of August.

542
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,920
Um, congratulations to Nico. Rosberg I
don't know if that puts him back in front.

543
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,710
I should probably look this shit up. Okay.
Through the magic of the pause button.

544
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,890
I just looked it up.
A Formula One standings.

545
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,840
Lewis Hamilton still in front of 232
points to Nico Rosberg's two 23 bite they

546
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:20,830
go is really important to come out
of the Craig for Nico to get a win.

547
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,510
I don't know what happened with Louis
for some reason. He started in 25th, um,

548
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,960
25th fucking place.
Uh,

549
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,420
for some reason he had a bunch
of penalties or something.

550
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:33,460
It's like he had a bunch of parking
tickets and he's like, well,

551
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:34,840
I'll just pay them all at this race.

552
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:37,960
And they stuck him at the back of the
race and because he's one of the greatest

553
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:42,680
drivers are at least right now,
he went from 25th to third.

554
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,780
The guy still made the podium,
which was pretty, uh, which was,

555
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:48,614
um,

556
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,770
yeah,

557
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,960
which is pretty amazing. Um, I look at all
of this, the gun, a little gossip here.

558
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,230
I've never seen more people bumping
into each other. Yesterday's race,

559
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,840
it was fucking unreal. In the
first turn. The Ferrari team,

560
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,230
they slammed into each other while it's
other client was trying to cut down low

561
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,650
and then he says to his team, are
they ran into me? It's like, dude,

562
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,670
what were you were driving
on the sidewalk, whatever
the fuck you call it. Um,

563
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,161
so anyway,

564
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:15,710
somebody said Max for staff and will cause
a massive accident sooner or later if

565
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,810
he does not change as driving tactics.

566
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,140
Ferrari driver Kimmy Raikkonen and
says, oh, he must've ran into him.

567
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,520
Reagan was angry after an incident
during Sundays. Belgium Grand Prix,

568
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:29,180
the latest of series of controversies
related to the Dutchman's driving the

569
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:33,050
fence said, if I had not break, we
would have had a massive accident.

570
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,510
It will happen sooner or later.
If he doesn't change,

571
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:38,750
I am fine with good heart racing.
But that is not correct.

572
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,730
A raikkonen swore over the radio because
of a tactic red bull's Verstappen had

573
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,800
adopt. Oh he for stopped
employment with the red bull.

574
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,380
My fault has adopted repeatedly this year,

575
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,100
which is to drive in the middle of the
track and only make a defensive move at

576
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:54,620
the last moment when he sees which way?

577
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:58,770
The drivers attacking is coming for
stopping, raking in and Ferrari.

578
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:03,650
Sebastian Vettel vital collided at the
first corner of the race with all three

579
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:04,730
cars,
suffering damage.

580
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:09,731
But it was an incident on the chemicals
straight later in the race that angered

581
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:14,720
the fin. Other guys defend,
but they do it correctly. Yeah,

582
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,610
I uh, yeah, I guess you're supposed to,

583
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:19,040
you're only allowed to make one move
is somebody is going around you.

584
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,860
You're allowed to make one
move to get in front of him.

585
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,560
He can't start fucking
zigzagging back and forth. Um,

586
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,340
oh man. It's just, I don't, I can't,

587
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:30,440
I can't believe I finally got into this
shit and I, as you can listen, you know,

588
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:33,650
if you actually watch this stuff, I don't
know what the fuck I'm talking about,

589
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,180
but I really enjoy it.

590
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:39,560
And yesterday's race was the kind of
race than I wish they were all like,

591
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,690
I think when they're fucking
bumping into each other,

592
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:45,650
it was like fucking Mad Max, you
know? And this track was crazy.

593
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,320
They had like major fucking downhills.

594
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,680
So He'd be coming up the hill and
I learned yesterday, you know,

595
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:54,650
they call it compression, the cars, you
know, sticking to the fucking ground.

596
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,760
So you've got a lot of traction.

597
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,630
Then you come up over that hill and
they say the road falls away from you,

598
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,270
which really made my fucking stomach
drop because it driving like, you know,

599
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,610
180 miles an hour with the road dropping
away from now you're like coming out of

600
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:11,120
this seat and this guy in this fucking
yellow car came up over. He lost it.

601
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:14,180
He got it. Then he just
fucking, it's unreal.

602
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:16,370
If you saw what the car looked
like after this guy's accident,

603
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,900
you would have thought that like a family
of five was dead and he got out his,

604
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:22,700
his ankle was a little tweaked,
you know,

605
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,630
I don't understand why they
can't make our cars like that.

606
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,870
We just put on helmets and just drive
like fucking lunatics that I mentioned.

607
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,860
You guys help bad.
I want to buy a motorcycle again.

608
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,530
I can't fucking do it because everybody
just tells me I'm going to fucking die,

609
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,070
but I really want to buy.

610
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,710
I want to buy a fucking bike so bad.
I miss it man.

611
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,730
I want to get that Ducati,
that Deval one,

612
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,550
that cruiser have it all in black.

613
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:55,370
And then on the side just right
underneath where it says, uh,

614
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:01,130
the name of the bike just had that
little Italian flag sticker on it.

615
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,900
That's all I want to do.
And I wanna get it.

616
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,170
But Saturday and Sunday morning at
like six in the fucking morning,

617
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,900
cause I had jet lag and I was
walking my dog and be like,

618
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,030
this is the time to fucking right.
There's nobody on the road.

619
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:15,080
Slow down at every intersection. Just
look, take it through the gears, you know,

620
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,200
ah fuck everybody.
Last night it was talking to somebody,

621
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:22,840
don't know you can't do it.
I've had fucking three friends of mine,

622
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:25,720
they'd died and I'm like, yeah, but when
they were young driving like maniacs, Nah,

623
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:29,800
they were great writers. Somebody else
hit him and I'm just like, why can't they,

624
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,450
I wish they could come up with like,

625
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,690
like a suit you could wear right
where right as you get hit.

626
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,890
What are those?
What does that thing that's stupid.

627
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,760
Then you put on your desk that people
have where you can totally compress the

628
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:50,690
thing or open, it's like a toy or you
can open it up into this big ball.

629
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,500
Ever seen that toy for kids?
It's a little plastic ball.

630
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:55,550
You can make it as a really small
building. You make a big one.

631
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,230
What if you just had that thing right?
Because it would be heavy as fuck.

632
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,281
I don't know.

633
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:04,220
The solution is that you always just
make carbon fiber always seems to be

634
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,610
solution, which evidently is
flammable. Is that what I'm seeing?

635
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:10,510
I have no fucking idea.
You can't be right. Um,

636
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,360
yeah,

637
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,170
it always does seem a
carbon fiber. Lee. A,

638
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,700
the particles when they go to make it
like the underneath the guy's cars on fire

639
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:21,110
a little bit. Um, anyways, why can't
they just have something like that?

640
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:24,440
So when you get knocked off your bike,
somehow it's senses it.

641
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:29,441
This is in the perfect world and it just
expanse this giant ball around you and,

642
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,960
and the ball takes the hit
right and you're inside of it,

643
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,460
right? Isn't there a fucking
way to do that? I mean,

644
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:42,670
I can Skype with somebody on the other
side of the planet and there's no delay.

645
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:43,570
Is that talking to me?

646
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:47,350
And you can't come up with some sort
of fucking suit that allows a fucking

647
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:51,730
freckled cont like me to ride
down the street. Oh my God. I, uh,

648
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,660
if you go to Europe,

649
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:55,080
there's no way to not get into
motorcycles cause everybody's,

650
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,780
there's so many people
over there riding them. Um,

651
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,090
and uh, I got into it fucking
hardcore again and I'm trying to, uh,

652
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,050
I'm waiting for that thing to
go away and it's not going away.

653
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,800
If I just wrote like twice a fucking
week, six to seven. Yeah. I know.

654
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,660
Everybody has to ruin it.

655
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,620
Okay.

656
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,080
Why does this fucking business
have to be in this city?

657
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,340
Why can't it just be like in Montana?
Just the middle of fucking nowhere,

658
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,180
you know,

659
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,440
just a bunch of self centered concert in
the middle of that giant fucking state.

660
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,110
And then he just fucking,
you could go out and cruise on a bike.

661
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,560
Still don't understand why it has to be
here. All the fucking places to pick.

662
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,980
They had to pick here at the middle
of a Goddamn desert, a desert. Um,

663
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,190
I always say dessert and then desert
because of the Lake Greg, Greg Giraldo,

664
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,040
when you talk about the, the, the troops
right in the home during the civil war.

665
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,230
Okay.

666
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,330
Like how eloquent they are. Writing
was as opposed to like, you know,

667
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,720
during the Gulf War, you
know, age fucking hard.

668
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:04,970
You're not have your ball
sticking against your leg.

669
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,140
Is you sitting out here in the,
in the desert.

670
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,870
A fucking Mr Gun. All right, let's uh,
let's, let's read some questions here.

671
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,470
For some reason, after all the ignorance,
she just heard, believe it or not,

672
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:22,130
people actually write in to me and they
asked for my advice knowing that I have

673
00:39:22,131 --> 00:39:27,020
no background in psychology
whatsoever. All right, so here you go.

674
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:30,950
At your own fucking risk.
Jeroen risk. All right, Kenya,

675
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,500
uh, I built, I'm a
Bostonian. Like yourself. Uh,

676
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:40,310
I'm a suburbian outside of
Boston and I get it right. Okay.

677
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,980
I lived in a cul de sac and played
street hockey. Okay. I wasn't,

678
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:46,340
I wasn't down in southeast steel in
cars. Good at math. Like an apples.

679
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,430
It's a whole different breed of
tough guy. All right. I had legos,

680
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,740
I had Lincoln logs. I had a
tree fort. Okay. All right.

681
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,650
I'm a Bostonian like yourself
that has a question for you.

682
00:39:57,651 --> 00:40:02,651
My wife is Kenyan and we have a place
near a narrow Nairobi national park.

683
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:09,010
The government is ramming a railroad
straight through the middle of the park in

684
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:13,240
clear violation of the environmental
efforts put in place by past generations

685
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:15,970
for the betterment of the Kenyan people.
Uh,

686
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:20,470
this park is considered a world heritage
site and this construction would be

687
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:24,910
devastating. Would you be willing to
champion this cause with your connections?

688
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:26,850
Yeah.

689
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,920
What do,
what connections do I have to stop?

690
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:32,150
A railroad being built in Kenya
may not going to lie to you.

691
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,230
My last couple of specialists,
we're pretty damn good,

692
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,450
but I don't know if I can stop.
He goes,

693
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:40,170
I hope just to bring attention to this
cause as it is being implemented very

694
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,870
rapidly before people
can complain about it.

695
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,980
I can assure you this is a very good
cause and deserves the attention of anyone

696
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,140
who values natures nature.

697
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,710
Now I'm off to fight in the
traffic on the Jamaica way.

698
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,450
Um, all right, wait a
minute. Well you know,

699
00:40:57,451 --> 00:41:02,370
if you send me a fucking link or
something I can definitely retweet it. Um,

700
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,840
but I think the best thing for your cause
would not be me to be a spokesperson

701
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:10,080
as long as I don't have to speak about
it because I'll tell you right now,

702
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:12,030
I'm not going to read,
even if I read up on it,

703
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,610
I'm going to stutter and
it's just going to, you know,

704
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,360
as kind of come a cautious
has a dope. Right. But yeah,

705
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:21,960
just tweet me a link today and I will,
I will retweet it.

706
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,453
And um,

707
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,190
yeah,

708
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,740
I dunno. I mean they're not
listening to their own people.

709
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:31,520
Then we'll still fucking comedian in la.
Don't John Play yourself pill?

710
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34,480
Everything counts. We'll fuck it.
Then I'll positive, okay, I'll,

711
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:35,880
I'll join the God damn.
Cause

712
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,430
I'll say don't build that railroad
through that park. And then they'll say,

713
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,180
well what's your other solution? You got
to, you got an alternative and I'll say,

714
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:48,930
no, I don't. All right. Concert Story.

715
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,650
Hey there, Billy vanilla
tits. That's a good one.

716
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,470
A month ago I took my niece the little way

717
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,250
and a couple of friends to a concert.
They wanted to see,

718
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,000
I get free tickets to lots of
shows, Yada Yada. So I took, uh,

719
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,420
we get there and I'm
immediately and immediately
I'm standing out in an ocean of

720
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:17,460
teens to get into this thing.

721
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,940
Another group of friends show up and they
accompanied by one of the other girl's

722
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:24,930
dad's. So we say hello and
walk into this situation.

723
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,580
It's pretty slow.
At first,

724
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:30,900
the opening band didn't have me in mind
when they made music, but they were okay.

725
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,850
The second band came on and they sounded
real familiar. The Dad says to me,

726
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,520
I heard about these guys from bill burr.
They're amazing. So I'm immediately like,

727
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,830
I'm like, fuck yeah,
this guy knows about bar.

728
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,280
So after they're sent,
we walk outside and decide,

729
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,750
I would guess that was 21 pilots because
I went to go see mute math and they

730
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:52,830
opened,
uh,

731
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,920
for 21 pilots and they had a very young
young crowd screaming like it was the

732
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:01,770
fucking Beatles. Um, so
anyways, so after they're set,

733
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:06,330
we walk outside and decided to have a
couple of beers while the kids enjoy the

734
00:43:06,331 --> 00:43:07,110
main act.

735
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,710
That definitely didn't have us in mind
when they made their music and talked

736
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:15,300
about, uh, Jesus, she talked about me
and laughed our asses off in the lobby.

737
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,830
What a turn. Not only did I get to stay
with my, is this like a fluff piece?

738
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:20,760
Why was this sent to me?

739
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,570
Okay.

740
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:27,550
Not saying that you sent the email, I'm
just saying my fucking podcast guy. Uh,

741
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,950
not that I didn't want to stay with my,
my niece,

742
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,490
but I had an excuse to let it hang with
the friends without me standing there.

743
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,550
And if I didn't have this guy to talk to,
I'd be the lone dude in the lobby,

744
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:40,000
or even worse on the floor watching the
show. But it doesn't end there. All right.

745
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,310
I'm guessing this is one of
the email was sent. Here we go.

746
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,990
While I'm standing out there,

747
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,530
a girl walks through and asked me what
time it is because her phone died.

748
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,930
I answered her in a couple minutes later.

749
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,580
We're talking about everything and
anything. The other dad was a champ.

750
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:59,200
He laughed at my jokes and then pieced
out when he saw things going. Well,

751
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,650
what was going well?
Not like some married dudes.

752
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,740
Uh Oh, what? This chick came. Wait
a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What?

753
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,770
Oh, I answered her in a couple of minutes
late. Oh, we're meaning you and the lady.

754
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,000
We're talking about everything and
everything. The other dad was a champ.

755
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:22,450
He laughed at my joke. Then pieced
out when he saw things going. Well,

756
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,370
I don't know if guys like that, right dad,
he fucking made it look like this guy.

757
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:30,700
He's holding court there.
Has a guy right there that guy get,

758
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,880
he gets in the intersection
when the light turns green.

759
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,790
He makes sure to cars
by and it gets through.

760
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,200
That's what I'm saying about
that guy. He said, yeah,

761
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:39,780
he made sure he peaced out when
he saw things were going well,

762
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,900
not like some married dudes who don't
get out much and feel the need to flirt.

763
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:49,860
So they have, uh, something
to jacket too later. Anyways,

764
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,480
I've gone out with this girl a bunch of
times then and got into a new band that

765
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:55,314
I love,

766
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,060
whose name I won't name because you don't
like to name names all because of all

767
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:04,380
Billy original recipe tits. Uh, thanks
and go fuck yourself. Well that's great.

768
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,420
That's great.
You know what,

769
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:09,480
and that's a nice fucking story
for all the cock blocks out there.

770
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,100
You know what I mean?
Those people who fucking cock block,

771
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:18,830
I've never understood that. It's
such a like a, it's such like a, Ah,

772
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,540
this is bad, so I'm going to trash
women in this and I'm the worst.

773
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,190
I was looking to see that such like
a female thing to do. You know,

774
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:28,800
chicks have that fucking thing
where it's just like, well,

775
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:31,280
if something good's not happening for me,
then I'm in.

776
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,680
Everybody around me has to suffer.
That's like what?

777
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,800
That's like the male version of
that is the cock block. Well,

778
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,850
if I'm not going to get laid,

779
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:41,940
you're not getting like get the fuck
is what the fuck is wrong with you.

780
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,980
You know what I mean?
I said fucking Douche.

781
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,580
Who throws the lady out of the way and
jumps in the fucking lifeboat on the

782
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,230
titanic? That person, right?

783
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:54,303
MMM.

784
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,170
I Dunno.
I had fucked it.

785
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,120
That's like male behavior and I
still ended up trashing women.

786
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:02,750
Like what the fuck is wrong with me?
I mean,

787
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,520
part of it is I have issues
with women obviously,

788
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:07,100
but the other part is it's just
so fucking fun to annoy him.

789
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,010
Maybe that's my fault.
Maybe it's my problem.

790
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,720
Is it wrong that you'd rather
annoy him than fuck him?

791
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,530
Is that weird or is it just sort of a,
as a different approach?

792
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,410
Oh my God. The best people
watching in the fucking world.

793
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,300
Reno International Airport, that fucking
burning man thing was coming in and I,

794
00:46:28,301 --> 00:46:31,510
I was going on, you know, a couple of
everybody kept asking me hilarious.

795
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:34,600
They're going, are you going
to hang around and go to
burning man? First of all,

796
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:37,900
it's like two, three hours away from Reno,
I guess. And secondly, it's like, dude,

797
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,350
look at me.
I was joking about that on stage.

798
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,260
I'm a 48 year old fucking bald white dude.

799
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:47,890
I'm not going to show up there and freak
everybody out. I looked like a cop.

800
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,950
Everybody's gonna be in the middle of
the taken acid or whatever they're doing,

801
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,540
and then I fucking show up looking
like I have a walkie talkie on my,

802
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,770
on my waist. I don't want to do that.
That's, that's some young kid shit.

803
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,990
I hate when fucking people my age right
before the day, just totally just dead.

804
00:47:04,991 --> 00:47:07,120
Just too fucking old.
Even hide it anymore.

805
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,550
I hate when they still try
to go to young people's Shit.

806
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,020
It's over.
It's not your time.

807
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:18,400
You don't remember when you were back
in the day when I'd be in the clubs,

808
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:21,980
you know, way back in the day, old Billy
red face in the clubs won't bump it,

809
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,230
don't,
right.

810
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,830
They'd always be that fucking old
creeping. Then you just bleed.

811
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:32,740
Looking at him like I remember just
looking at somebody who was like 35

812
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,320
even like 27 started to seem old. Like
what the fuck are they still doing their,

813
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,930
we'd like 2021 fake ids getting this
plane. There'd be somebody 27 in there.

814
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:47,650
Like what? That dude, you should be like
married with kids by now. That's what,

815
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:51,920
27 now here I am 48.
I don't,

816
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,590
you know what we were fucking
mind to tell you what to do.

817
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:57,040
It's just my own personal choice. I
don't, I like going to adult shit.

818
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,180
I want to be with the adults.
I don't want to be um,

819
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:01,670
yeah.

820
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,580
You know what I mean? I don't want to
be around that shit. Oh, by the way,

821
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:05,630
and speaking to young shit,

822
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:10,660
I have to give a shout out to a DJ named
Afrojack who I'm not going to lie to

823
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,080
you.
I never heard of the guy.

824
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:16,160
I'm not in that fucking
world and everybody's sending
me this stag where he took

825
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:20,300
a clip of some shit. I guess I talked
about Djs like a couple of years ago.

826
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,040
That's how it works on my podcast.

827
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:26,300
I'll say something and it takes like two
years before anybody really hears it.

828
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,470
Like that car Dashi and thing or
the Yoko Ono thing. Like I said,

829
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:33,230
those like they did the podcast.

830
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:34,810
Yeah.

831
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:39,520
And it goes like two years goes by. And
then somebody who actually has a, uh,

832
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:43,870
a podcast with influence, like Joe Rogan,
Joe Rogan blew up the Yoko ono thing.

833
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,380
Um,
so anyways,

834
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:51,560
people would send me this shit
and he did like a, I don't know,

835
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,320
do you call it a song? Is it a
track? Is, is it as something else?

836
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,190
I don't know what the fuck is.
I don't know what it's called.

837
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,140
I don't know what the fuck it is.
But he somehow aligned the shit up and uh,

838
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,930
he put me in a song and um,

839
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,800
as much as I still don't get
what the fuck is going on,

840
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,570
I want to thank the guy because there's
a bunch of young people in the crowd and

841
00:49:12,571 --> 00:49:15,750
uh, you know, performers, you need that.

842
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:18,660
You've got to keep getting the next wave
of young people is your fans start to

843
00:49:18,661 --> 00:49:21,330
get older. They have kids and they can't
even go out if they want to go out.

844
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,940
You know what I mean?
Like he just,

845
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:26,400
he probably just stopped me
from going on cruise ships.

846
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:29,520
He delayed that for another like
six years. So thank you very much.

847
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,390
Afrojack I don't know if
your name is Afro Jack,

848
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,470
like that's your first name or it's if it,

849
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,940
your name's Jack and your nicknames
Afrojack like you know, Billy red tits.

850
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,950
I Dunno. I Dunno what it is, but I
appreciate it. Thank you for, you know,

851
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,380
whatever the fuck you know, what,
how, how have you seen however,

852
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,000
however you could say that
shit. Um, you know, it's funny,

853
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,980
I actually watched this thing
one time with Nia recently,

854
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:57,630
this documentary on Dj a m can I just
say that again and you guys so I can make

855
00:49:57,631 --> 00:50:01,860
you cringe again. The fact that I as
old as I am just said that name, um,

856
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,810
on Dj a m and I watched it and uh, I
actually started to understand like, oh,

857
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:09,390
what I to see the,
I know there's an art to everything,

858
00:50:09,391 --> 00:50:12,330
but I actually was really starting to
understand it and Neil was talking about

859
00:50:12,331 --> 00:50:16,860
how one time she and a friend of hers
were in New York and went to some fucking

860
00:50:16,861 --> 00:50:20,820
club and that guy was DJ in there and
she said it was like the sickest night

861
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:24,930
ever have music and uh, you know,
within 10 minutes of being in the club,

862
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:26,460
everybody's like,
who the fuck is a DJ?

863
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:29,600
And then they figured out it's that
guy and I don't know what it is.

864
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,490
I guess it's like what song leads
into the next song? And you're,

865
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:38,030
you're changing the energy of the crowd,
which I'm relating to stand up, right.

866
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:39,500
You don't open with the closing bit,

867
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,530
but you got to open strong and then
you've got to take him on a ride.

868
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,320
You bring them up and then they go,
they're going to give you burned out.

869
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,240
You got 40 more minutes,
what do you do?

870
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:50,570
You take it down a little bit and he
started building it back up Dan a little

871
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:53,060
bit and then you're throwing them. Fuck
yeah. You know, it's like wrestling.

872
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,690
It's like what I did while I was stone
cold fucking a podcast and he talked

873
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:02,050
about how you can bring them up down,
up, down, up, down, a little more higher,

874
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,110
a little bit lower,
a little higher.

875
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:06,750
And then you get a right that last fucking
moment and then they fucking explode

876
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:10,460
and go nuts. So I dunno,
I haven't said that well.

877
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:14,240
Like I just fucking,
I like seeing live drummers.

878
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:15,680
Yeah,

879
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,620
that was a problem my hand when I went
to go see fucking lady Gaga, like I can,

880
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:22,460
I can go see anybody. If I can see the
band. She had a band and a fucking house.

881
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,440
They're like,
I was in this fucking cast on,

882
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,210
she's riding around on a God damn horse.

883
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,660
Okay.

884
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,650
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking
Christ they believe was my quote. Um,

885
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,020
okay.

886
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,110
By the way, what, what the
fuck's Tony Romo right now? Okay.

887
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:38,923
If,

888
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:43,090
if he was, it's hard
to say this, you know,

889
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:45,060
cause I could never retire
from fucking standup.

890
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,790
I don't feel I could and obviously he
loves football. The way I love standup up,

891
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:52,900
I would think, but like this is the time
to retire. This is the time to just say,

892
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,410
you know what? Fuck this. You know,

893
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,160
it's like Ali, those last few
fights, if he didn't have those,

894
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,990
maybe it would have been a
little bit different. I know.

895
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:05,570
What the fuck am I to say that shit.
I Dunno man.

896
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,590
You fucking break a bone in your back for
the second fucking time. Jesus Christ.

897
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:13,790
How fucking tough is that guy by the way?
Everybody always breaking his boss.

898
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,293
Um,

899
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:16,620
okay.

900
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,480
And I probably shouldn't have
said that shit. You know,

901
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,840
I don't know if he's married and he's
got a woman in his life because what if I

902
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:26,070
just gave her ammo and then I
just ruined his breakfast. Tony,

903
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,440
do you hear this?
You hear this podcast?

904
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,550
You hear what this person who never
played organized football paths,

905
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:37,220
the fourth grade said,
sorry, look at that.

906
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,530
I'm sitting there fucking
shitting on cop block.

907
00:52:40,531 --> 00:52:43,960
So then I turned around and I make a
move like that. What a fucking asshole.

908
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,070
That's, you know what bill, that's
just typical you. Um, all right, let's,

954
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,850
I'm a little out of sorts here.

955
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,450
Uh,

956
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,540
okay. All this'll be a good one.
Stand up at high school reunion.

957
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,550
Oh No.

958
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,950
Oh, this just has fucking
train wreck written. I'll, uh,

959
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,460
if this is a comedian and they're going
to do stand up at their high school

960
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:50,950
reunion, uh, it takes
balls, man. All right,

961
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:54,480
Bill. Fuck you. Sunscreen burr. Uh,

962
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,350
we've missed a couple of reunions now
all my classmates are married with kids,

963
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,110
so we,
I'm guessing your significant other.

964
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,840
I've been doing local
standup for a while now,

965
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,920
but that's been two hours away from
where I grew up and none of my classmates

966
00:56:08,921 --> 00:56:13,210
have seen it. S. C. E. N.
E. They haven't seen it.

967
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,100
Uh, this is why it's great
to get into show business.

968
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,760
You can be as dumb as me and
you can still be successful. Um,

969
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,960
now they've asked me to
do a set for the reunion.

970
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,860
I'll admit it's different for people,
you know.

971
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:32,070
So your advice on going after the home
crowd that knows you keep it clean,

972
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:37,270
offensive, use your best shit regardless.
What are your sunburned thoughts?

973
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,390
My sunburned thoughts is you're
out of your fucking mind.

974
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,060
There is no fucking way.

975
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,520
There is no fucking way
I would do that Gig.

976
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,020
I'm going to stand up there in front of
these fucking people that I knew for 15

977
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:59,080
years of my fucking life and
having seen for 20 years,

978
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,200
and I'm going to be as I'm looking at
them trying to de age their faces and

979
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,930
figure out who the fuck is who?
Oh my God.

980
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,200
And go right back to being like the,
the pecking order.

981
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,060
I'll tell you right now,
you've got balls like right now,

982
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,560
the fact that you just said that,

983
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:22,750
you know I'm going to do standup at my
high school union is the spider moment in

984
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:26,170
Goodfellas where he goes, why
don't you go fuck yourself, Tom?

985
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,910
And then Dinair or goes,
oh,

986
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,080
tests like dead pause

987
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,600
shows them in the 40 tell him to go fuck
himself. You know, I, it's kind of like,

988
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,120
don't take no shit off. Nobody. Right?
Yeah. Go ahead and do you know what dude?

989
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:45,070
I say you fucking do it. And this is
the thing, dude. I would, I would fuck,

990
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:49,030
I would not hold back.
I would give them both fucking barrels.

991
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:54,580
The only thing you have to lose is,
is if it goes bad,

992
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:58,030
you're going to have a great panel story
about bombing in front of people you

993
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:03,010
haven't seen in 20 fucking
years. Um, my advice would be,

994
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:06,070
I would definitely,
I would see the humor in the situation.

995
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:08,970
How fucking ridiculous it is.
Um,

996
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,570
that's what I would do. You know, I don't
have to make some sort of joke that,

997
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:17,290
you know, after me, you know, fucking
Joe Blow over here was a biologist.

998
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:19,750
He's gonna come up here for 10 minutes
and look through a fucking microscope or

999
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:23,170
some shit. I don't know why, but I
have no idea what I would do. Um,

1000
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:28,380
but I've actually, I ain't, you know what,
I've done something like that. I'm like,

1001
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:31,910
I'm not gonna lie to you. I've
done something like that. I, um,

1002
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,290
I,

1003
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:40,290
I did stand up in a bar in
my hometown and there was,

1004
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:44,920
it just so happened there was,
there was like, I don't know,

1005
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,480
there's like a table of people I went to
high school with and I'll never forget

1006
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:48,141
looking at them.

1007
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:52,720
The look on their face was holy
shit that said fucking guy,

1008
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:55,010
he used to have snowball fights with like,
they're not even listening to that.

1009
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:58,520
Just what they, this is the thing that
they've there, this site, you're doing it.

1010
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,670
It's all between. It's all about keeping
your own fucking head together. And uh,

1011
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,640
I'm not necessarily good about doing that.

1012
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:07,970
Like I don't even like seeing
the crowd before the show.

1013
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:13,400
I hate that. I hate when before I go
into something, somebody goes, hey bill,

1014
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:16,400
looking forward to the show or
like gay really like your stuff.

1015
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:19,700
I hate that because I feel like

1016
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,121
I always feel like,

1017
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:25,960
well now what if I go in there and I
bomb or what if you don't like my shit?

1018
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:29,680
And then you already said that you liked
me and then you're gonna feel bad that

1019
00:59:29,681 --> 00:59:34,410
you said that because I stunk.
Like after the show,

1020
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:38,490
I'll talk to people after it went well
and I felt like I gave you your money's

1021
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:43,360
worth. Then denim fine. But I feel like
if I get compliments on the way in, um,

1022
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,810
I'm like a, I'm like taking out a loan.
Does that make any sense? I don't know.

1023
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:50,440
Okay.

1024
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,320
So anyways, I, I gotta say
as you, you, you got more,
you got more balls than I do.

1025
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,930
And if that sounds weird and disjointed,
like from that,

1026
00:59:55,931 --> 01:00:00,310
my last thought is because I had to pit
pause and go fucking shut off the air

1027
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:03,760
conditioner. Oh, it's going
to be a fucking hot one
today, you know? All right.

1028
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,880
I think this is the last one here.
The last question. All right,

1029
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:09,550
last question here. Uh,
ex girlfriend's sister.

1030
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:15,030
I hate Billy Birkenstocks. Uh, I'm 26. Um,

1031
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,590
and still in love with my
high school sweetheart.

1032
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:22,210
We've been on and off again for 10 years
and I've gone through a lot to say the

1033
01:00:22,211 --> 01:00:23,680
least. Jesus Christ. Yes.

1034
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:29,110
I just got back from a two week vacation
with her where everything was perfect

1035
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:30,790
and we had the time of our lives.

1036
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:34,330
This is the woman I want to start a
family with and it became more and more

1037
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:37,900
apparent on this trip.
Congratulations. What could go wrong?

1038
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,530
Um,
here's the thing.

1039
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:48,290
I slept with her sister on a drunken
blacked out night three years ago while me

1040
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:52,320
and her,
we're not together and we're on bad terms.

1041
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,580
Oh boy.

1042
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:00,810
My heart was broken and I had a lot
of resentment. I was 23 drunk week.

1043
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,180
Shut the fuck up dude.
You had a dick.

1044
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:08,400
You fucking jerked off to where while
you were dating her other sit, stick.

1045
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:12,540
Get the fuck Outta here. Don't fucking
come at me. I got a dick too. All right.

1046
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:17,100
Don't fuck. And our younger
sister came on to me. Oh my God,

1047
01:01:17,101 --> 01:01:21,450
you victim. Things were different
then and I was a mess. Listen,

1048
01:01:21,451 --> 01:01:23,930
I'm not saying you weren't
fucking heartbroken. You A, yeah,

1049
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,330
you were fucking psych the next
day. There you go. You know what?

1050
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,550
You just got to check off a whole family.

1051
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,600
Well you got left to do
is bang them mother. Um,

1052
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,230
okay.

1053
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,600
That's got to be called
something like the Grand Slam.

1054
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:44,560
You don't like when tiger woods won four
in a row and they was saying he won the

1055
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:49,000
Grand Sake, you won, you won. All four
majors would be if you bang the mother.

1056
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:53,590
And all the daughters. That would be
the Grand Slam. Uh, the amount of guys.

1057
01:01:53,591 --> 01:01:57,730
Laughter right now. Why the women are
pissed. Uh, well a year or so later,

1058
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,880
me and my high school sweet,
he started talking again.

1059
01:02:00,881 --> 01:02:03,760
It started to become close
leading up to where it is now.

1060
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:06,940
I had an unbelievable guilt for
what I did with their sister. The,

1061
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,610
the closer me and this
girl got years later.

1062
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:13,450
It is the only thing that I haven't been
honest with her about and I had to tell

1063
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:15,160
her, you fucking idiot. No you didn't.

1064
01:02:15,161 --> 01:02:17,250
You should have talked to his
sister and just been like, look,

1065
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:21,780
what are we going to do
here? You know, easy. Is it,

1066
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,790
how does it make things
better that you told her

1067
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,350
that's such as and I, and then like
for the rest of their fucking lives,

1068
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:35,220
that's going to be a problem
between the two of them. Ah, Jesus,

1069
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:40,890
you shouldn't have said
Shit and just waited till 20
years later when the sister,

1070
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:43,740
you know, who never got married gets
fucking hammered and the guy, yeah,

1071
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:47,460
well I fuck Jasmin 25 years ago.
And at that point, you know,

1072
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:48,810
what are you going to do? He'd
be like, yeah, it was, dude,

1073
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:53,430
I was in the fucking two thousands.
What do you want from me? Um,

1074
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,473
anyways,

1075
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:55,650
okay.

1076
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,850
He goes, well, a year or so
later mean in the high school,

1077
01:02:58,851 --> 01:03:01,670
sweet started talking again, blah, blah,
blah, blah. I had an unbelievable guilt.

1078
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,330
MMM.

1079
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,580
So I had a test sold the last
night of our vacation. Oh my God.

1080
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:12,160
We were laying in bed and
I told her everything.

1081
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,410
I took a slap.

1082
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:20,480
She was crying for hours and it was
as ugly as you can imagine. Well,

1083
01:03:20,481 --> 01:03:24,920
you know what, Dude, I commend you. You
got it off your fucking chest. He goes,

1084
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:29,000
I feel terrible. And I'm torn on if
it was the right decision to tell her,

1085
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,710
my friends are giving me mixed answers
and I would like an outside perspective

1086
01:03:33,711 --> 01:03:38,020
from someone who I respect greatly.
Uh,

1087
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:41,750
Jesus Christ. I appreciate the
respect me. Um, I don't know.

1088
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,270
Do you know if it was really bugging
you and you felt like you had to tell a

1089
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:45,350
good good,
you told her,

1090
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:47,103
you know

1091
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,090
now you don't have to worry about that
fucking thing coming out of nowhere.

1092
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:54,170
He goes, it is still fresh and
everything is confusing on what is next.

1093
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,740
We love each other very much,
but obviously I fucked up big time.

1094
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:01,430
Do you think this relationship stands
a chance? I really hope it does,

1095
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:02,660
but I'm worried I ruined it.

1096
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,950
She seems to be getting through it
better than I thought after her first

1097
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:10,110
reaction,
she told me she loves me,

1098
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:12,770
but I really hurt her and she
needs some space because when I'm,

1099
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,900
oh well she needs some space.
I hope you don't have a brother

1100
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,600
because when I'm with her,

1101
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:23,570
okay,

1102
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:24,740
okay.
She told me she loves me,

1103
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:27,800
but I really hurt her and she needs
some space because when I'm with her she

1104
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:28,700
can't be mad at me.

1105
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,670
I'm not a scumbag and this is completely
out of character for me to do.

1106
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,280
I just made a terrible mistake.
Thanks to go fuck yourself.

1107
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:38,720
I will say the fact that you actually
feel this level of guilt, um,

1108
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,560
uh, you're a better man than me
cause I wouldn't have said Shit.

1109
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:43,700
I just would've just been like,

1110
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:45,880
well I hope this doesn't
fucking come out someday.

1111
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,650
Well we're having a pumpkin
pie over thanksgiving. Uh,

1112
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,400
and I bet there's a lot of people
out there that live with that secret.

1113
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:57,080
My thing is not only the cowardly self
preservation that I would try to have,

1114
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:01,740
I would also,
I'm also thinking like

1115
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,490
this is, I, I would have
handled that situation.

1116
01:05:06,491 --> 01:05:11,491
I either wouldn't have said shit or I
would just break up with her and just walk

1117
01:05:11,651 --> 01:05:14,550
away from it because

1118
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,010
I wouldn't say, Hey, by the

1119
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,221
way,

1120
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:21,940
I banged your sister and then for the
rest of their life they have to fucking

1121
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:24,310
deal with that.
MMM.

1122
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:27,200
When I'm the piece of shit that did it.

1123
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:32,230
But I have to commend you that you
actually felt that level of guilt and said

1124
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:33,830
something. Ah, cause I don't know.

1125
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,080
So it sounds to me that
you're going to get past it.

1126
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:43,770
So the good thing is that now you don't
have to worry about that fucking grand

1127
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:48,790
piano fuck crashing down on
your fucking life someday.

1128
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,590
So that's the upside.

1129
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,470
MMM.

1130
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:59,610
Maybe there's an upside that you told
her where she'll have faith in you that

1131
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:05,080
like, wow, this guy actually
feels guilt about stuff like that.

1132
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:08,050
So I can't trust them.
We were broken up while it happened.

1133
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,043
MMM.

1134
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,270
Let me see if I can get Nia in here
for this one. Hang on a second.

1135
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,290
All right. The magic of the pause button
again. The lovely Nia is here. Hi. Hey,

1136
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:24,291
I you doing watching the Vma is because
you refused last night and we were

1137
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:29,600
walking cause I was watching the car race.
Is that Formula One formula one was,

1138
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:34,510
is it called? Yeah, I said it
sounded like a swarm of killer bees.

1139
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:42,500
It's a lot longer than I thought it
was going to the corners. Yeah, I know.

1140
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,533
Yeah.

1141
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,390
Little playstation fucking game boy
they have or a steering wheel now.

1142
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:53,980
I didn't know they had to go around
44 times. That's a lot of times.

1143
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,420
Um, well it's a long track. It's
like a four and a quarter mile track.

1144
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:01,630
What's the going like 200 miles an hour.

1145
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,500
You can't fucking him driver on a
parking lot. God I know. But yeah,

1146
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,030
it was just a lot longer than I thought.

1147
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:09,990
And I know the first time you go to a race
track you don't, you never, you can't,

1148
01:07:09,991 --> 01:07:13,310
you can't believe how fucking big it is.
Like I've,

1149
01:07:13,311 --> 01:07:17,710
I've gone Bob Talladega and it just,
it just keeps going. And you're like,

1150
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,790
oh yeah, they're driving like
a 180 miles an hour. Yeah.

1151
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:25,510
So it's gotta be long. Okay,
that makes sense. Yeah.

1152
01:07:25,511 --> 01:07:30,070
And then I fell asleep so I wasn't
able to catch up on all the moments

1153
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:34,130
everyone's talking about. I don't know
what anyone's talking about, but the Vms,

1154
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:38,150
I have to go and watch, obviously
the, not on MTV, but they're all,

1155
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:42,130
they're all online. Yes. Videos
are still produced and made,

1156
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:44,230
cause you're always like,
they don't even make videos anymore.

1157
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:47,050
They do make music videos, but
there will have it, how do I say it?

1158
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:51,880
They don't even make music videos anymore,
but they're all online.

1159
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:54,430
But they do make them and they
still have big budgets to,

1160
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:58,840
so that was gonna be my next question.
All right. Ex girlfriend's sister.

1161
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:02,800
Oh, Geez. All right. Really
quickly, this guy. All right.

1162
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:06,220
I'll give the abridged version A.
I've been on and off again for 10 years.

1163
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:09,130
Just got back from a two week vacation
with her. Everything was perfect.

1164
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:13,570
We had the time of our lives. This is the
woman I want to start a family with a,

1165
01:08:13,571 --> 01:08:14,320
here's the thing.

1166
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,870
I slept with a and a drunk and blacked
out night three years ago while we met

1167
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:22,730
while we, me and her were not
together and we're on bad turns.

1168
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,440
My heart was broken.
I had a lot of resentment.

1169
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:27,950
I was 23 drunk week and her
youngest sister came on to me.

1170
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:33,170
Uh, no. I'll tell you, that's a
rough one there. A real rough. Then

1171
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:40,160
you're like, oh, he makes himself the
victim. She came onto me. I said, really?

1172
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:44,840
I said, dude, I have a dick too though,
fucking light. And I stopped that. I said,

1173
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:47,430
you rubbed one out to her
before you fucking eat.

1174
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,780
The seeds have been planted for a while
that you've been wanting to fuck the

1175
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:55,140
sister. Don't try to act like, oh, I was
so heartbroken. You and the sister or both

1176
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:58,480
dirty. Okay, so here's the deal. He goes,

1177
01:08:58,481 --> 01:09:01,510
he felt toward terrible the
last night of the vacation,

1178
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,480
he couldn't deal with the guilt.
So he told her,

1179
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,580
he goes, I tell him,
he goes, I took a slap.

1180
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:12,910
She was crying for hours and it
was ugly, as you can imagine. Yeah,

1181
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,970
I'm all right.
She told me she loves me,

1182
01:09:15,971 --> 01:09:19,570
but I really hurt her and she needs some
space because when I'm with with her,

1183
01:09:19,571 --> 01:09:20,950
she can't be mad at me.

1184
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:24,370
I'm not a scumbag and this is completely
out of character for me to do.

1185
01:09:24,371 --> 01:09:27,520
I just made a terrible mistake.
So he's basically saying,

1186
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,420
do you think the relationship stands
a chance? I really hope it does,

1187
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,680
but I'm worried I ruined it.

1188
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:36,190
She seems to be getting through it
better than I thought after our first

1189
01:09:36,191 --> 01:09:37,030
reaction.
What do you think?

1190
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:41,780
Yeah. No, it's, it's not
going to happen. He fucked her
sister. It's over. That's it.

1191
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:45,260
I think so. Yeah. Because I mean maybe,

1192
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:49,580
maybe there are some people who are
more emotionally evolved than I am,

1193
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,890
but I couldn't get,
but like that's her sister.

1194
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:55,580
Like her sister's not going anywhere
and like how's it going to be at like

1195
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:58,820
Thanksgiving and Christmas and
like all that kind of stuff.

1196
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:02,270
Like you're just going to avoid each
other or just kind of like, it's weird.

1197
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:07,010
I mean maybe the three of them
can have a threesome. That's

1198
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:13,280
what I was thinking. You can't, you
can't have a threesome with your sister.

1199
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:17,030
That's disgusting. That's
gross. I would never want to see

1200
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,760
each other on these bonds. Yeah.
Talking to each other. Hey,

1201
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:27,130
I know we went to a, the
waterpark. Oh No, stop.

1202
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:32,810
Unless the three of them sit down and
both the guy and the sister are so

1203
01:10:33,171 --> 01:10:36,320
repentant and so whatever.
But like you,

1204
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:40,430
you'd never be able to trust them.
You'd never be like, Oh yeah,

1205
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:44,600
can you guys run out and like, you know,
get some extra sugar and more groceries.

1206
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,360
Exactly. So, and that's the thing.
She might be okay with him now,

1207
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,540
but in the end she's going to choose
her sister like that no matter how her

1208
01:10:56,541 --> 01:11:01,040
sister betrayed her. That's the
sister. So you are disposable.

1209
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,800
You're just like the
dude that's her family.

1210
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,960
So if you think that you really like
hands on to her and the sister and the

1211
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:13,070
sister will probably get past it long,
a long,

1212
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,960
long ways from now and it'll
probably always still be there.

1213
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,800
But because their family family
betrays each other all the time,

1214
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:24,510
you know it's a thing. I think what
she did was worse than what he did.

1215
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:28,680
The sister? Yeah. Oh definitely.
If we're going to like put them on,

1216
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:31,560
who was the worst person?
That situation?

1217
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:33,990
The sister 100% here's what I learned.

1218
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:38,370
You never do that if you're
with a woman. Okay, okay.

1219
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,230
And you guys break up and blah blah blah.

1220
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:45,530
If her sister comes onto you like you
are effectively ending that relationship

1221
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:50,730
forever and only they told
her her and the relationship,

1222
01:11:50,731 --> 01:11:51,750
you think he should have told her.

1223
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:55,770
The thing about it is,

1224
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,720
is that he told her
because he felt guilty.

1225
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,900
So it was to unburden his own conscious
because it wasn't real because there's

1226
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:09,480
nothing in telling her that would
make her feel better and oh my God,

1227
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:12,330
thank you so much for being
honest with me. That's the sister.

1228
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,870
So I don't know.
I don't really know nothing.

1229
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:21,180
Nothing compatible that he had such guilt
that he had to tell her. Not really,

1230
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:25,020
because people are paired with shielding
all the time and they like, oh,

1231
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:28,860
I had just had to get it off my chest
and it's like, great, congratulations.

1232
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:30,810
It's off your chest and now I feel shitty.

1233
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,690
So was that really for
me or was that for you

1234
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:38,250
need Renee hill coming
in and bringing the love?

1235
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,830
Yeah, I, I don't, I don't,
I'm not with that whole like,

1236
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:47,160
well at least he was honest
with you. It's like, for what?

1237
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:51,930
For me now that was all for him to,
I never looked at it that way.

1238
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:56,910
Wow. Yeah. Not that I don't think
apologies are worthwhile or I don't,

1239
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:57,781
I,
it's not like,

1240
01:12:57,781 --> 01:13:00,600
I don't think that you should
apologize for something you did wrong,

1241
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:03,540
but I just feel like you really need to
question. That's what you were saying.

1242
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,730
Yeah.
You really need to take that question.

1243
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:10,530
Your motivations for confessing something
of this level. You know what I mean?

1244
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:12,540
It's like what are you
really trying to do?

1245
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:15,390
A lot of times people are just
trying to unburden themselves.

1246
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,041
Well that's what I was saying,

1247
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:20,520
that the best thing now is he got it out
there so he doesn't have to worry about

1248
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,870
that grand piano coming crashing down
into his life someday. Like I'm saying,

1249
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:25,890
well they haven't like
fucking Thanksgiving dinner.

1250
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:31,140
What I want to know is what is going
on between the girl and the sister?

1251
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:36,300
Cause obviously that's no sister.
That's no real. I don't know.

1252
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,890
That's what I'm wanting.
Something else.

1253
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:42,891
Why that's fucked up is because
now you know that the parents know.

1254
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,570
You know, you think she would have
told the parents like, but if they know

1255
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:53,490
yeah. And then they gotta be
like, Oh my God, we raised a whore

1256
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,950
and I don't think that she's a whore.
She's on a horse. People make mistakes,

1257
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:02,400
but it's got some really, yeah,
no, no, that's, that's beyond,

1258
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:05,970
that's a power thing yet
it is total power. It is.

1259
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:10,290
I wonder if this was a younger
sister and I wonder like, who knows?

1260
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,310
But that's what I'm more
intrigued about now.

1261
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:17,230
It's like what's going to happen with
these sisters? You know, that's like,

1262
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,730
that's some deep shit right there.
So I don't know.

1263
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,430
That's like a power thing on
her thing saying like, you know,

1264
01:14:22,431 --> 01:14:26,380
it was much as you're into her, you still
can't fucking resist me. What is it?

1265
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,800
Yeah,
maybe so because who does that?

1266
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:33,610
Who goes after the medicine
to the female mind? I,

1267
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,580
I can't let you win on that.
That's not a female thing.

1268
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:40,630
That's like a dirty ass ho bitch,
nasty person.

1269
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:44,860
I don't know what that's like.
I would never go after, uh,

1270
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:48,940
relatives like significant other.
So where do you draw the line?

1271
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:51,820
What do you mean coworker?
So you're not

1272
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,250
just so that people know because you
really have strong opinions on this.

1273
01:14:57,251 --> 01:15:01,330
So I want to know too. So family
obviously. Yeah, no you don't do that.

1274
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:02,540
Yeah.

1275
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:07,540
If the person that is clearly
in a relationship with
somebody else and you know

1276
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:11,910
that all of that together,
I want to know that.

1277
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,810
I want to know where you draw
the line. Coworker. You've okay.

1278
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,710
You guys occasionally up lunch together
with the sisters. Coworker. Yeah.

1279
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:24,100
And there's something the guy's got like
he does like the Paisley tie with the

1280
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:24,934
suspenders.

1281
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:29,030
Camera's that something that you guys
always go nuts about that no belt.

1282
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,150
Yeah. Well if you have suspenders, you
don't need a belt. So, but anyway, um,

1283
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,130
what if he has both suspenders and a
belt and then you're thinking like,

1284
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,540
I don't know what it is
that you're trying to do.

1285
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:45,190
Well maybe how would you have both when
that, when that like get that thing,

1286
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:47,050
that female thing with
like you'd feel safe.

1287
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:50,800
Like this guy's really going to have like
he's going to have an alarm system and

1288
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:55,500
a gun. Yeah, and a sword and
where to condoms. Yeah. No,

1289
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:59,950
I don't know about that. Yeah. No,
I mean if they're not involved,

1290
01:15:59,951 --> 01:16:02,880
if they're not like in a
real relationship, neighbors,

1291
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:08,600
would you bang a neighbor when I
Bang like my sister's neighbor? No,

1292
01:16:08,601 --> 01:16:11,860
not your sisters. Now we're taking
family out of it. I'm saying where?

1293
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,750
Where is the line where it's just
like, well whatever bitch, you know

1294
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,770
isn't that you guys say you put
the hand up, whatever bitch,

1295
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:24,100
what are you talking about? I'm saying,
cause you're saying like that's family.

1296
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:27,310
You can't fucking do that. I was just
trying to find a comedic angle here.

1297
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:32,230
Oh I see what you mean.
I mean neighbor two streets over.

1298
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,790
Your neighbor knew them, invited you over
and you went over there. You know what?

1299
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:41,170
I have a real life example of the guy.
The guy was an architect. Okay. All right,

1300
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,063
I got it.

1301
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,380
I have a real life example of this during,

1302
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:51,490
during my prom I went my senior prom.
I love somebody else already.

1303
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,150
Wait a minute. I went with somebody
who was just a friend. Okay.

1304
01:16:55,810 --> 01:17:00,450
But my friend has Biz Markie,
he was just depressed.

1305
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:01,743
Um,

1306
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:07,200
but my friend went to the prom with this
guy that she had just met and they were

1307
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:11,180
set up by another friend.
He went to a different school.

1308
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,360
So they didn't really like know each
other. That was the day of justification.

1309
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,360
They was set up by friends.
So I'm totally innocent.

1310
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:25,390
So really we really connected
during prom and like,

1311
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:29,900
as you know, that was not
what happened. As you know,

1312
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:31,550
my prom did not end that great.

1313
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:34,710
My parents like came and like took
me from this house and I was in,

1314
01:17:34,711 --> 01:17:37,670
because I was dumbing up,
wait to tell them the truth.

1315
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:41,240
I called my parents because I was supposed
to spend the night at a girlfriend's

1316
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:45,440
house, but instead we're going to
be hanging out at this boy's house.

1317
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:48,620
His older sister was there. There's
a whole bunch of us were hanging out.

1318
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:51,890
I was having such a great time that
I call my parents and I said, hey,

1319
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:54,140
just so you know,
I'm staying here.

1320
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:59,300
My mom completely flipped out and she and
my step father came and like extracted

1321
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:03,470
me from the home. So that's how my prom
ended. Exactly. So it didn't end on any,

1322
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:08,120
it was a very traumatic, but ultimately
they did the right thing. Um,

1323
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,560
but anyway,
he,

1324
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:14,561
me and this guy ended up connecting
and we ended up like dating afterwards,

1325
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:19,010
so you know, um, oh that's different. I
thought you were saying that, you know,

1326
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:20,271
like I,

1327
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:23,660
we went in the bathroom like to the front
part of the Limo and put the window up.

1328
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:29,090
No, no, no, no. But it wasn't
her boyfriend. They had just met.

1329
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,540
I think she definitely felt some
type of way about it, you know,

1330
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:36,110
only because he chose you over her.
Exactly.

1331
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:39,110
You guys didn't have any sort of
like friendship, friendship? No.

1332
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:43,550
She and I were really good
friends. Yeah. That yet. No, no,

1333
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:47,860
that's not good. Oh, that's a
rough one. But it wasn't, Oh Fred,

1334
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:51,740
a lot of rough ones and
we dated for a while.

1335
01:18:51,741 --> 01:18:55,280
We dated up until, you know, like I
went to college basically. And that was,

1336
01:18:55,281 --> 01:18:58,670
that was the end of that. So it wasn't
like this law of the term, you know,

1337
01:18:58,671 --> 01:19:02,570
toward affair. It wasn't like he
was my first love or anything.

1338
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:07,550
He was just really cute and a football
player and Nice Bob Marley, you know. Hey,

1339
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:08,923
what can I say?

1340
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:13,270
Sorted, sorted, sorted
details here. All right,

1341
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:17,320
well that's the podcast for this week.
Um, Jeez. And he came hard this week.

1342
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,720
You came hard. You're really fucking
just put that guy you just said.

1343
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,820
You know what? And that's it. It's
a fucking rap. And you know what?

1344
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:26,440
I think you're right. I think you're
right. I could say that. Yeah.

1345
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:30,240
Cause I sit here and my yes. Yeah. How
long have you had these fucking buddy?

1346
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,830
I've had these, as long as I've known
you, he's fucking Pajama bottoms.

1347
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,100
There's two things that I'll never die.
Pajamas, we'll never get holes in them.

1348
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:40,030
Right. And sweatpants. You
cannot kill sweatpants it
and made out of that fucking,

1349
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:42,340
um,
I think we'll go do some break dance.

1350
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:46,570
Was it boogaloo something rather than
one of the fucking movie is, yeah. Yeah.

1351
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,320
Whatever that fucking movie. Electric
overload break electric boogaloo right,

1352
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,500
right. Those are is that breaks
the breakin two electric boogaloo.

1353
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,530
There was such a weird period where
all those dance movies are coming out.

1354
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:03,830
You know one of the worst dance
movies of all time is footloose.

1355
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:05,630
That is some of the worst dancing ever.

1356
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,190
It's, yeah, not a great dancing.

1357
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:12,540
It's Brits Pretty Peak White Dancing.
But it's still a fun movie.

1358
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:17,680
Why, why are you looking at me like
that? Cause I, I don't, I just,

1359
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:23,220
it's how you can fucking sit through the
excruciating dances in that movie and

1360
01:20:24,281 --> 01:20:28,770
still see the fun and it's cute and
it's like it's a town where they live.

1361
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,610
That's right.
Cause dancing and folks,

1362
01:20:31,611 --> 01:20:34,840
was that an off Broadway play
that they turned into a fucking,

1363
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:38,620
they made it into a Broadway show
of course. Cause they always,

1364
01:20:38,621 --> 01:20:41,170
that's where it should have
stayed. Yeah. I don't know.

1365
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:44,140
You should have to decide to go.
Kevin Bacon was hot in it.

1366
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,920
I remember that part where he goes
and he does that Solo dance out of

1367
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:51,250
frustration in the barn and he's like
flipping around on the beams in the

1368
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:55,720
ceiling along the barn. And he just, you
know, now he's at the Billy Squier video.

1369
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,870
Who's Billy squire?
Squire, the poor bastard.

1370
01:20:58,871 --> 01:21:02,260
The guy was a foster this guy that you
were like obsessed with watching off his

1371
01:21:02,261 --> 01:21:04,310
videos when we were on
vacation. Yeah. Cause I,

1372
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:07,570
when I was watching them live and like
Detroit is like this guy was a fucking

1373
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:11,230
rock star. You got to see
the video. It's so bad. No,

1374
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:13,060
I remember you showed me the video.

1375
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:16,300
Did I show you when he was crawling
on his fucking name? I feel bad too.

1376
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,010
Piling on. But like I know the guy
already feels like it ended his career.

1377
01:21:21,011 --> 01:21:23,620
What are you doing? I don't
want, I said I wouldn't do it.

1378
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:27,910
I said it wouldn't do it and here I am.
No, I don't know what it is. It's the,

1379
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:32,560
you need to apologize to Billy squire and
get that off of your chest while he is.

1380
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,430
Why he's still feels shitty about,
oh by the way, it's drummer.

1381
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,670
I guess it's pronounced shoon art.

1382
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:41,140
Bobby Chouinard Green to that book
and I'm reading that WBCN book,

1383
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:45,760
which is fucking great. Um,
all right, that's it. That's
