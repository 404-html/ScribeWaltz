1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,240
Hey, what's going on as bill burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:07,830
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast and, Huh?

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,090
Just checking. Just checking in
on you. Just checking in on you.

4
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:20,020
What's going on now? It's
been a sad week, you know,

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,780
for standup comedians.
It's been a sad week.

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,070
Joe De Rosa has decided to
retire. No, I'm kidding. Um,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,380
why didn't I pick, why did I pick John
Rosell? Because his birthday's coming up.

8
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:36,430
Everybody wished Joe to Rosa. Happy
Birthday on Sunday. All right.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,660
On Twitter
you call them twinkle toes.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,910
You call them whatever you want, but just,
just, just wishing me happy birthday.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,610
Anyways. Um, what am I
talking about here? Uh,

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,330
it's a sad day in stand up comedy because,
uh,

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,390
that fucking Scaramucci guy got fired.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,430
I know it happened a few days ago,

15
00:00:57,431 --> 00:01:01,420
but I don't pay attention and I'll
do a podcast every couple of days.

16
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:04,030
What do you want from me? Well Bill,
you know, we'd like it though, you know,

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,120
you know some Douche sent me something
on Twitter. He goes, hey bill,

18
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:11,740
please read the news before you
do your podcast on North Korea.

19
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:15,310
Shot off a nuclear warhead
or a missile or something,

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,010
and I'm tilting my head to
go, there wasn't no killer
was some sort of ballistic,

21
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:22,000
whatever the fuck that means. It's a
giant mad that could make it to Chicago.

22
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,520
That's the way I heard it.
And I looked it up and it wasn't nuclear,

23
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:25,710
so I wrote him back.
I said,

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,370
it wasn't no Kyla,
you fucking dope.

25
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:34,950
Stop acting like you're too smart to
listen to my podcast. I Dunno. And then,

26
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,470
and whenever I call people out on it, they
go, oh, she was looking for reaction. Oh,

27
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:41,620
where are you? Oh yeah, yeah. Take your
comment and fucking go home. Right.

28
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,790
You're not in the sandbox anymore.
He's gonna to run away. Huh?

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,910
You're going to go down there and
hide under this skirty Yamada.

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,670
Huh? Um, SCARAMUCCI got fired.

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,300
Fucking sucks.
Everybody says they want somebody honest.

32
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:01,960
And this guy goes in and he literally
just says what he's thinking.

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,050
I didn't know how to say
that. Guy Rents. He reacts.

34
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,730
R. E. I. N. C. E. Tell me what
it means to me. Um, rents.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,340
He says he's a fucking
paranoid schizophrenia.

36
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,190
Yeah.

37
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,390
Uh, paranoiacs whatever the hell that
means. And he goes, I'm not sure,

38
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,860
like Steve Bannon.
I'm not trying to suck my old cock.

39
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm not trying to build my own brand.
I'm here to serve the country. I mean,

40
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,600
Jesus Christ.

41
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,600
What more do you want from
somebody in the White House? Is it,

42
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,370
cause he said Cock,
is it,

43
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:39,350
cause he said fucking like these people
who go in there like Obama who speak

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,540
eloquently and, and
just fucking, you know,

45
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,170
we hit a jump shot every fucking once
in a while. Now. My God, he's so cool.

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,960
I don't, I really don't under, I, I
fucking given up on people. You know,

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,010
that's how people are. And
when, when, when fucking, uh,

48
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,060
what George Carlin died
and what's his face?

49
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,560
The guy there who fucking was always
grabbing a whatever the hell was doing,

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,010
kept settling out of court,
you know, like led Zepplin.

51
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,820
Yeah,
he does his tribute to George Carlin.

52
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:15,930
It's him to sit in as shitting on
him for fucking curse too much. Okay.

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,303
I Dunno.

54
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,880
That's a fucking shame,
man. That is a, uh,

55
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,610
that is a real fucking shame
at that guy is gone yet.

56
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,180
L So what did we get it?

57
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:30,580
We're going to have somebody who we're
gonna have a clean comic go in there who

58
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:35,180
still lies his ass off. But
where's the sweater? I mean,

59
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:38,420
if you can get past cock and fucking,
he basically said,

60
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:42,710
I'm not here for my own needs.
I'm not here to,

61
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:47,570
to advance myself. Actually, you
know, that's a lie. No, right.

62
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:50,880
He's a liar too. But he was a
fun liar. Come on, people leave.

63
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,940
Fuck the guy was fun.

64
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,903
Yeah.

65
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,980
He goes, I'm not a backstabber. I'm
more of a front stabber. I mean, this,

66
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:01,360
this was like, it's like
what if, what a fucking,

67
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,650
somebody who watched Goodfellas too
much got to be in the office. Right.

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,830
And he never took it to debate in class
and no one ever told them not to curse

69
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,680
and to the microphone. I
mean, is it this one? I mean,

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,110
isn't that what the Internet is all about?

71
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,840
Isn't that why the Internet blew
up at the end of the fucking day?

72
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,280
Isn't that why it blew up?

73
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,180
It's not because you want it to go on
there and research how fucking seagulls

74
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,460
fly from one side of the beach to the
other and all those other fun filled facts

75
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:30,490
you can find on a website you went
on cause you wanted to see Teddy's,

76
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,360
you wanted to see some pussy and
you wanted some uncensored language.

77
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,500
Isn't that what you wanted?

78
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,590
And look how much better society
is now because of the Internet.

79
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,630
Uh, you know something, if I
was ever on the debating team,

80
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:48,730
there wouldn't need to be another
person there. Okay. First of all,

81
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,500
because I'm not good at debating.
And second of all,

82
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,790
I end up undoing all of my points
during my argument. You know,

83
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,700
like if you ever debated
me like the worst,

84
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,120
the most apprehensive you'd
get is you bring your eyebrows
up like half. Like, oh,

85
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,170
okay, they come back then, okay,
he just fucked the whole thing up.

86
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,800
He just fucked it all up
like Scaramucci did they,

87
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,000
aren't you going them
all? Look who's here. Hey,

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,230
I know you're doing your podcast and
then leaving. So what are you guys going?

89
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,450
Wow. You got oatmeal on your forearm to
clean up and get ready to start the day.

90
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,550
Okay. Kiss Goodbye. Little princess you.

91
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:32,170
Huh? You eating oatmeal and banana? It's
just like Yo man now. Huh? You got to,

92
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:36,910
we got a mushroom up pretty good.
This is called the podcast sweetheart.

93
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,843
Woo.

94
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,640
No, Hey, I'm talking about SCARAMUCCI.

95
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,350
So mooch,

96
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,070
Scaramucci audios will catch
the daily news. Addie. Oh,

97
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,380
smooth Chacha and then the other ones,
a

98
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,600
Henry and our writings riding.
When Henry Good milk came up with a MOOC.

99
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:04,420
There it is. Okay. That's what he
would have had for the fucking great.

100
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,760
Okay. All right ladies.
Okay, I'll go to work.

101
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,530
Why those before you leave,
right?

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,490
Yeah, but you know something.
Parenting is entered a new scary phase.

103
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,590
This is where she's mobile. She's
going mobile and I don't give a shit.

104
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:29,600
Like if there was a cobra on the floor,

105
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:33,020
she'd grab it by its neck and try
to stick it into her mouth. I mean,

106
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,910
I hit her on the floor the other day.

107
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:38,120
I thought I had everything all cleaned
up and I got one of these casino rugs.

108
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,910
Basically you're the ones with all the
different colors on it. You're like,

109
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,170
oh my God. Is that from the Orient?
No, it's from fucking leash.

110
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,840
Right. And uh, it's fucking, you know,

111
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,770
you can't see stuff.

112
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,290
So I remember I was stretching
before I worked out like an old man.

113
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,500
I got a stretch right.
And I saw one of those spongy earplugs on,

114
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,910
on the ground and I was like note to self
pick that up. And I was just, you know,

115
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,640
being a neat freak, cause I've
never had a baby crawling around.

116
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,970
So long story short,
I'm hanging out here with my lovely wife.

117
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,220
My daughter's crawling on the
floor and I see her in a tongue,

118
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,600
looks like it's purple and I'm like,
what says enter tongue?

119
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,830
What the fuck's going over the tongue?

120
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,870
And then she kinda was
moving it around a guy.

121
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,000
I guess it's all right cause the
earplug was purple by the way.

122
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,930
She wasn't like losing oxygen and then
Diego's yeah, no, she's looking down.

123
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:28,030
She's fine. Jesus Christ.
I can pull that out

124
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,460
and I can't even begin
to tell you like the,

125
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,200
when something like hap that
happens to you, to your kid,

126
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,640
when you drive to work,

127
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:43,000
you get in a cab and you're going to see
in the subway however the fuck you get

128
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:46,390
to work, you ride a tricycle
with the giant front wheel,
however you get to work,

129
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,640
you're not even paying
attention to what you're doing.

130
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,060
All it's going on is a
fucking movie in your head.

131
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,550
That would make Stanley Kubrick fucking,

132
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,740
I dunno what Steven came one of
those fucking guys freak out.

133
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:04,360
Like just the stuff I was thinking about
like you know the worst case scenario

134
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:09,310
of all of that and now so now there is
nothing on the fucking ground. All right,

135
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:12,370
we got those things. You stick on
the tables on the corner so you know,

136
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,400
so you don't hit the corner with
their head. Evidently it's okay.

137
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:20,210
The rest of it they fucking give themself
a face rub along the fucking Tasha.

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,630
What does the Dasher most of you are going
to ask? Cause you're not hockey fans.

139
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,820
That's a little ledge that goes
around the boards, the fucking board.

140
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,523
So anyways,

141
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,280
we're doing the table read today for
episode three Oh three three three three

142
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,430
episode three Oh three.
We're moving along.

143
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,200
We're doing an episode three Oh four
next week we'll have five of them done by

144
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,110
the end of the month and half way there.

145
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,660
Halfway there to writing
and then rewriting and then
the rewriting starts. Um,

146
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,321
but it's,
I think,

147
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,350
I feel like everybody knows the characters
this year and we're cruising along.

148
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,280
Knock on wood, knock on wood. So I
think this'll be a nice table read.

149
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:06,210
But Oh my God. Every once in a while
a nice fucking lay up comes in.

150
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:10,650
He needed that guy. You needed scare
a mulch to fucking balance out Trump.

151
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,910
Cause everybody's doing Trump jokes
enough with the fucking Trump jokes.

152
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:19,560
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my
God. What's going to happen?

153
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,160
The same fucking thing that happened
when Obama was in office. You're morons.

154
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,520
The exact same fucking thing.
Watch.

155
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,680
Just watch. Watch how much
our foreign policy to watch.

156
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:34,610
How much in fucking corporations have
to pay attention to the environment.

157
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,090
Watch how much bankers go to jail. It's
going to be the exact same fucking thing.

158
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,660
And I'm not talking about minorities,
I'm not talking about illegal aliens.

159
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:45,140
It's white people. Stop acting like
you fucking life is gonna Change.

160
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,470
Like somebody is going to come
in and take your fucking SUV,

161
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:52,670
your little fucking bran
muffin or whatever the fuck
else she got at Starbucks.

162
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,860
All of these fucking assholes freaking
the fuck out, which I understand,

163
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,980
but where was this for the
last fucking eight years

164
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,680
and the eight years before they had
the AP eight all the way back to Jimmy

165
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:05,710
Carter.

166
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,340
Jimmy Carter was the last fucking real
man that was in the God damn office.

167
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:09,941
Look at him out there.

168
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:13,840
He's not out there fucking doing Payton's
waiting for his library to be built is

169
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:16,210
out there building houses.
I could, Goddamn man,

170
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,670
it's put his fucking hammer
where his mouth this,

171
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,920
these other fucking guys just sitting
around waiting for their library. But yet,

172
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:25,780
you know,
there's a Roman,

173
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:29,710
all those presidential libraries that
you go in there for the rest of your life

174
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:32,230
and there's a group, he
just standing there, right?

175
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,380
And she just blows you the second you
walk in and the whole time she does,

176
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,150
it's fucking true. All right.
If you don't think that's true,

177
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:46,250
then you need to get on
the Goddamn Internet. Um,

178
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,510
anyways,
plowing ahead here.

179
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,690
But he had a blue tie.

180
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,760
Um, anyways, people, I don't, I don't
pay attention to politics. I don't,

181
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:00,910
I just do all of this shit.

182
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,690
So then people can air quote
correct me on the fucking,

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,830
on Twitter with their own misinformation.
It's a little game I like to call.

184
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,850
I don't have a name for it. Um, anyway.

185
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,390
Scaramucci God dammit,

186
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,370
that guy should have
his own fucking podcast.

187
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:21,460
I would listen to that every fucking week.
Isn't that what you do now?

188
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,380
I love how everybody,
when they get fucking,

189
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,090
when they totally ruined their career,
their first fucking option is what I do.

190
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,900
They did. They start doing, stand up.
Remember Charlie Shanie fucking two guys,

191
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:38,740
a girl and a fucking pizza place. He was
on that whatever the fuck his thing was.

192
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,850
Hey, there's two guys in there
as a kid and there's no check.

193
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,540
I know you know exactly
what you're gonna do.

194
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,530
200 fucking episodes and make
it to syndication. Let me guess.

195
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:53,860
Do you got two dates in the same fucking
night? Now what are going to do? But up,

196
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:57,850
but up up is the story. No wonder he
ended up doing all those fucking drug.

197
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:02,260
So would I. How many fucking times can
you just sit there doing another episode?

198
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,690
Those poor people on those
fucking sick comp Smith.

199
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,680
Once you get up to like
episode 80, 90, and just like,

200
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:11,320
and you know that you don't care anymore,
you know,

201
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,810
it's bad enough when you don't care.
Just the cruise there.

202
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:17,470
I just can't imagine walking out in
front of that fucking studio audience.

203
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,350
You know, you guys missed
it. I was actually,

204
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,000
I was in Hollywood during the
fucking heyday of that shit.

205
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,740
And uh,

206
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,240
used to always hear these stories
about all of these fucking shows.

207
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,950
The stay would be in like the,
uh,

208
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:35,830
they were in the seventh season
and they'd be like, dude, they,

209
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:39,910
I heard they don't come in until Thursday.
You know,

210
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,010
most of them don't even
show up to the table read.

211
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,620
Then they would blow off for her.
So Tuesday and Wednesday,

212
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:47,110
they wouldn't even
fucking come in Thursday.

213
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,760
They just do the block and
cause they have, it's so down,

214
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,093
you know,

215
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,810
I know I go sit on it, Richie,
and then I jumped in the air,

216
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:59,200
cross my legs and sit and Howard
Cunningham's chair. I got it.

217
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,510
How many of these fucking
episodes do we got to do? Right.

218
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,910
They'd show up for the camera blocking,
which is basically,

219
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,980
so you know where you stand.
So you're going to be on camera,

220
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:07,150
you won't block anybody else.

221
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,870
And then the next day they do the
taping and then that was it. Yeah.

222
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,370
Um, anyway, so these mother fuckers, he's,

223
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,580
I bet he does a podcast. You know,
they should start a podcast network.

224
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:26,110
Just the outcasts. Right. And it
should be like fucking Paula Deen.

225
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,990
Um,
uh,

226
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,230
who's that guy who was like
fed fucking really weird guy.

227
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,130
Glenn Beck dead. That guy. Jesus Christ.

228
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,300
You know, I used to watch him
just to feel emotionally stable.

229
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,340
He was like a character on a wrestling
like Kinda like a, a fucking,

230
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,490
I dunno like one of those high pitched,
uh,

231
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,650
who's that high pitch guy
who had the megaphone?

232
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,470
It was like Bret Hart.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,930
Giuseppe was built like that
guy from gladiator gladiator.

234
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,630
I forget what that movie was called.
Um, anyways, they should have them.

235
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:07,311
Bill O'reilly.

236
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:11,310
Should you just stick them all on the
same network and they just sell them like,

237
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:15,720
you know, the main stream couldn't
handle us. It couldn't handle our truth.

238
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:21,060
We went out day or shade it
lag. [inaudible] everybody
is, that's what I do.

239
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,020
You know our American playboy can't
hate on me because I tell it like it is.

240
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,230
That's the male version
of when a woman goes like,

241
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:30,090
guides are like intimidated by me.

242
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,080
Now you're a cunt and you
sir are a racist moron. Okay.

243
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,820
You're not telling it how it is.
Okay.

244
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,980
You're telling it how
you're fucking racist.

245
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:41,730
Parents told you how it is and then you
never left your town and then somehow

246
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:45,150
you got on television and then you started
saying the shit that you heard at the

247
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,600
local diner. Right. And then everybody
else with dirty boots are like,

248
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,550
right.
That's how it was.

249
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,500
So it was people, I don't know what
I'm talking about right now, you know?

250
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,020
I have no idea. Oh Man. Oh Jesus.
I'll tell you, me and my wife all,

251
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,230
we almost got into it. Oh, he almost
got into it this morning, you know,

252
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,360
fucking unreal. I had to work out this
morning to keep my figure in shape. Okay,

253
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,370
I've got to do this fucking podcast.

254
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,310
Then I got to go over the script and
then I have to go do a table read.

255
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,340
I got to do all of that before 10 o'clock
in the morning and I forget whatever

256
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:24,420
the fucking branch of the armed serve
we do more before booking Millenium oh

257
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:27,120
yeah, you got a table
read. What do you deal?

258
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,460
You march around and sing dirty limericks

259
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,133
wait up

260
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,223
Hashtag,

261
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,420
Huh?

262
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,550
Oh right.
That's what the fuck you do.

263
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:50,130
And then you do some pull ups and all
of a sudden I'm supposed to fucking sit

264
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,570
there and feel like I
haven't done anything.

265
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,320
I got to do what those guys that doing.

266
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,220
I've always wanted another adult with
more lines on the side of his sleeve

267
00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:01,720
screaming at me. How can I
sign up for that? You know,

268
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,360
if I was a gun nut, I joined
the fucking military that, that,

269
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:08,160
that's what you want to do, right?
You know, you know what the deal is.

270
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:12,090
You start off with tin cans, then you move
up to squirrels, then you shoot a bird,

271
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,030
right? And then eventually
you get in the fucking board.

272
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:18,330
Cause at the end of the day,
no matter how difficult it is,

273
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,790
they matter how much deer urine
you've got to put on yourself.

274
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,680
You shooting something dumber than you.

275
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,110
At some point you want to go
after the ultimate brain, okay?

276
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,620
You've watched Jurassic
Park too many times.

277
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,240
You realize there's no real Velo Rasa,
[inaudible], whatever the fuck they they,

278
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,270
God damn thinks where you realize there
aren't enough of those. You'd like,

279
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:42,660
I'm joining the God damn military.
Right. That's what you do.

280
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,550
I wonder how many psychos did that,
you know,

281
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,050
they always say that they're doing
it for your freedom. Right? I joined,

282
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,920
I show a sharp don't happen.
And I was like, I'm not done.

283
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,050
Then there are those people, come
on, somebody write me an anonymous,

284
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,980
what branch of the service or you
went, Huh? Are you in the coast guard?

285
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,150
Yeah. We get to sense what are the
people you're working with? Joy.

286
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:07,290
Just because they wanted to see someone
half eaten by shark pull 'em out of the

287
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,680
water just to see what it looks like. You
know, I think the coast guard, that's,

288
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:14,400
that's like the worst fucking
like out of all the jobs,

289
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,120
because the war never ends.
It never ends. You know,

290
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,890
hopefully at some point this shit will
end over in the Middle East, you know?

291
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,980
Um, I don't know how it ends, but
who the fuck knows? But anyways, um,

292
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,900
the coast guard,
it never fucking,

293
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,640
and that right there, I mean,
can you get the metal of,

294
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,560
they should have a civilian saving a
dumb civilian medal of honor for the

295
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,700
fucking coast guard.

296
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,590
Do you realize every time there's like
a bad storm coming and that telling

297
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:50,310
everybody to stay inside and you get
like, oh you get excited. You know,

298
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,440
cause all they sent me
home from work early,

299
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,220
all we get to light a fire
in the fireplace, you know,

300
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,580
let's watch raising Arizona,
get the kids together,

301
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:02,610
all wrap up in a blanket and
you have a great fucking time.

302
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,540
Oh Beg some smarts. That's
why I love you lady. Right?

303
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,400
You're getting ready. You know what the
fuck they're doing. And the coast guard,

304
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,200
they have fucking palms are sweating.

305
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,480
Their stomach is in a knot because they
know some stupid fuck is going to get in

306
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:23,481
his God damn boat around his fucking
surfboard or his boogie board or some dumb

307
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:27,280
shit is gonna go on a fucking hike.
All right.

308
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,110
And he's going to Alton,
you gotta come get me.

309
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,070
And these people who are completely
safe got to get in there.

310
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,440
Fucking got to get in
a fucking helicopter,

311
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,050
fly out the middle of a fucking hurricane,

312
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:44,700
defy some fucking dope in his silly
named yacht who had to take the fucking

313
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:45,450
thing out,
right.

314
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,170
Had to show off in front of his trophy
fucking wipe and now they got to go out

315
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,930
there.
It's some poor bastard.

316
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,200
He's got a fucking jump out of a
helicopter in a hurricane into the fucking

317
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:02,970
ocean to try to get these fucking
dopes out of there, back to the land.

318
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,650
So what they can breed and
make more stupid people.

319
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,850
So the people at the top of the coast
guard can keep making their fucking blood

320
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,500
money.
We're taking college.

321
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,870
Okay.

322
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,640
That right there is the
scariest fucking job.

323
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,640
I am terrified to the fucking ocean.
Okay.

324
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,600
You would not want to have a bunch
of mes in the Coast Guard. Okay.

325
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,310
Those fucking boats would just be sitting
there in the sun and on the day will

326
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:33,820
be yet that would be it. I would fucking,
I would be, we would be on the dock.

327
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:38,821
I'd be on the boat with a life jacket on
playing cards and I would get like this

328
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:40,174
distress car.
Yeah.

329
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,413
Yes.

330
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,880
Good. I'd be like, Hey Roger Dad. Well
what the fuck are you doing out there?

331
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,410
Well, I don't, what the
fuck, what the fuck?

332
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,360
That would be me,

333
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,650
I would have that meltdown every dime
and then I would do the job because

334
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:07,020
basically at the end of the day,
if I was in the coast guard,

335
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,930
that's how I have to
fucking make my limit.

336
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,470
And now I have to go out there and
fish some fucking dope out there.

337
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,810
Is Anybody in the Coast
Guard listening to this?

338
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:20,811
Can you please tell me there's no way
when you phish somebody out of the ocean.

339
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,410
Okay. And then they, you
got to fucking go last.

340
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,950
Okay.

341
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,680
And then they send that
fucking hook down again. Right?

342
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,430
It's just sitting there
and 40 foot waves are

343
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,250
going up and down.
When they wrote,

344
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:43,500
when they fucking crank you back
up in that Goddamn helicopter,

345
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,450
there is no fucking way,
you know,

346
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:49,270
talk some shit to that guy is he's
sitting there with that fucking,

347
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,650
I almost got swallowed by the ocean.
Look on his face.

348
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:58,570
Whatever the fuck that looks like.
He knows he's fucking dumb. Right?

349
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,870
Do you must look them right
in the heg take fuck head.

350
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,390
Next time he take your boat out,

351
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:07,690
why don't you make sure the fucking sun's
out and it's not a fucking whatever.

352
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,370
Well, how are they rate a hurricane?
Fucking got goddamn five or a cake.

353
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,770
It's unbelievable. You know what I
always think that they fucking look like?

354
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:18,311
I mean,
you just,

355
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:23,311
I would be so fucking embarrassed if I
ever did some dumb shit like that and

356
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:27,340
somebody had to go out wrist.
If fucking life fly a fucking helicopter.

357
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:29,930
You're not supposed to fly. And turbulence
with helicopters. As far as Mike,

358
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,050
my little knowledge of it
and these fucking guys got
to go fly out and then that

359
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:39,440
shit
unfucking believable.

360
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:44,030
They ever make a movie about
the Coast Guard, Huh? Well,

361
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:47,000
I didn't say it.
I'm fucking making movies about,

362
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,150
made a whole TV show about a
fucking dolphin saving people.

363
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,330
They call him flipper.
He can pray.

364
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,320
You can hold his breath and then it
comes up I think if supposed to be there.

365
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,203
All right,

366
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,650
let me make a fucking TV show
about a of of a guy saving fish.

367
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,340
You know that f beached themselves and
you throw it pay and maybe they did.

368
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,400
Was it free willy? We
actually, we captured that one.

369
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,060
I don't know if I think I probably owe
coast guard ever fishes me out of the

370
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,760
fucking ocean. You know what the
look I'm going to have on my face.

371
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,210
Do you remember when Oj got arrested the
second time and he knew he was fucked,

372
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,650
but he was trying to smile.

373
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,070
Remember that fucking that's the
fucking look I would have on my face.

374
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:28,820
I just forgot. I know. I know. You
don't have to say is that they do,

375
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,000
you shouldn't say a fucking word to those
people after you pull them out of the

376
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:36,780
water. Even the gold
digging whores, you know?

377
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,450
Yeah.

378
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,170
Just talk to her. Yeah.
He had enough heavy,

379
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:45,920
had enough rich old caulk at this point.
Sweetheart, why don't you go back,

380
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:49,700
finish up at community college and
build a real fucking life. Okay.

381
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,210
No,
we didn't find your other glass high heel.

382
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:57,770
You're fucking stripper it. Oh, and
they did take it back to the base.

383
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,430
Um, anyways, sorry. Most of that
was just the stress of my day.

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,910
23 fucking minutes. All right,

387
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,940
If you're fucking Dharmana I have to
go out in the ocean during a hurricane.

00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:07,940
dope me undies me undies.
I got fat balls, Doo Doo,

429
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:12,200
Doo Doo. It was a birth
defect. I got too many nuts.

430
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,510
Fivefold Bolles makes
fucking nine but don't worry,

431
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,580
my boss feel fine because I got dead
velvety under wherever up my giant

432
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:27,040
stretched out fucking nuts sack.
I really mean. All right. Mondays.

433
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,540
Mondays are the softest, most comfortable
underwear you'll ever wear, period.

434
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,770
And a fucking story.
And summer is the perfect time to upgrade.

435
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,810
Upgrade your underwear drawer because
everyone is thinking about looking good

436
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:42,860
and feeling good.

437
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:48,410
Everyone is on social media and me
undies are the ultimate feel good undies.

438
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,990
Wouldn't you love to take a
Selfie with your nuts? What?

439
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:56,460
You couldn't do it before this underwear
put your scrotum in a good mood.

440
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:01,020
Every pair of me undies is sustainably
sourced and made from micro modal, modal,

441
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,610
a fabric that is three times softer than
cotton according to the people at me

442
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:05,941
undies.

443
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:10,470
Because me undies comes in all kinds of
colors and patterns and they release new

444
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,460
limited edition patterns each
month that will always sell out.

445
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,730
You know what me undies
needs to go up against a,

446
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,000
what's said gay underwear brand.
Uh,

447
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,880
a filthy pig or nasty pigman.

448
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,660
At that time I told you I
was unfortunately going to
Charlie Murphy's funeral

449
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,830
and I didn't pack enough underwear and
the only fucking underwear place in my

450
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:36,450
neighborhood was right across the street
and it had like the banana hammock shit.

451
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:39,690
And I walked in there and there was
like cock rings and all this shit.

452
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,170
I ever tell you this story. So I
got it. So I'm looking for the,

453
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:46,530
all the underwear is just like
fucking like atlas that all this.

454
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:51,450
So I finally go to the guy behind the
counter. I go, eight skews me, but I go,

455
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,150
do you got any? Uh, you
got any normal underwear?

456
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,850
And he goes to find normal.
And I was like, I dunno,

457
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,990
it doesn't say nasty pig
and the fucking waistband

458
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,680
does it say stretch out my ass on the
fucking right across the booty cheeks.

459
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,430
Can you just got a pair of black
or gray or white ones? I'm sorry,

460
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,850
my life isn't as exciting as yours be.

461
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,470
These audit go up against those guys.
You know,

462
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,590

colors and the patterns. You know,

463
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,730
people will buy nasty pig underwear.
Maybe you could get them on.

464
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't think nasty pig is made
out of micro Modo. Modot uh,

And none of the things I've Elbert
said is mirrored in any way.

475
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:07,640
Reflects the feelings of anybody over
here and trying to make it dick feel good

476
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:12,140
in a pair of underwear, pro flowers,
everybody. Pro Flowers. Hey,

477
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:12,974
it's August.

478
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,100
Why don't you take a bouquet of flowers
and put them in your girlfriend's face?

479
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:17,990
Huh?
Um,

480
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,470
talk about the last time you spontaneously
surprise someone with something

481
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:26,210
completely unexpected and how
it felt. Uh, Jesus Christ.

482
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:28,400
I hope you don't send
this to fucking hope.

483
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:32,180
There's no serial killers with
podcast talking about the last time he

484
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:36,530
spontaneously surprise someone with
something completely unexpected and how it

485
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:37,364
felt.

486
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,810
Picture in Hannibal Lecter. I remember
it was heart rate wouldn't even go up.

487
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,670
He's listening to the classical
music. I don't know. Um,

488
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,590
I would surprise my wife
but she snoops too much.

489
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,240
She always figures out what the fuck
I'm doing and then I just be all right.

490
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,980
Fucking here it is.
All right.

491
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:01,981
Talk about what the Rose Bouquet bouquet
bouquet recently sent to you by profile

492
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:07,000
is look like and your overall impression
of it. Uh, well I didn't receive it,

493
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:11,680
but I have seen bouquets of roses before
and I know what they look like when

494
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:16,420
they're in the vase and
uh, you know, it was,

495
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:20,530
yeah, those are flowers
and they really smell like.

496
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,210
All right. Pro Flowers wants to help you
surprise someone for no reason at all.

497
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,930
Well, in other words, you want
to make more money selling
flowers. In other words,

498
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
there's no real fucking
holiday this month.

499
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,290
All while also surprising you with
a special deal. For my listeners,

500
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:40,530
get 20% off any other of their unique
summer Rose Rose bouquets or any other

501
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,040
bouquet of 29. Why are they trying
to fucking do this? Just saying,

502
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:48,340
what the fuck you mean here? This
is the deal. There's no eastern,

503
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,420
there's no mother's Day.

504
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:53,050
There's no fucking Valentine's
Day unless it's her birthday.

505
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,980
There's no fucking reason to
get a flowers other than this.

506
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,330
Shut the fuck up for a couple of hours,

507
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,760
okay? If you, if your girlfriend's
birthday isn't this month, okay.

508
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:11,060
And God knows Jesus didn't do anything
in August cause just like Fyi,

509
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,260
he took the month off. Okay,
so there's no Jesus holiday.

510
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,680
I don't know what Muhammad did.
I don't even want to get into Buddha.

511
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:21,970
But as far as me as a white
male, white male, Christian,

512
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:26,320
there's no holiday this month. Okay,
so you're probably sitting there going,

513
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:29,920
why the fuck would I get her flowers?
You know why? Because it means something.

514
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:33,820
It means more.
You're supposed to do it on mother's Day.

515
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,950
You're supposed to do
it on their birthday.

516
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:40,270
You're supposed to tip them upside down
on Christmas and use their fucking clam

517
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:44,080
is a vase on Christmas.
We all know this. Okay,

518
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:49,630
but you're not supposed to do it in
August and that's why you do it. Okay?

519
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,010
This is like when Michael Jordan used to
come to practice and rather than acting

520
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,630
like he was the best guy in the league,

521
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,820
he would practice like
he was going to get cut.

522
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,510
That's what you want to do with pro
flowers. So fuck their copy. All right?

523
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,250
You can get 20% off the summertime. Roses.
Go get some for your mother in August.

524
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,940
Just get them for and be like,
Yo, why you should do this?

525
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:14,320
Because you're the best mother
I ever could have asked for. Oh,

526
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,930
that's what you're going to
get right there. All right?

527
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,160
And you get 20% off some or roses
or any other bootcamp. Okay?

528
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:25,180
For fucking $29 a more.
Go to proflowers.com use my code.

529

Berbee you are are a checkout.
That's proflowers.com code.

530
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:32,950
[inaudible] don't wake to make
someone's Day. That's it. 32 minutes.

531
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,120
32 like Oj Simpson. He's
going to be ready. Wow.

532
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,330
Come October. Uh, what
you gonna do when? Oh,

533
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:45,320
Jane comes running wild on you.
I've had a pretty nonconfrontational life.

534
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,100
Yes, you did. Oj. Except for that night.
He killed two people. Other than that.

535
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,893
That was it.

536
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,200
You ever see that fucking documentary
about how we got fucking arrested the

537
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:57,440
second time when he went down
there to go get his shit, you know,

538
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:00,440
and then he had his buddy take out
his gun and then they didn't have his

539
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:01,730
memorabilia that he thought.

540
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,500
So then these other fucking assholes
started grabbing autograph Pete Rose

541
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:06,501
Baseballs,

542
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:09,380
and then they took the guy's cell phone
and then it became an armed robbery.

543
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,070
I mean, I would assume also
think, depending on how that
got got the memorabilia,

544
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,130
I don't really remember. All
I know is it's like, dude,

545
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,180
I can tell you this man.
Okay.

546
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,580
If I was a black guy who got away with
killing two white people and I would not

547
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:29,630
leave the fucking house for the rest
in me, it's what the fucking guy,

548
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:31,460
I don't know what he's thinking.
You know,

549
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:35,420
you run for 2000 yards in a 14 game
season and then all of a sudden you think

550
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:36,254
you're invincible.

551
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,600
That fucking look on his face when he
gets arrested the second time where he

552
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,700
knows he's fucked and
yet he's trying to smile.

553
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,320
I was talking about that
yesterday in the writer's room.

554
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:50,240
It's one of the funniest fucking
things I've ever seen. It's like that,

555
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,430
and there's one of ric flair
with somebody's interviewing
him and they're asking

556
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:59,000
him, what was it like the last time you
went to Japan and you see his love for

557
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:02,480
wrestling, and he knew it was his
last day, said, look at this picture.

558
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,360
What was going on? And
he was like, this was,

559
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,810
I knew this was my last time I was going
to Japan and he starts to fucking cry

560
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,460
and he doesn't want to cry,
you know,

561
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,390
cause he's the nature boy
and he's trying not to cry.

562
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:20,870
So he's smiling while he's trying.
I can try not to cry.

563
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,700
I've never seen an actor do that in a
seat because of an actor's starts to cry,

564
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,830
they can't help it. They're
like, oh good, I'm crying.

565
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:31,190
This is what the director wants.
Crying equals good acting.

566
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,170
I'm going to get an award.
All right,

567
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:40,340
Denzel gets one with one tier.
I got to tears coming down
that aren't, I mean, die.

568
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,080
Get a Golden Globe and a fucking Oscar.
Right. All right, that's the podcast.

569
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,130
Please listen to this wonderful
music. Oh, by the way,

570
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:52,370
you know what am I finally
fucking got into? And I,

571
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:54,260
I used to trash them all the time.

572
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:58,980
Joe Rosa was right about Frank Zappa.
I could never get into a,

573
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:01,930
granted I was listening to fucking
hair metal. It was two. And I always,

574
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,650
people always said Joe's garage.

575
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:07,970
Every time I read a fucking drummer
magazine for fucking 15 years,

576
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:09,560
every drum was trying
to get Vinnie Callie,

577
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:12,530
you as high hat sound and Geogebra Joe's
garage. That's what they always said.

578
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,800
You know, I wanted to get that Vinny
call you to high hats and Joe's garage.

579
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,110
And I always got to put on and I was like,
what the fuck is this?

580
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,820
I don't even know what's going on.
Is,

581
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,590
is frank mocking music is easy
trying to take what I just,

582
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,510
it was so far beyond anything. I was
listening to it. It didn't sound good,

583
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:31,700
if you can believe that. And, um,

584
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,230
I finally just put it on in the car and
I also fucking had another 15 years of

585
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:42,231
listening to music and actually trying
to expand my horizons from top 40 Horse

586
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:46,170
Shit that I had been listening to. And,
uh, it's fucking unbelievable album.

587
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,650
It's fucking unbelievable.
So, uh, Joe de Rosa,

588
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,940
I trashed him so many goddamn times
about Frank Zappa so many times.

589
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,180
And I was like, Joe, you're contrarian.
You just like it cause it's different djs.

590
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,850
I swear to God, if everybody liked Frank
Zappa, you wouldn't fucking like him.

591
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,380
And he goes, that is a true bill. I,
I, I'd hate you and your freckled face.

592
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:05,490
And we would go back and forth,

593
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:09,330
back and forth as we drank the fucking
the brown devil then that's what we would

594
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:13,050
do. Okay. And Joe Rosa, I'll
tell you right now, and I'm
going to tell him his son,

595
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:17,300
his birthday, he was never more right
about Frank Zappa and he was never more,

596
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,120
he was right about the brown album with
Primus. And he was right about the,

597
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,870
the fucking golden girls.
Okay. I saw the golden girls.

598
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,200
I saw four old ladies, Joe,
to Rosa saw comedy gold.

599
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,590
I didn't see it the other night I
was sitting and they weren't on,

600
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,860
they were having a marathon.

601
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,760
I was trying to get my daughter to go to
sleep and I'm watching the shit that's

602
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:39,420
like 30 years old and I'm laughing my
ass off. I fucking love that show now.

603
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,950
You know.

604
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,950
So my apologies to the great Joe to Rosa
and happy birthday to him and oh by the

605
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:46,950
way,

606
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,240
if you guys would like to do me the
biggest fucking favor you could ever do,

607
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,070
there's a few fucking tickets left
for Paul Versey standup special,

608
00:36:56,071 --> 00:37:00,720
his first one, his first
hour, then me, Pete Davidson,

609
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,070
Al Madrigal and all things comedy. We'll
be producing our first standup special.

610
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:08,820
We would love to sell this place
out. Okay. Was So fucking close.

611
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,220
We could lie to Paul and
say this is sold out.

612
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:13,890
We just want to sell these last
few tickets. If he could do it,

613
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,870
if he can make it down.
Okay.

614
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:20,730
It's at the Tarrytown theater in
beautiful Tarrytown, New York. I mean,

615
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:23,820
this is like one of the,
the beginning of a Tom Hanks movie,

616
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:27,160
when he has the perfect life before he
decides to fucking go out there and it

617
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,820
gets stuck on a Goddamn island
talking to a volleyball, right?

618
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,800
This is where they would
start maybe his neighborhood.

619
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:34,710
And like big when he was riding the
fucking ball with a little kid was riding

620
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,530
the bike. That's what this place looks
like. He could bring you lady up,

621
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,880
you can have a nice fucking dinner.

622
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,500
Me and Pete Davidson are going to go on
stage and fuck around at the same time

623
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:46,480
trying out new bits, getting you guys
warmed up. And then Paul [inaudible],

624
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:50,160
he's going to absolutely fucking
crush it. All right. And all things,

625
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,560
but he is producing it and
it's going to be great.

626
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:56,460
So please come down if you can.
I'll be hanging out in between shows.

627
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:58,050
You want to get a picture?
I'll sign shit.

628
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:02,370
Whatever the fuck I gotta do to get you
into the goddamn building. Um, that's it.

629
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:07,020
I'll be tweeting out a link. Uh,
let's make it happen. Okay. That's it.

630
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:10,560
Enjoy the music and we'll be playing
some a greatest hits of a Thursday

631
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,530
afternoon just before Monday morning,
Friday,

632
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,350
fucking whatever the hell he called
this thing on the Thursday gone by and

633
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:17,170
another year.

634
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,600
Awesome. Alright, go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend consent.

635
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,473
I'll talk to you.

636
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,283
Okay.

637
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,633
Hey

638
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,033
Mom.

639
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,690
Hey,
what's going on?

640
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:14,470
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

641
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,490
August the third 2009

642
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,160
why the fuck does it say November? You
know what? I thought I finally had it.

643
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,740
I was going to be like,
it's 77 degrees out.

644
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,960
Chance of a high of 83 and now I'm
looking at says fucking November.

645
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:36,850
Why is that? I Dunno.
Why the fuck it does it?

646
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,410
That does to meet every God damn
week. I'll gives a shit, whatever.

647
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:46,220
It's August 3rd all right.
Another year flying by Jesus Christ.

648
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:49,760
Where is the summer going?
Huh?

649
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,790
How many people have said that to you
already? Everybody always says that.

650
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:56,720
Where is the summer go egg every year.

651
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,210
It just seems to go by even faster.

652
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,230
I'd say it's amazing like the
first 20 years of my life,

653
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:07,010
it just seemed like it took forever
about today. Once she had 30 those years,

654
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:10,910
they just, they just, they fly by. Oh,
and if you have a kid, forget about it.

655
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,290
Just for fun. Yeah. I mean, I don't,

656
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,290
I don't even remember 35
to 46 nobody cares, lady.

657
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,640
Nobody cares. You're, you're
saying the same shit. We got it.

658
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,610
Life goes by fast.
Okay.

659
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,910
Where is the time going?
I don't know.

660
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,570
I'm wasting a lot right now
listening to you, going on your big,

661
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:36,571
long fucking seemingly
philosophical little rant
about where the fucking time is

662
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:41,720
going. While you're not really being,
you're not presenting any what?

663
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:45,080
A philosophical shit.
Now you like that people,

664
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,000
this is going to be a hybrid of
podcasts where I hit you with terms like

665
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,580
philosophical shit.
All right?

666
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,530
So I'll be coming at me acting like I'm,
I'm getting all upper crust here.

667
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,350
That's your own insecurity
because you get nervous when I,

668
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,170
when I use terms like that.
All right? That's not my fault.

669
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:05,960
You went to a community college,
you know,

670
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,890
and you didn't have great teachers to
teach you about philosophical shit.

671
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,310
All right, whatever. This is
the Monday morning podcast.

672
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:17,450
I do one of these every single week
and um, I really enjoy doing them.

673
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,330
Um,
I don't know why cause you know why?

674
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:25,331
Cause I walk around my apartment and I
talked to myself anyways and when I have,

675
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,090
um, when I have headphones on and
I have talking into a microphone,

676
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:32,450
I don't feel as crazy while
my dog is already asleep.

677
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,880
She's in heat right now.

678
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,960
Jesus Christ walking around
with the fucking swollen pussy.

679
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,660
That's what I got. Huh? How is that? Yeah.

680
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:45,590
I hope you were eating when I just said
that as disgusting as one of the most

681
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:47,250
disgusting things I've ever said.
But anyways,

682
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,660
this is really going off
the rails quick this week.

683
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:54,620
People brand new conductor
here. Um, all right, let's,

684
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:58,010
let's get down to some shit here that
I want to talk about. First of all,

685
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,950
I have some homework for all of you guys,

686
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,050
everyone who's listening
to this podcast and um,

687
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,550
I got to admit my podcast.

688
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,320
I think it's finally taking off because
in the last couple of weeks I've learned

689
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:17,090
that I don't have enough bandwidth
on iTunes for the amount of people

690
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:20,090
downloading it.
So I appreciate all the new listeners.

691
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,800
I got a computer nerd friend around
the corner who hopefully will solve the

692
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,650
problem tomorrow.
You know,

693
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:30,590
teach me how to get some
more bandwidth or whatever,

694
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:34,980
so more people can listen to it. I
get a ton of questions. So anyway,

695
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:38,810
so I feel like I'm starting to
build a force here. All right?

696
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,400
So maybe I can use this force for,

697
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:47,540
for like my own wishes. You
know that Jesus Christ at
the, even for my own wishes,

698
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,580
for, for my own desires. There we go.

699
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,370
So this is the required homework
for all of you this week.

700
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:56,810
All of you have to go out and you got,
you have to go see the movie, the orphan.

701
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,453
All right?

702
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,080
It is required because I want to
talk about that movie for a good 10,

703
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:07,130
15 minutes. I want to
talk about that movie. Um,

704
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,030
but I don't want to ruin it for people.
All right?

705
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,550
You have to go see that movie.

706
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:18,551
That movie is a throwback to classic,

707
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,040
I would say mid maybe late
eighties horror films where,

708
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,970
um,

709
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,840
they just kind of went off the
rails and they building suspense.

710
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,780
So the whole thing just became funny
cause it was inadvertently a fucking

711
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:39,780
hilarious movie.
And uh,

712
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,430
I dunno. Ah, Shit. I
want to talk about this.

713
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,850
I'm giving you guys one fucking week
next week I'm talking about that movie

714
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,480
because it was so, uh, it
was so ridiculous. You know,

715
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,560
this is how I know it's a good horror
movie is if I go and see it and then when

716
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:59,610
I get home and I'm turning the lights out,
you know,

717
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,280
I'm creeped out in my own apartment.
You know,

718
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,290
as I walked by a hallway and there's no
light on, you know, like to this day,

719
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,760
to this day, when I'm on the road
and I go back to my hotel room,

720
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:16,761
every once in a while I'll put the fucking
lights out and I'll expect like the

721
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:21,600
TV to come on and see the girl crawling
out of the well or to hear the phone

722
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:25,650
ring. And I pick it up and it's
going to go seven days, you know,

723
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,560
because that movie,
I don't know what it was about the ring,

724
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,600
that one stayed with me,
the Blair witch,

725
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,890
which was really a polarizing movie where
a lot of people look to those fucking

726
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:39,350
stupid. I won't fucking scared at
all. I was just fucking laughing.

727
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,920
You know those people,

728
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,040
those people who go to scary movies and
they got to talk about how it didn't

729
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:48,330
scare them and how they laughed the
whole time as if that means if they were

730
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,610
actually confronted by
a psycho on the street,

731
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,040
they would have a better
chance of, uh, you know,

732
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,540
of surviving because they laughed
in a movie theater. I mean,

733
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,780
anybody can sit in a fucking movie and
just take themselves out of the movie and

734
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:04,500
just fell. It's just an actor. Oh, it's
fake blood. You can do that. You know,

735
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,240
I dunno.

736
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,170
Maybe this is me just getting fucking
defensive because the Blair witch scared

737
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:14,040
the shit out of me. You know, I
fucking bought that movie hook,

738
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:17,190
line and sinker and the end when that
dude was standing there facing the fucking

739
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,030
corner, it was just creepy. I
like when I can't see the monster.

740
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,120
That's my thing.
Is that your thing bill?

741
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,240
I don't remember asking you what your
thing is. Well then don't fucking listen.

742
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,110
Sorry. I'm going to, I'm kind of
in a mood right now. There's a lot.

743
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,100
I had a lot of devastating shit happened
to me this week. And not only that,

744
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:37,080
I was driving,
uh,

745
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,910
down the street out here and I
saw some lady had a, a, a sign on,

746
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,730
on the back of her,
her as Suzu trooper,

747
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:47,160
everybody 1988,

748
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:52,050
Isuzu Trooper Zuzu however the
fuck you say it. And it says, uh,

749
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,690
I might be slow, but I'm in front of you.
You know, and that's the kind of person,

750
00:46:57,691 --> 00:47:01,500
if someone dragged them out of the car
and started beating them repeatedly about

751
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,334
the head and neck,

752
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,240
as much as I would feel bad for
the person who's driving the zoo,

753
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,670
trooper [inaudible] kind of
be kind of asking for it,

754
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,130
you know, why are you baiting
people to beat the shit?

755
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:21,720
That's what you're doing right there.
That's like Nananana ass shit. And uh,

756
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:25,260
you know, it's like, uh, I don't know.

757
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,000
That would be like me a,
I don't know,

758
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:30,160
in the 60s when the race
riots were going on, you know,

759
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:35,161
and having some fucking racial
shit on my isn't really bill,

760
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:38,200
is it really to that level?
Now? You're right, it is.

761
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:42,530
And I don't even go down a fucking robot,
a moron. Um, but anyway, speaking of the,

762
00:47:42,531 --> 00:47:47,220
in the 1988 Zuzu trooper, and that's kind
of been a new thing that I have on my,

763
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:47,400
uh,

764
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,360
my myspace page is I'm taking pictures
of random vehicles out here in Los

765
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,230
Angeles. Um, because I, I just,

766
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,650
you can't believe how long,
if you're from the east coast,

767
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:02,440
you cannot believe how
long cars last out here.

768
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,880
Some of the cars that like,
oh,

769
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,420
you have a hang out with your friends,
you know, some high school buddies,

770
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,620
you know,
you haven't seen in awhile.

771
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,450
And then they bring up some kid who
moved in the second grade, you know,

772
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,280
hey, remember John Sarno
everything and you were like,

773
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:22,690
holy fuck,

774
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,370
I have not thought about that kid since
1982 dad is what it's like walking,

775
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,030
driving around out here. I don't know if
I told you this a couple of months back,

776
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:36,060
I saw a Pontiac t 1000 in
good condition out here.

777
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:41,920
Chocolate, Brown, Pontiac t 1000. And
for those of you who aren't in the car,

778
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:46,300
you probably think, oh, teen 1000
probably had some bulls. You know,

779
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:51,270
you could probably do a
burnout or whatever fucking
stupid thing those gearheads

780
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,110
do. Um, that I'm jealous of because
I don't know how to fix a car myself.

781
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,010
Um,

782
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:02,010
Pontiac team 1000 was actually
the Pontiac's answer to the shoe.

783
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,370
A Chevy Chevette,

784
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,800
which was a hatchback Chevy
Chevette and was also a very,

785
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,060
um, on its way to becoming
a hugely hacky joke.

786
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,740
When I first started in stand up,

787
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,520
one of the classic hacky jokes
when I first started was,

788
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:24,670
uh, people get on stage and be like,
Hey, I'm doing pretty good. You know,

789
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,650
you see my car outside? Yeah, I got,

790
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,860
the vet has Chevette and I'd be like,
yeah,

791
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,510
Oh shit. I thought he was
Doug about it, love it.

792
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,140
And then the guy and his,
everyone's laughing.

793
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:38,800
The guy would be adjusted his sport
coat sleeves to make sure that they were

794
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:43,300
three quarters of the way
down his forearms to let you
know that he wasn't in an

795
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:45,700
office.
You know,

796
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,830
that's why he had the pastel colored tee
shirt underneath his sport coat to let

797
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:54,970
you know that he was, he was off
the grid. He was out of the Matrix.

798
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,820
He found a way to find
your daily grind uniform,

799
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,040
a fucking edgy.

800
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,700
That might be one of the worst periods
of fucking dress ever. The late eighties,

801
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,650
standup comedian,

802
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,110
remember that with this skinny ties or
the fuck he's just, it's just in the,

803
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:21,100
and the, the, the was
basically the feathered mullet.

804
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,320
It was like Farrah Fawcett
met. Uh, I don't know,

805
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,000
Billy Ray Cyrus. I got, I
got fucking nothing on that
one. But speaking of which,

806
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:31,370
let, let's, let's plow ahead.
So anyways, I, I have, uh,

807
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:35,000
I've been taking some pictures of
some pretty random fucking vehicles,

808
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:39,200
one of which I don't even know what
it was. It looks like a big RV.

809
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,170
I thought it was a Volkswagen.
It's missing the bumpers.

810
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,320
It literally looks like it's made out
of Styrofoam Styrofoam and I'm convinced

811
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:48,320
someone's living in it. Um, but anyways,

812
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:51,410
check those out on my myspace page
if you're bored. But, hey, bill,

813
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:55,610
why don't you get back to the
podcast? Fine. I will. And I will,

814
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,720
you're probably wondering,
you know,

815
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,420
a couple of minutes ago I said I
kind of had a devastating week.

816
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,580
Um, how do I get into this? All right.

817
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,900
Once again,

818
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,900
going back about a month
ago when the subject of,

819
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:15,320
uh, steroids in baseball came
up. I did not name a name,

820
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:20,321
but I said if one particular person
were to some for some reason get busted,

821
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:25,400
I guess it wasn't roids it was HGH, but
whatever was HDH whatever the fuck it is.

822
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,830
If they were to get busted debt, I was
going to be done with baseball and, uh,

823
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,280
the person got busted and,
uh, that's it. I'm out.

824
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,103
I'm out.

825
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,230
Okay,

826
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,970
I'm out. Fuck baseball. I don't know if
I'm going to be out forever, but fuck it.

827
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:47,600
I did catch myself for half
a second watching a Dodgers.

828
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:49,520
I think they're playing the cardinals.
I can't watch it.

829
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,430
I watch for like three seconds. And then
Manny Ramirez came up and I was like, Oh,

830
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,780
here we go again. I'm done. I'm
fucking done with, you know,

831
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:01,330
what bugs me the most about all of
this shit. And um, you know, I got,

832
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,840
I got emails from a couple of
Yankee fans going on, right? Gold.

833
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:08,850
Now what now what you say
[inaudible] you know what a yeah,

834
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:10,930
you're right. You're absolutely
right. But I'll tell you,

835
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:15,070
us against you is even roids verse Roids
and Europe where you're actually still

836
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:19,340
a couple ahead of us. But
no, it's roids verse Roids.

837
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,490
All right, if you want to
argue the 2004 championship,

838
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,870
because I can't really think of
a cardinal that got caught. Uh,

839
00:52:27,871 --> 00:52:30,480
I would have that argument
with somebody from St Louis.

840
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,430
But as far as Yankee fans go, I mean,
come on dude. All right. We, we, we,

841
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,960
you know, you guys did everything but
send a fucking center up to the plate.

842
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,240
You know what? That's what the Yankees
and red sox should be right now.

843
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,190
They should just have half men,

844
00:52:48,191 --> 00:52:52,570
half horses and they
just go up to the plate,

845
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,920
you know,
and they got to put on a jersey,

846
00:52:56,921 --> 00:53:00,820
cause you can't look at
that little fucking, uh, you
can't look at that. You know,

847
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,310
you know what it is when they
come up to bat, they're good.

848
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:05,770
They're going to need a
shirt cause they're going to
need a little pocket to put

849
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:08,770
that little fucking pan
flute in when they come up.

850
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,100
I think that that's what they should do.
So I gotta be honest with you,

851
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:15,520
I don't know what is going on at baseball,
but uh,

852
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,010
I'm not even mad at the players anymore.

853
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,780
What's really pissing me off at this point
is how the owners made all that money

854
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:26,520
and they're not being held
accountable on any level.

855
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,580
I really think like the last 10 years
of baseball was just a big marketing

856
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:33,970
okay.

857
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,650
Like scheme to get everybody,

858
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,980
like how insane is this
country into baseball now,

859
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,530
I don't know if you guys remember,
but back in the early mid nineties,

860
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,850
it was really going downhill even
before the strike and all that.

861
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:50,050
Basically all you had was cal Ripkin
was going to break Lou Gehrig's record

862
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,670
record record record and um,

863
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:56,760
yeah,

864
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,840
he was like this throwback guy and he
was doing something that was really

865
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:05,040
respectable. W uh, you know,
it was a record that, okay,
how much, I can't even talk.

866
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,030
What the fuck is wrong with me?

867
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,870
It's like Lou Gehrig went back to an
era that was considered, you know,

868
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,060
a golden age during America as far
as hard work and World War II when

869
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:19,110
segregation and water fountains and
all that other fucked up shit that they

870
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:21,300
don't really see. You ever noticed
that when they go back in time,

871
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,160
you know when they talk
about the golden years, they,

872
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:26,070
they or they talk about racism.

873
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:29,840
They never tell those two stories
at the same time. You know, America,

874
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,330
we made all this, you know,
made steel, steel workers.

875
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,650
I don't know all this type of shit in
the American car and all that type of

876
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,470
stuff. But they always, and then if
they're going to tell the racism story,

877
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:40,560
they just tell that one separately,
you know? All right, you could,

878
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:45,240
you could beat your, your wife.
The rule of thumb, you know,

879
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,260
what was the rule of thumb?
You could, you could,

880
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,330
you could beat your wife with a stick
no bigger than your thumb. You know,

881
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,990
you can't tell me girls weren't looking
at guys. Thumbs on first dates back then,

882
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,400
those little five foot,

883
00:54:56,401 --> 00:55:01,401
six inches do with little fucking little
sausage fingers so that Jesus could I

884
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:04,620
take the beat down from this guy
and I don't think I could, you know,

885
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,330
but then again, the women back then,
it was like big milkmaids, you know,

886
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,243
they were all doughy.

887
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:11,670
Okay.

888
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,910
You ever see like the paintings from
way back in the day of like sexy women?

889
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,050
You know, they were raw.
They were definitely healthy.

890
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,380
So healthy fucking women. All right, I'm
getting off the track here. All right,

891
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:29,790
so let's get back to baseball. So you
fucking, so basically what they did was,

892
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,190
I think basketball and football
were overtaking him. I mean,

893
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:36,780
that's what I was watching. Bird
Magic, Jordan, Isaiah Thomas,

894
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:40,080
all those great teams, Dominique
Wilkins, all that stuff was going on.

895
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,810
Then in football,
I mean,

896
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:47,811
I went from the late seventies Roger
Staubach beaten the Denver Broncos.

897
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:50,940
That was the first Superbowl I watched.
And I went right through, you know,

898
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:55,260
the last two Terry Bradshaw's Steeler
championships into Joe Montana,

899
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:59,850
Dan Marino, John Elway, right
on through, right on, through,

900
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:01,440
right up til like,
uh,

901
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,260
I would say the end was maybe a

902
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,370
cowboys dynasty.

903
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,420
Okay.

904
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,970
That year with the fuck happened
when the 40 niners played the,

905
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:18,990
the chargers in the super
bowl. That's, that's when,

906
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:23,410
that's when the golden age ended.
That was a bad one. Um, anyways,

907
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,920
but whatever. So no one was fucking
watching baseball son. And they just want,

908
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:30,100
they want, they, they juiced up the
ball, they made the ballpark smaller,

909
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:34,300
and then they just look the other way as
these fucking roided out dudes came up

910
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:39,160
and hit like 80 home runs as a third
baseman and they all made a shit load of

911
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:43,380
money and now they're leaving the
players to hold the fucking bag. Uh,

912
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:47,260
I don't know. I think it's
bullshit. So because of that,

913
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,730
I actually,

914
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,730
I'm beginning to try to find a
different sport that I can watch in the

915
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:53,110
summertime. And, uh,

916
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,740
I went to the x games in Carson,

917
00:56:56,741 --> 00:57:01,540
California on Saturday and I watched
a little motorcross man. It was,

918
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:04,470
that was definitely, it was cool. But I,

919
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,930
I've never felt so old in my
life going down to that thing.

920
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:12,940
And I also did not fit in.
If you've never been to the x games,

921
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,530
a motorcross SORTA skateboard, all that
type of shit to describe the crowd.

922
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:22,960
It's Sorta if Travis Barker and dog,
the bounty hunter had children,

923
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,800
that's what the crowd would fucking live.
Somehow they had 30,000 children.

924
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:31,300
That's what the fucking crowd would look
like. It was very, uh, everybody there,

925
00:57:31,301 --> 00:57:35,890
it looked like they had at least
one felony, you know, and I'm dirty,

926
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:40,450
filthy, filthy, Skanky fucking women just,

927
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:44,950
you know, I, you know, it's, it's, it,
it's getting a tattoo. Is that out yet?

928
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,320
Is that it?
Has that gone the way of the bell bottom?

929
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:51,610
There is nothing more
skanky or then just fucking,

930
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:57,340
just tattoos on a woman. It's
just, you know, I don't know.

931
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:01,720
I remember there was a period where they
were kind of cute or whatever and then,

932
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:06,100
I dunno, it jumped the shark when
whoever coined the term the tramp stamp.

933
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,470
And if you live under a fucking log,

934
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:12,160
that's basically the tattoo when the
small of a woman's back that just really

935
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:16,810
just says that, you know, I fucked
a lot of guys in my sorority.

936
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,510
That's another major red flag.

937
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:23,650
When you see a girl who has like a
sorority tattoo down around her ankle that

938
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:27,850
yeah. Um, I dunno, I'm not
saying don't marry her,

939
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:32,290
I'm just saying don't go to any of her
high school or college reunions because

940
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:35,620
there's going to be a lot of guys going
up shaking your hand with that look on

941
00:58:35,621 --> 00:58:36,454
their face.

942
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,500
Like does this guy know that me and my
buddy fucking double teamed his fucking

943
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:46,270
wife, the mother of his children and
I know a lot of females right now.

944
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,150
What you saying right now? That's the
double Sandra. That's as I was saying,

945
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,810
how can we as a come a guy can go out and
blah, blah blah. And if a woman does it,

946
00:58:52,811 --> 00:58:56,800
she's a whore. I'll tell you why.
This is actually a bit for my act.

947
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,900
I'm going to burn in my podcast.
I'll tell you why.

948
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,170
Because for a woman to
get laid is absolutely,

949
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:06,390
there's no fucking skill involved.
All right.

950
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:09,940
You getting laid is like me trying to
get a fat kid eat ice cream. You know,

951
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,200
it's really, there's not a
lot of, you know, I guess,

952
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,680
see what it is is a guy, his men
have to make women want to fuck us.

953
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:24,410
We have come up, we have to
dazzle. We got to put on a show.

954
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:28,910
We got to come up with some
sort of fucking angle to
get someone of the opposite

955
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:33,650
sex to touch us. You guys can, you can
just fucking lay down in a pool table.

956
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:36,770
You could bang everybody fucking bar.
There's no skill.

957
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,310
It's gluttonous. That's
what it is. It's gluttonous.

958
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,530
It's like watching a fat guy eat
ice cream in public and listen

959
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,210
[inaudible] nobody gives a shit.

960
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:49,610
But when I do do a Google
would've figured fuck

961
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,480
because you're a fat fuck.
That's why.

962
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,890
So getting back to the woman thing,
no respect,

963
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,660
no respect for your numbers.
Because you have a vagina.

964
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,650
All right. There we
go. Jesus Christ. Bill,

965
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,050
you went a long way on that one.
Eric.

966
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,700
We're 20 minutes in and I don't think
I've ever felt more ignorant. Um,

967
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:17,530
all right, continuing on. Here's
something that I wanted to, uh,

968
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,720
and I just realized the record
levels are kind of high here.

969
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:23,800
I hope I'm not my screaming
into this thing. Um, anyways,

970
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:27,460
whenever it gives a fuck, uh, this is
what you get. This is what you get.

971
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:32,380
What did they want to say
this week? Oh, I know.

972
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:36,370
This is something I would like,
if anybody out there,

973
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:41,371
does anybody out there have a VHS
copy of the Superbowl with the rams?

974
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:44,980
Beat the titans?
I've never seen that.

975
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,320
Superbowl and it bugs me.

976
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,970
It's the only Superbowl
since 1978 Broncos,

977
01:00:51,971 --> 01:00:55,240
cowboys. It's the only one that I
missed. And when I say I missed it,

978
01:00:55,241 --> 01:00:59,440
I missed the whole fucking thing.
Um,

979
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,880
and why was that?

980
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:06,020
I was dating some girl
and she wasn't into it.

981
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,270
Are you seeing my dog here?
Just go.

982
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,460
Sometimes I feel like I'm telling a story
and she's actually board. Um, anyway,

983
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:19,450
she wasn't into it and uh,
yeah,

984
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,890
so I ended up fucking hanging out with
her and stead. Wow. Was that embarrassing?

985
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,680
And an end up being course ended up being
one of the greatest Superbowls fucking

986
01:01:26,681 --> 01:01:29,740
ever and I've never seen it.
So if anybody has a copy of it,

987
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:34,390
please can you make me a copy?
Send me an email and send it my way.

988
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:34,901
I'll trade you.

989
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:39,580
I'll trade you a fucking
DVD for a VHS copy of that.

990
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:45,490
Um, all right. There we go. That was,
it was a really fucking long way to go.

991
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,530
All right, let's throw it to
get this thing back on track.

992
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,360
She can tell you can't you guys always
tell when I'm searching on my computer

993
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:54,460
and my sentences become more
choppy? All right. Hey, Bill. Uh,

994
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:58,810
you talked about inadvertent racism on
your July 27th podcasts and I see what

995
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:00,190
you're saying.
Uh,

996
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,240
simply recognizing that certain dialects
can be found in whites, blacks, Asians,

997
01:02:04,241 --> 01:02:05,890
et Cetera,
isn't really racist.

998
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:10,540
But the woman who emailed you about
shiny suits on Conan called you working

999
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,580
class or blue collar or some shit,

1000
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:16,860
presumably based on your Boston accent
and you seem to take offense to it.

1001
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,800
Just thought you'd want to know.
Uh,

1002
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:23,160
you're talking out of two sides
of your mouse here, miles here.

1003
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,580
And I am emailed her back and told her
that basically my entire act and the

1004
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:31,200
podcast are based on talking
out of both sides of my mouth.

1005
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,500
So I found that email hilarious.
But my point,

1006
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,910
and I'm not going to stop blaming people
for not getting my point because I

1007
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:42,990
understand how my complete inability
to present my points. Clearly.

1008
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,600
My point is that,
you know,

1009
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,210
each race does have an accent.

1010
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,730
Okay.

1011
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:56,690
So if you were to say that sounds
sounded like an Asian dude. Oh,

1012
01:02:56,691 --> 01:03:00,020
that sounded like a black dude.
It's not racist.

1013
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,260
You know,
it isn't,

1014
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,790
I still can't fucking explain this
without sounding like a dick. I look if,

1015
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:15,510
if, if some, if you were talking to some
guy on the phone and he's like, oh, hello,

1016
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,860
I be over there. Very, very
sure. And again, it comes
over and it was a black guy,

1017
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,200
wouldn't you be in the back? He
had like Jesus Christ, this guy,

1018
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:24,240
he sounded like like a fucking Asian dude.

1019
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:27,240
Now I'm not saying that all
Asian guys sound like that,

1020
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:28,860
but if somebody sounds like that,

1021
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,910
they are going to sound like they're Asian
and I'm also not a master of dialects,

1022
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:37,350
so I am going to be doing an
exaggerated version of your people.

1023
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:42,690
That's it. The same way def
jam comic go on TV and imitate.

1024
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:47,610
White Guy's gone. Oh Gee, I got
to go do my taxes. Holy Heck Gee.

1025
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:50,070
Willikers Jimmy, do you
have any cricket? I mean,

1026
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,350
nobody knows anyone who talks like that,

1027
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:56,430
but you know what this say plus it's
comedy. It's a fucking joke, right?

1028
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:01,350
That's all I'm saying. Okay, so
way back in the day, the Oj trial,

1029
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,950
when a neighbor heard a voice and
it said is sounded like a black guy,

1030
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:07,710
and they tried to sit there
and make that unbelievable,

1031
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:11,580
the most racist thing
ever. It wasn't, you know,

1032
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,290
believe in an like,
let's look at gay guys.

1033
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,510
One of the most fascinating accents ever.

1034
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,340
Here's another bit I used to do on my act.

1035
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,840
How gay guys come from all over
the country, all over the world.

1036
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,630
Let's just stick with this country.
They come from all 50 states,

1037
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,080
yet there is a gay accent.

1038
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:38,080
Hi, how are you doing? Yes, Jesus, right?

1039
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:42,520
Hacky, absolutely. But a
hundred percent not true.

1040
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,230
You can't say that.

1041
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:47,710
And that fascinates me because I think
if you're a gay guy from down south,

1042
01:04:47,711 --> 01:04:51,370
you should be like, hey buddy, I know
and I want to suck your fucking Dick.

1043
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:54,550
What do you think about that? You
really got a nice bump there, buddy.

1044
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,500
You know what I mean? Ah. It gives a fuck.

1045
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:04,330
I'm so sick of trying to explain my
uninformed fucking views. Whatever.

1046
01:05:04,331 --> 01:05:08,890
It's a podcast. Don't take it seriously.
Some people take it seriously. Yeah,

1047
01:05:08,891 --> 01:05:11,410
it gives a shit. Yeah. Just get
to no, they take it seriously.

1048
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:14,490
Then it gives me something to read. So
please, for the love of God, keep uh,

1049
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:19,030
keep taking this shit
seriously. Um, all right,

1050
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,370
here's another one for you.

1051
01:05:21,371 --> 01:05:25,030
We're going to be dealing a lot with
racist week evidently. Here's a very, uh,

1052
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:28,030
he's a very, some of these emails,
they're getting a little serious here.

1053
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:29,870
Here's one for you. Hey Bill, I'm an,

1054
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:34,890
I'm an 18 age old black man.
You know,

1055
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:36,280
do you guys proof read these things?

1056
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:41,380
And I've always wanted to
interracially date since middle school.

1057
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,020
I'm sorry. Just had some
fucking weed checks. So

1058
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,220
that literally sounded like
I was getting choked up.

1059
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:52,730
I've always wanted the interracially
dates. It's middle school. Um,

1060
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:57,370
but there is one short five 11 guy
that is always there and a mess up.

1061
01:05:57,371 --> 01:06:02,140
Something good. My Dad, my dad is
what you would call a buzzkill.

1062
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,090
I'm a photographer for my school and
there was a girl that I've been friends

1063
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:09,400
with for awhile and uh,

1064
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:14,230
almost every halftime at
the football games we would
talk one time she said, hey,

1065
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,000
can I take a picture with you?

1066
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,090
I was not going to say no because
the more you please women,

1067
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,510
you went a little closer
to her pleasing you.

1068
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,440
Oh God. Is that hilarious?
That's how a young man thinks.

1069
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,020
That's a whole nother subject.
You know what,

1070
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,020
you actually want to be going in the
opposite direction a lot of the times.

1071
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:36,940
But if she's a nice girl, yes. Be
Nice to wear anyways. Um, so anyways,

1072
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:40,870
years she gets close to pleasing you.
But uh, as she climbed out of the stands,

1073
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,610
I was running through my,

1074
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:45,640
it was running through my head what my
old man would say because he makes me

1075
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:49,900
show him the photos to see my progress.
I guess as a photographer,

1076
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,831
um,

1077
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:55,210
we had someone snapped the photo of us
and when I got home and put the photos up

1078
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,070
for my old man,
I tried to skip it,

1079
01:06:57,071 --> 01:07:02,071
but he saw that I had to sit there for
an hour in 45 minutes and listen to how

1080
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:07,240
white people did US wrong for 400 years.
And if you, if you start liking them,

1081
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:11,560
it's because you want to be them.
Bill A,

1082
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,060
that's just the light version.

1083
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,230
A couple of weeks ago we were at our
family reunion and we were watching tiger

1084
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:20,260
woods. I said, the tiger
woods had a hot wife.

1085
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:27,280
I really wish you recorded all of this.
And my dad butted in and said, is she hot?

1086
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,190
Is she hot because she's white.
Bill,

1087
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:35,130
I tried to tell this shit head that I
love all women no matter what race. Um,

1088
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,990
one, no matter what the race is,
my old man flew off the handle.

1089
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:42,220
I had to sit for three hours and listen
to him rant about the same shit I've

1090
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:45,850
heard since I was 13. Stuff like,
you just hate black women, don't you?

1091
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,600
You just want mud kids,
don't you? Jesus Christ.

1092
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,040
If you do marry them,
you'll just be a dog to them.

1093
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:57,870
And I always know and I always
knew that that yellow Skinner,

1094
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,000
yours would go to your head.
Uh,

1095
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:05,470
I guess that's light skin.
It's like a whole nother fucking thing.

1096
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,590
Ah, high yella. Doesn't
that mean light skinned?

1097
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,020
Anybody out there of a African persuasion
that can explain that to white people?

1098
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:18,350
Red Boned and all that
shit. Um, anyways, uh,

1099
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:23,550
so whatever. More light skinned. So
thinks he's a cut above. Can't hang out.

1100
01:08:23,551 --> 01:08:24,500
So what does your dad,

1101
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,480
does your dad look like?
Keith Robinson. All right,

1102
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:36,710
that's for standup fans anyways. Uh, where
are we going? What am I going with this?

1103
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:41,710
I just lost my fucking plates.
Mud kids,

1104
01:08:41,711 --> 01:08:46,360
yellow skin. Jesus, one of them fucking
ugliest emails ever. Um, Bill, this is,

1105
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,230
uh, Bill, this is just

1106
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,550
I short on me. I don't know what you're
writing here. I'm six. One love Jennifer.

1107
01:08:56,551 --> 01:09:00,570
Love Hewitt,
Vanessa and Hughes Riana.

1108
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,260
Oh Jesus Christ.
What the fuck?

1109
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:08,760
And I always,

1110
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:13,650
and I always that that
Chris Brown would backfire.

1111
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,810
I always knew that that Chris Brown would
backfire and that Asian girls from the

1112
01:09:18,811 --> 01:09:22,650
beat and that age girl from the
beginning of true lies a girl is a girl.

1113
01:09:22,651 --> 01:09:26,790
And when you're, and when you are
hungry like a wolf, this kid hilarious.

1114
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,490
You do not want to settle for just one
kind of food. This guy basically. Yeah,

1115
01:09:32,491 --> 01:09:36,150
he's 18.
He wants to fuck on every continent.

1116
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:41,220
He wants to bang a girl from every
racist is total normal behavior. Bill,

1117
01:09:41,221 --> 01:09:42,420
I've hated my family.

1118
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,790
This is really become a doctor Phil here.
Bill,

1119
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:52,791
I have hated my family for fucking up my
life from birth with their divorce and

1120
01:09:53,461 --> 01:09:57,060
my mom died when I was 14. She us
iron man. I forgot about that part.

1121
01:09:57,061 --> 01:10:00,810
I would have been laughing here, but I
hated her like m and m hated his mom.

1122
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:06,660
I'm living with my dad now for now because
I'm about to head to college and that

1123
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:10,080
same girl is going to the same
college and she wants to hook up.

1124
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,980
Bill helped me find an easy
way to tell my dad the fuck off

1125
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:18,950
while do, I dunno if you've
been listening to my podcast,

1126
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:23,951
but do you really think I'm qualified
on any level to address the shit that's

1127
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,190
going on here?
Do this is like,

1128
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,310
this is like the perfect storm of stuff.
All right. All right. The first of all,

1129
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:37,311
the mistake your dad's making
is by ranting and raving
at you for an hour and 45

1130
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:41,700
minutes about what he doesn't want you
to do is the quickest way to make you run

1131
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:46,180
out and go do it. All
right. And from what I,

1132
01:10:46,181 --> 01:10:51,180
I've my experience as a kid,
obviously I don't have any kids and uh,

1133
01:10:51,181 --> 01:10:54,450
yeah, he should be able to
date whoever you want to date.

1134
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,340
I will say this, you're
18, don't get a girlfriend.

1135
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:04,300
All right? Stay single. Get out
there, figure out what you want.

1136
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:08,470
And as you're going around fucking the,
uh,

1137
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,970
entire rainbow of color out there,
be making a mental list.

1138
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:17,250
What you're looking for in somebody to,
uh,

1139
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:21,930
to settle down with. This is
the shit that, this is all
the shit that I didn't do

1140
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,350
is I rudderlessly just bounced
from one fucking chick to another.

1141
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:29,963
Um,

1142
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,300
okay.

1143
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,910
Nice way to tell you I, and easy
way to tell you dad to fuck off. Uh,

1144
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:39,770
you know what, why don't you try agreeing
with them? You know, when he goes,

1145
01:11:39,771 --> 01:11:42,170
yeah, I knew that yellow skin
would go to your head and be like,

1146
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:45,530
you're absolutely right. Data. I can't
even believe that I'm talking to you.

1147
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,780
In fact,
when we walk in public,

1148
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:51,110
is there any way that you could kind of
walk like 40 feet behind me so people

1149
01:11:51,111 --> 01:11:53,210
don't know that we're together?
You can, I don't mean,

1150
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:55,730
I don't know if your dad gets physical
and you starts fucking slapping you

1151
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,910
around like some lifetime movie. But,
uh, I've used this technique on, uh,

1152
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,840
a number of people after a while,
when you just get sick,

1153
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:07,740
you have to get somebody, they just
get, they just get, I dunno, they,

1154
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:08,603
they get,

1155
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:12,920
they get pissed cause they know you're
going to go out and possibly enjoy life

1156
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:17,660
more than they have. You know,
like I had a couple people,

1157
01:12:17,661 --> 01:12:21,440
uh, you know, when I moved down in New
York, I had friends given me shit like a,

1158
01:12:21,441 --> 01:12:24,260
you know, hey I got a new apartment
here but it's not New York City.

1159
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,430
And then I'd always find myself having
to knock living in New York City,

1160
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:33,410
like tone down my shit so they could feel
better about where the hell they lived.

1161
01:12:33,411 --> 01:12:35,990
And after a while I was just like, yeah,
I just start agreeing with them. Yeah,

1162
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:39,830
you're right. It isn't New York. New York
is the shit. It's the Paris of America.

1163
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:43,760
You know. It's too bad you
don't live there cause it's
fucking awesome. You just,

1164
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:44,670
you just agree with them.

1165
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:48,380
Oh you think you're the shit now could
you live down there? Yeah, I know.

1166
01:12:48,381 --> 01:12:49,280
It's unbelievable.

1167
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:54,350
My Ego is completely out of
control and you know, just,

1168
01:12:54,351 --> 01:12:55,184
I dunno.

1169
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:56,350
Okay.

1170
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,910
I don't know what to tell
you, dude. That that's,

1171
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,770
that's a really tough one
because no matter what,

1172
01:12:59,771 --> 01:13:03,250
you're always going to want
your dad's approval. Um,

1173
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:09,810
but just watch out for the anger that's
building up in you and just make sure

1174
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:15,940
that you don't start making spiteful
decisions towards him about your own life

1175
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:18,910
and the path you want to go down because,
uh,

1176
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:23,460
then you get, you're going to end up in
some miserable play. Yeah, you'll start,

1177
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:25,830
you'll literally start dating
someone just to piss him off.

1178
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm not saying you might, you'll do.
Maybe you will. I don't know. Um,

1179
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:35,330
I dunno dude, that there's, there's a
lot of shit going on there, but you know,

1180
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:38,810
I'm glad you brought all of this stuff
up because you remember that bit I was

1181
01:13:38,811 --> 01:13:40,220
doing that.
Get out of the pool,

1182
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:45,140
make it fun of those movies where
they show like racist white people.

1183
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:49,310
And this right here is
the point of that bit,

1184
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:54,770
which is they've made 80 million
movies about white people being racist.

1185
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:59,330
And I was laughing that that
started off with slavery.

1186
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,800
One of the most horrific things that's
ever happened in this country other than

1187
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:06,140
I guess the straight up
genocide of the the Indians,

1188
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:10,550
native Americans are the fuck he supposed
to call them and there's been so many

1189
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:13,810
movies made about that shit that now
it's all the way down to like swimming.

1190
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:17,460
That was the joke and I know I like,

1191
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,030
I stopped doing the jokes
wants they're on TV,

1192
01:14:19,031 --> 01:14:23,440
but I know I said at some point are
white people the only ones who think evil

1193
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:25,470
shit.
I came,

1194
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:29,140
remember how the joke when isn't there
some Mexican guy making fun of an Asian

1195
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:31,960
dude or whatever.
This is what the fuck I'm talking about.

1196
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,870
This is what I'm talking about and it
just gets annoying after a while that you

1197
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:41,260
take a movie like guess who's
coming to dinner when it's,

1198
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:45,460
when it's the white girl bringing home
the Black Guy, the original movie.

1199
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:50,670
Then it's this drama and it's this really
serious fucking thing that needs to be

1200
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:55,030
addressed. But when you flip it and it's
a black girl, bring an Ashton Kutcher,

1201
01:14:55,510 --> 01:15:00,250
all of a sudden now, now it's a
comedy. And, and what's his face?

1202
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:05,800
The Dad there, you know, not wanting
her to bring home a white dude.

1203
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:10,690
Now it's fucking hilarious.
I mean, I guess I get it
because of a, on some level,

1204
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,330
because it's not like black
people and slave white people.

1205
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,360
So though the rules are fucking different,
but you know what I'm saying?

1206
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:18,730
Something I'm just saying, I'm just, I
don't fucking know. I don't want him,

1207
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:20,380
you know what I mean? You
know what the fuck. I mean,

1208
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:22,990
I'm just saying it's like I
got it. I understand. You know,

1209
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:27,370
there's 80,000 fucking movies
about white people being racist.

1210
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:32,100
How about we switch it up every once in
awhile and make a movie about Mexicans

1211
01:15:32,101 --> 01:15:36,040
stabbing Puerto Ricans after a boxing
match. How about that? You know,

1212
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:39,580
we ever see that like whenever a Mexican
fire fights a Puerto Rican fighter,

1213
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:43,630
guaranteed somebody getting stabbed
in the Bronx, that's all I'm saying.

1214
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,360
I mean, maybe that's not a movie. Maybe
that's more of a, uh, a short, but a,

1215
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:51,700
you know, he could have the
hackey characters in there. Right.

1216
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:56,800
And what the fuck I'm talking about.
Anyways, that's a move on here.

1217
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:01,570
Let's recommend, so my youtube
videos for the week. Um, here we go.

1218
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:04,480
Here's ones that you guys can search.
I don't have time to fucking look.

1219
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,620
I watch all of these,

1220
01:16:05,621 --> 01:16:09,370
but this is just becoming way too big
to try to watch all of these and try to

1221
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:14,040
come up with the greatest one ever. My,
my, my youtube video of the year is tough.

1222
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:17,290
A tough talk in college,
Girl. That one. Um,

1223
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,510
here's some other ones that
people are also suggesting.

1224
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:22,130
If you're at work and you
don't want to work, um,

1225
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:26,920
go on Youtube and search killer dwarf,
midget Muay Thai fighting.

1226
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:31,270
And if you don't wanna watch that and
you want something a little cuter,

1227
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:36,130
watch a search, Charlie bit my finger,
which literally has 90 million views.

1228
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:37,240
So if you haven't seen it yet,

1229
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,630
you're one of those people who
not only does not watch TV,

1230
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:45,460
but you don't have a computer. Uh,
this is a weird one. Dog Malfunction.

1231
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,750
I went to show that to my
girlfriend and she was just like,

1232
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:54,310
is he going to shit himself? Like shit
all over the place? It's like, no,

1233
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,930
it's something different.
A guy with gun confront skateboarder,

1234
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:02,080
I can't remember if I told you that
one last week, but that's a decent,

1235
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:05,410
that's actually a really good one.
And a here's a really good one.

1236
01:17:05,411 --> 01:17:07,330
A boxer beats up two guys.

1237
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:12,331
I love this video because the box or
dude is basically what every man wants to

1238
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:14,060
be in this video.

1239
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:18,800
Basically two guys do something fucked
up to his girl and without even without

1240
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:23,120
even a moment's hesitation, he fucks
up these two. This guy is like,

1241
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:27,140
you know who all those guys and like
the action movies pretend to be.

1242
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:31,070
This guy's the guy in
real life. Um, all right,

1243
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,770
well getting up here in time,
aren't we? 37 minutes. Okay,

1244
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:35,210
we got to start winding down here.

1245
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,933
MMM.

1246
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,020
All right. Here's something
sneaky corporations. All right.

1247
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,430
And I know I keep saying that.

1248
01:17:43,431 --> 01:17:48,080
I'm done trying to tell people not to
use those automated machines at the

1249
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:51,560
grocery store. I had another guy
telling me how much easy there. Oh yeah.

1250
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,380
I'm in and out of there in two minutes.
Really?

1251
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,770
You scan a week's worth of groceries
and you have them in a bag and you're in

1252
01:17:57,771 --> 01:18:00,740
and out of there in two minutes.
Oh yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure it's,

1253
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:03,680
I'm sure it's way easier than having
someone who's trained to do it.

1254
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:06,620
Do it for you and stick it in a bag
as you sit there rubbing your balls,

1255
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:10,750
doing nothing. I'm sure
it's way fucking easier. Ah,

1256
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:15,770
idiots. Idiots who want to
work for free. Have Fun. Um,

1257
01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:19,130
anyways, there's another one
sneaky corporation thing. Um, Bill,

1258
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:20,750
I share your and Bubba, Bubba, bubba.

1259
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,313
MMM.

1260
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,860
Here's an article you should check out.

1261
01:18:24,861 --> 01:18:28,340
I'll sum up the basic idea of the
article. Essentially, here's one for you.

1262
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,640
Starbucks opened a coffee shop in Seattle
called 15th Avenue Coffee and tea.

1263
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:39,620
They have nothing blatant to
indicate that they are a Starbucks.

1264
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:43,880
They've gone out of their way to disguise
their company as an independent coffee

1265
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:48,710
shop. They even sent scouts to check
out independently owned coffee shop.

1266
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,410
I'm assuming to better emulate them.

1267
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:56,480
50th Avenue coffee and tea
will serve beers and wines.

1268
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,420
It will have cheese platters
and entertainment at night.

1269
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:04,370
I think this is a new direction that
corporations go into these days.

1270
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,970
They create new brands and new images
to trick people into supporting their

1271
01:19:07,971 --> 01:19:11,500
company.
And you can't tell who owns what anymore.

1272
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,470
So for overrated,
underrated, I say overrated.

1273
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:20,480
The 15th Avenue Coffee and tea,
Aka Starbucks and disguise.

1274
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,210
How fucking creepy is that?
You know what?

1275
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:25,430
I Bet I've gone in and spent
money to place like that.

1276
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:27,520
I was go out there and
as long as it's not a,

1277
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:34,100
as long as it's not like a, uh,
a chain name that I recognize.

1278
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:35,750
Okay,

1279
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:40,330
I know some of this shit, like I know
like, uh, but this is a chain anyway,

1280
01:19:40,331 --> 01:19:44,420
so I wouldn't eat there with see that
chipolte Lei is actually owned by

1281
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:48,440
Mcdonald's. But anyways, they,
I fucking hate your post lay.

1282
01:19:48,441 --> 01:19:49,500
I don't know if you've noticed,
you haven't noticed.

1283
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:52,880
They always open right across the street
from like a really good a Mexican food

1284
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:56,990
restaurant. That's how they didn't just
fucking put those guys out of business.

1285
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:59,630
I tried to, I tried to stay away from
those, but I'll have to, I'll have to,

1286
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:03,320
I gotta be honest with you. I didn't
even read the article. You know,

1287
01:20:03,321 --> 01:20:03,891
that's what I do.

1288
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:06,620
Somebody just tells something that's all
you gotta do is just tell me something

1289
01:20:06,621 --> 01:20:08,970
and it becomes here because
I'm not going to look at it.

1290
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:13,140
I'm on bullshit and I'm actually going
to read it. All right. Um, horror films.

1291
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,470
Bill, after hearing your story
about the movie curtains,

1292
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:19,530
it brought back memories of a
movie that I saw when I was young.

1293
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,680
It was called the unseen.
All right.

1294
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:25,230
You guys get to hear the description
of this movie and just to let you know,

1295
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:30,150
he ruins the ending, but I still have
to see this. This is a fucking classic.

1296
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:30,781
He goes,

1297
01:20:30,781 --> 01:20:34,590
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
back in the 80s but being six and seeing

1298
01:20:34,591 --> 01:20:37,260
this one did a number on me for a while.
Pretty much.

1299
01:20:37,261 --> 01:20:40,470
The movie is about three chicks
who can't find a hotel to stay in.

1300
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:44,310
So they end up at a bed and
breakfast type place. Jesus,

1301
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:48,260
there's an original beginning to a
horror movie. Um, so there's some quote,

1302
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:52,560
there's some quote unquote thing that
attacks these people that stay there.

1303
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:56,490
The part that screwed me up is
that the thing that attack them,

1304
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:02,040
um, would attack through the oversized
air vents in the walls and floors,

1305
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,850
pulling them through and killing them.
So after watching it,

1306
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:08,790
I was terrified to go into the bathroom
because all of our bathrooms in our

1307
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:13,260
house had Vince right behind me.
As I took a piss for the longest time,

1308
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:16,860
I would have to use the bathroom with
the door open in case something would try

1309
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:21,450
to get me. I look back at it now and think
to myself, what a pussy I was. But Hey,

1310
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,480
I guess that's why six year olds
shouldn't watch horror flicks.

1311
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:28,410
Here's to four months of pissing
with the door open. All right,

1312
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:31,170
now here's the spoiler
alert. Everybody. Here's a,

1313
01:21:31,171 --> 01:21:34,550
if you're going to rent curtains,
you don't want to hear, uh,

1314
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:40,110
you don't want to hear this last part.
Um, and of course, okay. By the way,

1315
01:21:40,111 --> 01:21:43,440
the thing in the movie turns
out to be a retarded kid,

1316
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:48,420
that the parents kept locked in the
basement and all he wanted to do was play

1317
01:21:48,421 --> 01:21:53,040
with people.
Apparently his play was a little rough.

1318
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:02,180
How many of those horror
movies are basically,

1319
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:07,370
it always comes down to some, somebody
being shunned as a kid, I swear to God.

1320
01:22:07,371 --> 01:22:08,240
I think most of those,

1321
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:13,490
most of those horror movies have something
to do with the person who wrote the

1322
01:22:13,491 --> 01:22:17,150
movie, their childhood. A lot of
writers, they're fucking nerds.

1323
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,720
So they had these awful childhoods
and then they had like these fucking

1324
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:22,250
fantasies of what the,

1325
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:27,251
what they wanted to do to people and then
they just move it a little to the left

1326
01:22:27,411 --> 01:22:29,090
and they turn it rather from,
you know,

1327
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:31,250
just some kid having
some murderous fantasy.

1328
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:32,880
They turned it into a fucking monster star

1329
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:38,010
and then you got to goddamn movie.
Does that make any sense?

1330
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:40,680
That I just say that retarded
people are writing movie scripts.

1331
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,540
I think I did. I think that's how
the math works out on that one. Wow.

1332
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,790
Let's blow by that. All right,
bill question. I love your calm.

1333
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:49,920
This is the questions for
the week and then I'm done.

1334
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,050
Let me hype what I got going on this week.

1335
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,360
I'm going to be at the comedy
connection in Providence,

1336
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:58,020
Rhode Island on Friday
and Saturday of this week.

1337
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,690
That would be a,
what's today?

1338
01:23:00,691 --> 01:23:05,590
The third Friday is four days a
seventh and the eighth. All right.

1339
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:09,610
I'm going to be back there doing two shows
both nights. He can go on my website,

1340
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:14,900
[inaudible] dot com and just click
to the link. Please show up and uh,

1341
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,810
watch my new hour of hilarity.

1342
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:21,400
And the following week I'm going to
be at the punchline in, um, Atlanta,

1343
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:25,360
Georgia and I believe I have the dates
wrong. I'm going to be there Thursday,

1344
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,310
Friday, Saturday. I have it down
as Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1345
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:31,030
I have to change that and hopefully
by the time you listen to this I have,

1346
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:34,270
um, and other than that, I'm
going to be in Stockholm,

1347
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:39,271
Sweden at the end of the month and that's
going to be end of my summer and I'll

1348
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,470
be enjoying being in Stockholm,

1349
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:45,670
Sweden cause I'm not going to be missing
baseball. I will not because I am done.

1350
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,000
I'm fucking, I don't know
if I'm done forever, but I'm
taking a break. I've had it.

1351
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:50,290
I don't give a fuck anymore.

1352
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:51,690
Okay.

1353
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:54,510
I think what that guy in the white
sox said, the coach there was true.

1354
01:23:54,511 --> 01:23:58,590
He's just like for the love of God,
just release, just released the list,

1355
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:01,920
you know, so you can just
get on with it. You know,

1356
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,180
I don't understand about these guys.

1357
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:07,530
They get on roids and then they get off
roids and now they're clean and they're

1358
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:11,430
still the same size that they
were. The only guy, like I said,

1359
01:24:11,431 --> 01:24:14,610
the only tie guy ever saw gets
smaller was uh, Jason Giambi.

1360
01:24:14,611 --> 01:24:19,110
That's the only fucking guy. All the
rest of them, they look the exact same.

1361
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:23,040
So I don't know. I have. Fuck it.

1362
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:27,970
I feel like a dope getting all excited
the last 10 years, boy. Oh boy.

1363
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:32,220
Did you see that? A home run all
boil pool. It's all bullshit.

1364
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:34,980
All right. Questions. Hey Bill. Uh,

1365
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:38,670
let the comedy podcasts I read recently
started working at a retail store.

1366
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:43,740
And during the hiring process they gave
me a choice between direct deposit or a

1367
01:24:43,741 --> 01:24:46,260
debit card that they provided.

1368
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:47,650
Yeah.

1369
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,930
Basically saying,
um,

1370
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,900
I wouldn't be getting a
physical check every other week.

1371
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:57,130
I asked why they did that and the lady
said, that's just the way we, they do it.

1372
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:59,860
Isn't that how you, isn't that the
response you always get from corporations?

1373
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:01,260
Yeah.

1374
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,800
You know what, why, why do I have to do
it? Oh, that's stay just they make us.

1375
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:08,460
That's just, that's just
how they do it. So anyways,

1376
01:25:08,461 --> 01:25:10,680
like every other person
I said, oh, all right.

1377
01:25:10,681 --> 01:25:13,620
And even though that's the way they do it,
didn't answer my question.

1378
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:15,600
So I guess my question to you is,

1379
01:25:15,601 --> 01:25:19,170
do you think that this is just a way for
paper money to be turned into numbers

1380
01:25:19,171 --> 01:25:20,004
on a computer?

1381
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:24,390
Is it really easier to have my money
directly deposited in a bank or say,

1382
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:29,040
or on some debit card rather than me going
to the bank and physically getting my

1383
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:32,910
money. If I may use your
reference about it, um,

1384
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,710
about if your iPod crashes
and all your songs are gone,

1385
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:41,730
but if you physically had
the cds back to back it up,

1386
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,290
then you will be okay.

1387
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:44,780
Okay.

1388
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:47,390
Uh, did any of that makes sense?
Not The way I'm reading it. No,

1389
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:51,140
I'm just saying I would rather get the
physical checks than to be doing things

1390
01:25:51,141 --> 01:25:55,700
online, but I guess that's just the way
they do it. Yeah, dude, that's brutal.

1391
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,380
That's fucking brutal.

1392
01:25:57,381 --> 01:25:59,960
See what they're doing is they're
forcing the herd into a direction.

1393
01:25:59,961 --> 01:26:02,870
So when guys like me don't play
ball with that, just out of,

1394
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,590
I'm going to have to play ball the
same way with those automated machines.

1395
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:09,410
Everyone's going to start using them
and then there aren't going to be any

1396
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:13,320
cashier people and then I'm
going to be fucked, you know?

1397
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,700
So, um, yeah, that,

1398
01:26:17,701 --> 01:26:20,160
that's what they're doing
is they're phasing out cash.

1399
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:26,180
So anybody who has any cash hidden in
their walls are in their bed or any of

1400
01:26:26,551 --> 01:26:29,040
that type of shit.
Um,

1401
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:33,060
that stuff eventually will become obsolete
unless you take it out and then you

1402
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:35,850
give it to them and then there'll be like,
well, where the fuck did you get this?

1403
01:26:35,851 --> 01:26:39,220
And then they'll tax the shit out of you.
Um,

1404
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,680
and I know a lot of you right now going,
well,

1405
01:26:40,681 --> 01:26:43,860
you should have fucking reported the
money anyways and all this type of stuff.

1406
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:48,210
And if you really read about the Federal
Reserve and all and how fucking corrupt

1407
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:50,440
it is there,

1408
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,910
there's a link on the Internet right now
where it's where some guy used to work

1409
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:57,300
at the Federal Reserve just called
it a Ponzi scheme on television,

1410
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:01,320
on CNBC said it's basically
nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.

1411
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:05,900
I don't know if the guy, actually, let me,
let me get, let me get that link for you.

1412
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:11,660
Um, if you really want to
check this shit out, go, uh,

1413
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,600
it's called the daily bail.com

1414
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:19,690
and all this is, this is
when they have the, oh,

1415
01:27:19,691 --> 01:27:22,990
that's a woman testifying
for the Federal Reserve.

1416
01:27:22,991 --> 01:27:26,460
When they've asked if they have
any, you know, they put it,

1417
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:29,950
give them $1 trillion and there was no
record of where it went or who took it.

1418
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:35,640
And they just keep talking in circles
while we have a person that is looking

1419
01:27:37,391 --> 01:27:38,224
into that.

1420
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:42,490
But right now I can't give
you an answer on that.

1421
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,530
Like that's the way they
answered everything.

1422
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:49,810
Do the whole thing's a fucking scam. It's
all a scam. What they're trying to do is

1423
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:56,360
they're trying to phase out cash.
So there'll be no way for you to ever,

1424
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,460
like everything you do
will have to be reported.

1425
01:27:58,461 --> 01:28:01,550
They'll know where all your money is
at all times. And then not only that,

1426
01:28:01,551 --> 01:28:05,850
they're going to have all your money
at all times. It's, I don't know how,

1427
01:28:05,851 --> 01:28:07,490
how do you know how to,
it's so fucking huge.

1428
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,560
I never know where to begin
to try to explain what,

1429
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,270
how little that I understand
about this is just, just,

1430
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:17,690
let me put it this way. The amount of
money that you've made in your life,

1431
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:20,480
how much of it have you
actually held in your hand?

1432
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:26,160
How many times have you gone out and you
work all week and then they just typed

1433
01:28:26,161 --> 01:28:28,700
some numbers on a piece
of paper and then you,

1434
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,590
you know the check and then you just
go down to the bank and then it just

1435
01:28:31,591 --> 01:28:35,690
becomes this number on a computer screen.
The amount of number, that's money,

1436
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,780
money that's out there versus the amount
of money that's actually printed first.

1437
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:43,770
The amount of money that actually has
gold behind it, it's fucking terrifying.

1438
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,050
It's a,

1439
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:51,750
it's the biggest fucking scam

1440
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:55,860
I think in the history of the world.

1441
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:57,140
Okay.

1442
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:00,170
It's the biggest fucking scam.
And when you get a mortgage like I have,

1443
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,100
and I'm sitting here trying
to figure out how to get

1444
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,050
out from underneath that debt and meet,

1445
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:08,820
realizing that me getting
out from underneath the debt
will actually cost me an

1446
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:10,980
extra four grand a year in taxes.

1447
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,280
Okay.

1448
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,130
If not even more, I think all the way I
worked it out. Yeah. It would cost me,

1449
01:29:16,131 --> 01:29:18,890
I pay about 24 grand a year in
taxes or something like that,

1450
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:25,650
and we go up to 28 I can't even remember.
I tried to work all of this shit out,

1451
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:28,950
but basically my best move was

1452
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,573
to just

1453
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:33,420
take 30 years to pay off a mortgage.

1454
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:34,510
Okay.

1455
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:38,080
To basically pay 200%
interest on six figures.

1456
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:41,380
I Dunno. You know what?
I can't even explain it.

1457
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:46,000
I'm probably sounded like a
moron right now. Just, just,

1458
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:50,470
I dunno. Read up on this
stuff. It's fuck. It's brutal.

1459
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,350
It's just fucking brutal. I
can't even, I don't know. I'm,

1460
01:29:53,351 --> 01:29:54,580
I'm coming off like a moron.

1461
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:57,640
I wasn't prepared to discuss this
and what little I knew about it.

1462
01:29:57,641 --> 01:29:59,820
Now you guys are probably gone.
This guy's just a fucking idiot.

1463
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:02,210
Okay.

1464
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:04,490
I don't know where the fuck do
you begin to try to explain this?

1465
01:30:04,491 --> 01:30:07,220
It's actually funny.
Like I'm really stammering right now.

1466
01:30:07,221 --> 01:30:10,070
I feel like I committed a murder right
now and I'm trying to say that I didn't

1467
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:13,190
and I didn't take time to fucking
come up with a, with an alibi.

1468
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,230
Okay.

1469
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:18,150
Um, I don't think that you should
put your money in the bank is basic.

1470
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:22,630
What I'm saying,
you know these guys fucking,

1471
01:30:22,631 --> 01:30:25,420
you'd take your money.
Okay. He put it in a bank.

1472
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:26,730
Okay.

1473
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,390
All right.

1474
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:32,390
They give you like fucking 0.5% interest
on it and then they take your money and

1475
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:36,840
then they turn around and they loan it
back to you with everybody else's money

1476
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,450
at some ridiculous fucking interest rate.

1477
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,140
And then on top of that,

1478
01:30:43,141 --> 01:30:47,670
they come up with these fucking loans
that make homeless people qualified to get

1479
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:49,890
homes,
which drives the price,

1480
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,830
artificially drives the
prices of houses up.

1481
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:57,580
If it comes like Superbowl
tickets, everybody wants to
go. So now a fourth thing,

1482
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,710
something that's worth $400 face
value now becomes worth four grand.

1483
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,650
It's not fucking worth for grants.

1484
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:09,270
So then you go out and you pay like
a couple hundred grand more than your

1485
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:13,410
fucking places actually worth and
you're paying interest on it. And who?

1486
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:15,510
Who drove the price up?
The bank.

1487
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:18,570
And how does a bank
make money on interest?

1488
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:19,860
Okay,

1489
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:20,481
so they dig,

1490
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:24,140
just basically created loan so they
can make houses more fucking expenses.

1491
01:31:24,141 --> 01:31:28,320
So expensive so they can make even
more money. The whole thing was,

1492
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:31,080
was bullshit.
It was completely criminal

1493
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,310
actually. You know what? It wasn't
criminal. That was a great thing.

1494
01:31:33,311 --> 01:31:34,690
It was actually legal,
what they were doing.

1495
01:31:34,691 --> 01:31:36,220
That's how much fucking power they have.

1496
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:40,450
And then when the whole thing fucking
topples, they make us fucking pay for it.

1497
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:43,390
We pay for it and they
keep the fucking money.

1498
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,210
They're beyond fucking corrupt.
It's the most corrupt bullshit

1499
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,750
on the planet.
I think it's worse.

1500
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:58,110
It's worse than than anything that's
going on in the planet right now.

1501
01:31:58,111 --> 01:32:00,130
It's right up there with genocide.
What

1502
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,000
the fuck they're doing is
because basically they're
in slaving the entire planet

1503
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:08,500
and right now they rather you know it
or not. You are financially enslaved.

1504
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:12,570
You're fucking indentured, sir. I really
sound like a fucking crazy. I'm serious.

1505
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:12,751
You're,

1506
01:32:12,751 --> 01:32:17,500
you're fucking year and a dent might my
own guy who invest my money when I was

1507
01:32:17,501 --> 01:32:20,740
trying to figure out how to get out
of this bullshit, he said it to me.

1508
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:25,570
This is a guy who actually could probably
obviously and a much more intelligent

1509
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:28,300
way explain this fucking
game. He said, Bill, face it.

1510
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:32,720
We're all indentured
servants to the banks. Um,

1511
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,780
I dunno dude.
I Dunno.

1512
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:36,650
What the fuck happened back in
the day when you moved to town.

1513
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:41,420
We went from having a house raising party
to having a 30 year fucking mortgage.

1514
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,950
Will you pay 200% interest on the
fucking money that you were loaned?

1515
01:32:45,951 --> 01:32:49,310
And by the time you pay it off,
you in a fucking wheelchair?

1516
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:50,810
Yeah,

1517
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:53,600
there has to be a happy medium.
I don't want to live in a log cabin.

1518
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:55,460
I don't want to live in a cave. But, um,

1519
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:59,120
if you think that the
government is above the banks,

1520
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,530
you're out of your fucking mind.

1521
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:05,590
And a great example is when the president
tells bankers after they fucked up the

1522
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,920
economy not to take a bonus,
and they basically say, hey,

1523
01:33:09,921 --> 01:33:14,330
go fuck yourself with taking a bonus
anyways. And then he just says, oh, okay.

1524
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:19,200
I think that should basically tell you,
you know who the fuck is running stuff.

1525
01:33:19,201 --> 01:33:21,300
So I know that came off
as completely ignorant,

1526
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:26,580
but read up on it. Okay, I can't,
I'm just a fucking comedian.

1527
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:28,140
I really shouldn't get
into this type of shit.

1528
01:33:28,141 --> 01:33:31,740
But that fucking question
really set me off. It's a,

1529
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,360
I dunno, it's frightening.
It's frightening.

1530
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:37,770
It's why I'm trying to pay off
my apartment as quickly as I can.

1531
01:33:37,771 --> 01:33:39,780
I don't think I'm going to make
it because of the end of it.

1532
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:44,520
I want to have something of some sort of
fucking value that I can go out and get

1533
01:33:44,521 --> 01:33:46,020
a sandwich with.
You know,

1534
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:50,520
maybe I can rent out a part
of my apartment because I
don't think money is going

1535
01:33:50,521 --> 01:33:54,570
to be worth anything if they just keep
printing it. They're phasing the shit out.

1536
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:55,810
Okay.

1537
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:59,880
It's, it's bad. It's bad.
People don't do that.

1538
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:02,550
Don't get direct deposit.
Don't do that.

1539
01:34:02,551 --> 01:34:05,070
Don't do your fucking
banking on the Internet.

1540
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:12,140
It's the level of faith you,
you're, you're, you're an
idiot. If you're doing that,

1541
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:14,450
you think you're the only
guy looking at that shit.

1542
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:16,760
I'll tell you what pisses me off
with someone sent me an email said,

1543
01:34:16,761 --> 01:34:19,910
even if you don't do banking on,
on the Internet,

1544
01:34:19,911 --> 01:34:23,120
all your information is up
there anyways just in case.

1545
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:24,460
Yeah.

1546
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,500
Just in case you want to go online now,

1547
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:29,260
I don't think that they should have
the right to do it. It's my money.

1548
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:31,090
I should be the one who tells him,
listen,

1549
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:33,550
I don't want my information
out there like that,

1550
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,300
but they can do whatever the fuck
they wanted. It's just, it's all,

1551
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,990
it's not your money, everybody. It's
not your money. They give you money,

1552
01:34:39,991 --> 01:34:43,540
you and your job is to go out and get
into as much debt as you possibly can

1553
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:45,100
sustain.
And if you don't,

1554
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:48,940
then they just take it from you so you
can never become rich and they keep

1555
01:34:48,941 --> 01:34:51,640
getting fucking richer.
That's what the fuck is going on.

1556
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:54,310
And this has nothing to do
with Republican or Democrat.

1557
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:59,520
This just has to do with a select few
group of evil people at the fucking top

1558
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:02,720
who are running everything.
I know I sound like a motto,

1559
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:06,150
my fucking mind and I probably am.
Um,

1560
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:09,200
but I welcome the debate.

1561
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:14,270
Anybody who is an economics or whatever
who majored in that Shit and you want it,

1562
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,150
you want to email me and
you want to explain to me,

1563
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:18,910
okay?

1564
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:19,361
I mean,

1565
01:35:19,361 --> 01:35:23,080
am I wrong thinking that the Federal
Reserve is a private corporation that does

1566
01:35:23,081 --> 01:35:27,820
not have to answer to the u s government
that has never been audited. Am I wrong?

1567
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,200
Okay.

1568
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:32,710
Aren't they in charge? I know the
treasury physically prints the money.

1569
01:35:32,711 --> 01:35:33,521
Am I wrong?

1570
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:38,521
I'm just asking am I wrong when I say
that they are the ones that are in charge

1571
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:44,740
of how much gets printed and when and
that the u s government or the banks then

1572
01:35:44,741 --> 01:35:46,810
take that money and have
to pay interest on it.

1573
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:50,440
And that creates this debt that
we can never fucking get out of.

1574
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,960
And isn't that what happened over in
Europe and isn't that why they are now on

1575
01:35:54,961 --> 01:35:59,160
the fucking euro and are we
now moving towards the Amera?

1576
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,453
Huh?

1577
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:05,760
This is me just regurgitating
all my Wikipedia youtube shit.

1578
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:11,070
That even sounded dumb to me,
but I dunno. That's the general,

1579
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,200
you know what I mean?
Um,

1580
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,580
you know what I'm like right now
I'm a guy who just started watching,

1581
01:36:14,581 --> 01:36:17,610
like it'd be like me trying to
intelligently talk about the x games.

1582
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:21,140
Then when I went to the x games once
and I'm like, you do the backside.

1583
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:25,890
Fakey all right, whatever. Let's
plow ahead. Hey Bill, I love the,

1584
01:36:25,891 --> 01:36:29,970
uh, the podcast here.
Okay. Bill Hill. Bill,

1585
01:36:29,971 --> 01:36:33,990
have you ever been offered to do, to
be on the show, last comic standing,

1586
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:40,140
um, offered to be on it? No, I did. I
could audition for it, but I didn't.

1587
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:42,960
Um,
I just thought it was,

1588
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:46,680
I thought it was good for Comedians
at a certain level and I thought I was

1589
01:36:46,681 --> 01:36:50,370
beyond the level where it was good and I
would have just looked cheesy on there,

1590
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:53,250
you know what I mean?
Plus I to, I knew myself,

1591
01:36:53,251 --> 01:36:56,790
I wouldn't have done any
of the competitions. I just
would have been, well, no,

1592
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:57,720
I'm not fucking doing that.

1593
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:02,040
Just challenged me and I'll go up and
I'll do three minutes and if you beat me,

1594
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:04,980
then I don't have to live in a
house with seven other comedians,

1595
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:07,470
which would be kind of enjoyable.
In other words,

1596
01:37:07,471 --> 01:37:11,250
I wouldn't have been good on the show.
So now I never, uh, I never got offered,

1597
01:37:11,251 --> 01:37:15,780
but I, I could've auditioned and I didn't
think it was for me. All right, Bill. Hey,

1598
01:37:15,781 --> 01:37:19,230
love your comedy, uh, on the podcast.
Thank you. I have a question for you.

1599
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:23,370
I need your advice. My brother passed
away two weeks ago at 34 years old.

1600
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:27,330
All right. This is kind of a fucked
up one to end on, but I'm gonna um,

1601
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:30,300
needless to say, I'm crushed.
Sorry to hear that, man.

1602
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:34,710
That's really a brutal solve my
condolences. Um, here's the issue.

1603
01:37:34,711 --> 01:37:38,340
My inlaws haven't said anything to
me. No phone call, no cards, nothing.

1604
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:43,440
I'm devastated. You would think
that them being parents themselves,

1605
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:48,000
um, that they may care about me
since I am married to their daughter.

1606
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:52,590
Um, they will, they would have said
something. Um, they didn't say anything.

1607
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,930
I don't really want anything
to do with them now.

1608
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:58,470
I relationship was fine before this
as good as you can be within laws.

1609
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:01,380
I'm just not feeling
much like seeing them.

1610
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:03,780
It hasn't come up yet with my wife,

1611
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:08,370
but she is really close with them
and likes for us to go over, um,

1612
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:12,150
likes to go over there to hang out.
What should I do?

1613
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,800
Should I just drop it and pretend like
they couldn't have cared less that my

1614
01:38:16,801 --> 01:38:21,801
brother died or do I stand my ground and
fuse to go over to any functions until

1615
01:38:21,871 --> 01:38:26,100
I hear something? Obviously the latter
choice would cause friction at home.

1616
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,110
I'm the first choice would kill me
inside the one being to go over there.

1617
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:35,490
What do you think? Uh, you know
what this podcast is? This,

1618
01:38:35,491 --> 01:38:36,121
it should just be,

1619
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:40,740
Bill just talks about shit that he's not
qualified to talk about. Okay. And uh,

1620
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:43,950
that includes all that banking stuff.
Even though I know on my gut level,

1621
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:46,620
somewhere in there I'm right.
Um,

1622
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:48,520
okay.

1623
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,090
All right. My Gut is telling me, uh,

1624
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:52,370
okay.

1625
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:56,480
You're obviously, you're,
you're angry right now and uh,

1626
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,790
you have to go through that stuff.

1627
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:03,870
I think the move here is it's a bad move.

1628
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:05,330
Okay.

1629
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:07,400
To, um, you know,

1630
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:11,730
basically you going to be married to
your wife for the rest of your life.

1631
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:14,880
You don't need the fucking not getting
along with the in laws to make it a

1632
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:19,020
miserable situation. Um, I don't
know anything about your in laws.

1633
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:22,740
I don't know if they're not
good with emotions. I don't
know if they're like, he,

1634
01:39:22,741 --> 01:39:26,340
I don't know what to say. I mean, I
don't know how old they are. I mean,

1635
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:29,460
a lot of these people who come from
the pre Oprah fucking Winfrey show,

1636
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:33,000
especially guys and a lot of
women, they don't, you know,

1637
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:36,870
they don't know how to express shit
like the, when stuff like this comes up,

1638
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:37,770
they don't know what to do.

1639
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:42,420
So the move is right now is you have to
talk to your wife and you have to tell

1640
01:39:42,421 --> 01:39:47,421
her how devastated you are that your
in laws haven't expressed any sort of

1641
01:39:48,091 --> 01:39:48,924
condolences.

1642
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:53,070
And you have to tell her that it's making
you not want to do anything with them

1643
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,450
ever again.
And just say that you're putting it.

1644
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:59,190
You really have to communicate that to
your wife because what you're doing right

1645
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:03,930
now is you're already gone
through something devastating
and you could possibly,

1646
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:07,380
through your grief,
make your own personal life,

1647
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:12,090
which I'm guessing was happy up to this
point. Even worse because you're gonna,

1648
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,450
you're gonna push away your in laws and
then push away your wife at the same

1649
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:18,570
time. So what you have to do, you
have to go to her and in a calm way,

1650
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:23,220
just tell how hurt you are that they
didn't, that they didn't. Um, they didn't,

1651
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:28,200
you know, send a car to flowers or
anything like that. Um, some ways I know,

1652
01:40:28,201 --> 01:40:29,040
ask somebody about this.

1653
01:40:29,041 --> 01:40:31,080
And they actually brought up a
great point that they had some,

1654
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:35,160
a friend of theirs pass away and there
was so many flowers at the funeral and

1655
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:37,290
people were coming up going,
hey, did you get the flowers?

1656
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:41,220
Did you get the flowers I sent? And it's
like, you know, they're dealing with,

1657
01:40:41,221 --> 01:40:46,080
you know, the, the funeral stuff
that they got to take care of,

1658
01:40:46,081 --> 01:40:49,770
picking out the coffin and all that
awful stuff so they don't get a chance to

1659
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:52,950
look at all the flowers. So for all, you
know, they might've sent some flowers.

1660
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:57,790
So the first, Oh, there you go
dude. There's your jump off point.

1661
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:02,140
You have to say to your wife that, listen,
I need to talk to you about something.

1662
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:07,810
And you just say, obviously you know
what happened. And as far as I know,

1663
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:10,930
uh, you know, has your,

1664
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:15,070
have your parents sent a card or
any flowers that I didn't get?

1665
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,180
Let her answer that.
And if she says she doesn't know,

1666
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:21,580
then that's when you go
and say, look, you know,

1667
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:22,930
obviously this is a big thing to me.

1668
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:27,610
And they haven't expressed any condolences
and this is making me want to do x, y,

1669
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:31,360
and z. That's how you do it.
So just use the jump off point,

1670
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,550
you know,
with that question,

1671
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:37,580
that's something I've learned in my
life was shit a lot less devastating,

1672
01:41:37,581 --> 01:41:41,720
which is basically the first thing you
do is you have to find out if what you're

1673
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:46,120
thinking is correct before you go off
on somebody. Going off is step two.

1674
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:51,110
All right? I can't tell you how many times
in my life someone comes up and says,

1675
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,910
hey,
so and so says this,

1676
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:56,690
and then I just take that as law rather
than going up to the person going, hey,

1677
01:41:56,691 --> 01:42:00,560
you know, I'm not saying
you did this, but somebody,

1678
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:02,630
somebody saying that you said this shit,

1679
01:42:02,631 --> 01:42:05,030
and then you're supposed to do
it that way rather than just

1680
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:06,750
flipping out.
Because

1681
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,560
if you flip out and they actually
sent flowers, you're, you're,

1682
01:42:09,561 --> 01:42:13,750
you're really going to look bad and then
you made already a, a brutal situation.

1683
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,780
Even worse. Alright, there you go.
I'm done. Babylon for a week. Dude,

1684
01:42:16,781 --> 01:42:17,510
I'm sorry to hear about [inaudible]

1685
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:21,870
your loss. I hope, uh, you know, I hope,

1686
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:24,960
I hope shit works out for you with your
in laws and all that type of stuff.

1687
01:42:24,961 --> 01:42:29,700
All right. Ah, that's a devastating way to
end this podcast. And it's over an hour.

1688
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:31,410
These things are getting
way too fucking long.

1689
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:35,130
And I apologize for all my babbling
this weekend. Yes, I know. I am a moron.

1690
01:42:35,131 --> 01:42:37,800
So I would love to hear from all
you economic majors out there.

1691
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,413
MMM.

1692
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:42,890
Or someone who is even in banking.
Please. Somebody for the love of God.

1693
01:42:42,891 --> 01:42:45,270
If you're in banking, please defend
it because I got to tell you,

1694
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:49,130
I'm not one of these psycho conspiracy
theorists who thinks he's 100% right.

1695
01:42:49,131 --> 01:42:52,010
I want to be fucking
wrong on all of this shit.

1696
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,800
I want to be wrong on the
automated cashier things.

1697
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:57,530
I want to be wrong and all I want to
say that they're actually sitting there

1698
01:42:57,531 --> 01:42:58,010
going,

1699
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:02,990
how can we make less money and pass
savings on to the fucking customer?

1700
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:07,160
How come I yacht be smaller?
All right, that's it. Um,

1701
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,820
I should like, I should have lost
a lot of credibility on that one.

1702
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,630
I really stammered my way through that
banking thing and I'd be lying to you if

1703
01:43:14,631 --> 01:43:19,460
I wasn't embarrassed. All right. And then
is it, that is a podcast for this week.

1704
01:43:19,461 --> 01:43:20,540
Thanks for listening everybody.

1705
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:24,950
I'm gonna try to get the bandwidth up
so more people can enjoy my completely

1706
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:25,813
uninformed

1707
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:27,680
means every week. Alright. God bless you,

1708
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,173
boss.

1709
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:01,610
Yeah.
