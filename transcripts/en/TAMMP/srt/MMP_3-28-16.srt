1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,010
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:04,860
It's bill burn his time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,010
March 28th,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,690
2016 the year of the Yac whatever the
fuck it is. And the Chinese New Year.

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:16,710
I have no ideas and they had new
year. Next, next, uh, next month.

6
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:21,450
How does that work with those people?
You know how to like,

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,310
I don't, I don't get it. I just don't,

8
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,670
I don't understand why we're on
standard and everybody else's on metric.

9
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:30,150
Can we just pick one fucking calendar,
one unit of measurement.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,540
You fucked over Europe. Jesus Christ
metric. And then some old guys talk. Hey,

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,650
way fucking 20 stone,
20 stone.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,160
I mean, I guess we're still
saying horsepower. Jesus.
Fucking, well, what size stone?

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,220
What are you a fucking free mason?
Um, she buddy in the Illuminati.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,070
Is that where he's at now?
The little secret group.

15
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,560
You think you're gonna make it
buying up land on the aquifers?

16
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,680
Is that what you're going
to do? And then what? Ha.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,160
All the robots are gonna take everything
over, right? You phase everybody out,

18
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:08,490
but a big, except you and then you,
you guys, you guys going to be good.

19
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:10,650
And then all the robots,
for some reason I'm going to turn him.

20
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:15,000
He fucking movies you need to watch
before you realize that they're eventually

21
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,020
going to turn on.
You stuck out.

22
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,670
You made a fucking robot now,

23
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:25,170
which choke when you off with
your Dick and you deserve it.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,650
Madec glad you stayed ban on and layer on.
There you go.

25
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:33,000
There was a little Illuminati with
a Lionel Richie and he'd like that.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,510
Um, somebody sent me this fucking
video. They go, hey, you might want to,

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,680
you might want to watch this thing.

28
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,380
And it was basically this
person was talking about, uh,

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,500
we showing how the automobile put
the horse out of business, you know,

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,090
which it was so funny to me.
Like the Horse was upset like,

31
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:51,660
Oh fuck you mean human beings and our
nature aren't going to ride on my back

32
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:56,550
anymore guy what I want now what do I
gotta do? I can't run free on the planes.

33
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,210
Um, I guess the horse population dropped
off, but like nobody who is no one,

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,450
you know,
most of them are born into a,

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,460
I guess you really don't
see horses running around do
you can be out in Wyoming.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,170
Yeah. See a lot of cows at
the waffle house. I'm sorry.

37
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,750
Well why would you do a fat joke
bill this early and come on,

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,040
you're better than that bell.
Hang on a second. We come off

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,180
a certain standard of comedy. You got
to go that low. Yeah. You got a tech,

40
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:31,440
the broads and fat people while at the
same time that early, hey, you know,

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,810
whatever, you've got to shoot
your way out of a slump.

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,240
It's my second attempt to get to sing go.

43
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,810
And this is one of these times
I'm recording the podcast.

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,430
Not because I'm feeling it,
it's because I have to,

45
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,370
cause I got shit to do tomorrow. So, uh,

46
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,830
I got to kind of knock this thing
out on Easter. So anyways, anybody,

47
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:48,240
if somebody shows me this fucking thing,

48
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:53,241
so the guys shows how the car put the
horse out of fucking business and uh,

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,430
yeah, like I said, like,
like the horse is upset.

50
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,020
It's like when you watch those
weird commercials, we're like, uh,

51
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,200
the Mr potato heads or sneaking
off to eat potato chips.

52
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,580
There's some sort of weird like undertones
of cannibalism going on there and

53
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:10,850
it's supposed to be adorable. I don't, I
don't get those commercials on any level.

54
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,930
Um,
but uh,

55
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,380
totally lost my train of thought.
Oh yeah.

56
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:23,381
So they were basically
showing how computers and
everything being automated is

57
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:28,760
going to phase everybody out and there's
going to be this mass unemployment that

58
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:33,530
is coming. I'm like, this is fucking
groundbreaking thought. I mean,

59
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,070
a dummy like me has been saying
this for fucking ever. Right.

60
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,140
And he just kept going like, oh,
see are in this industry. Well,

61
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:42,710
you're not safe either. You
think you know, you actually,

62
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:46,010
you're a computer programmer. Well guess
what? You're not safe either, buddy.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,220
Just fucking relax. And like he
just kept coming with that tone.

64
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,710
And at some point I was just like,

65
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,740
what are you going to fucking shine that
light on yourself that maybe it does by

66
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:57,380
the end? I couldn't listen to
them. What about condescending?

67
00:03:57,381 --> 00:04:01,010
Douchebags who think they know everything?
Narrating over these fucking videos,

68
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,920
you know, with the big dude I'd called. It

69
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,990
really is technology in the future
are going to get rid of jobs. Yeah.

70
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:12,680
I had no idea. It's only been doing that
since the beginning of fucking time.

71
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,070
And these fucking people are just forever
forecasting that the sky is going to

72
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:22,340
fall. This is the fucking thing.
Eventually the sky will fall.

73
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,170
Nobody knows when it's going to happen.

74
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,700
Everybody's been trying to predict it
ever since that fucking Nostradamus Douche

75
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,660
bag all the way down to a moron like me.

76
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,040
And the bottom line is none of us
know what we're talking about. Oh,

77
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,430
the lovely mia. I'm busting that on your
podcasts. We'll get a microphone in a,

78
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:39,590
in a plug there in the,
uh,

79
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:43,700
they in the closet until the bottom line
is nobody knows when all this shit's

80
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:48,440
going to end. So just fucking
go enjoy yourself. You know,

81
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,410
I just feel like there's fucking, all
this whole presidential election you get,

82
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,820
you got one loan, it's in the
closets on the closet, a top shelf.

83
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,900
You got one Luna tick on the fucking left,
another lunatic on the right.

84
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:04,880
And then you got this fucking, I dunno
what she is in the middle, you know,

85
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,920
she's not really in the middle.
She's just more of the same,

86
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,170
you know they're going to be, they should
just wheel her into the White House.

87
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:12,670
Like fucking Hannibal Lecter.
When I was in fucking mass zone,

88
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,340
you just went out to watch her awful
fucking mouth. You need the plug too.

89
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,900
Oh I got the plug over here.

90
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,950
Let me hit pause so the listeners don't
have to fucking listen to this shit.

91
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,730
And with that, the magic of the pause
button, we were able to get by all that.

92
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:32,270
Don't you wish she had a pause
button in life? Nia? I certainly do.

93
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:35,210
When all of a sudden something
bad was going on. Like you know,

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,470
I was in the middle of one of my long
drawn out stories. You could. Well,

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,990
I actually want to fast forward when you,

96
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,910
I felt that your listeners
might need rescuing from that,

97
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,670
from those that what it is. You just
bring it down. Bring into the mic here.

98
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,390
Yeah. Don't do that. Just have it. Just
hold it down a little more relaxed.

99
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:55,010
You know, like you sitting
there with a drink in your hand.

100
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:58,180
You're always telling me how to use the
microphone. Yeah, because you don't,

101
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,000
all right, well fucking use
how you want to use it. Then

102
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,130
I got my own style, man. Yeah, you do.

103
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,470
Yeah, you don't, you sound, sometimes
you sound like you don't want to.

104
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:11,060
A little kid answers the phone. You just
pick up the phone, you know? It's like,

105
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,093
hello

106
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,910
and you're like, Hey, what'd you
do today? Do you have a good day?

107
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,643
Yes.

108
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,240
That's the hardest thing ever.

109
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:27,710
I just was talking to my niece and it's
just like you gotta like you can't,

110
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,030
if you just ask them yes or no questions,
you gotta be like,

111
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,970
what did you do today? You can't
be like, did you have fun today?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,820
Because they want elaborate
there. Just go, yes.

113
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,060
You're like, oh fuck, I
need another question. Yeah.

114
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,080
They're not the greatest
conversationalist, but oh they're,

115
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,350
they're brutal interview,
brutal interview.

116
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:50,930
So they just always that white
child actors are so creepy,

117
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,750
you know, like little kid. Cause
it's like you shouldn't be able,

118
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,220
you shouldn't be this articulate.

119
00:06:55,221 --> 00:07:00,221
You shouldn't be able to just like
elaborate in a way because you're a kid.

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,610
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

121
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,460
No, it's, it's the combination
that they talk like adults,

122
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,370
they're making more money than you are.
Right.

123
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,560
And they're wearing that little
talk show suit, the whole thing.

124
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:13,590
And they just peel and they just sit
there and they cross their legs like an

125
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:16,410
adult does when they do panel and
they'll just be like, you know,

126
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,300
so what was it like working on
blah, blah, blah. And He'd be like,

127
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,220
oh he was great to work with. I've, I've,
I've been a huge fan of his stuff. Like,

128
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,590
yeah, for the last six years,
my whole life basically,

129
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,650
I don't think they should make little
kids do interviews. I feel like that's,

130
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,740
I think it's one thing for
them to do movies and stuff.

131
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,710
But I don't think they should be
doing interviews and press and stuff.

132
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,000
I just feel like that's weird.

133
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,840
I don't think people should talk
the little kids period. Like no,

134
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,380
like you seen like little kids. I don't
talk to little kids, like little kids.

135
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,650
Yeah, neither do I. And I
think that that is a like,

136
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,190
I think it weirds them out after
the age of four to be like, yeah.

137
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,450
Oh,
okay.

138
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,560
When they're just talking to
you like, yeah, you don't like,

139
00:07:56,561 --> 00:08:01,300
do you remember her being a member in
young Frankenstein when he just goes like,

140
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:01,530
yeah,

141
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,410
tis alive.
I've never seen it.

142
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,650
Frankenstein sitting. They
look looking at him like, dude,

143
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:11,780
what the fuck is your deal?
No. Gene Wilder. Oh No,

144
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,440
he never saw that movie. No. Walk this
way. You haven't touched your food.

145
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,670
Are you quoting the
movie area saying words?

146
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,190
You're quoting the movie and
to have a tough cookie? No. No.

147
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:28,600
Like uh, yeah. How have you never seen
that when we was fucking hilarious out.

148
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,970
The one where he's always going
Frankenstein. Yeah, Broncos.

149
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,980
Remember those clips, but I don't,
wasn't there something cool? He's young.

150
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,170
Frankenstein with Yahoo serious,

151
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,680
that comedian and process really movie.

152
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,640
Well God knows I always fuck up the name.
It's the one with gene wilder in it.

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,670
I think you're right that that's
the name of a gene wilder movie.

154
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:53,410
But wasn't there something with
Frankenstein with Yahoo Serious am I?

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,100
I Dunno.
I don't know why there's like a wind

156
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,680
tunnel where you're, where you're
talking you, you know what it is.

157
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,750
Does it sound bad? No.
Cause this is what you do.

158
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,870
You're up here and then you're
down here and then you're here.

159
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,020
You're moving it all around.
So what do I do?

160
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,080
You need a steady hand on that microphone.
You don't move your hand at all. Ah,

161
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,970
I'm, I'm pretty consistent. I just, I rest
it like this. I rested against my chest,

162
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,790
my chest tickles my mail, my
mail pecks him, my testicles.

163
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,470
Does it sound far away though if I do
this? Yeah, it does. How about this?

164
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,350
That's fine. This is good. That
is good. All right. That's right.

165
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:29,040
Then I just don't move and freeze
for the next 15 minutes. Well,

166
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,610
I'm probably gonna leave soon. I just
came in and say hi. Oh, okay. Well,

167
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:36,900
I didn't know if you had any questions
from all that hasn't come in yet. Oh,

168
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,570
so where are you going on
about Frankenstein? No,

169
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,770
I was talking about the Illumina,

170
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
this fucking video somebody
told me to watch was just like,

171
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:47,100
this guy is just saying how technology
and robots are going to phase everybody

172
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:51,570
out and you just go, you know, Oh,
you're a milk man. You think you're safe.

173
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,360
Check out this fucking robot and
everything. It's just like, yeah.

174
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,090
Well what about condescending
douchebags who narrate videos?

175
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:01,290
Like they probably already have a
robot to do that, right? Don't they?

176
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,670
To do what?
I'll tell you this to just narrate shit.

177
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,460
They already have the fucking
robot lady in the elevator

178
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,450
or even that's just a voiceover that
in so many countries only please make a

179
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:18,360
poster. It's like a horror
film. And what did he say?

180
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,490
That weird robot lady in the elevator.

181
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,530
I want to fucking robot
lady in the elevator.

182
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,370
He didn't do a poster for a movie with
your face looking very concerned and

183
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,840
there's like an elevator
she used to pressing.

184
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,290
She's in like every fucking
elevator and it's like going up.

185
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,640
And then when she says going down,

186
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:39,640
she goes going down and she really like,

187
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,700
like your whole life is
going in the shitter.

188
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,490
And I can't tell you how many people
I've been in the elevator. I go, I,

189
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,200
it's so fucking depressing. They're
like, I know I hate it. It's not just me.

190
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,980
Okay. You know, it's all of us out
there in the remodel, you know,

191
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,270
hoping they got that little waffle flippy
thing down there for the continental

192
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,910
breakfast.
It was stale blueberry muffins.

193
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:03,000
Those little bite size ones that
for some reason give, give you a,

194
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,490
what do they call this?
Your little muffin toughened tops.

195
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,690
Those things are like little grenades
for your gut. Feel your belly. You know,

196
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,090
you just pop one of those in there and you
come like, like homer Simpson. Yup. Oh,

197
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,790
you're going to do this. All
right, let's get into the, well,

198
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,180
let's get into this part of it. Oh, I
thought you were giving me shit. Yup.

199
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,370
It's still on that shit.
Let's talk about uh,

200
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,360
your, your little trashing that you'd
say you took like a seller level,

201
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,950
comedy cellar level trashing.

202
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:36,951
Today we were out to
Brunch and mother in law,

203
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,880
brother in law, my sister in law
and you and me and we go out,

204
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,690
we go out to a lunch and you
are the biggest sweetheart.

205
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,800
You got to your wonderful sense of humor.
You're a cutie pie.

206
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,980
But when you talk to the
wait staff or just in

207
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,450
general, I still don't see
it. Oh in everybody. That
was an agreement. You have,

208
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,070
you put a little mustard on it.

209
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,580
You have like a can you get
your shit together or what?

210
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:05,860
Like how many times do I have
to ask you the first time,

211
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,310
like when the lady came over and she goes,

212
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,500
what did she ask you?

213
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:16,501
And I were sitting down while that is
six top while my mom and my brother were

214
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:21,370
outside waiting for my sister.
So we went to get our table and she said,

215
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,270
hi, can I get you guys into the drink? And
we both said waters and she goes, okay,

216
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,820
and can I get you some appetizers?
And I said, we're just,

217
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:32,210
we're waiting on three more. That's all
I said. But you make it seem like, um,

218
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,700
excuse me.
You had this tone of like,

219
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:39,490
bitch,
why would two people sit at a six top?

220
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:42,970
There's obviously more people coming.
You had a little fucking,

221
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,120
and there are menus and then we'll menus
that see Derek and the menus and it was

222
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:49,660
totally,
that's what it was.

223
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,080
The fact that there was menus
there and she didn't do the math.

224
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,440
You just have this,
well what the fuck's wrong with you?

225
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,040
But I don't think that I'm a difficult
person to serve in a restaurant.

226
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:08,041
What'd you say that I know what the way
don't you do it the way that you do it.

227
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,100
It's, it's one of those
fucking zingers. It's a tone.

228
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,470
So the person that you
said something nice,

229
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:18,670
but there's a tone in there that makes
the person a step and a half away kind of

230
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:22,540
cock their head like, well she
just being a fucking asshole there.

231
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,130
Am I like you are accusing me of being
shady is basically what it was and that's

232
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:31,540
not my intention. I just, you do.
You do know though I not shady.

233
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,920
Shady is like dishonest.

234
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,980
You're saying that that shady as in I'm
being shady the way it throwing shade.

235
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,820
Are you going down,
drilling down?

236
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,400
Um, I, I just have,

237
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,910
I definitely have a little less patients
than normal perhaps at a restaurant.

238
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,470
This is good. You're gradually,
they do feel that. Um,

239
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,790
I don't like it when they're not
on top of things. That's all.

240
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,620
And I mean it wasn't just for me,

241
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:05,450
like my mom got her salad before
she got her wine and the woman,

242
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,840
the bus got drinks and like,
you know,

243
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:10,180
me and my brother and my
sister all had mixed drinks.

244
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,720
She had wine like hers should have
been the first thing that came out.

245
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,170
And then we all get our stuff and then
she gets a salad with no wine and I said

246
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:23,260
to her, and she has a wine to the ones
you brought over. My Mom's fat salad.

247
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,400
I just said that she has one.

248
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,940
I wasn't like my mom ordered wine
and she should've gotten that first.

249
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:31,150
I don't do all that. No, you don't go to
that level. Yeah. So what's the problem?

250
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,120
You have a fucking tone. I can't do it
the way that you fucking do it. I just,

251
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,750
I always look at you go easy.
Nia.

252
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,330
Just fucking take a little
off the fast ball there.

253
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,540
You just have this fucking
do your brother agreed.

254
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,100
You sister agreed when she
pleaded the fifth and he goes,

255
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:50,590
I'm not going to get involved in
this cause she does the same thing.

256
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,830
To be honest, I'm not trying to
throw them on. That's what you want.

257
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,060
That's what your brother said.

258
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,510
What brother goes when your mother would
tell I said that's where she gets it

259
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:00,080
from.

260
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Well I mean my mom definitely has
been known to complain about food.

261
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:08,740
She bitched about the food in Italy.
The funniest thing ever keeps saying,

262
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,650
I guess I'm just used to a sandwich
that has meat on it. More meat,

263
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,990
more meat on it. No, I mean I think, yes.

264
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,090
How hard did we tease her for
complaining about the food? A lot,

265
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,370
but then then good sport
about it. But um, no,

266
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:29,930
I mean my mom has a tendency to be late.
Just to the point with people like that,

267
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:34,610
because you know, just
letting them know, listen,

268
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,390
this was the Sunday waitstaff,
this was the Easter Sunday weights that,

269
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,530
like I said,
you're not getting,

270
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:43,660
you're not getting the Crigila
wait stab on Easter Sunday.

271
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,990
Like let's be real. Wow. You're just,

272
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,000
you're going in there with that attitude
now this is all this type of fucking

273
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,050
predispose thought and
tone that guys like me,

274
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,510
guys like me and offend somebody because
somebody did it shift at it. No, no, no,

275
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:59,640
no.
I'm saying on Easter Sunday you have,

276
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,910
you're going to say that I'm saying
that they're not the creme de la creme,

277
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,880
but if you had been in this restaurant,
okay, so I'm not talking about you.

278
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,410
If you had vantage restaurant,

279
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,880
you would have seen just
how it was a little off.

280
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,170
That's all. And I wasn't like throwing
a temper tantrum or being demanding.

281
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,150
Here you have a mandate.

282
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,680
You have this fucking attitude
every fucking place we go.

283
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:28,460
When you order, you have,
I'm always like easy, easy,

284
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,550
all you're gonna do.
Just pump the brakes a little.

285
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,540
I just feel like they asked me what I
want and I just tell them what I want and

286
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:40,280
what I need and I'm, the thing is,
when you order, I think you're fine.

287
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,390
But then it's when, when everything
isn't chomp, chomp coming your way,

288
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:47,270
you have a way of like,
can we get some more bread?

289
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,130
Like please, like you have
this, I can't, I'm, that's

290
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,890
my page.
So you're fucking agreeing with me.

291
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,490
I agree that I have a low patience for

292
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,770
service that is not the
quality that I feel that,

293
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,920
yeah, well his is that, yes. Sound crazy.
I know. And if they fuck with your food,

294
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,290
they're going to fuck with my food too.
So it's just fucking,

295
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,470
the wait staff has an unbelievable
amount of power that you're not really

296
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,400
realizing to fuck with your life.
I realized that I was a waitress.

297
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:29,910
Remember, I understand how
it all goes down. I just say,

298
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:31,400
what happened to you at that job?

299
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,750
You got fired and here you are.

300
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,233
Oh yeah,

301
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,450
I got fired over some bullshit and they
could never even tell him why I got

302
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,660
fired. Okay. They were like, oh,

303
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,450
you told somebody that they couldn't
have ice coffee. And I said, Oh,

304
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,320
you told me that we don't serve ice
tea anymore because it's the fall.

305
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,160
And they're like, oh, but you still
can have ice coffee. And I'm like, oh,

306
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,330
I didn't fucking know that.

307
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,410
And that was an example of one of the
reasons why they fired me. Bullshit.

308
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,300
It was over some bullshit

309
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,420
little mustard getting slung
around in that place. You don't,

310
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,020
you probably have the
same fucking attitude,

311
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,160
the same lack of patience with the
people ordering those fucking bar flies.

312
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,020
Actually no,
he did a great show.

313
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:23,370
That was one of my favorite times when
I was first getting that this place

314
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,180
doesn't exist anymore.

315
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,860
The all state cafe on the west side
in New York and she used to work the

316
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:32,490
lunchtime shift and I would
come in as a fucking, you know,

317
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,380
no name Magoo comedian. Right. So on my
days of free, my phone's not ringing.

318
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,260
You come in every day that
I was working with. So cute.

319
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:43,110
You come in with the New York Post,
you come in with the paper, I loved it.

320
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,900
And you'd sit in the same booth and you
get a burger. Oh Shit. And I would sell,

321
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,720
Rosa would come by to, Rosen would
come down. You looked adorable.

322
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,300
You looked at during people
love to the people that you got.

323
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,111
You got the chef there.

324
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,380
I wish I just brought that up
there cause I had friends there.

325
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,260
But restaurants are just, they're
weird environments. Anyway.

326
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,260
That's the only place
you ever got fired from.

327
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,600
And I remember how far you took
that cause everybody sells.

328
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,140
You've just gotten promoted, promoted,
promoted. That's the only place. Yeah,

329
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,993
you cried.

330
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,600
So I think maybe that's why you have that
fucking attitude when you go in there

331
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:18,960
because it brings you back.
Oh, that's ridiculous.

332
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,380
Well then I didn't know if
maybe you're just not nice

333
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,243
person.

334
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,340
Now I get impatient at restaurants.
I will cop to that. Okay, fine.

335
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,800
I cops are being impatient at restaurants.

336
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,740
Well do you remember when you were awake?

337
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,810
Waiter or waitress and people
were like impatient with you.

338
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:36,650
How did that make you feel?

339
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,590
It didn't make me feel good.
Okay.

340
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,040
So the next time we go out,

341
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,860
do you think maybe I'll
just let you order from me.

342
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:51,150
How about that and make an all nights
at school and traditional just like you

343
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:55,830
like that. Well yeah, I liked
it when there was defined jobs.

344
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,720
Define gender roles you mean? Yeah,
absolutely. Well I'll let you,

345
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,450
it made it made a shrew to deal with
when you take me out to eat it made it a

346
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:11,700
lot easier. And what do you mean the
questions just came in by the way?

347
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,800
One of them them's skin infections.

348
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,520
What am I talk to somebody
I'm wrote you about? They got,

349
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,810
they were getting married or they're
engaged in their fiance wanted to have a

350
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:28,780
little mermaid theme wedding.
Did you have this question? Yeah,

351
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,540
cause I got sent it to Andrew. Send it
to me too. Um, it's a comment. I'm an,

352
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,630
obviously I'm late, but
I just, first of all,

353
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:40,500
I just don't think that's a real
fucking question. Are you okay? Good.

354
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,150
I didn't think it was real,
but I was like,

355
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:47,010
if this is real person would really
like no 28 year old woman wants,

356
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,360
have their fiance dress up
as who was it supposed to be?

357
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,260
Neptune.

358
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,500
Um,
you know,

359
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,290
because that doesn't make any buttons
sense because June is her father would,

360
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,520
would, would be, uh, the
Little Mermaid's father.

361
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,040
Yeah. I, it just seemed
like it would be addressed

362
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,680
stop as Prince Eric and the fact that
you didn't know that just proves that you

363
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:11,220
lied because a girl who's really
into little mermaid like I am,

364
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,750
would know that those are the facts.

365
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,110
Well, maybe they're just talking
about, okay, here we go. Bazaar 13,

366
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:21,940
most bizarre and unusual wedding
themes. All right, here we go. Look,

367
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:25,360
these people are dressed up like
fucking monsters. All right.

368
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:29,890
Look at these other both dress
zombies. Yeah. No, this isn't really,

369
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:32,650
this isn't good for the podcast is people
can't see what we're talking about it.

370
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:36,180
Yeah. Well we can comment on it. I can
you have a little faith in me. Jesus.

371
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,420
Stop treating me like a waiter.

372
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,763
Yeah.

373
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,100
Having your wedding edit
at a department store.

374
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,170
These people got married at Tj Maxx.
Alright,

375
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,110
no comment. No comment. Oh, okay.
Your entire party can be superheroes.

376
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,871
All right,
so here,

377
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:59,540
this is getting towards a little
Neptune or whatever the fuck it was.

378
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,060
Couple of the Little Mermaid,
little mermaid. Okay,

379
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:06,120
so one was dressed like wonder woman.
The other one is dressed like Batman.

380
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,650
How out of shape is the Batman? It's
a loose fitting. Fucking Batman suit.

381
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:13,590
He looks horrible.
That's some shit that you regret later.

382
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,610
He looks like old Batman.
Like we know when your skin loses the els.

383
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:21,400
This city Super Mario Brothers
can smash it up at your weddings.

384
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,880
That's a wedding cake or
Super Mario brothers wedding.

385
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,000
Just show up naked. Okay. Now is
this scene, is this seeming a,

386
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,570
okay.

387
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,160
Wow.
What a bunch of fucking Weirdos.

388
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,050
A roller coaster of a wedding. People
get married on a rollercoaster. Yeah,

389
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,790
I could see that. Jump off a bridge while
you say I. Do you get the metaphor in?

390
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,480
Yes. Is it hitting you over
the head with the at? Yes.

391
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,393
Uh,

392
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,750
make it so somebody has in their wedding
ring to boldly go where no man has gone

393
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:57,290
before you. This is, this is the seeing
the theme here. This is Shrek wedding.

394
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,670
Oh really? Well, anyway, I,

395
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,950
I thought the question said that the
dad thrown into a shark cage was not the

396
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:08,030
dad,
but like the,

397
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,110
the groom was supposed to be dressed
like Neptune and that just would not make

398
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:14,540
sense unless he was just
all this comic con shit.

399
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:19,130
All these fucking nerds try to find middle
earth for the wedding of your dreams.

400
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,660
Rocky horror picture show
and a Zombie wedding.

401
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,320
I mean, it's just people out there
that think that, that shit's cool.

402
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,850
I still thought it was a bogus question.
I have. I don't fucking know. Hey,

403
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,960
what do I know? Okay. Um,

404
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,780
I was going to tell the story of seeing
the old guy fall off the scooter and I

405
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:43,210
hope you saw it, right. Jesus
Christ and you helped him.

406
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,990
Now what was I supposed to do?
The first person there,

407
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,270
it's silly bird of the rescue
fucking guy rolling down the street,

408
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,220
slide on his face.
Pork.

409
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,230
He wasn't phy Ed raspberries. He
knocked himself out. He came around,

410
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,220
he was spitting up, he was pulling out
little bits of teeth. And I dunno why,

411
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,930
it was horrifying when I saw it,

412
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:09,120
but now I can't talk about it without
laughing cause he was on a scooter.

413
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,040
I had basically I was,
I'm on,

414
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,710
I'm not going to say all the information
cause God forbid the people that are

415
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:21,580
related to them and listening.
So the fucking dude was like, uh,

416
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,870
I fuck it. I'll just tell the
story. I didn't do anything.

417
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,320
I just finished flying.
Explain his fucking tragic.

418
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,320
Why don't we know is all right.
Just done, finished flying. Right,

419
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,770
which everybody says is so fucking unsafe.
Right.

420
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,110
Fly around and look all this cool shit.

421
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,040
Flyovers Silver Lake to see that
they took the water out of it.

422
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:47,910
I even realize that. And I came
back, I fucking land, you know,

423
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,920
say goodbye to everybody and I'm driving
out, you know, to the real scary thing.

424
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:55,860
Driving down the fucking street.
And I literally pull out,

425
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,610
I make a right turn and I don't,
I don't drive more than 40 yards.

426
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:01,230
And I just see this fucking guy,

427
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:05,370
just this old guy takes
the turn to come onto the,

428
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,110
on the little two lane highway.
Then I'm on,

429
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:09,060
he's on the opposite side
of the road and he liked,

430
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,200
he went too fast and I'm
like a motorcycle. You can't
just turn the front wheel.

431
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,700
You're going to go down on a scooter.
You know what I mean?

432
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:18,240
You've got to kind of look your way
through the turn in lean and your momentum

433
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,450
momentum. You know he's supposed to
look through the fucking turn. He,

434
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,630
he was going too fast
and he went into the,

435
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,570
the fucking island in the middle of that.

436
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,373
Okay.

437
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,060
He fucking,
he jumped the fucking curb.

438
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:36,410
The whole fucking scooter went up
in the back. You high sided, right?

439
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,910
He just gets launched off this bucket
thing and he's rolling down the street

440
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:45,590
like a fucking log. Why are you laughing
so hard? Because people falling down.

441
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:49,070
It's fucking hilarious. He was
fine. He didn't break anything.

442
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,180
He just knocked himself out.

443
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:55,181
He's Lucas and then he wasn't wearing a
shield and in the end he was sliding on

444
00:25:55,371 --> 00:26:00,080
his face. So I'm going, Oh
shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit is,

445
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:02,690
I'm watching it and I fucking pull over.
No,

446
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,680
I made sure everybody stopped and I
got out. I was like, dude, do it right.

447
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,260
Just stay there. You're alright.
You're alright. And um, and he was,

448
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,080
he wasn't saying anything and he,
his fucking raspberry on his face,

449
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,420
his pants with torn up,
you know,

450
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,880
you got fucking attacked by a
wild animal and he's fucking late.

451
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,970
I feel terrible that this happened
to them, but it's just afterwards,

452
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:28,560
this is funny. And he was
laying there right in like
one of his legs. He had like,

453
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,980
oh, like he was chilling and the island
was just straight out like that is,

454
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,010
and he was like going around and I was
like, all right man. I called nine one,

455
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,280
you find you're fine. And then this
lady shows up and she just kept going,

456
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:43,330
don't move. Don't move. Okay.
You're okay. Just don't move. Okay.

457
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,880
You just have to keep going.
Okay.

458
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,390
And it started annoying me and I almost
started laughing like, I want to be like,

459
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:52,980
lady, like the way you're
talking is probably worse
than what the fuck is failing

460
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:57,240
right now. So, uh, by then you were
like five or six people at stopped.

461
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,650
Everybody called to this ambulance shows
up and like, okay, thank God, and he,

462
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,560
and now he wants to get up. And we just
kept telling him not to get up. And, um,

463
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,910
the ambulance pulls up and he just
goes, uh, he goes, is he all right?

464
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,610
Is he all right? You're like, yeah,
yeah, he seems to be okay. You know,

465
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,220
we're not fucking doctors, but he seems
to be okay. And he goes, all right,

466
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:16,830
just tell him not to move.
I already have someone on this ambulance,

467
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,150
there's another one coming,

468
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:22,280
and then he gets in and drives away
and then we're looking down the street.

469
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,440
We don't see any ambulance come and
we're like, what the fuck? And um,

470
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,670
finally one at a, a cop finally came
up and this guy was fucking priceless.

471
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:35,360
He gets out right? Fucking
horse. You Bald Guy, right?

472
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,620
He's got the whole land in strip.

473
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,980
He just comes out looking like Sargent
Riker from the rookies for anybody's old,

474
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,650
and he fucking just comes walking.
He looked, the guy from d Bluth,

475
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,700
the old guy showed his ass with
the mustache minus the mustache.

476
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:51,590
She just comes walking up and he just
walks right up to the guy, Dennis Franz.

477
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:51,891
Yeah.

478
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:56,360
He just walks up like his toes are almost
touching the guy's body and he just

479
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:59,820
looks down at Amigos.
You're all right.

480
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,730
And the guy at that point,
it's going like, yeah, yeah,
I'm fine. And he goes, hi.

481
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,410
Know Daniel's going to be kind of
like, he just, his level of just like,

482
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:16,890
I don't know, he must be like, people
would be on fire every day. So this guy,

483
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,580
he just sees a scooter and this guy
fucked up. He's just like, yeah, yeah.

484
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:23,640
All right. He also seemed way too
old to still be in a patrol car,

485
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,340
so I think he fucked up
somehow and got busted down.

486
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:31,341
Or maybe he was on his way
to some a senior police
fucking banquet or some shit.

487
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:35,550
And he's just like, I'm driving a cruiser.
They know I'm a cop. I have to stop.

488
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:37,290
So once that was fine,
it was funny,

489
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,840
they were just standing there waiting
for the ambulance. But you know,

490
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:43,170
we got to get on with that day and uh,
me and there was this tall,

491
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:47,390
older black dude standing
there, this, he's just like,
he's that guy, man, the here.

492
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,590
And I was like, yeah, yeah,
the here and we just like,

493
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,690
we both got in a car and fucking
drove away. And uh, it was really,

494
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,270
you know, it wasn't too bad. I
mean, it wasn't too glorious scene.

495
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:02,100
It was just a couple of raspberries
and stuff. I didn't have a, but it was,

496
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,541
oh yeah,
absolutely.

497
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,380
But it wasn't until I got on the highway
and I started driving and I started

498
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,120
thinking about it and I
just started laughing.

499
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,810
I think it was just more of
a surprise that you saw it,

500
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,220
but there is just something,

501
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,990
just watching somebody
get fucked up like that.

502
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,720
I remember the time I was in Griffith
Park and that dude came down the hill in

503
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:25,450
street clothes on a skateboard. He went
down that fucking, are you serious dude?

504
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:27,950
This kid will you hike
up to the observatory?

505
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,920
Somebody was going down a skateboard.
Yeah.

506
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,390
So I was just north of where the Greek
theater was and this guy just went flying

507
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:38,270
by in this thing and I was just like,
oh my God,

508
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:42,800
that guy is the shit like,
and I'm thinking like, well
how's he going to stop?

509
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:45,380
Cause this is just downhill to you getting
the traffic and all of a sudden his

510
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:48,380
legs started doing that.
What are [inaudible] wobbly fucking thing.

511
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:53,150
And I'm like no fucking way
and I'm telling you this
guy was going like 30 miles

512
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:56,660
an hour.
Then he just steps off the skateboard.

513
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,570
You always do that either one or
two steps and then you're done.

514
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,410
He was going so fast,
he did like one step and it was like,

515
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,630
who's that guy who fucking jump 30 feet
in 1969 nobody ever broken he fucking

516
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,960
head first
client.

517
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,950
It was like the greatest
study of his sight.

518
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,650
He learned it too and he started rolling
with me. When I tell you this guy,

519
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,260
this guy was rolling so fast,
he was like a blurry. He's like,

520
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,920
he would go like you hit like his elbow,
which would shoot them in the area

521
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,220
and then the best is when you're not
going fast enough to keep rolling and then

522
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,620
you just slide in the sand like

523
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,720
all the way down the thing and
I'll let you escape and kept going.

524
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,023
And he just,

525
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,460
he was just not moving and
I was going like, oh my God.

526
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,410
And he was so he started wiping out like
50 yards away from me and I swear to

527
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:55,260
God was a quarter mile walk to
get where the fuck he stopped.

528
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,740
And he was just laying in the road dump
moving and like I was like, I think

529
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,320
he had, he had no helmet.
No, he had street clothes on.

530
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,560
He looked like he just came
back from drinking and he just,

531
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:10,060
he had like this Harrison Ford,
like Brown leather chair.

532
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:15,840
He just fucking launched
himself. So I get up. So I,

533
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,690
I'm getting close to it at
this point is trying to set up,

534
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,490
he knows he's laying in the middle of
the road and I finally see his skateboard

535
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,240
hit the curb on the other side when
pops into a parked car and then he like,

536
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,080
like crawled. He tried to stand up and
he couldn't put any weight on that like,

537
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:35,730
and he crawled, he crawled over and sat
down and by then I knew it was all right.

538
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:38,680
So it was already starting to laugh.
So it's just going like Tony

539
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,910
doing that dude while laughing. I got
you. All right. He goes, he's like,

540
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:47,860
yeah bro. Fuck. I was,

541
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,310
and at that point I'm trying not to
laugh. I was just like, dude, I go,

542
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,860
that was fucking,
I was fucking hardcore man.

543
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,900
I never seen a wipe out like that. If I
wasn't filming that fucking thing, dude,

544
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,750
it was the most fucking,
it was the greatest log roll,

545
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,950
whatever the fuck you call
that thing that do. It's just,

546
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,750
I never seen him either. I can't believe
these shoes stayed on. Like, you know,

547
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,930
your shoes always fly off whenever
you get hit real hard. Oh my God.

548
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,660
Tremendous.
Fucking tremendous.

549
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:25,720
And it's just as much as you feel for
the person that's just nothing funnier

550
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:30,100
than watching somebody fucking wipe out
if they don't die and you don't know him.

551
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,340
Right. God, God, help me, man. Anyway,

552
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,530
so let me do a little podcast reading for
some, uh, for some of the advertising.

553
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,280
Oh, it's advertising. It's advertising.
You do the questions afterward. Yeah,

554
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:45,130
I can get right to those
things if you know.

555
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,290
I just don't want you to start
talking to me in a certain way.

556
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,230
I was going to ask you
what you wanted for dinner.

557
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:55,700
I'm starting to get hungry again. Um,
some were moldy. Oh, here we go. Oh.

558
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:59,000
The advertising would help me read some
advertising yet God knows I can't read

559
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:02,930
out loud. They don't want me to read
it. Well, I can't read this again.

560
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,330
And she had the whole fucking,
am I supposed to read the whole menu?

561
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:09,410
I'm not doing this shit. All right. What's
it? Look at it before you do the black?

562
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:12,620
Yes, baby. Yeah. I didn't get
into this business to have a job.

563
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,650
Blue Apron, everybody. All right.
You need to know how to cook.

564
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,630
Um, not only do you feel like you know
your way around the kitchen, honey,

565
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,980
but cooking at home means eating healthier
and saving money instead of ordering

566
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:31,070
expensive takeout again,
but where do you start?

567
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,530
It sounds like an almost
old school infomercials.

568
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,830
Somebody like looking at all the pans
and it looks at the camera and shakes

569
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:40,310
their head. Look, I don't know
where to start. Turn on a burner.

570
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:44,030
You're fucking checker.
Blue Apron, blue apron.

571
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:46,700
As you covet for less
than 10 bucks per meal,

572
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:50,150
blue apron delivers all the fresh
ingredients you need to create home cooked

573
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:52,880
meals. Just follow the easy
step by step instructions.

574
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,400
This is actually a cool thing. This
is, I would definitely try that.

575
00:33:55,401 --> 00:34:00,170
Can blue aprons and that's
some stuff? No. Oh, okay. Neil.

576
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,030
We got too much shit.
I'm trying to get rid of shit.

577
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:04,160
I don't need a bunch of
way friends hanging around.

578
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:10,130
They said you food in a recipe card.
I haven't even finished this.

579
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,550
That's what blue apron is. What are you
talking about? How do I know what this is?

580
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,010
You're doing? The average has any,
you don't know what Blue Apron is.

581
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,370
They send you the ingredients and then
the rest they send you the exact amount

582
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,350
you need so you don't buy
it too much or too little.

583
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,420
Well then they should call it
blue recipes, shouldn't they?

584
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,330
Maybe you do want me to read it.

585
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,450
Each meal can be prepared and I'm just
saying if I was young, right, and I was,

586
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,000
you know, dating or anything,
this is a great way. Hey,
let's stay in tonight. Well,

587
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,950
we're a little blue apron.
We can do that.

588
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,190
Each meal can be prepared
in 40 minutes or less.

589
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,530
No overwhelming trips
to the grocery store.

590
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,060
No more sad takeout.
Oh, look at the noodles.

591
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,480
No matter how I love that,
they just have to shit on everything else.

592
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:53,060
It's convenient. Why do you
have to take grocery stores down

593
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,370
no matter your dietary preferences?

594
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,220
Blue Blue Apron makes it a breeze to
discover and prepare dishes like I am not

595
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:08,340
reading all of these fucking
things. At least read three. Let's,

596
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:11,810
we'll do like a little like a Donny and
Marie here. I'll read the first one.

597
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,750
Chicken Fried Chicken.
With what?

598
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,750
And you've not heard of chicken fried
chicken. You wrote chicken fried steak,

599
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,010
chicken fried chicken with big sweet
potato when Quick Collard Greens.

600
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,940
Oh look at him.
Go

601
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,360
Shrimp Po boy sandwiches with
Tribeca bread. Locked in.

602
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,340
The fuck is striped backup bread.
Maybe we should go to blue apron. Dot.

603
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,740
Steak and egg number for ourselves.
Steak and eggs with Kimchi fried rice.

604
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,810
That sounds good.
I love Kimchi.

605
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,790
Spice Catfish with pious direct
style rice and creamy saffron AOE.

606
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,110
Ooh,
I used to be my stripper name.

607
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,580
Seared pork with sprinkler such an old
jokes. Dot. Dot. Turn off the computer.

608
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,570
Not C'mon, c'mon. I like Yo here.
Uh, radishes and sugar. Snap peas.

609
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,820
Hash with ranch yogurt. I haven't heard
of it after the shit. One word. Oh,

610
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:12,690
radishes and sugar. Snap Peas
Hash with, I know, I guess. Yeah,

611
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:15,630
it has to do with ranch yoga. I speak
the language. That sounds great.

612
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:19,260
In your own kitchen. Cook with
ingredients that you've never used before.

613
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:24,030
Like watermelon, radishes,
Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh.

614
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,370
And purple potatoes, ab clicks
with purple potatoes. Oh,

615
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,640
we used to go to the farmer's market

616
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,140
every Sunday and it was all
dirty people walking around.

617
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,720
What dirty people are just,
you know,

618
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:40,320
he's talking about the vendors and all
the lefties you'd recommend like the

619
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:43,260
Hippie Carmela's guys,
all the man buns,

620
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,180
the fucking hair fallen
into the fucking Kim.

621
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,180
She kind of plays into the way you
could definitely buy weed there as no,

622
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,100
I actually,
I don't mind the farmer's market,

623
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,840
but I hate how you have to get there.
I just hate that.

624
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,390
I know you gotta get there early. He
got to get there early. It's like, do I,

625
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,380
let me just go down the street and
I'll just get the poison oh and recipes

626
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:05,160
between 500 to 700 calories proportion.
Delicious and good for you right now.

627
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:08,790
You can get your first two meals for free.
You get blue apron.com/bird.

628
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:12,090
That's blue apron.com/bird blue
apron. A better way to cook. Actually,

629
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:16,260
I like farmer's market because if
they actually are local farmers,

630
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,180
I like to, uh, support them.

631
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:21,240
But I know the corporate food has
worked its way in there. You know,

632
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,890
they just take off corporate potatoes
and they just write, hey man, potatoes.

633
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,260
And then it, it's like me by him thinking
I'm sticking it to the man. Hey man,

634
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:35,790
potatoes only two this week.
Can you believe it? Great.

635
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:39,570
I read these things.
Helux a great group. Uh,

636
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,440
right now it's not helix helix. Was that
the name of the group? I don't know.

637
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,870
Gimme it. Oh, oh, see, see
what are you talking about?

638
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:52,680
What you want to do rob do rocky,

639
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,870
you don't remember that song now?
It was like a, I dunno what it was.

640
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:57,210
It was one of the most bizarre things.

641
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,630
And there was some reason they
would dress like fucking cavemen.

642
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,360
That sounds like an eighties thing. Oh,
absolutely. It was an eighties thing. Oh,

643
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,810
well you know how old I was in the 80s
like I would, I, I don't remember sermons.

644
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,010
Yeah. But you know, other things was,
speaking of robots taking over everywhere,

645
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:15,890
how can you have a can make a robot do
what James Brown did? You can't you kit.

646
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,441
You know what?

647
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:21,441
But there's some fucking nerd trying to
insert oppression in pain into a robot

648
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:24,630
to see if they can give
it a little bit of soul.

649
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,570
It's like x Masha. They stay, start
treating it worst than the other ones

650
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,020
are ex machina or however you
pronounce it, night after night.

651
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,990
I really feel like it's helix.
Helix night after night.

652
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:42,670
Two people lay in the same bod.

653
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,200
I was going to say it's
bed night after night.

654
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:51,100
Two people lay in the same bed, but when
it comes time to buy a new mattress,

655
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,510
only one gets their way
until near the fucking top.

656
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,130
Until now.

00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,610
Dr. Carver. Oh, it's carvers. I've
been saying carby the whole time.

701
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:56,180
Dr Covey's as Dr Carver's.
I never noticed that.

702
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,300
It's a lot to cure disease.
He shaved

703
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,580
Dr Carver's. Shave butter is where
it's called easy shave butter.

704
00:42:06,581 --> 00:42:09,730
That was a little too fucking, I don't
know what, what are we making here? Huh?

705
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,760
What are you making here? I put this
on my face. You share about that.

706
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,150
This is the first time they've ever done
something like this and once you try

707
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,540
dollar shave club.com you'll become a
proud member like millions of others.

708
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:23,650
One reason is because they deliver amazing
razors right to your door for a third

709
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:26,650
of the price of what?
The greedy razor corporations judge.

710
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,560
That means when you
join dollar Shave Club,

711
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:33,040
you could afford to shave with a fresh
blade anytime you want, you want want,

712
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,480
which feels fantastic.

713
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,680
You'll get a first class shave when you
use the executive blade without hurting

714
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,460
your wallet.

715
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,460
Another reason is their Dr Carver's shave
butter carver carver using it with the

716
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:49,330
executive makes the blade glide
gently for the smoothest shave ever,

717
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,590
ever.
Dr Carver's shave butter,

718
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:55,300
is it your average shave cream?

719
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:58,210
It's a unique conditioning formula

That's dollar shave club.com/bar
high dollar shave club.com/bar

726
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,330
oh yeah, it's tough. It's tough.

727
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:27,050
That's why I fuck around and them because
I'm not going to have people subjected

728
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,560
to my fucking reading out loud without,
you know, if it's a funny train wreck,

729
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,490
like the way I read is like me watching
that old guy fall off the scooter.

730
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,530
Oh grandpa grampy did you take
it to first? Hey, guess what?

731
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:42,300
My Boston Bruins did tafe today.

732
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,350
Did they do something that's going to
put them in the running to be in the

733
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,980
Stanley Cup finals? Uh, the playoffs,
the playoffs last week, you know,

734
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,900
we were fucking possibly could be a,
you know, a bunch of shit had to happen.

735
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:58,140
You know, basically the ranges and the
capitals had to keep losing or whatever.

736
00:43:58,141 --> 00:43:59,520
And we could have gone past them.

737
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:03,630
I've been in first place in the eastern
conference and then we lost five in a

738
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:07,980
row. Okay. And today we have, we
want our first one PB Toronto,

739
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,060
thank Gosh in breweries. Yeah.
It was going to be a shit show.

740
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,410
We lost five in a row. We fucking
lost to San Jose, Anaheim, the kings,

741
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,940
then the ranges and then the panthers
and the wheels will fucking coming off.

742
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,560
And then uh, of course as always
Berge run and shower fucking step up,

743
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,300
you know, for the, uh,

744
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,510
I guess the tying goal and then the ahead
goal and what's his face Boleski get

745
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,620
the fucking empty net or I missed the
whole game because we were at Brunch and I

746
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:40,200
was sitting there watching you
looking absolutely gorgeous.

747
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:44,330
Treating the wait staff.
Is that why you didn't want to go to that?

748
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,500
No, I didn't. I didn't know.

749
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,900
I didn't want to go cause I thought
your mom wanted to go to someplace where

750
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:51,630
everyone was going to go and everyone
was going to show up with their Easter

751
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:53,240
hats and I was gonna be
standing out in the sun.

752
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,440
It's going to be a 45 minute wait.

753
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,740
If you guys want to go down the street
and get some drinks and then maybe come

754
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:02,570
back, we'll give you this vibrating
square. Yeah. And I don't want to do that.

755
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,620
Not to be that. No, it ended
up being great. Ended up
being great. Oh by the way,

756
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,730
I haven't even talked about it.
And the,

757
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:13,080
I played the terrorist's data last night
and long beach is the place where a

758
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,760
Richard Pryor did the greatest
standup special of all time.

759
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,150
I want to thank everyone who came out.
I had such a great time,

760
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:23,151
but for the first 10 minutes I was
literally freaking out going like that's

761
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:26,760
where he told the white guy, you
know, sit your ass down. You know,

762
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:31,650
this is where he did. My monkeys died.
And I remember in the end when I waved,

763
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:32,101
good night,

764
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:36,300
I remember how he finished to set doing
the woman having the orgasm and the

765
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:40,120
whole place goes nuts and eating enough
to say goodnight. He just waved. Ah.

766
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,730
I started to watch the special,

767
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:45,510
I had to stop watching it because I knew
it would fuck up my set but like it is,

768
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,650
if it is the definition of a
comic who's just in a zone,

769
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,950
he walks out from the beginning to end.

770
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:57,920
It gives me like fucking goosebumps when
I watched that special to this day he

771
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,010
is the greatest,

772
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:04,190
it's not even fucking close and I got
to basically stand and do stand up there

773
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,410
and I just can't believe I watched
that special since I was a kid.

774
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:11,580
And you walk in and it looks the exact
same way you drive in his where he drove

775
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:15,930
him with his wife when they filmed the
special and it all still looks the same

776
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,320
and as I was walking in I was getting
like the chills and you just walk in and

777
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:24,050
it's like there it is. This is, this
is it, this is the place and it,

778
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,650
and at the end of the show, when I said
goodnight, Dean del Ray came out and out,

779
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:31,770
showed me in the spotlight,
went on him so it wasn't on me.

780
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,840
And so it wasn't in my eyes anymore.

781
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:36,510
I could just see the spotlight
hitting the tops of everybody's heads.

782
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,820
And that's the way I saw the theater,
you know,

783
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:42,570
cause they didn't really show the
crowd in that special. And, um,

784
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,460
it was just one of the
coolest things ever.

785
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:46,920
And then the night before I
worked at theater in Riverside,

786
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:51,660
California that they actually debuted,
gone with the wind. The first,

787
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:54,660
you know, before they had the official
premiere, it Mann's Chinese theater,

788
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:56,460
they wanted to make sure
the sound was our rights.

789
00:46:56,461 --> 00:47:00,720
So they just headed east and they,
uh, they shot at, I don't know,

790
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,770
they fucking,
whatever.

791
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,450
They played the movie out there
and I got to stand on those stages.

792
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,140
It was fucking tremendous. And I want
to thank everybody who came out. Um,

793
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,890
it was fucking amazing. It's
fucking amazing. Yeah. Um,

794
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,240
and lastly before we get
into the questions is the,
uh, the Lincoln Continental.

795
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:23,310
All right. I talked about this,
you know, this guy who drove us,

796
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:25,770
we got a driver to take us down to long
beach because I knew it was going to

797
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:29,650
have a couple of whiskeys after that. You
know, I was trying to be responsible. So,

798
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,640
um, you know, I, I was sitting
there going like, you know,

799
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:36,040
I like to Lincoln Continental.
I hope they don't fuck it up.

800
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,430
I hope they make it fuck with
the Mercedes Benz. You know,

801
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,150
like those really make this a nice car.
Like fuck. With the seven series BMW,

802
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,510
I went to seem to be a nice
fucking car and I was saying,

803
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:49,390
you'll be cool if they actually brought
back the suicide doors and the driver

804
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:50,650
was going, yeah, they're doing that.

805
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,810
The top of the line is
going to have suicide doors.

806
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,870
And I went and I looked it up
and here's a picture of it.

807
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,060
How sick is that fucking
car? That's very cool. Um,

808
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,510
where I'm going to post this picture
and it's just the concept car.

809
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,500
And as far as I know, they didn't
fucking do it. Why wouldn't you do that?

810
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,310
Look at that. The how fucking food.
That is the sickest fucking shit ever.

811
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,250
Yeah. Look at that car.
Yeah, I see. No, it's cool.

812
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,680
I'm looking at, hopefully you guys had
just you looking at the picture right now.

813
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:27,730
They even had like the trunk comes up
and slides forward and then the bottom

814
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:31,880
kicks out and they should fucking luggage.
You can see it in real life. They can.

815
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:32,321
We know.

816
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:35,320
What you have to do is you have to buy
the car and then you've got to take it to

817
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:38,590
one of these wizards out here and say
you see that? I want you to do that.

818
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,580
One of those gas monkey guys.
Tell him to fucking do that to the car.

819
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,760
Wait, what's this one though? I saw on
the bottom this, this is a Lincoln. Yeah.

820
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:52,690
This is what the led lights and in
this one, the led lights like the,

821
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,100
the Lincoln continental,

822
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:58,030
their emblem also lights up
in led lights as fucking sick.

823
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,110
That's nice to them.

824
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:03,670
17 Lincoln continental to
replace 2016 Lincoln Mkx.

825
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,680
Yeah. I'm either going to get that.
I'm going to get that Dodge Ram,

826
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:13,690
r t s sport, like just a two door, no
extra cab, none of that. I just, I'm,

827
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:14,740
I'm such a Ford Guy,

828
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:18,250
but I just fucking love the way
the dodge Ram Hemi truck looks.

829
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,940
One of the other one or the other.
But I'm going to get some,

830
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,530
I'll probably get the old man car. That's
me. Right? You're definitely an old man.

831
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,270
I am. God Damn it. I thought it was cool.
I guess I'm not. All right, so here we go.

832
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,300
Unless they fucked the car up and then
I'll be right back to square one. Um,

833
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,730
look at this fucking guy.

834
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,020
Wait a second.
You are addicted to Worldstar hip hop.

835
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,710
Watch these videos constantly.
Dude. It's the funniest shit ever.

836
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:53,410
So sick. His fights. It's the funniest
fucking videos. And then there's all this,

837
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,870
all this rap shit that I'm never going
to fucking, I'm just see that site.

838
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,550
I'm too out of the loop. And I ended up
seeing like, oh, it was a guy, I liked it.

839
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,840
Trinidad, Trinidad, James.
James. Yes. The fucking book.

840
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,630
Guy's a genius. I don't
know. It's a fucking G. Yay.
Yes. He's totally different.

841
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,010
You don't think he is.
I enjoy a couple of his songs,

842
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,290
but I wouldn't go that far.

843
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,170
He didn't see the fucking video where
they had the things in that Ida look

844
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:24,940
cooler shit. They did that in the
fucking, the opening to that movie belly.

845
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:29,810
This is not like a new concept.
Look, everything's been done.

846
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,030
You could do that to my
Yak. Hawaii being, yeah,

847
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:33,980
he's treating everybody like
a fucking way to this week.

848
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:37,040
I'm trying to give somebody a shout out
who got plucked out of a record deal.

849
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:41,510
You know what I mean? It's true.
You know, unbelievable. All the,

850
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:45,140
I get to criticize shit. I see that.
All right, let's get onto the, uh,

851
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:49,160
the scope to the, uh, let's get to the
questions here for this week. Alright.

852
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,270
Daredevil dear Billy. Nunchucks
uh, you know nunchucks are

853
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:57,770
yes. Bell. That was it right there.

854
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,410
That was it right there.

855
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,050
You just asked me if I knew
what nunchucks I just asked you.

856
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,360
Yeah. I can't even read out
loud. I'm not judging you. Fuck.

857
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,160
All right.

858
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:14,190
Last year someone recommended
you to watch a dare devil.

859
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,160
I would like to reiterate that a year
later, season two is the shit. Uh,

860
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:23,330
the punisher fucks people up the way
he should and you actually believed the

861
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,960
love story. Tons of cool fight
scenes. Watch it with the whiskey.

862
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:31,040
Not sure if Neil would love it, but this
one's, this one's for you. All right.

863
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:34,220
I'll give it a shot. Heard. It's really
good. Well, let's let her watch. Watch it.

864
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:37,010
Let's watch it tonight. Okay. We'll watch
it. You want to have a whiskey with me?

865
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,090
Sure. Whiskey with all
frisky over here. Um,

866
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,440
sorry. Skin infection. Oh,

867
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:50,060
the question everybody has not been
waiting for. All right, dear bill,

868
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,320
I was hanging out with this girl
and I think she gave me a quote.

869
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:58,850
Skin infection. Oh No, I
haven't been with anybody else.

870
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:02,510
I confronted her about it and she
said she didn't have any symptoms.

871
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,820
I am 100% sure I haven't been with
anyone else and I contracted it from her.

872
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,290
She's acting like nothing happened.
And I didn't say I got it from her,

873
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:13,820
but it's still kind of weird.

874
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,930
Should I take my chances and
get back with her or move on?

875
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,540
What kind of skin infection do you have?

876
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,300
Means Std. He's just
trying. I know. Okay. Um,

877
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,260
I was hanging out with this girl.
I mean if you were,

878
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,930
if that was the only person that you had
slept with and like the last six months

879
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,630
and you didn't use protection and uh,

880
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,760
I mean as long as you told her just get
treated and I mean that's up to you if

881
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:45,510
you want to keep banging this girl or not,
but don't keep being in this girl.

882
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,350
Yeah, I'm probably not.
Especially if she, I mean,

883
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:51,150
because the thing is she could
at least be like, all right,

884
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:53,640
well let me go get tested just in case.
Yeah.

885
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,500
And then you could both be tested for
everything and get treated for everything

886
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:01,680
and that's all good. Yeah.
Going, I go your separate ways.

887
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,420
This is how this thing starts
off. Yeah, it's not good.

888
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,760
He obviously likes bagging her,

889
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,510
otherwise he wouldn't be asking this
question and might not be too many

890
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:13,170
prospects on the horizon.
If this is what it's come down to.

891
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,750
I'll go the obvious one. She's really
good at fucking, but she's done it a lot.

892
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,520
A lot of people maybe, maybe, well, maybe
she got on well, I mean she got unlucky.

893
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,120
Maybe she just had the gift.
I don't fucking know. Jeez.

894
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,100
Well I hope whatever you
got is hero section. Go to
the doctor. It gets treated.

895
00:53:31,101 --> 00:53:35,340
Use Protection. Like don't be an
idiot. Stop raw dogging out here.

896
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,320
Okay. New Girls. No new
car. Sorry. New Car.

897
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,550
That was like a Freudian slip.
Like get a new girlfriend.

898
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:48,840
Get the fuck out of that
thing. Oh Man. Dude,

899
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,090
that's brutal. Makes you happy to
be married. All right. New Car.

900
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,770
Dear Billy Blue Book.

901
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:00,360
I'm in the market for a
new car like yourself.

902
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,390
I want to get something,
use something with character,

903
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:07,230
but my girlfriend thinks I'm holding
onto the past and I'm trying to be hip in

904
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:10,200
my own way.
She wants me to get a Passat.

905
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,500
What do you know how much of a creepy
sell out I'd have to be to drive a facade.

906
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,550
Thoughts? Sexy car. Why would your
girl wants you to get a facade?

907
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,120
That's some lame. I would want to see
the man. Mankind, not a fucking facade.

908
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,450
This keep on top of it was that,

909
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:31,080
but I also fucking drive an eight year
old dented Prius. I know, but you're,

910
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,420
I mean, I'm a frugal son about this. I
think it's a little bit different. Why?

911
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:38,730
Why is it different? Well, you didn't
tell me to get the fucking thing.

912
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,170
You know what is,
you know what it is out there.

913
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,850
There's so many fucking men and women
out there that that will derail your

914
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:46,300
fucking dreams.
They,

915
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,980
I wonder if she wants him to get a car
like a facade because I feel like that's

916
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:54,981
a reasonable safe car because she's
trying to get you to save up for a ring or

917
00:54:55,501 --> 00:55:00,000
an apartment or something. Yeah. Look
at that thing. That is not, oh my God.

918
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:04,020
That's his solace as my car I've
ever seen in my fucking life.

919
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,220
That that is so boring. Yeah,
free is at least it's like,

920
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:12,500
what is that a Passat?
Whatever.

921
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,410
I was horrible and defected. Germans made
that Germans usually fucking crush it.

922
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,150
Well then I'm sure it's very efficient.

923
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:25,470
Leave that one alone. Um, but
other than that, I'm not into it.

924
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,830
I think the biggest thing here is what
happens to a lot of people when they get

925
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:32,970
into a relationship is, look, there's
definitely going to be some compromises,

926
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:36,390
but like when your heart's fucking racing
and you want to fucking do something,

927
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:40,320
or the person you're with and you can
see it, like this is something they want.

928
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:43,140
This is something of a passionate and
something's gonna make them happy for you

929
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:46,320
to try to fucking talk him out of
it. Like, why would you do that?

930
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:49,830
She wants him rain. That's why. And
she's trying to get them not to spend,

931
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,440
I have to spend money on an
older car that needs repairs,

932
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:55,740
pairs and the this and that and the other
when he could be saving for it rang.

933
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,400
I guaran fucking see it. Switch
to thinking. I absolutely think,

934
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,690
well if he gets a used car,

935
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:05,520
isn't that cheaper than
going out and getting a new
Passat? Uh, what, what is it?

936
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,940
Um,
what did he wants it?

937
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,800
I want to get something used and then
with character things I'm holding onto the

938
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,940
past and trying to be hip of Myeloma,
but does he meets wrong Kevin?

939
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,000
A little bit of style.
Asset. Car. He must plastic.

940
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,780
The miss means you have something like
that. She wants one of us get up the sun.

941
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,700
Right? She wants him to get a
nice cost. Modern. No, she uses,

942
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:28,050
we're going to have a family
and a house someday. Oh, car.

943
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,060
That's what that's about. Read between
the lines. Read in between the lines.

944
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,250
Oh, I thought she was the dream
catcher. You know, dream catcher.

945
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:39,740
Dream catcher is like,
your dream is this is my dream.

946
00:56:39,741 --> 00:56:42,740
And then she catches it and she puts
it in your pocket like a dream killer.

947
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,890
Dream killer. Right? But
you got to catch it first.

948
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,720
It's like an ant.
You can't kill it much.

949
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,330
You just decide that things
are what you want them to be.

950
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:57,380
That a dream catcher is
really what a dream killer is,

951
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,200
but you have to catch it. Catch it
before you kill it. Okay, honey,

952
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,140
I live in my own little world
over here. Alright. Magma,

953
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,020
magma. Okay, dear bill, have you heard,

954
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:14,490
have you heard about the lonesome blues?
Have you heard of magma?

955
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,230
I just saw them in la.

956
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,870
They definitely sound like some
sort of fucking metal band here.

957
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,250
I'd never heard of them,

958
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:23,760
but what the friend of mine
who works in post production,

959
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,870
the drummer is 68 and unreal. All
right. I already loved this band.

960
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:32,220
He plays a combination of Jazz and
progressive style beats, tons of soul.

961
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:36,600
The music is interesting. An
operatic, oh, he invited his,

962
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:40,020
he invented his own language
and it's really out there.

963
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:44,490
Please look some up and give you
a reaction on the podcast. Well,

964
00:57:44,491 --> 00:57:47,160
let me fucking do it really quickly.
We're running out of time here.

965
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,790
Let's see here. What do you think?
You think you're gonna like it?

966
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,480
Well, I'm curious about it. I'm
surprised the dude I was, I,

967
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:58,950
when I saw this crazy fucking band,
Bobby Lee's Bobby Lee's brothers in it,

968
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:03,300
and I went and I saw this crazy fucking
bad. Like I don't, I got to the show late.

969
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:05,750
I can't remember the name of the
band, but they'll fucking hot. Yeah.

970
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,940
Somebody tagged me in a picture you
took with one of the band members.

971
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,320
I had the best time

972
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,500
they had this one. Still look them up
so he can give them a shout out. Okay.

973
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,150
I the best fucking time.

974
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:18,850
All I remember was there fucking
they're closing song was,

975
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,370
was that the guitar was like
really likes fresh, fresh, fresh,

976
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:24,760
and the guy just what's going
like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

977
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:28,570
no, no. That was, it was just so
ridiculous. It was awesome and funny.

978
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:29,301
And I was just going to say,

979
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:32,950
you should put that on an album cover
and then have all the lyrics like written

980
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:37,740
out like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh,
there French. Oh, they are Mac, mother.

981
00:58:37,741 --> 00:58:40,630
Weird. Weirdest band in the world. All
right. Let's, let's see what we got here.

982
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,493
Yeah.

983
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,890
All right. I'm already in. I kinda
like it too. I would go see that.

984
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:56,950
That reminds me by about to this kind
of stuff you always reminds me of.

985
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:01,460
I used to go see, have you used to go see
Oz noy down in the village? Mas Noise.

986
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:04,530
O. Z. N. O. Y. Yeah. You
still always have like,

987
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,750
we'll Lee would be down there and Keith
Carlock would sit in and just settle.

988
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:11,590
He's insane drummers. Um,
look at me. Look at that.

989
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,130
Oh my God. Yeah. I love it.

990
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,070
They all look a little long in the two.
That actually

991
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,950
good. These guys are all BS. That guy,

992
00:59:23,951 --> 00:59:27,010
the bass player looks like the cop that
walked up to the guy in the fucking

993
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:31,100
scooter. Yeah. All right. Oh
my God. I love these guys.

994
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,270
I'm speeding up. Oh,
what's going to happen?

995
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:40,860
Hang on. Why can't leave
it here? Here we go.

996
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,850
I'll let me fast forward so you'd
have to sit through. All right,

997
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:56,370
dude. I would just add this is the, yeah,
this is when it starts getting weird.

998
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:00,270
It gets all fucking night. Yeah, I'm
in know what I feel like if there was,

999
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:04,350
if we had our own version of the Andy
Warhols factory or something like that,

1000
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,920
like a big loft space downtown when we
just had a bunch of our artists friends

1001
01:00:07,921 --> 01:00:09,060
and assorted Weirdos,

1002
01:00:09,061 --> 01:00:12,330
we can have magma playing in the
background and it just would make a lot of

1003
01:00:12,331 --> 01:00:15,600
sense and we're cause you could drown
out all those assholes that hang around

1004
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:16,434
with people like that.

1005
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,820
I'm not an Andy Warhol
fan on on any level.

1006
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,260
Or you don't like his like persona?
No, I respect the originality of it,

1007
01:00:25,261 --> 01:00:29,220
but I also just feel like a lot of it was
smoke and mirrors and it was very like

1008
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,560
that hipsters sort of
sort of the original,

1009
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,680
the original of like that hipster shit.

1010
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,640
Like am I going to paint a soup can and
then like it's some sort of comment on

1011
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,070
capitalism and everything and
it's just like, all right,

1012
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,800
but is it a really a deep comment
on it because it's not moving me.

1013
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,910
I Dunno. I mean I like Andy
were high like his stuff.

1014
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:55,800
I feel like that was a very cool time
to be in New York City during that time.

1015
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:59,100
I feel like I would've loved to
been a part of that scene, but, um,

1016
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,340
it just seemed to me like it was a
bunch of nerds trying to be cool,

1017
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,250
pretending like a lot of hipsters to me.
I think there were a lot of,

1018
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:09,030
I Ms. Smith that found each other and
they created like their own little world

1019
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,340
and they became cool because of that.

1020
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:12,690
Yeah,

1021
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,790
that's what I think. All right.
Because there's a bunch of like,

1022
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:17,970
you know what a transgendered
people and just like, yeah.

1023
01:01:17,971 --> 01:01:21,360
College and they're just automatically
cool automatically. Cool.

1024
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:22,800
Can you just listen to what I'm saying?

1025
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,780
Like there's no asshole
transgendered people.

1026
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,420
Okay.

1027
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:31,420
Can I explain to you what it was the
bringing together of all these different

1028
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:34,970
kinds of people and that was
different in New York City.

1029
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:37,820
It was like a whole birth of interesting,

1030
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:42,530
like outsider perspectives and giving
them like a platform and like you're a

1031
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:47,290
freak and you're cool. No,
no, I absolutely think so.
Then like though the, uh,

1032
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,270
what is wrong? Why can't, why
if I have a different opinion,

1033
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:53,630
you gotta fucking get upset. No, it's
not that you have a different opinion.

1034
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:57,050
Is that you literally didn't even let
me finish my thought before you just

1035
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:59,740
hopped on that whole thing
and that just makes you sound.

1036
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,400
I interrupt. It's what I do. Fine.

1037
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,780
You're taking this way too seriously.
Look,

1038
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,800
do I have any sort of artistic style of
looking at me like I'm in a buffalo wild

1039
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:18,860
wings. I'm going to sit here and criticize
fucking Andy Warhol. Her fucking,

1040
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:21,781
oh yeah.

1041
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:25,500
I took an an Elvis cover that somebody
else already created and then I painted

1042
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:29,550
red and blue stripes across the war.
How can a very easily made that poster?

1043
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,530
That's the kind of stuff that he made.

1044
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,680
Actually there is a poster of
him and on John Michel Basquiat,

1045
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:37,500
that was kind of like my tour poster.
Yeah,

1046
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:42,360
like the kind of like battle of them
boxing and stuff like that poster could

1047
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:46,170
100% have been what Andy Warhol did
if you were famous back in the day.

1048
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,500
That's what I'm saying.
So he's saying he's not original.

1049
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:55,080
I'm saying the person that did that,
perhaps putting a head on something,

1050
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:00,270
was he the first guy that he's the first
day I was Photoshop shit style to that

1051
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:03,490
poster, which is really cool
by the way. And like that.

1052
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:07,770
It reminds me a little bit of
what Warhol might have done.

1053
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,873
That's all I'm saying.

1054
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:15,750
When you went to a museum though, like
let's be honest, I don't like them.

1055
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,460
I really don't like it. Look, if
it's, if it's a bunch of old cars,

1056
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,730
if it's painting old cars, if it's
paintings, uh, cars, you know,

1057
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,550
there's a big debate actually,
the art community,

1058
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:31,551
our automobiles works of art and they
took a Ralph Lauren's car collection and

1059
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,970
they stuck it in one of those
fucking stuck up museums there.

1060
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,720
Moma, whatever the fuck it is.
Museum of natural history. The, the,

1061
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:47,100
I don't think they put it in. Let me
see the fucking on the fifth avenue,

1062
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:51,480
whatever the fuck it's called. Every
other fucking broad. I dated in New York,

1063
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:54,630
that was always the first date. Like
they, oh, let's go to a museum. It's like,

1064
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:59,010
well you stop back and look at smart.
Stop doing this.

1065
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,040
Just cause you're dumb. Does stop
trying. Trying to be, oh for fuck sakes.

1066
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:06,480
Let's just go out and get a drink and
see if we can deal with each other.

1067
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:09,750
I got to go fucking sit there
and stand next to you in silence.

1068
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,880
Reading Shit above dinosaur bones.
Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun.

1069
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,110
I'll meet you there.
Um,

1070
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,950
no I don't like them.
I don't like,

1071
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,980
one of the worst museums I
ever went to was when we went,

1072
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,370
we were in Vatican City and we should've
gone to the right just to look at that

1073
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:32,430
overrated painting on the fucking ceiling.
We went to the,

1074
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:35,850
can we just pause and I just,
they know what I'm talking about.

1075
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:37,860
They know about the Sistine Chapel,

1076
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:42,910
so fucking overrated sizing the
art that was in the mannequin.

1077
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,740
Like this art, that's like hundreds
of planet. I'm telling you what now,

1078
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:51,480
like this amazing, if I bought
that building torcal fucking art,

1079
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:53,790
if I bought that building
the Sistine Chapel,

1080
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:57,300
I would turn that into a cigar room and
I would let that smoke go right up into

1081
01:04:57,301 --> 01:05:00,540
that overrated. Do they make
it seem like it's fucking huge?

1082
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:04,650
There's no way it took that long
bill.

1083
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:07,770
You went in there and you looked at him
for like five seconds and then you were

1084
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,070
like ready to get a fucking
Panini bull shitting you.

1085
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,100
I'm going to tell you I'm going to end.
He was like the original contractor.

1086
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:17,970
They said, hey, can you paint my ceiling?
Uh, yeah. Yeah. This will be easy.

1087
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:22,290
I'll have this done in like three
fucking weeks. Fucking four years later.

1088
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,650
Yeah. They're fucking the
green page on back order.

1089
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,370
He's got 20 other ceilings
he's fucking working on.

1090
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:32,020
Um,

1091
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,620
I mean you can't tell me when you went
through the whole Vatican thing and you

1092
01:05:34,621 --> 01:05:38,560
watched every fucking investement that
every goddamn pope ward like after a

1093
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:41,940
while you like, I get it. They all
wore these ponchos with a cross on it.

1094
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:46,080
I was fascinated by it because
I love religious art. Oh, okay.

1095
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,970
What about sexual assault? What about it?
He'll fucking 800 pound gorilla. What?

1096
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:56,130
Don't they have a little something
about that in there? Yeah,

1097
01:05:56,131 --> 01:05:57,470
cause I kind of went,
yeah,

1098
01:05:57,471 --> 01:06:00,360
well that would have ruined the
year while there was an art,

1099
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:02,370
the way they hit all those pedophiles,
all those years.

1100
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,600
That's an art form to be moving all
those chess pieces around while still

1101
01:06:06,601 --> 01:06:08,310
collecting the money and not paying taxes.

1102
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,530
What does that have to do with
the art that we're talking about?

1103
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:13,840
Saying of the Vatican?
Well,

1104
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:16,810
if I was to talk about a certain
somebody Sitcom right now,

1105
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:19,600
I think you would bring up
some of his offstage behavior.

1106
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:27,180
Are we talking about Cosby? No, we're
talking about fucking slapping. Right?

1107
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,090
Uh,
the,

1108
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:36,750
the priests are the ones that
were painting the fucking
Sistine Chapel Bill. No,

1109
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:38,370
I taught,
I'm not talking about that.

1110
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,170
I'm talking about when we looked at
every fucking fork and chalice that Pope

1111
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:47,820
John Paul the fucking 58th.
When you go into the Sistine Chapel,

1112
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:51,900
which admittedly I thought it was
the 16th chapel. Did you really?

1113
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,180
You don't remember that we are
staying on line. I remember I said,

1114
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,660
you know what I would do, because this
line is so fucking long. If I lived here,

1115
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:00,990
I would open a bar across the street.
Now we call it the 17th chapel.

1116
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:06,750
And you're like, why would you call it
that? I was like 16 chapel to 70 chapel.

1117
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,950
And he just looked at me and your
eyes narrowed. And he said, Bill,

1118
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:16,160
it's the Sistine Chapel.
And I said,

1119
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,200
that's my story about Rome.

1120
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:24,730
Okay.

1121
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:29,030
Alrighty. Fuck all you guys.
All right. 37 years old,

1122
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:33,230
ladies and gentlemen. Yeah,
I'm not into that shit.

1123
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,820
Okay. You know. Okay. See that,
look at you. You're an angel.

1124
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,900
You can see through my
stupidity. You don't have to
be into it. I still love you.

1125
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,590
It's, you know, it is a good
guy. It's still, you know what?

1126
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,850
But the reality is that there are
certain things that are common knowledge.

1127
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:53,060
I really should have known that.
I would think so.

1128
01:07:53,061 --> 01:07:57,350
But I bet a lot of people think it's the
16th chapel. You know something I don't,

1129
01:07:57,351 --> 01:08:01,640
uh, I don't like, I don't get
embarrassed by shit like that.

1130
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:06,580
You really don't know if I think I would.
Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was the 16th.

1131
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:10,670
I didn't know it was the disgusting and
then a big, oh my God. It's assisting.

1132
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:11,540
It's like,
did,

1133
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:16,590
is anything in there from something
that you created then shut up.

1134
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,190
What are you, oh, that was the
Apollo 13 mission. Oh really?

1135
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,390
You were fucking astronaut.

1136
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:30,230
It's just sitting in this diner with
me getting fucking eggs, aren't ya?

1137
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:34,490
And they're not the farmer's market once
either. It's why you don't like the,

1138
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,301
the museums.

1139
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:38,510
Do you feel like there is a pretension
and people who like art and stuff like

1140
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:42,170
that? It's too much fucking
shit. It's too much reading.

1141
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:47,240
It's reading. Oh my God. It just
keeps going and going and going.

1142
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,250
And then there's people whispering.

1143
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:52,523
Sure.

1144
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,840
That's what happened to me in the,

1145
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:00,910
in the Sistine Chapel when we walked
in and I was just like, oh wow.

1146
01:09:00,911 --> 01:09:01,820
It's kind of small anyway.

1147
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,043
Sure.

1148
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:04,410
Oh,

1149
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:07,120
I wanted to put that guy's head right
to the fucking stained glass window that

1150
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:11,880
we were in a church. So it's like a holy
place. So you know, you gotta keep it.

1151
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:14,670
Why would think they went on a certain
level of noise to drown out the

1152
01:09:14,671 --> 01:09:18,690
children's screen in the basement? Oh
my God. They deserve it. Fuck them.

1153
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,810
Pieces of shit. Um, we can't,
we can't end it with that.

1154
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,270
Why isn't the dog coming in here?
I'm a little concerned. Oh, play. Oh,

1155
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:33,240
because she's a Clo. Oh, poor
thing. She's right there,

1156
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:37,980
right baby. All right. That's
the podcast for this week.

1157
01:09:37,981 --> 01:09:41,970
I'll check in on you.
She was sleeping on Thursday.

1158
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:46,800
What's that? Oh, she was
sleeping. Okay, cool. All right.
She was just sleeping well,

1159
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:51,540
thank you for hanging out on the
podcast. Thanks for having me. All right.

1160
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:52,800
I'm glad you came by.

1161
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,630
I don't think those stories of people
falling off shit would have been as fun

1162
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:00,610
and somebody to bounce it off of. Oh,
look who's here. Sleepy old gray bear.

1163
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:05,970
Yes. Seeing your dog. I know.
We just realized that dog's
a senior now. She's eight.

1164
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,560
She's eight and a half years old.

1165
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,270
Starting to get a little bit
of white in her face. Yeah.

1166
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,290
That made me sad and it made me happy.
You know,

1167
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:17,010
she had a rough first year and a half
and she's just been fucking chill in ever

1168
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:21,990
sense, haven't you cleo? She looks
great though and she's still adorable.

1169
01:10:21,991 --> 01:10:24,000
She's still our little
baby no matter what.

1170
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,250
Well I think she had to pay rent at
this point. All right, that's it.

1171
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,920
I'll talk to you guys on Thursday
and once again, Sarah, see Matt,

1172
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:35,150

1175
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,750
And I want to thank Dean
del Ray for crushing it both
nights. And um, that's it.

1176

I got Canada coming up later on this
week. I'm going to be in Ontario. Um,

Oh Geez.

1183

fucking show. All right. That's it.

1184
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:18,420
I'll talk to you guys later.
