week. Um, been doing a bunch of,

7
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,070
a bunch of, uh, what do you call it?

8
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:30,071
Their promotion for F is for family that
comes out next Tuesday at midnight on

00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:33,140
Netflix season to

Um, please tune in if you enjoy it.

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,080
So then we could do a season three,
three, three. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,980
yeah. We'll see what happens. I um,

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,110
I know it's been such
a whirlwind of press.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,600
What the fuck did I do
yesterday or two nights ago?

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,220
Okay.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,770
How was that something? I wear
a sport coat. I do know that

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
I have absolutely no recollection
where I was two nights ago. Last night,

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,720
we went over to Netflix, this new
building they're taking over the world,

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,490
the new building and

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,070
Oh, I know what I did. I know what I did

23
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,570
there was for Emmy consideration,
they had it, they had the thing there.

24
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:31,571
And you sat there on a pen panel and
it was a Judd Apatow Chelsea handler.

25
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,020
Uh, the woman who created friends,
I gotta tell you right now,

26
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:41,900
if I created friends,
I would never come out of the house again.

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,280
I'd have so much goddamn money.

28
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:47,690
I would just be sitting in there
with the biggest drum kit ever.

29
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,340
And I'd have a fucking helicopter.
I don't know why, but yeah,

30
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,950
I'd be all fucking weird. I'd be like
growing my nail and I cutting my nails.

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,890
You know,
I beat Howard fucking huge

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,900
and it was me. And then the guy
from, uh, the Santa Clarita Diet,

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,630
that was pretty cool. You got to
sit there and every, I tell us

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,410
Zillow,
when you're creating your show,

35
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:12,110
what is it that you do when
you're creating the show?

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,553
MMM.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,250
Okay.

38
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,280
Does any of this stuff in the show,
is it based on you?

39
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:20,690
Is it made up or is it something
else that we don't know altogether?

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,280
And he answered all the questions and uh,
you hope you get out of it unscathed,

41
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,640
which I think I did.
Sorry.

42
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:35,350
So what's funny was I actually wore
a sport coat and then Mike Price,

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,170
uh, cocreative efforts of family, the
Great Mike Price from the Simpson.

44
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,770
So I could not do f is
for family without him.

45
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,150
He was dressed casual to last
night when we went to the,

46
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:49,170
the new Netflix building. They're
taking over the world. Um,

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,300
yeah.

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,520
I said, I am not going to, I'd
said in Django, you know what,

49
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:56,100
I'm just going to wear a fucking button
down, blah blah. And as I pull in,

50
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:00,100
Mike Price has a jacket on. I got you.
What fucking jacket? No, I'm the bum.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,370
So we were laughing about that and
everybody else had on a jacket.

52
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:07,030
So I just look like the, uh, the fucking
artist showing up. Like, hey man,

53
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,100
I just like roll out of bed
man. And Yeah. You know,

54
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,340
when everyone feel and I
just putting on me and um,

55
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,420
but we sat through two episodes,
the first two episodes.

56
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,490
It was a friendly though,
you know,

57
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,980
everybody pretty much in the crowd was
on the show and they will laugh and

58
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,430
having a good time. So I
hope you guys enjoy it. Um,

59
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,260
I was on rich Ising yesterday.

60
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,860
I don't know if he can go to some
rich i's and.net and watch it.

61
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,640
I had a great time, so thank
you to him. And uh, then I did,

62
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:37,150
Bill Simmons had a great time on that one.
Um,

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,560
and I got coming up next week.
I know I'm doing Craig Ferguson,

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,160
who's the greatest special I've
ever seen of doing his and uh,

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,520
there's something else. Somebody
look at my phone, I should,

66
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,230
I'm trying to promote these things

67
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,683
mmm.

68
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,390
Before I, uh, doing that
would probably be good. Right.

69
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:03,750
Rather than telling you after I did them.
I mean, that would make sense. Bill,

70
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,140
the whole thing about promotion is
let people know something's coming.

71
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,190
Not that it came and went.

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,800
Okay.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,940
Oh, I know. I could actually,

74
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:14,900
I have a Gig for the California
Highway Patrol Booboo, but the two,

75
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,120
but that at the dead.

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,960
Oh yeah, I'm going to be on my best
behavior. You cannot know enough cops.

77
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,210
There's some great life advice.

78
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,260
You have no idea when you're going
to snap, you just walk into a bank,

79
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:31,850
you're going to make a
deposit. You just think, hey,

80
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:35,720
what if I just pulled my shirt up over
my head and passed them a note? You know,

81
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,050
you have no idea when for some
stupid fucking reason you do that.

82
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,190
And then unfortunate, hopefully when the
cop shows up, he's like, get out of crap.

83
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,550
I'll wait a bill. What are you
doing? Huh? All right. No. All right,

84
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,220
well I'll take care of this. Everything's
fine. There was no gun or a day.

85
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,810
It takes you outside. So what the fuck
you gotta get Outta here? Get outta here.

86
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,800
His son of a bitch,
you like dead.

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,540
And that right there is
called white privilege.

88
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,630
I don't know who's not white
or listens to that. You know,

89
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:04,130
he times I've gone in and robbed
the bank and it's, you know,

90
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,860
I've never been successful,
but I've never gone to jail for it.

91
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,960
It's because I am a white male, you know,
and I might get in trouble for this.

92
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,690
I might lose some of my privileges
if I let non. Why do you smell that?

93
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:19,040
I've actually on six,
maybe seven if you want to get technical.

94
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,630
First Time it was, I made a joke, but on
six, six and a half different occasions,

95
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:25,010
I made an attempt to rob a bank.

96
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,570
I was caught but knew the cop when they
will come in. Five out of six of those,

97
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:33,710
another time the guy was like, oh, you
look just like me and he let me go.

98
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,920
Those are all true stories. Um,
then you can add those to the,

99
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:43,520
to the non fake news in your life.
Um,

100
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,450
I flew a fucking helicopter this morning,
but getting back into it,

101
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:53,210
I'm up over 120 hours a,
my auto rotations are looking okay.

102
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:56,750
Last week they were fucking horrific.
Put the collective down,

103
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,890
fucking followed it. And I didn't go
aft cyclic and it was like, oh my God,

104
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,724
am I going to die?

105
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,300
Yeah,

106
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,910
getting good on the radio again.
I got this great fucking APP.

107
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:11,210
If you want to listen, if anybody else
there is into aviation of something,

108
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,950
I just,
you know,

109
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,950
cause you don't want to sound
like a fucking moron when
you're making your calls,

110
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,750
which uh, you know, I do on a regular
basis, there's an app called live a t c.

111
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,640
Dot net.
It's really cool.

112
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,520
And you just click and you can
listen to whatever airport you want.

113
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,850
I was listening, you know, when
my flight's taking off, you know,

114
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,110
I don't care about what does it,

115
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:35,111
magnetic deviation or whatever the
fuck it is from my cell phone or was it

116
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,340
magnetic something or there
retardation. I can't, I don't remember.

117
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,770
All I know is I'm going back and I'm
going through all my ground school again,

118
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:46,970
trying to remember all the Shit I'm
reading about fucking weather and uh,

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm having a great time,

120
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,650
get myself back to where my skill level
was right before my lovely daughter was

121
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:55,400
born. And, um, I don't
know. I'm totally into it,

122
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:59,450
but the only thing I don't like about
those Robinson's is that the mass bumping

123
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,170
in the low Gi pushovers and uh,

124
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,340
someone was telling me today that they
had to have a fully articulated rotor

125
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,880
system. We didn't have to fucking deal
with that. And for those of you don't fly,

126
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,900
a mass bumping is basically
when the blades attack the mast

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,920
and break off the helicopter.

128
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,020
If they don't get bent and then slam into
the cockpit and cut your fucking legs

129
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:24,950
off or you right in half,
you know, that could happen.

130
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,690
So that happened on those bell helicopters
I guess that they had in Vietnam.

131
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,980
And, uh, you can't, you know, when
they would fly low to the ground,

132
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,210
they'd go up the hill and you know,

133
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:38,500
cause they was trying to stay at the tree
line so they wouldn't get shot at they

134
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,360
way up in the air and they would just
fly and they'd go up the hill and then

135
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,850
when they would dive down the backside,
that's the thing.

136
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:45,680
When you push forward
with the stick like that,

137
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,190
you're not supposed to do that in
a semi articulated rotor system.

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,250
What happens to the,
see if I can remember.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,030
Basically what happens is the
main rotor is still spinning,

140
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,690
but it's no longer producing
lift with the helicopter. Right?

141
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,300
You've sort of been this low.
Gee thanks. So what happens is,

142
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,180
is if it goes counterclockwise,
you main rotor, your,

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,060
your rear tail rotor is going to
be on back behind you on the left.

144
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:11,690
And so you're,

145
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,560
it's still going to be compensating for
the torque that the main rotor is no

146
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,400
longer producing.

147
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,250
So it's going to push you over and
you're going to roll over to the right.

148
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,790
And what's fucked up is as
you roll over to the right,

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,290
the way to get out of
it is counterintuitive.

150
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,780
You would think that you would
move the stick left. You don't,

151
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:34,781
you move it slightly back after you go
aft to reload the main rotor to get back

152
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,510
underneath it. So when she's
fucking watching the ground
coming up on the right,

153
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,530
like I don't want to go there,
you will move the stick.

154
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,170
Like you want to do a backward
somersault rather than roll back up.

155
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,950
It's completely fucked up.
You got one chance to do it.
If you pull back too fast,

156
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:53,870
I think he chopped the tail off. So
there's that, which is why I don't fly.

157
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:55,590
If there's any sort of wind,
I don't fly.

158
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,840
But you know there's a
danger with anything that
you do if you're not risking,

159
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,810
are you really living?
Um,

160
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:07,440
I have to get on Instagram and I have
to become some sort of motivational

161
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,930
comedian. That's what I want to do. I
want to start giving you guys nausea,

162
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:14,490
eating fucking life lessons,
you know,

163
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,670
is I'm believing a gym
or a fucking juice bar.

164
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,790
What is with all these
fucking cops on the,

165
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:24,240
on Instagram acting like they're
trying to inspire you. It's you're not,

166
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,660
you tried to show me what
great shape you're it

167
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,380
Hashtag doing this one for you guys.
The fuck out of here.

168
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,860
Um, Instagram, horse, male
and female. All right,

169
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:41,940
so the Celtics, they won a
game. Holy Shit. Holy Shit.

170
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,310
So we have game five tonight,

171
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,370
which every Celtic fan knows that we
are basically eight quarters away.

172
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,440
If we can survive the next eight quarters,
we are eight.

173
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,760
No actually not eight quarters.

174
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,790
The next 11 quarters we are 11 quarters
away from Kelly Olynyk taking over this

175
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,780
fucking series and
getting us to the finals.

176
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,240
I know I say a Thomas' out.

177
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,460
I know they got fucking Lebron
Kevin Love.

178
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:15,540
They got all these mother
fuckers. I understand. Okay.

179
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,910
Do you know what Boston has?
We got hot,

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,110
so we always have never have
explosive speed. We have a strick,

181
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,330
no explosive newness with
all our draft players.

182
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,320
If he's got a quick first step and can
dunk where lag now pass that guy on.

183
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,590
Where can this guy do look like?

184
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,840
He's going to trip over his
own feet and he's white.

185
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,670
Gimme that guy you always happened.
And then we got the the like the,

186
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,140
the bruise and black dudes, but we just
never have those above the rim guys.

187
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,660
We just don't have explosive guys.
You know Isaiah has been, you know,

188
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:53,040
he's like five foot eight. So all
I'm saying, okay, but you know,

189
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,430
Crowder, he's going to get a say, you
know something. The younger kids though,

190
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,380
Brown Bradley, those guys, I love how
Bradley keeps trying to dunk on the Bronx.

191
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,690
He keeps missing the fucking rim.
No, that wouldn't, I liked that guy.

192
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,200
So anyways,
I don't know what I'm talking about.

193
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,110
All I know is the remaining Celtics,

194
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,540
just all you gotta do is get us to
the fourth quarter end game seven.

195
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,580
All right? And then the garden's
going to come alive. Kelly Kelly,

196
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,473
Kelly,

197
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,990
and he's going to hit a fucking zone
and I don't know what's going to happen.

198
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,990
He's going to be so in the zone.

199
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,060
He's not even gonna need a
headband anymore to keep his,

200
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,860
his locks out of his face and he's
just going to find, I don't know,

201
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,260
he's to start draining threes and that's
going to be all she wrote for the land.

202
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Okay. Anybody want to put money on
it? I'll put money on it right now.

203
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,510
If we can somehow survive the next 11
quarters. Kelly, that was not a book.

204
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,360
Everybody thinks it's a fluke.

205
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:53,361
I'm telling you that man has ice water
in his faints Arctic fucking polar bear

206
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,070
swimming around in his fucking veins.
Microscopic ones.

207
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:03,010
I'm telling you the
thing is he's just bored.

208
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,030
He doesn't give a fuck about game five
one through four or even game six or even

209
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:12,550
the first fucking half. Actually
no, he had a good game game seven.

210
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:17,551
We just have to get to game seven and
the man that I've always been confused as

211
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,320
to why he was on the team.

212
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,250
I once again got hit with a
cold bucket of reality of bill.

213
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:28,600
You're just a stand up comic. You
don't know shit about sports led Danny.

214
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:32,380
Ange make the calls and
if Danny Ainge says,

215
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:37,381
Kelly Olynyk is the fucking man that
I am standard down you way Cleveland.

216
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,470
I know you're fucking nervous.
You are.

217
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,940
You are so scared that we are somehow
going to win game five and gave six

218
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:50,210
without Isaiah Thomas or Kelly Olynyk
gets dunked on and people go right around

219
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,780
up. You fucking wait man. We
get to game seven. It's over.

220
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,080
That man shows up to play.

221
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,690
All right. I'm an idiot. Anyways.

222
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,640
Carely carely um, let's uh,
let's move on to the, uh,

223
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:11,530
the predators. Holy Shit. Hey, anybody
in Montreal, the Montreal Canadian fans.

224
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:14,680
Did you notice that the guy that you
traded for, cause he was too flashy.

225
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,760
You know, you didn't like
his personality. PK Subaru,

226
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,470
it was really your front
office on this one,

227
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:25,420
but I'm going to play blame the fan base
yet another former Canadian leading a

228
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,830
team to the finals, leading a team
to the final level is my front door.

229
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,980
By the way, if you wonder what that beep
was, I didn't read the refrigerator open.

230
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm so hoping that the predators
when the cup, because um, the Bruins,

231
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:40,630
we'll never catch the Montreal community
Canadians and the amount of Stanley

232
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:41,171
cups they have.

233
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:45,790
So all I can do is tease them about the
guys that they got rid of that then went

234
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:50,290
on to win cups elsewhere. Is
it petty? Oh, I think it's,

235
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,620
I think it's very petty. Who Do you
like tonight? Games. Seven Games.

236
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:57,940
Seven penguins. Penguins. Where's
the fucking, Otto was senators.

237
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,780
Where is that game? It was an an
Ottawa. If you're in Pittsburgh,

238
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:02,591
you want to go to the game,

239
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,030
you can probably just walk up to the
gate and buy a ticket. Kenosis this,

240
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,220
it's a transient city. You know, it's
a capitol. People don't give a shit.

241
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,950
They're from other places.
They're Calgary fans that live there.

242
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,370
Edmonton blue jackets.
They don't give a fuck.

243
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,630
They're not going to the Goddamn game.
Uh, what do you guys think? I actually,

244
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,300
for some fucked up reason,
I think,

245
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,740
I think auto was going
to win only because, um,

246
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,840
I dunno, the penguins have had a
little bit of gold tender issue there.

247
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,500
That's the only reason.
But that's all right.

248
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,670
I'm guessing the 10 seconds
that I paid attention.

249
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,380
Why do I talk about sports right now?

250
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:41,650
I'm too fucking busy running around
doing podcasts. Um, you know what?

251
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:45,850
I was so busy last week. I forgot
to read the, uh, the question.

252
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:50,710
So let me read this. Here's another person
giving me shit about bills. Fake News,

253
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,870
Delta Rant,
Billy fake fucking news.

254
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:57,440
I was listening to your podcasts from
last Monday as I was sitting on a Delta

255
00:14:57,441 --> 00:15:01,430
flight heading to Los Angeles from Austin,
Texas was at,

256
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:04,910
pardon until that fucking story and one
of your readers brought up the Delta

257
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,910
Airlines incident where a
dad was threatened to get
kicked off and jailed if he

258
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:09,860
didn't stop complaining and fall in line.

259
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,970
As I was listening to your useless
fucking rant, still a huge fan.

260
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:17,480
I noticed how uninformed both you and
your reader, we're on the situation.

261
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,670
All right. Time out here. First of all,

262
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,330
if you guys are going to come at me
with uninformed and fake news, I,

263
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,530
you new to the podcast.
I don't really,

264
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:32,160
I just commented on for fucking series.
I've probably watched three minutes in.

265
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,960
My job is to make you laugh.
It's not to get facts.

266
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,210
What the fuck you think
you listen in to hear, sir?

267
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,830
I could have easily Google that and
figured out what I was talking about.

268
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,410
Don't come at me like use
some sorta Rhodes scholar.

269
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,080
Like I'm impressed that you're going
from Los Angeles to Austin, Texas.

270
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,400
Are you going to keep it weird name
when you get to Austin, Texas. Austin,

271
00:15:55,401 --> 00:16:00,401
Texas is one of the most
overrated overpopulated
fucking cities and this goddamn

272
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,060
country. You know why cause La
concert like you keep moving there.

273
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,350
Who actually if you teach you
research you'd realize it.

274
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm not from La [inaudible] from Austin.
He lets me tell you something buddy.

275
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,150
I don't give a fuck where you from.

276
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,790
The mere fact that you're dumb enough to
try to get fucking accurate information

277
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,070
from this podcast and you
think that I'm uninformed.

278
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:27,071
I used to do a radio show
called uninformed with with
better call Saul's star

279
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,450
breakout star Joe de Rosa,

280
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,020
the teen idol sensation sensation

281
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,070
from the now defunct
opie and Anthony Program.

282
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,880
That's what really broke up ob,
Anthony and Jimmy. It was the,

283
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,910
the sheer star power of Joe de
Rosa coming in once every 16 weeks.

284
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,480
They just all had to go their separate
ways because when they came back into the

285
00:16:56,481 --> 00:17:01,400
studio, when they looked at one another,
all they can be reminded of was, was the,

286
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:05,660
the force of Joe to Rose's talent.
All right.

287
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:08,630
Do you want to look that one up there
and go on when your flight from La to

288
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:13,580
Austin? He said as I was listening
and Blah Blah Blah Blah. Um,

289
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,860
okay. I know. Okay. First
the seat that, that,

290
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:23,000
that the dad was bitching about being
sold to another passenger was actually his

291
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,780
18 year old son's seat. All
right, now where did you get this?

292
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:30,320
At delta.com cause they're not,
I don't trust these guys either.

293
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:33,380
I don't trust you either. How do I
know you're not fucking Eddie Delta,

294
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,900
son of a Ulysses Delta who
fucking started the airline, um,

295
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,870
who we put on an earlier flight by buying
a separate ticket instead of notifying

296
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:45,500
delta that he was changing his son
flight to an earlier flight. Doing this.

297
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:50,501
He thought he could magically have an
open seat to him for his who is under two

298
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,960
but that wasn't the case. Jesus, this
guy's spreading the seam and outer.

299
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,600
He's got an 18 year old and a toddler.
You go buddy, keep banging away.

300
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,410
You see when you decide to put your son,
I don't fucking go.

301
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:08,280
You see like you're fucking
talking down to me. You dumb cunt.

302
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,960
All you did was researching my
job, sir, is to make people laugh.

303
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,540
That's it. I, my job is not the fucking,

304
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,760
I don't have fucking time to figure
shit out. What am I still in school?

305
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,360
I got in this business to not have a job.

306
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,670
How am I going to sit here and
research your guy's fucking emails?

307
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:30,270
I don't care what your right to me,
unless it sounds totally ridiculous.

308
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm going to treat him as long.

309
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,000
I've also flown a lot and I've noticed
that they don't give a fuck about you.

310
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,570
I remember one time I was on a flight
and they had the inner calm on,

311
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:44,730
so God damn loud. You needed like
earplugs and I said to the stores, I go,

312
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,450
is there any way you can turn that down
a little bit? And she just goes, no,

313
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,580
I'm sorry sir.
There's nothing we can do about it.

314
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,890
It's like you're telling me that they
installed an intercom system without a

315
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:00,730
volume knob and it was at full blast.
That's what you're telling me there.

316
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:04,500
Why are you being difficult?
I'm not being difficult.

317
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
All right with you fucking crooked toes.
All right.

318
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,890
You see when you decided to put your son
on an earlier flight by buying another

319
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:13,190
ticket while not telling Delta,
they assume that the,

320
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:17,160
the 18 year old son did not make it on
his original flight because he didn't

321
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:20,700
check in and they weren't notified that
the dad bought a completely separate

322
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,960
ticket. So they gave the seat away to a
standby passenger per standard protocol.

323
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,591
Also,

324
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,520
FAA regulation disallows a child under
two to sit in the standard seat without

325
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:32,970
the proper child seat and harness. So
there's another thing that dad got wrong.

326
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,750
You can't have a child
with a different name.

327
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:38,220
Sit in a seat that he sold to your 18
year old son. All right, fair enough.

328
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,030
Imagine all the,
the issues this would calls cause if we,

329
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,150
what if we allowed for anyone to use his,

330
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,180
any ticket that was issued
in someone else's name.

331
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:52,560
His mistake was that he didn't check in
and notify Delta and should have paid

332
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:56,460
the change fate to send his son on an
earlier flight with the same ticket and

333
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,000
then buy another ticket for his toddler
if he had the proper safety hardest for

334
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:03,240
the toddler. Uh, tickets are not
transferable to another passenger.

335
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm not defending the flight attendant
who I thought said some things that were

336
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:08,010
inappropriate by threatening jail,
et cetera.

337
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,920
That's really what I was
commenting on, buddy. All right.

338
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:14,270
That they're sitting there acting like
he did something in the Pentagon. Um,

339
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,030
however the dad was completely wrong to
think he can somehow put his oldest son

340
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:22,080
on an earlier flight home and then
use as original ticket. What this guy,

341
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,610
he's got an 18 year old and a two year.

342
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:26,700
He's too busy fucking without a
condom to research all of this.

343
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,370
How about having a little empathy for him,
sir,

344
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,410
on your Los Angeles to Austin
flight fucking jackass.

345
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,540
What is the oldest sons? Um, which
is okay. Put it as okay. However,

346
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,770
the dad was completely wrong
to think he could sum up,

347
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:45,660
put his oldest son on an earlier flight
home and then use his original ticket,

348
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,590
which is in his oldest son's name.

349
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:50,920
How many times are you going to say the
same thing on the two year old toddler?

350
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:54,590
So he and she, because he or she could
sit in that seat of Delta Nuwella

351
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,430
just wanted to clear up your fake news
rant. You misinformed cons. Oh God.

352
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,250
Everything's fake news is
it's, it wasn't fake news, sir.

353
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,670
It was just me trying to make you fucking
laugh. Okay. That's all it was. Okay.

354
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:09,130
I'm glad you researched
and cleared all of that up.

355
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,140
Okay.

356
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,800
At the end of the day,
at the end of the day,

357
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,810
I'm just here to make you laugh. Okay.
So please people for the love of God.

358
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,190
All right. And stop acting like, you
know, I can't do what you just did.

359
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,301
Okay.

360
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:29,260
Girls stabs boyfriend and avoid jail
time because it was damaged her career.

361
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,060
Now what am I supposed to do here,
sir?

362
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,820
Am I really supposed to
fucking sit here and research?

363
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:37,450
This is if someone's going to go to jail
with the jokes that I do or should I

364
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:40,570
just take it at last so I can
get on with my fucking life?

365
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,930
Here's the deal. Why don't you got, why
don't you be the fucking the fact police.

366
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,390
All right, I'll do the rent the
next week. You can correct me.

367
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,930
That was my uninformed short. They
would gel to Rosa. We just pick a topic.

368
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:56,020
We'd go off on it, we'd be completely
wrong and then we'd bring an expert in.

369
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,190
That was literally the shell.

370
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,520
People would learn things and
there was laughs to be had.

371
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,480
All right girls stabs boyfriend and avoid
jail time because it would damage her

372
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,760
career. Hey there, Billy beats.

373
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,030
I'm sure a million people tweeted and
email you this article. Actually. No,

374
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:13,090
they didn't. Well, maybe they did. I don't
know. This girl stabbed her boyfriend,

375
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:16,660
but the judge agreed that any sentencing
would damage her future career in

376
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:20,620
medicine. Jesus Christ. Go Fuck Yourself.
All right, let me, let me read this here.

377
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,190
Go to the page. Oh, here we
go. Click here. Oh, this.

378
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:30,130
This is UK news. God knows this
probably happened in America.

379
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,900
I find the UK people love
to fucking did you see this?

380
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:39,760
That happened in your country. You
guys are all fat and stupid. All right,

381
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:42,880
here we go. Wow. Jesus.
Wow. I see what happens.

382
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:44,980
She's got this little
angel smirk on her face.

383
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,300
Aspiring surgeon Levina
Woodward admits attack,

384
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:54,160
but judge to first sentencing because
of her extraordinary talent. What?

385
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:56,680
He blew her back in his fucking chambers

386
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,660
and Oxford University studious
who's wider than my fucking legs.

387
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,130
Stabbed her boyfriend with a bread
knife. Okay. It's a bread knife.

388
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,840
May Not go to jail because it could
damage your prospects of a medical career.

389
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,740
Accord has heard,

390
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,190
well what sort of training and maybe she
could've stabbed them and sewed him up

391
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:21,250
real quick.
Aspiring hat surgeon.

392
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,780
Okay.

393
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,780
Levenia would-would 24 punched and stabbed
her boyfriend during an alcohol drug

394
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:32,350
fueled row at Christ church college.

395
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,650
This is an on the
guardian.com is this credible?

396
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,300
She so she's on drugs and she's drunk and
she punched and stabbed her boyfriend.

397
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,700
She admitted unlawfully wounding.

398
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:48,320
The Cambridge University who
she met on the dating app.

399
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:52,460
Tinder. All right, well not to blame
the victim, but what did he do?

400
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,270
You can do that with men.
What did he do? Judge Ian.

401
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,390
They're always named Ian over there.
Ian Pringle.

402
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,720
Nigel or Ian QC.

403
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,470
I'm sitting at Oxford Crown Court.
I was,

404
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,080
this is like the school court.

405
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,090
Is that what it is that she go to trial
at the fucking skull that's taking her

406
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,350
money?
I don't know.

407
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:19,850
Said he would take an exceptional course
and to first sentence for four months

408
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,090
hinting that Woodward would not
be jailed because of her talent.

409
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,850
It seems to me that this was a one off.

410
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,200
This was a one off drunk,
drugged up stabbing.

411
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,090
Is that what goes on in England? If you
go to Oxford, they give you one free pass.

412
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:40,370
As long as it's a bread
knife and not a steak knife.

413
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,230
A complete one off to
prevent this extraordinary,

414
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,960
extraordinary able young talent,
young lady,

415
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,990
lady from not following her long held
desire to enter the profession she wishes

416
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,850
to would be a sentence a what's B,

417
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,210
which would be a sentence
which would be too severe.

418
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,800
Then some fucking judge speak to enter
the profession she wishes to would be a

419
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:07,700
sentence which would be too severe.
He said that sounding fake.

420
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:11,420
That sounds like somebody's trying
to sound like a judge. What you did.

421
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:15,320
We'll never, I know leave you, but
it was pretty awful. Pretty awful.

422
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,060
That's an understatement. And normally
it would attract a custodial sentence.

423
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,170
She's going to be a janitor,
whether it's immediate or suspended.

424
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,620
He said Woodward, who
lives in Milan, Italy,

425
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:31,790
but the mother stabbed her then boyfriend
in the leg after punching him in the

426
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:35,150
face and it was below the waist.
So that's a misdemeanor, right?

427
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,370
She then hurled a laptop,

428
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,650
glass and jam jarred him during the
attack on the 30th of September last year,

429
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:46,010
the quarter she was in court
to hear the judge's comments.

430
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,170
The court was told that Christ's church
would allow her to return in October

431
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:56,171
because she is that bright and has had
articles published in medical journals.

432
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,620
Do do you realize that if this is true,
how fucked up this is

433
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,080
that then they have the,

434
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:07,280
the trap car that they drive down to
impoverished areas and they'd leave it on

435
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:09,200
with the keys in it and the door open.

436
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,870
Why don't you fucking help
somebody out down there?

437
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,580
You gotta be white as a ghost going to
fucking Oxford and they know they're

438
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:19,640
going to make a bunch of money off
your given a prescription drug someday.

439
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,500
Wow. All right. Anyways,

440
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,170
Woodward will be sentenced
on the 25th of September.

441
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,700
She was given a restraining order and
told to stay drug free and not to Rhea

442
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,290
friend. Hey, if you don't mind,

443
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:38,150
could you stay away from the person you
stabbed and lay off the fucking pills or

444
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,120
whatever the hell he said she had taken.
A spokesman for Christ shirt said,

445
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,150
I'm afraid that Christ church does
comment on the circumstances of individual

446
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:49,320
students. I'm a little
confused. If that was a,

447
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,110
I would think that that would
make it to real court. Not just,

448
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,220
she's a little thing to fucking lunatic,
but she's an animal in the rack. Huh?

449
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,370
Um, yeah. I mean that's
par for the course. I mean,

450
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:04,100
women do not pay the same fucking price.
You know,

451
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,790
white guys get away with shit that
black guys did. There's all fucking,

452
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,000
there's all different.
Before you do the crime,

453
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:14,570
you really should just do the
math and be like, what am I?

454
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,990
Oh,
what's up sweetheart?

455
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,720
She's coming in here and yeah, I can,
I can't be funny without cursing.

456
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:27,710
He can't bring my lovely daughter.
Is that my jot in there?

457
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,480
Um, am I watching her now?
Is that what's going on? No.

458
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, are you coming to hang out? Oh,
you want to be on the podcast? Hey,

459
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:45,570
listen to this shit. Some woman
punched, stabbed in through a laptop,

460
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:49,380
through a window in a drug
and alcohol fueled rage.

461
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,460
And they gave her a suspended sentence
because of her extraordinary talent in

462
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:57,120
the metal. Or pretend it could
damage her career in the future.

463
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,390
No, she stabbed her boyfriend in the leg.
Oh, get over here with a bread knife.

464
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:07,350
It was a bread knife. You know what
the fuck go around stabbing people.

465
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,820
He has a bread knife near Renee Hill. You
know you want to make a bumper sticker?

466
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,180
You know what? That's good. You can't
go around stabbing people. That's right.

467
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:18,240
You can't go around stabbing people
even if it's with a butter knife.

468
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,080
So what is it? They let her off.
Why? I'll show you what it is.

469
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,390
That's what it is. And the, oh, cause she
is wine. Yeah, he goes to Oxford. Yeah.

470
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,590
Okay. Damage her career.
Oh go fuck yourself.

471
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,340
Whether a little other little, a little
blondie white girl and a moto jacket

472
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,360
that says and is sitting in
this world. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

473
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,180
When she actually killed somebody.
Next time we'll see.

474
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,580
You can't kill someone with
a butter knife. She'll use,

475
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:52,400
I show you this fucking steak knife next.
She's crazy.

476
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,580
Is a butter knife a gateway to
a steak knife? I believe so.

477
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:57,110
I believe if you're willing
to pick up a butter,

478
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,820
neither willing to beg
them just about anything.

479
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,550
You conclude your case. Yeah. Can I,

480
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:06,920
can I hear your closing
arguments for this white lady?

481
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,980
If you were talking to the jury.
All right. You were in England. See,

482
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,860
we're in a powdered wig so it's even
more creepily white for you. Go ahead.

483
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,160
I have to wear the, I think
everybody has to wear one over there.

484
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:20,660
They're big into dress up over there. I'm
a king. I'm a queen. Who? I'm the duchess.

485
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,080
Okay, Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, I know that.

486
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:31,190
What's her name? Uh, Levenia.

487
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,900
I know Luvenia Luvenia
Woodward looks innocent,

488
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,260
but you're staring into the eyes
of a psychopathic would be killer.

489
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,770
That's all I got, man. I thought you were
going to trash her mice wispy way fee.

490
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:52,570
Little white bitch break.
If I tried to hand her a nail file.

491
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,870
All right.
From an airline mechanic to complete with,

492
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,960
to compete with cheapo airlines
like southwest or jet blue,

493
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:01,300
the majors need to oversell seats.

494
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,050
In the case of passenger
misses their flight.

495
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,760
When passengers Miss Flights,
they essentially buy two seats for one,

496
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,240
the one they missed and the
one the airline rebook them on.

497
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,910
They do this to maximize
revenue per flight.

498
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:19,420
I'm against what United did because they
could have paid someone 1 million for

499
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:23,230
this seat and still not lost as
much as they did. Unfortunately,

500
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:27,900
entitled people want to pay for
an Uber and sit first class.

501
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,510
Uh,

502
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:33,310
it's hard to balance enough profit to
operate in eight three 21 cross country

503
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:38,370
keep prices low and still try to run
the airline like it did in the 70s.

504
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:41,440
Flying isn't as prestigious
as it used to be.

505
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,680
And everyone is looking for a way
to save a buck. Loved the show.

506
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,630
Go Fuck Yourself. All right, so
evidently passengers are, oh,

507
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:50,410
so I'm to blame.
Well,

508
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:55,330
let me ask what was going on in
the 70s that isn't going on now.

509
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,890
Is there a way more people flying?

510
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:00,970
Did you guys go after bottom feeders so
you have more airplanes so you have more

511
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:01,900
overhead?

512
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,460
I don't understand why it was so procedure
prestigious back in the Ron Burgundy

513
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:09,960
days and they treated you way better.

514
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,100
Now they just jam everybody,
you know,

515
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,120
in the back of the plane and try to put
the seats closer together so they can

516
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,970
get more rose. Did you
say Ron Burgundy? Yeah.

517
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,580
That's not a real person. No, but
that the era was like in the 70s.

518
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,980
Okay.
The Ron Burgundy Seventies.

519
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,100
What's a matter with them as a matter with
that man? Um, I would say, uh, I want it.

520
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:33,881
Why is that?
I,

521
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:36,400
this is really interesting to hear from
people who actually work in the field.

522
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,790
Like what happened?
Um,

523
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,720
what happened to the price of
fueled go up so high I don't get it.

524
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,490
Why would they just raised ticket prices?

525
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,430
Because on the average person
couldn't afford it. Well, good thing.

526
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:52,080
Get them the f out of there. Right? Wait,

527
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,060
sorry. I don't know why I came in
here. I'm really kind of checked out.

528
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,380
All right. Yeah. Well you got, we got it.
You've been dealing with the kid all day.

529
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:05,150
Who puked on me right
before I did this puke,

530
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,470
it was split up and it
was just a little bit,

531
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,200
you act like you're witnessing someone
getting executed in front of you.

532
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:15,640
Every time she spits up you're like,
oh my God. Like, oh that humanity.

533
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,340
I was sitting there and she was smiling
and out of nowhere she went that it just

534
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,140
fucking all came out and it's all warm.

535
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,760
It's like somebody poured clam
chowder on me and I was laying down,

536
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:32,020
so one of my shirt, my belt, my
pants, and it's just like, yeah,

537
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:34,300
I think I had the normal reaction
to somebody puking on you,

538
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:36,280
no matter how cute they are.

539
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,410
How cute are you? All right, let me,
let me, Oh wait, wait. What'd you do?

540
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,293
What'd you do?

541
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,790
Okay.

542
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,930
Price.
What did you do?

543
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,600
All right. I hope that wasn't a
bunch of silence here. Maybe it was,

544
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:06,570
maybe it wasn't. I don't know. Um,

545
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,650
I see someone wrote you something
about an article that I read. Oh,

546
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:15,160
my family's slaves article. Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,310
That was an intense article. I
want to, what does this person say?

548
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:21,460
Can you read the question? Yeah,
that's what I was going to do.

549
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,960
Can you not sit on the recorder again?
All right. My family slaves article. Hey,

550
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:30,340
Bilbo Baggins longtime listener.
First time email.

551
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,340
Um, I read an article written by
Alex Tos on, he's dead now. Okay.

552
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,691
That's shock me,

553
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:40,960
but didn't really necessarily
surprise me and I love your cultural,

554
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,550
a cultural perspective on it. Oh
my God, this is so fucking long.

555
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,990
And this article, this guy talks about
his family owned a slave for 50 years.

556
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:55,000
Even after immigrating to America,

557
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:59,170
they smuggled her with them and all that.
They treated her like shit,

558
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:02,290
never paying her,
forcing her to sleep on top of laundry.

559
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,910
I imagine it's the dirty laundry.

560
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,390
Why would you want to have somebody in
constantly beating her for the tiniest of

561
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:11,224
Eris?

562
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,180
Only when the writer grew up with an
American identity that he realized what

563
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,130
they were doing to the
poor woman wasn't right.

564
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:22,150
Did he and his sibling confront their
parents over this? Hey Mom, you know,

565
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:25,510
you've been thinking this
lady's sleeps on our clothes.

566
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,640
Guarding my teacher. That's not
right. As a guy of Chinese descent,

567
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,800
raised in the Americas,
raised in America.

568
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:36,610
I've witnessed poor people like
this firsthand. Growing up,

569
00:34:36,611 --> 00:34:39,580
visiting family back in Hong Kong,
I'd see my cousin,

570
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,630
they're millennials by the way,
being tended to by a young Filipino girl,

571
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:47,770
no older than her twenties I never thought
much of this back then. Looking back,

572
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:49,390
it seems pretty fucked up.

573
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,930
I asked my mother about these kinds
of people and she simply said,

574
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,350
that's just the way things are.
These girls are poor.

575
00:34:56,351 --> 00:34:57,670
They need to support their family,

576
00:34:57,671 --> 00:35:00,070
and that's the only kind of shitty
employment that they can get.

577
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,110
Once my grandfather took me past city
hall and Hong Kong on a Sunday and I saw

578
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:08,410
hundreds of young Filipino girls just
sitting on the ground doing absolutely

579
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:10,900
nothing. I asked him,
what was that all about?

580
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,980
He said that Sunday was a day off and
they had nothing better to do than loiter.

581
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,010
They sent all their money
back home to their families,

582
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:21,190
so it's not like they could shop
or go to a restaurant or anything.

583
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,470
They ate and slept with their employers.

584
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,270
I never seen my grandfather turned his
nose up at a group of people like that,

585
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:32,110
but biff ever before my grandfather whose
parents were murdered by the Japanese

586
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:35,530
during World War Two. Oh Wow.
Yeah, I read about that shit.

587
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:40,531
The rape and Nan King every that they
fucking Japanese went off and had to walk

588
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,120
to the orphanage after finding out
Jesus Christ. I've had an easy life.

589
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,240
One of the kindest,
most empathetic old farts I know.

590
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,940
Loved randomly hugging white people.

591
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,450
He called them hellos because
that's what they'd say to him.

592
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,500
One of these people out.
Uh, here's the article.

593
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:03,270
I'm just curious what someone like
you raised with purely Western centric

594
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:06,480
ideologies would say about
something like this that, well,

595
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:10,130
I mean this country was kind
of built on that, so, um,

596
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,140
it was built on slavery. Yeah. I
can't really step away to, well,

597
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:17,400
we don't do it anymore. Um, but uh, yeah,

598
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:18,800
obviously I think it's,
it's right

599
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,160
three, I mean, not now, but
you should read the article.
It's, it's pretty powerful,

600
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,180
that whole thing,

601
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:29,181
because this woman was given to his
mother by her father and they're Filipino.

602
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:31,590
And that's just, yeah,
they would just like here,

603
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:33,090
this person is going to take care of you.

604
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,300
So she kept this woman throughout her
life and it became her children's care

605
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,030
keeper. Yeah. Cause she didn't
want to do any fucking work.

606
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:43,740
And then she moved to America and be like,
Oh my God,

607
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:47,190
I've got to take these kids out
for a Sunday. No, no. That's again,

608
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,180
that's just like the culture.

609
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:51,750
Like this person is your nanny and now
like you inherit them or something like

610
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,460
that. So it wasn't even as if she had,
it's this Bob part of their tradition.

611
00:36:55,461 --> 00:36:56,730
I have to be not like all of that.

612
00:36:56,731 --> 00:37:00,420
This guy grew up and then he realized
that this woman wasn't getting paid and

613
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:03,800
all this other stuff and he didn't realize
it until it dawned on him like she is

614
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:04,634
a slave.

615
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,100
And so he tried to make things better
for her in her later life after his

616
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:13,050
parents died and all this kind
of stuff. Back Rub. Yeah. No,

617
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:18,030
but by that time she, you
know, didn't know any other
lives. So she didn't really,

618
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:21,000
she wasn't like, yeah, I've been
waiting to go shopping at the mall.

619
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:21,834
Like this whole,

620
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,830
this is so fucking sad. That's
like one, it's like Dubai, Dubai,

621
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:29,100
they tell all those people and
east of there that, hey man,

622
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:31,410
come on here and to help us build
all these beautiful buildings.

623
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:33,030
You make all this money,
you'll get out of poverty.

624
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:36,390
Then they get them there and then they'd
take confiscate their passports and

625
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:41,370
that's just slave labor that builds
those fucking places. And then they, uh,

626
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
like the number one, the only way to get
out of it as they like commit suicide.

627
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,140
Right.
It's fucking brutal.

628
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:50,130
Then you watch your shows and the big
balloon tinted horse go over there to buy

629
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:54,030
a fucking bag. Not a
fan. Not Fan of Dubai,

630
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,560
not a fan of Dubai.

631
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,970
Why can't they be sinless like
the United States of America?

632
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,110
Uh, no, that's all horribly
depressing. And Ah,

633
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:05,460
I don't know what to tell you
about that as far as like,

634
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,870
I don't know how you'd do that
to somebody. They go in there,

635
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,680
goes to comedy right out
the window. Oh. Um, I wonder

636
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,130
why he, I'm just curious of
why this person asked. Like,

637
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,970
I'm curious what someone like you raised
with a purely wasn't centric ideologies

638
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:23,040
would say about something
like this. Again, it's like,

639
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,710
are you forgetting that this
is America that was built?

640
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,100
Yeah,
but I didn't grow up with that.

641
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:29,110
So what he wants to do is
get an outside perspective.

642
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:33,010
It's actually an intelligent thing that
you mean like, Hey, I'm not from here.

643
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,160
I grew up here, but you know, I
also have, you know, back there.

644
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:40,300
So what do you think about this? And Blah,
blah, blah. You know what I think, uh,

645
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,260
I think it's a terrible,
I'm going to go on a limb and say that.

646
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:48,370
That's fucking terrible.
I have so much more shit to read.

647
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,050
Renia you have to get out of
here cause you're just gonna.

648
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,990
You're gonna prolong it. Oh, I thought
you were only doing half an hour. Wait,

649
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:56,350
how'd that? We're ready to get going.
All right. Sorry. All right, real quick.

650
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,920
Let's let me, let me read this. Cool cars.
Hey, Billy Bruin balls. I'm a huge fan.

651
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:04,720
All you Ariana excited that you've
become an F1 and moto GP fan.

652
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,480
I followed both of your, these
incredible sports since the mid eighties.

653
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,570
If you haven't already
seen the documentary, uh,

654
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,020
center or Siena Johns Santa isn't,
I saw that actually did watch it.

655
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,400
I don't know perhaps his
name. No, you should.

656
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,970
It does a fantastic job of explaining
the myth around the great formula one

657
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:23,860
driver and his intense rivalry with
Mclaren teammate Alan Prost. Uh,

658
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,360
I know you're always
looking for cool website.

659
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:29,830
Here's the link to a really cool auto
auction website and it's a bring a

660
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:33,460
trailer.com. I'll check that
out. All right, here we go.

661
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Here's some fucking advertisement before
we play a little music and then play a

662
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:42,010
greatest hits thing. All right. Five,

663
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:46,720
four mentioned the importance
of feeling good in your clothes.

664
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,250
All my God, when I walk around in jeans,
I want my fucking legs to feel great.

665
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,361
Looking good,

666
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:56,980
doesn't need to cost a fortune five
four club is revolutionizing the way men

667
00:39:56,981 --> 00:40:01,960
shot, not the ladies. The way
the men do it. At five four club,

668
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:06,730
they found a way to make men under five
foot four looks stylish to tall women.

669
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,770
No.
At five four club,

670
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,520
they found a way to make great looking
clothes affordable for everyone else. Oh,

671
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:13,410
Jesus has his person,

672
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,600
his servant gonna make them sleeping on
top of the clothes before they sell them

673
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:21,460
together. Five four club also understands
that your time is extremely valuable.

674
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,260
Why wasted at the mall or wandering around
in the stores? Dude, I swear to God,

675
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,280
strip malls and malls.

676
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:30,260
Do you think in the future near do you
think they're going to exist anymore?

677
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,460
If more and more companies like this,
there's going to be no post office.

678
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:37,480
You won't go to the fucking
mall. Everything's going
to be a luxury high rise,

679
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,430
right? With indentured servants milling
around out front during a Sunday,

680
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,210
I dunno,

681
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,310
each month they send you a curated box
of two to three items that are handpicked

682
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,900
to match the current season in your style.
Five,

683
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:53,260
four club partners with cutting
edge designers and brands,

684
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:57,220
so you'll get the same quality as
top designer clothes for way less.

685
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:02,110
They'd been helping men with fashion for
over 15 years and shipped over 100,000

686
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:02,980
men every month.

687
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Chris Paul and Mark Walberg
use five four club in five.

688
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:12,520
Four is featured in Gq,
vice and instyle among other publications.

689
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:17,430
Near a little look over. They didn't
believe that. Absolutely. Well,

690
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,420
and I'm on the way to the my Oscars.
You know,

691
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:22,870
someday I'm going to call the five four
club. They know what they're doing,

692
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:24,340
so if you don't,
that's okay.

693
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:28,060
Five four club will help you build
your wardrobe one month at a time.

694
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,440
Oh, Bardo me, undies, me. Andy's.

695
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:35,790
Everyone needs a slave, but do, do,

696
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:39,320
do beyond ease me undies work
until they're in the grave.

697
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,270
Your balls feel nice and soft because
they polished in with the underwear they

698
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:47,480
made in. That's fucking
evil. Bottom white.

699
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,960
It's part of my DNA. I'm really
sorry. All right. Mian he's,

700
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,011
hey bill.

701
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:59,780
What do you think about lifelong slavery
and somebody's dreams being crushed and

702
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,480
so crushed that they don't even have any
dreams and they don't want to do on a

703
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,314
Sunday?

704
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:08,350
I love to hear your Massachusetts
Western take on that discuss.

705
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,690

816
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,063
Evan.

817
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,730
Let's read some of the, uh, the questions
here for this week or we got an update.

818
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:11,010
I love when there's an uptake.
Remember last week, the,
uh, the granny fucking war.

819
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,850
Remember that story? All right.
Here we got an update. Hey,

820
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:18,130
they're all Billy fucking water.

821
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,800
I got an update for you on this one. Uh,
the story has good news and bad news.

822
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:26,320
All right, so last, last week, for
those of you who didn't listen,

823
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:30,530
I'll give you a little recap. There
was some kid, uh, you know, he was,

824
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,160
he's basically, he's engaged,
he's getting married in six weeks,

825
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:39,161
so he's over his fiance's house as it
was future in laws house or fucking

826
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:41,630
parents. That's all I'm
trying to say, right?

827
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,340
So they're playing some card game and
evidently they're down to the final hand

828
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:50,960
and he has, uh, the cards
called granny water.

829
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,480
I don't know what the game is or whatever.

830
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,030
Some people sent me pictures of
the car at the game does exist,

831
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,530
but it's a really high point card
or whatever. And he was laying down,

832
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,580
ah, fuck, I'm yon and sorry, he
was laying down his card last.

833
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,080
I basically, when he laid it down, he was
going to do the old fucking right there.

834
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,300
Fred.
I won the game and uh,

835
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,200
he had the grantee water card and I guess
in the end of the game is probably the,

836
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,820
you get it, you hold onto it and
you played at a crucial point.

837
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,700
So everybody's sitting there as
everybody's laying the cards down,

838
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,180
waiting to see who's going to fucking
lay it down. So this kid fucking,

839
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:26,600
it's finally his turn, he lays
it down to be like, you know,

840
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:28,670
like hitting the last second three.
I just won.

841
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,620
And because he listens to the
podcast instead of saying,

842
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:35,630
I got the grantee water card,
he goes, he goes, look, he goes,

843
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:39,450
it's all fucking grant now. He
goes, it's granny fucking wall.

844
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,640
And just screamed it
to his in laws.

845
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,670
Okay, who never heard this guy curse
before and do not listen to this podcast.

846
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:54,140
So they just stared at him
like, what? What was that?

847
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:55,670
What is my daughter marrying?

848
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,460
Like he just completely screwed
the whole fucking thing up.

849
00:51:58,461 --> 00:52:01,940
So he's asking me for advice. Should he
bring it up? Should he not bring it up?

850
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:03,650
All right, now you guys
are caught up. Here he go.

851
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,440
He says the story has
good news and bad news.

852
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,340
The good news is my fiance's parents
were super cool about the whole thing.

853
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,110
Um, I bit the bullet and
waited until we went over, uh,

854
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,040
for game night again last
night. I apologize. Of course.

855
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:26,630
And they said they initially just thought,
why are,

856
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,430
why are your electors fuck?

857
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,760
They initially thought it was really
odd for me to yell like that without

858
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:36,440
knowing, without them knowing the
context. But once it was explained,

859
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:41,600
my fiance texted them about it. It
was no big deal. It was a huge relief.

860
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:46,430
We played the game again and every
time someone played that card,

861
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:50,570
they did the whole granny water thing
minus the fucking in the middle.

862
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:56,210
Okay, cool. He goes, so my
embarrassment will be immortalized. Uh,

863
00:52:56,211 --> 00:53:00,140
the bad news is that I mentioned that
you read the letter on the podcast.

864
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,150
Oh No. You know what, you're
one of those guys, dude,

865
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,570
you just like, you just like
stepping in shit. He goes naturally.

866
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:09,890
They wanted to listen to it.

867
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:14,330
I thought it wasn't a big deal because
they lived through the story and your

868
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:16,100
commentary was hilarious.

869
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,930
I warn them about the explicit nature of
your podcast and that there were plenty

870
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:25,890
of fucks throughout the fact that you
did the grantee water thing before it was

871
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:28,620
even brought up, uh, was perfect.

872
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,380
Everyone thought the story was hilarious.

873
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:36,360
That is until the p s
uh,

874
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:41,010
if you recall, I may or may have not
called Hillary Clinton a current,

875
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,170
uh, Jesus. That's right. You
did. He goes, yeah, I know.

876
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:50,300
I'm a dumb ass bill. My fiance just
turned to me and said, did you write that?

877
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,933
Uh,

878
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,090
he said,
my fiance turned to me and said,

879
00:53:55,091 --> 00:54:00,070
did you write that with that look
on her face? I knew I was fucked.

880
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,480
So freckles. I did. The only
thing I could, I said, oh,

881
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:08,800
sorry about that. I didn't write
it. Bill's email screener. Guy Did.

882
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,490
Andrew did,
he picks the emails each week,

883
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:17,491
then writes the little opening line pawn
and then sometimes throws in a ps to

884
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:21,520
make them more entertaining when I,
why would you write this?

885
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,340
Cause if they listen to this, you're
fucked. Do you know what dude,

886
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:26,380
I have no sympathy for you. So here
we go. He goes, they bought it.

887
00:54:26,381 --> 00:54:29,800
So we just listened to the rest and
we're laughing again by the end.

888
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:32,530
So I through Andrew under
the bus on that one.

889
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,120
I'm going to repeat my only good move
from the last story and just shut the fuck

890
00:54:37,121 --> 00:54:41,470
up about it forever and the end all
is well thanks for reading it on the

891
00:54:41,471 --> 00:54:44,590
podcast. It seemed to help
smooth it over. No worries.

892
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:49,210
Just tell them not to listen to
this one. He goes, by the way, um,

893
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,500
I just bought tickets to your show and
I'm not going to say where the show is in

894
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,450
case anybody is figuring
out what the fuck this is.

895
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:00,930
It's the week after my wedding and my
fiance slash wife by that point is coming

896
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:05,650
too. I'd love to meet you in person.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Uh,

897
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,020
all right.
Well yeah,

898
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,050
I'll be hanging out after Iowa.

899
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,260
Just scream out. Oh, I
just said where it was.

900
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:20,220
How well you're fucked granny water
screaming out and I'll fucking say a,

901
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,130
all right,

902
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:24,370
now everybody's going to do that.
This he smiles all night.

903
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,090
Hey, what's up? This is
bill burr. For some reason,

904
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,310
the podcasts that I did on Memorial Day,
uh,

905
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,410
I dunno,
it hasn't been able to upload.

906
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:23,040
So now what I've done is I've turned it
into two parts because I think it's been,

907
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,340
I think it was too long.

908
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:29,341
So here is part one of the
54 minute Memorial Day,

909
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:34,420
Monday morning podcast at the end of
this one. You listened to part two,

910
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,250
Huh?
Yeah.

911
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:43,190
Hey, what's going on? It's Belper and it
is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

912
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,040
May 25th,

913
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,530
2009 Happy Memorial Day to one
and all. Oh, you liked that.

914
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:53,740
Is that what are the most happiest
Kris kringle ways I've ever started.

915
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:58,420
A fucking podcast. Yeah. Happy
Memorial Day. And thank you to all the,

916
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:00,610
uh,
all the troops out there who are serving,

917
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:04,030
who have ever served at a,
yeah.

918
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,300
Get yourself a burger today or whatever
the fuck you supposed to do on this

919
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,160
holiday. What are you supposed to
do? He's supposed to go to a parade.

920
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,890
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
You know, I'm not going to a parade.

921
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,790
I, uh, I'm not big on
parades. I don't like him.

922
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,670
I find them boring once I've
seen the first band, I get it.

923
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,250
All right. You're all basically
playing the same song.

924
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,020
It all sounds like the same song.

925
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,460
And I hate when a big fucking college
band starts playing top 40 hits.

926
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,900
Like it's going to sound
good. You know, like, oh,

927
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:42,120
that's the way Beyonce
should have done that song.

928
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,190
She should have had 58 guys on
a Tuba and 26 guys on trumpets.

929
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,820
I'll play in that fucking,
uh,

930
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:54,440
if you like a daddy bear to blurred
of egg on it with the fucking trauma,

931
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,151
you know,

932
00:57:57,151 --> 00:58:02,151
28 fucking guys doing that shit and
then you're all fucking walking with the

933
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:06,810
same feet. Hey, we're all taking
a left at the same time. Ah,

934
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:11,420
go fuck yourselves. You know, I just
like the drum line. That's all I like.

935
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:16,150
Other than that, you
know, parade music sucks.

936
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,640
There's a couple of them. Bam,
Bam, Ba bum ba Ba ba bump Ba bump,

937
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,640
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,

938
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,790
fitbit pepper.
That's great.

939
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:29,100
And watch everybody prance around and
their red jackets with the gold buttons.

940
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:33,140
That's fine. I'm all over that, but
that's it. Once it's done. All right,

941
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:35,930
let's drink.
Now let's fucking fire up the grill.

942
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,970
I don't need to see another one of those

943
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,330
where bap bap, bap, bap,
bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

944
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:44,810
bap about Jesus Christ.

945
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:49,080
How many more counting on
index lady did, Joe? Man,

946
00:58:49,081 --> 00:58:53,070
please welcome nick girls choir
with their little twiddle sticks.

947
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,080
Whenever the fuck Bhutan's

948
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,920
Eh,
Eh,

949
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,530
Ooh, ha ha. You know, just standing there,

950
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,590
my big forehead just
burning in the fucking sun.

951
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,770
And what and what comes in the end?
It's either Santa Claus or a fire engine.

952
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:19,160
That's the end of the fucking paper.
Okay.

953
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:24,440
Oh those firemen sitting the truck
fresh after banging a hooker,

954
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,070
you know,

955
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:29,750
are stealing the cash and somebody's
buttoned down in a closet when there was a

956
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:31,760
fire in the basement.
You know,

957
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,840
I love talking shit about firemen
now cause I don't respect them.

958
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:40,340
I just love how they just
have this fucking Dudley do,
right? People love firemen.

959
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:45,200
They hate cops. They love firemen. You
know your house is on fire. They show up,

960
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,543
right?

961
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,970
You can't get stuck in a tree who comes
running down the street and a raincoat

962
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:55,220
with a fucking ladder. The
goddamn firemen, they get a call,

963
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:59,120
you know,
did not like cops polishing off a donut.

964
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:04,280
They stay fucking slide down that stripper
pole and they get it on the big red

965
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:06,560
for who the fuck doesn't
like a fire engine. You know,

966
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,110
I saw a fire engine fucking yesterday.

967
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:12,170
I was coming under the dog park with
my dog and there was like three of them

968
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:15,770
lined up and I guess they
were doing some CPR core.

969
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:17,870
I don't know what the fuck they would
do when they had one of the firemen,

970
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,920
you know he was, he was strapped down
to a Gurney. This isn't some gay shit.

971
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:25,580
They were like, fine, they will,
they will. They will learn it.

972
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:29,570
Some sort of procedure probably how to
move someone who has got a spinal cord

973
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:30,440
injury or whatever,

974
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,040
but they all the fire engines lined up
and I got to admit there's something,

975
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,070
there's a little kid and everybody's,

976
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,120
you get near a fire
engine is fucking great.

977
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:42,920
Big Red fire engine with all that
fucking chrome, you know? I mean,

978
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:47,660
who is a kid didn't want to be that guy
at the back of the fire engine driving

979
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:49,940
the thing down the fucking street.
You know what I mean?

980
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,510
That's what I'm going to do
someday when I get super famous.

981
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:56,930
That's the perk that I'm
calling in is I'm going to be,

982
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,490
I want to fucking drive that
thing down the street. You know,

983
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:05,000
they take you on a straightaway,
you realize how much
those fucking trucks cost.

984
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,860
Yeah. Well I don't either. I have
no fucking idea how much they cost.

985
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:14,120
They got to cost a lot.
Right. You know, dude,

986
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:18,710
you got to figure a fucking Winnebago. If
you get a nice one, cost you 150 grand.

987
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:22,580
Now what if you had a Winnebago that
could actually put out fires, you know,

988
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:25,910
or save someone with a spinal cord injury.
You know what I'm saying? Like that,

989
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:29,770
that would be, uh, that'd be at
least 200 grand. Right? You know,

990
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,580
I wonder if I can fucking
Google it right now.

991
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,290
You don't even realize today if you click
on f four, you get on your computer,

992
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,440
uh, at least on the Mac
book, you get the calculator,

993
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,300
you get the weather for the week,

994
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:46,070
you get a calendar and you get a clock,
you know?

995
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:49,550
I know that's basic computer shit.
That's something I do here on the podcast.

996
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,640
You don't, I'm not googling that shit. I,

997
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:56,360
there's gotta be a fireman or two
who fucking a listen to this podcast,

998
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:59,060
right? And I'm going to trash and
cops, by the way, either I'm not,

999
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:02,240
I'm just saying how everybody doesn't
like cops. Cause when cops show up,

1000
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:03,763
you know,

1001
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:08,240
either just got beat down by your husband
or you're getting a fucking speeding

1002
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:11,780
ticket, you know, that's
when cops show up. You know,

1003
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:16,670
firemen show up like a, you know, they
stick a ladder. It's like very romantic.

1004
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:20,640
They put a ladder up to your bedroom
and they just take you away from it all.

1005
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,560
You know what? Maybe
I'll start debt. Let's,

1006
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,950
let's start a new segment on
this podcast where you actually,

1007
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,290
you got to tell a bad story about a group
of people that only gets good press.

1008
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,510
Like either fireman. What about the
troops? You know, straight up. Oh,

1009
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:46,000
on Memorial Day straight across the board.
Support the troops.

1010
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:49,500
Do you support the truth? You're a
judge. Support the troops. You know,

1011
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,910
because I'm such a Cunt, I've actually
broken down supporting the troops.

1012
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,070
You know,

1013
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,500
th t I actually have so much free time
that I actually sat there and I was like,

1014
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,860
really? I just have to straight
across the board, support the troops,

1015
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,890
every single one of them.
You know, every single one,

1016
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:09,950
like there's not one asshole in the navy
that even his fellow fucking people in

1017
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:12,150
the navy can't fucking stand.
You know,

1018
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:16,380
there's some current right now on a
fucking aircraft carrier who's just not

1019
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:19,530
pulling his weight.
He's always fucking off and he know.

1020
01:03:19,531 --> 01:03:23,940
But he knows exactly when to fucking
pop to attention. When, when some,

1021
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,710
when some officer comes by,

1022
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,940
you know there's not one douche bag
in the navy dead is other navy buddies

1023
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:33,420
aren't thinking it. Just push overboard.
Give me a fucking break. Okay,

1024
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:38,990
so that I support the troops
but not the Douche bags.

1025
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,380
How about that?
Um,

1026
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:44,070
I'm actually going to make that into
a bumper sticker and I'll just have a

1027
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:46,170
camouflage background so
no one will question it.

1028
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,780
Where Lynn Miller and break it down here.

1029
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:52,350
Where are you guys saying he supports
the truth? We're not the Douche bags.

1030
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:56,760
I guess the Douche bags. Mostly the people
who don't support the troops. Now, dude,

1031
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,740
the Douche bags and the guys
who are troops but happened
to be douche bags. Okay,

1032
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,510
let's not speak in absolutes here.

1033
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,250
Why the fuck would I say shit like that
on the God Memorial Day? You know what?

1034
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:11,250
I support all the troops, even that
Douche bags today, but on any other day,

1035
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:15,810
I don't. I don't. I, you know, I live in,
I live in the real world here. I'm or not.

1036
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,040
I don't live in a real world.
Look at me.

1037
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:20,640
I'm fucking sitting here with an orange
microphone talking shit to fucking

1038
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:25,470
myself. I'm, I'm a realist. Okay.

1039
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,570
You know what I mean? Look at, I
look at all, what's his face there,

1040
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,910
George Bush. You know what I mean? I bet
people didn't think he was a Douche bag.

1041
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:40,740
I bet he was a hot shit when he was in
the fucking national guard. You know,

1042
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,710
taking weekends off when
he's supposed to be there.

1043
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:46,780
He probably took you out on his boat now.
Now he didn't have a boat.

1044
01:04:46,781 --> 01:04:51,740
He lived in Texas, probably at a horse
or some shit. Isn't it amazing how that,

1045
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:56,210
that guy just, he just fucking
disappeared. You know, I didn't,

1046
01:04:56,211 --> 01:04:58,020
I didn't agree with
George Bush's policies,

1047
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:01,110
but there was just something about that
guy that I just really fucking related

1048
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:04,920
to. You know what I mean? Like if I went,

1049
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:06,900
if I stopped being president,

1050
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:11,130
the amount of stress that has to
be involved with that fucking job,

1051
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,730
I got to tell you something,
dude, today that job was over. I,

1052
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,500
that's that.
Yet I'd like him.

1053
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:22,150
You'd never see me again or the
very least I would take like a,

1054
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:28,150
God, I, you'd have to, you'd have to
take at least five fucking years off.

1055
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,310
I know they told stories about how
much that job ages you and if you don't

1056
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:37,210
believe it, look at like younger pictures
of George Bush. Like how quickly you go.

1057
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:41,800
Gray. Same thing happened to,
uh, to Bill Clinton. You know?

1058
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:45,820
Or maybe they just stop using Grecian
formula because they got elected and I'm

1059
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:49,090
like, well, I don't have to do this
fucking beauty parlor shit anyways.

1060
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:52,090
I got the fucking job,
you know,

1061
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,840
I'm taking my dick out,
bring in an intern.

1062
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:01,090
One of the easiest impressions ever.
Build Little Bill Clinton for you.

1063
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:05,280
You like that. And the end of this, I'll
do a Vinnie Barbarino actually, you know,

1064
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:06,970
that's one of the things
that I wish I knew how to do.

1065
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:10,840
I wish I knew how to do a impressions.
I wish, I wish I could do it.

1066
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,410
I can more sorta imitate people
who I hang out with, but I,

1067
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:19,411
I can't imitate famous people unless
somebody famous already does the

1068
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:25,180
impression, then I can do an impression
of their impression. That's basically it.

1069
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,900
You know, that's, that's I'm
sort of a hacky impression guy.

1070
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:32,440
And a, and then if you do
something really obscure,

1071
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:36,820
which I think I've talked to before in
this podcast, like yeah, Jay Moore's,

1072
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,440
Collin Quinn, if you guys seen that, and
I'm going to cross promote right now,

1073
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:42,400
not only j more,

1074
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:47,401
but the opn Anthony show
go on youtube and a search.

1075
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,000
Jay Mohr, opie and Anthony
and uh, he calls in,

1076
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:57,001
he does a series of unbelievable fucking
impressions and the most amazing one is

1077
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:00,370
he does Colin Quinn.
And if you know,

1078
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,620
who the fuck does that guy?

1079
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:09,310
Like I've known Collin Forever and I've
never noticed any like tick in the way

1080
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:11,890
he talks and this guy, you
know what I mean? I just like,

1081
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:13,840
one time I saw somebody do a,

1082
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:19,110
the first person I saw do Tom
cruise the fuck show was I watching?

1083
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,050
I was watching. It wasn't
30 rock. Excuse me.

1084
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:26,080
How to clear my throat wasn't 30 rock.
What was that other show that,

1085
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:31,081
that dude from friends was on that was
like 30 rock except they were taking it

1086
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,014
seriously.

1087
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:37,120
The fuck was that one
called like 60 degrees.

1088
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,520
I can never remember these. I wasn't
there a number in it, you know,

1089
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,780
to fuck Jesus Christ. We have to do is
sketch show, is that what it's called?

1090
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:48,220
I know it was a drama,
but whatever.

1091
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,510
But there was some kid in there who did
impressions and keeps fucking unreal.

1092
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:56,050
He did a Ben Stiller and a,
uh,

1093
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,850
an a Tom cruise that we're dead on and I,

1094
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:02,290
I've scoured the internet
trying to find scoured. Is that,

1095
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,360
is that really a fucking,
is that the right word?

1096
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:09,040
Does not mean you got burned
now scalded is burned.

1097
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,220
Scoured. That's not a
fucking word. Whatever.

1098
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,560
I searched high and low near
and far all over the Internet.

1099
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:18,410
I can't fucking find it,
but it's definitely worth,

1100
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:23,060
it's definitely worth checking out and a,
and there you go.

1101
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,210
I've talked myself into a corner.
I don't know what the fuck to say now.

1102
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,480
I just realized that usually I just,
you know, I get a head of steam going,

1103
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,590
this is how I do these podcasts.

1104
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:34,430
I get a fucking head of steam going and
I just start running until I'm out of

1105
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:38,600
breath and then I go back to the screen
and I read like questions or whatever.

1106
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:40,850
But you know what? I'm not going
to read a question this week.

1107
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:43,400
I'm going to start off with a,

1108
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:47,260
a couple of stories about dogs.
All right.

1109
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:52,380
One funny one in one feel good. One for
the Memorial Day holiday. All right,

1110
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:56,220
here we go. Ah, this comes
from some fucking, dude.

1111
01:08:56,221 --> 01:09:00,390
I don't name names on this. All right.
I'm old school. All right. Uh, hey bill,

1112
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,970
I have a dog story for you.
Uh,

1113
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,680
whenever I visit my parents
who live at the Jersey shore,

1114
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:09,330
I always take my dog who lives
with them to the beach. Uh,

1115
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:12,240
personally, I love that
sentence. Listen to this.

1116
01:09:12,241 --> 01:09:15,090
Whenever I visit my parents
who live in the Jersey shore,

1117
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:20,180
I always take my dog who lives
with them to the beach. Dude,

1118
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:24,740
if your dog lives with your parents,
that's not your dog. All right?

1119
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,620
That's like, you know,
that's like your bank.

1120
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:34,300
You'd fucking knocked up your 16 year
old girlfriend and you left the baby with

1121
01:09:34,301 --> 01:09:36,280
your parents and they raised it.
You know,

1122
01:09:36,281 --> 01:09:38,110
you'll run to one of
those douchebags in a bar.

1123
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,500
It fucking two in the
morning on a Wednesday starts
saying how he's got a kid.

1124
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,720
Yeah. Went, see my kid for
Gurus takes out a picture of it,

1125
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,460
you know, and it's like, dude, it's
fucking 2:00 AM on a Wednesday.

1126
01:09:50,461 --> 01:09:54,600
Shouldn't you be home with your
kid? Ah, I don't have a right now.

1127
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:58,760
She's with my parents. Well then it's
not your fucking kid. All right? You're,

1128
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,230
you're like a,
you're like,

1129
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:05,360
it's brother sold a brother
who's like chuck on happy days.

1130
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:07,380
Anybody remember that?
I mean,

1131
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:10,650
people out there realize that Richie
Cunningham actually had an older brother

1132
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:12,150
during the first season named chuck,

1133
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,950
and he didn't know what
the fuck to do with them.

1134
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,900
So they just had them go off to college
and then they just never used them again.

1135
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:19,950
And then after a while,

1136
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:23,590
they literally started just saying that
they get two kids and they never address

1137
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:26,610
that kid anymore. You know? Ever again.

1138
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:31,190
That's what your fucking dogs life,
sir. It's like chuck on happy days.

1139
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:32,263
But anyways,

1140
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,410
let's read the rest of this story because
this is actually a funny story. Uh,

1141
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,370
my dog is 110 pound golden retriever,

1142
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:41,670
who basically looks like a furry
[inaudible] with legs. God Damn it.

1143
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:42,890
I can't fucking read.
So anyways,

1144
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,570
so I had my dog at the beach and his
favorite thing to do at the beach is to go

1145
01:10:46,571 --> 01:10:49,480
in the water and swim after tennis balls.
Uh,

1146
01:10:49,481 --> 01:10:53,260
so one day I'm at the beach and this is
school trip of what seems to be a fourth

1147
01:10:53,261 --> 01:10:58,210
graders and fifth graders and they're
looking at see life in a jetty. Sarah,

1148
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:01,180
I like how you wrote jetty. Like
everybody knows what the fuck a jetty is.

1149
01:11:01,181 --> 01:11:02,080
What does a jetty,

1150
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:07,440
is that a little pool of water that
gathers during high tide and then remains

1151
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:11,250
during low tide? Is that what
a jetty is? I don't know.

1152
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:15,270
I know it's not a lagoon cause I
Gilligan's island. All right. Uh,

1153
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:19,170
so a few of the kids came up to me and
asked me if it was okay if they could

1154
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:21,000
play with my dog.
So I told him no problem.

1155
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,030
And the kids are getting a kick out of
watching my dog run to the water and

1156
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,020
fetched the tennis ball.

1157
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,890
So one of the kids yells over to his
friend who's busy looking in the jetty.

1158
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,190
He's like, hey dude, you got to come over
here and check out how cool this dog it.

1159
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:35,160
At which point the kid and
the looking in the jetty says,

1160
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:40,020
no way you guys are missing out. There's
a whole bunch of crustaceans over here.

1161
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:45,030
So the kid who's standing next to me just
sort of turns it looks at me and goes,

1162
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:46,440
what a faggot.

1163
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:51,450
And I just burst out laughing because
I was thinking the exact same thing

1164
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,980
as a fucking hilarious story right there.
People, I don't know if it went by you,

1165
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:03,450
but that was a funny God
damn story. That's the funny
thing about being an adult.

1166
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,630
If you're younger you,

1167
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,500
I guess you think that you know you're
going to get mature and you're not going

1168
01:12:09,501 --> 01:12:11,910
to think that shit that you would
have thought in fourth grade.

1169
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,560
And that's not what being an adult is.
Being adult is,

1170
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:20,700
I guess still thinking the same
shit that a fourth grader thinks,

1171
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,820
but you got to act like you're
not thinking. You know, like,

1172
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:27,570
I'd like to think if I was there,
I would have said, uh, you know,

1173
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,340
you shouldn't use that word. It's very
offensive, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1174
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:36,570
and gone down that politically correct
route. But I probably would have left too.

1175
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,480
You know what I mean?

1176
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,170
And that was just funny on a lot of
levels where the kid was being a little

1177
01:12:43,171 --> 01:12:47,880
pussy and the fact that a fourth grader
would say that and the fact that it's

1178
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:50,470
coming out of a fourth graders
mouth, you know what I mean? I,

1179
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,760
I would challenge one of those
politically correct people. You know,

1180
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,410
I don't, I don't think, you know what?

1181
01:12:58,411 --> 01:13:01,140
I just talked myself into a fucking
corner again, I don't know what to say.

1182
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,270
This is one of these deals.
You know what it is really people.

1183
01:13:03,271 --> 01:13:06,810
I just had a big argument. My girlfriend
and she's walking the dog right now.

1184
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:10,200
I know she's coming back in
a half hour and she's worked.

1185
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:13,890
She's going to come in and she's
not going to argue with me. Okay.

1186
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:16,800
For you douchebags and think you're going
to get a little behind the scenes here

1187
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:17,700
in my relationship,

1188
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,270
but she's definitely going to give me
the silent treatment and as much as I'm

1189
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,810
going to try to block her out,
it's a,

1190
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:26,880
I'm not going to be able to do it
because her silence is just going to be

1191
01:13:26,881 --> 01:13:31,590
fucking washing over me,
you know? So whatever.

1192
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,230
Um,
I had one of those arguments you have,

1193
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,410
you have to have in a relationship every
once in awhile you got to blow the air

1194
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:39,480
out of the pipes and uh,

1195
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,580
that's what I did and I'm going
to be paying for it today.

1196
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:46,020
So I hope your guys Memorial Day is
working out a little better than mine.

1197
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:47,550
What do you think about that?
Okay,

1198
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,730
and how about a little pat on the back
for me on a nice fucking holiday actually

1199
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:54,900
doing this God damn podcast has
17 fucking free minutes so far.

1200
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,870
I got to tell you I'm not doing 50
minutes. I know. I always say that,

1201
01:13:57,871 --> 01:14:01,650
but I'm not doing it this week. Okay?
I get shit to do. I got laundry going.

1202
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:02,670
All right,

1203
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:06,510
I've got a whole bunch of shit I got to
do before I can then go to a god damned

1204
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:07,344
barbecue,

1205
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:12,070
show off my pasty white legs and have a
burger because that's what the fuck I'm

1206
01:14:12,071 --> 01:14:16,750
doing. Um, so anyways, you know,
before I get too far down the road,

1207
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,510
that is a new,
that is a new segment here.

1208
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:24,660
Well you have to tell a bad story about
a group of people that just consistently

1209
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:29,410
always gets good press and don't fucking
make one up either. Okay. If you,

1210
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:32,770
if you have one, send one in. If you
don't, please don't waste my time.

1211
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,360
People always try and do that.

1212
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:38,140
Like I don't read a lot of the shit that
people send me cause it just, you know,

1213
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:39,310
some of the revenge stories,

1214
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,670
that's why I kind of stopped doing them
because they really got like ridiculous,

1215
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:46,780
you know, they started getting like
James Bond ask and I'm like, dude,

1216
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,620
the overhead of this revenge
is six figures. Okay.

1217
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:54,880
This didn't happen. So anyways,
yeah. If he, if you knew, you know,

1218
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:59,830
a nun who was being a
little cunty one day, uh,

1219
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,210
who else gets good press? Kids
get great press, you know,

1220
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,280
like they can do no wrong like they have,

1221
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:10,990
they're not aware that they're
doing wrong, you know, I don't know.

1222
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,310
If you don't hate kids on
some level, you're just not
being honest with yourself.

1223
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:19,960
All right. Um, what do we got
here? Let's go with the, uh,

1224
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:23,860
the questions for the week. All
right. Question number one, Bill.

1225
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:29,290
If you had the choice to resurrect
either resurrect, either bond Scott,

1226
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,920
Jimi Hendrix or John Bonam for one night,

1227
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,450
who would you want to see in concert?
Uh,

1228
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,820
you son of a bitch. That's a hard one. Um,

1229
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:47,940
huge ACDC fan and I've always hated the
fact that I never got to see bond Scott,

1230
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:55,160
but Jimi Hendrix, that would be
like being able to see fucking, uh,

1231
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,470
I can't even say Jordan
cause I got to see him play.

1232
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:03,190
I would tell you that story
when I saw Michael Jordan play,

1233
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,490
I saw him in North Carolina and not
when he played with the tar heels.

1234
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,640
This is a story for people who live in
North Carolina because I'm in the place

1235
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:16,090
was not packed. I might've told this story
before. I can't even fucking remember.

1236
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:19,930
I talk on my cell phone so much.
My brain is mush. Basically.

1237
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:24,490
I was living in North
Carolina in 87, 88. And uh,

1238
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:29,170
it was the year before
the Charlotte Hornets.

1239
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:30,880
We're going to start in the NBA.

1240
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:36,220
So to get people excited
about, uh, NBA hoop, you know,

1241
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:40,000
cause obviously down there they got
tobacco road and all that fucking shit.

1242
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:43,000
They're really big into college
ball to get people excited.

1243
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:47,440
What they did was they had to scrimmages
at the Dean Dome at the University of

1244
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:50,620
North Carolina.
And um,

1245
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:56,100
what they did was they had a basically
two games and professional hoop,

1246
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,030
like scrimmage hoop and each
team had a former tar heel on it.

1247
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:06,160
And one of the Games was a,
the Chicago Bulls.

1248
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,280
First I want to say the
Cleveland Cavaliers.

1249
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,910
So you had Michael Jordan,
former tar heel,

1250
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:18,960
and then you had Brad Doherty on
the Cavaliers. And, uh, so I've,

1251
01:17:18,961 --> 01:17:23,390
I've got to see Michael Jordan back when
he was skinny and he had hair and he,

1252
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:26,240
and he only had one dunk. But
it was cool. It was so early.

1253
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:30,080
I told this story before.
I remember that I told this story before.

1254
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:33,800
It didn't I or did I tell it in a bar?
I can't fucking remember.

1255
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:36,290
But I remember it was so
early in Jordan's career,

1256
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:39,740
I was nudging my mom going to
watch that guy. That guy's good.

1257
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,520
That guy's good.
Can you fucking believe that?

1258
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:47,720
And then the other game
was the Los Angeles Lakers,
cause they had James Worthy,

1259
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,800
former tar heel.

1260
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,040
And I want to say they played the Seattle
Supersonics and it was a Sam Perkins,

1261
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,390
but I can't fucking remember.

1262
01:17:56,391 --> 01:17:58,940
So if anybody from North
Carolina or if you can Google it,

1263
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:03,350
and somehow it was in the dean dome.
I remember that. I do remember that.

1264
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:07,460
And it wasn't nearly, it was, it
was probably three quarters full,

1265
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,840
not even maybe 60% fucking full.
Um,

1266
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:15,470
Jesus Christ. Can I get back
to the fucking questionnaire?
All right. Bon Scott,

1267
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:18,530
Jimi Hendrix man or John Bonam.

1268
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:24,950
Ah, fuck. You know, I couldn't, I
can't, I can't fucking answer that.

1269
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,550
John Bonham Mobile,
Jimi Hendrix.

1270
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:34,550
Well, if I'll tell you this, if I
was going to see, you know what,

1271
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:35,870
I would have to flip a coin,

1272
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:41,000
which doesn't even work out mathematically
cause there's three fucking people.

1273
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:46,400
I'd have to throw a dart. All right,
I got to admit Bon Scott is out.

1274
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,430
God dammit. I never
thought I'd say that. Okay.

1275
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,710
But the thing about Jimmy
Hendrix and John Bonham is they,

1276
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:57,770
they changed Jimi Hendrix changed fucking
what you thought was what you could do

1277
01:18:58,641 --> 01:19:01,910
on the guitar and John Bonham,
you know,

1278
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:05,960
basically he brought rock
drumming into the modern era.

1279
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:10,340
So fucking cunt. What
a question. All right,

1280
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:12,970
now this is all I can tell you. I would
throw a dark between Jimmy Hendrickson,

1281
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:17,240
John Bonham, and when I would see Jimi
Hendrix, it would be with band of Gypsies,

1282
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,110
not with the experience.
All right? Cause that, uh,

1283
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:26,080
that live album he has, we placed
machine gun and all that shit. Well,

1284
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:29,450
boom, boom. Ba Da Ba da Ba da
Ba. Do Bad. That one with Bob,

1285
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:32,870
was it budding miles on drums and uh,
Billy Cox,

1286
01:19:32,871 --> 01:19:36,640
whatever his fucking name is
on base that I would, I'd want,

1287
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:39,470
that's what I want to,
I would want to see them on at that,

1288
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,950
wherever they take that.
Was it in San Francisco at the Fillmore?

1289
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:45,830
Remember that Shit.

1290
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:51,130
And I would see John Bonham at a Royal
Albert Hall and I would be backstage and

1291
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:54,590
I would be able to see his fucking based
from fourth to figure out what the fuck

1292
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:55,424
he was doing.

1293
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,840
Do you guys ever listen to old live albums
or you ever watch old concert footage

1294
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,700
of how polite rock shows were?

1295
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:06,890
Like the promoter would literally come
out and they would like announce the band.

1296
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:10,440
Like on that Jimi Hendrix one,
it's really cool.

1297
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:13,230
Like this promoter comes out and people
have this little polite applause,

1298
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:17,520
applause and a the here, this
promoter going out, you know,

1299
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:22,521
welcome to the Fillmore west tonight
we have a wonderful new band.

1300
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,290
Ah, Babababa all this type of
shit. And then the background,

1301
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:28,690
Jimmy's already playing,
he says,

1302
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,340
and the fucking promoter
is talking over it.

1303
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,920
It gives me chill in a second. He's done.
Then they just fucking go into the song.

1304
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,450
You know?
Maybe because I'm old now,

1305
01:20:40,451 --> 01:20:44,410
I would love to go see a great band and
be able to sit down and just fucking

1306
01:20:44,411 --> 01:20:49,240
enjoy them as musicians. I hate the
fact that I have to fucking stand up,

1307
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:52,820
you know?
And look around that Douche bag,

1308
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,550
who puts his fucking
girlfriend on his shoulders?

1309
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:59,360
You want to talk about a fucking
pussy whipped individual.

1310
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,370
It's already bad enough that you
probably had to buy the fucking tickets.

1311
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,640
You had to pay for parking. You're
already fucking whatever, two,

1312
01:21:06,641 --> 01:21:09,980
300 bucks in the hall. Yeah. You
know? And then on top of that,

1313
01:21:09,981 --> 01:21:14,740
you got to put your fucking chick on your
shoulders. Right. See, you're literally,

1314
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:18,790
your spinal cord is crunching down so
she can get up there and make eyes over

1315
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,810
there with the fucking lead singer and
possibly even flash your tits that she'll

1316
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:26,170
then fucking blame on whatever
the weed was fucking laced with.

1317
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:31,330
You're actually helping her to maybe
bang another guy at that point.

1318
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:33,800
You know?
Because if the lead singer like sir,

1319
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:37,490
he just gives the nod to the fucking,
the uh,

1320
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,600
his go gather some pussy guy.

1321
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:42,660
And then when he comes down there and he
taps your girlfriend on the shoulders,

1322
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:45,360
says he wants to meet him, you
know, you sitting there going like,

1323
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,490
you want to say no, you
can't do that. But you know,

1324
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:51,590
you're never going to hear the end of
it because that was a dream to go see a

1325
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:55,990
[inaudible] fucking a
Eddie fucking Douche bag,

1326
01:21:55,991 --> 01:22:00,550
whatever his fucking name is Eddie
vetter. Right. I, you know what,

1327
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:04,090
I totally lost control of that story
because my washing machine just started

1328
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:07,540
beeping to let me know that
the load of clothes has done.

1329
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:11,800
This is what I'm doing with my fucking,
my memorial day.

1330
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:15,820
I'll listen to the sirens.
It'd be funny if I could actually do this,

1331
01:22:15,821 --> 01:22:19,000
this podcast live and that was
a bunch of firemen coming over.

1332
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:23,060
He had to kick my ass, you know,
and just to be traditional,

1333
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:26,580
they didn't break down the door with
an ax. They actually put the ladder up,

1334
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,120
fuse me,
Jesus

1335
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,380
price is my house on fire.
Here it comes.

1336
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:33,770
It would have that moment

1337
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:39,310
and there it goes. Ah, right.

1338
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,760
He's winding down. Okay, keep going.

1339
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:50,270
Jesus Christ thought my place
was on fire there for a second.

1340
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,750
Um, anyways, so that's what I would do.

1341
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:56,210
I would pick between Jimmy
Hendrickson bond, Scott and I would,

1342
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,040
I would throw a dart and uh,
I have to admit,

1343
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:04,250
I think I would see Jimi Hendrix and
the end of it there, I made my decision.

1344
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,180
I would see Jimi Dude.

1345
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,930
That was a great fucking question.
That really was a great question.

1346
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:13,000
Okay.

1347
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,670
And here comes another God damn truck.
You know what?

1348
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:19,630
This is some Douche bag on memorial
day already burned down their fucking

1349
01:23:19,631 --> 01:23:23,920
backyard with their,
with their Hibachi Jesus Christ.

1350
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:25,690
There's the one where you
got to steer in the back.

1351
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,013
Yeah.

1352
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,510
Holy Shit.
This stopping on my street.

1353
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:32,980
Yeah.

1354
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,290
What would you do with the
middle of this fucking podcast?

1355
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,960
All of a sudden somebody came
on while we're like a megaphone

1356
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:43,760
Amri tangent. Ain't everybody
on the street dates to evacuate.

1357
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,060
Okay.

1358
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,620
Do you know that happened
to me when I was a kid?

1359
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:52,080
Jesus Christ is for fucking fire
trucks right outside my window.

1360
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,830
I feel like one of those guys,
I feel like Jimmy Olsen,

1361
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:58,290
like I'm getting the scoop right now.
You know what?

1362
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:01,080
Now I have to go over and
I have to investigate.

1363
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:06,240
Let me bring my little fucking
podcast station over here. You know,

1364
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:09,510
it'd be great if there was one right below
the window and I could actually stick

1365
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,130
my head out with,

1366
01:24:11,131 --> 01:24:15,450
I actually wear headphones and I got this
microphone with the orange screen on it

1367
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,880
and I just started talking like
it was the 1920s scares me sir.

1368
01:24:20,881 --> 01:24:23,970
What's going on down now?
Trying to get the scope.

1369
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:30,460
Why can't I open my fucking windows?
You know what's funny?

1370
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:35,410
You ever notice like whenever like some
fucking old lady twists or goddamn ankle,

1371
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:38,920
like 17 firetrucks show up. It's
like, is it really necessary?

1372
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:40,230
Okay,

1373
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:44,430
why don't you put all the, the old lady
broke her fucking hip shit on one truck.

1374
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:47,450
Dude,
there's no smoke.

1375
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,170
There's nothing this for
fucking two fire trucks

1376
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:58,550
for fire trucks. Oh my God.
Is that a why that is a woman.

1377
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:01,400
I thought that was a guy. Jesus
Christ. Somebody just came walking by

1378
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:04,680
looking like they weren't one of those,
you know,

1379
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:09,300
those eighties bands that just uh,
they all just had like, then you know,

1380
01:25:09,301 --> 01:25:10,800
the one hit wonders but there was,
there was,

1381
01:25:10,801 --> 01:25:13,890
there was that whole scene like
they weren't like a Duran Duran.

1382
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:17,630
They actually thought that they
were like artistic. What the,

1383
01:25:17,631 --> 01:25:20,790
what the fuck kind of bands were those?
They weren't, it wasn't like heavy metal.

1384
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,770
It wasn't rock, um, new wave.

1385
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:26,783
That's right.

1386
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,240
I thought it was some guy dressed like
he was front and a new wave band and

1387
01:25:31,241 --> 01:25:33,960
ended up just being, I did, you know, you
know what girls like put their, their,

1388
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:36,130
their pony tail,
you know,

1389
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:40,800
and they wrap it around the front
and you can't fucking see it. Dude.

1390
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:45,150
There's no sense of urgency. Now
they're backing the fire truck up. I,

1391
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:49,440
this is one of these times when I just
wish I was old so I could go out there

1392
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:53,520
and just start yelling at him.
You know about taxpayers money and Shit,

1393
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,960
Dude, how fucked up is that?
I was making fun of firemen,

1394
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:00,893
you know,

1395
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,540
at the beginning of this podcast
and for fucking fire truck show up.

1396
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,250
You don't want,
this is the thing,

1397
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,660
I have to close the window because my
voice really carries and I say fuck a lot.

1398
01:26:11,661 --> 01:26:14,750
Not to mention the word cunt,
so I'm going to have to,

1399
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:18,410
you know when they always leave
the fire engines running, you know?

1400
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,240
Who Do you think pays for that
gas? Huh? We do see this is great.

1401
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:25,370
This is the new segment right here.

1402
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:29,750
I can trash fireman if there's a fire man.
Listen right now.

1403
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:32,810
Is it a fire man or a fireman?
You know,

1404
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,870
if one of you motherfuckers is listening
right now, can you answer that? Why?

1405
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:40,870
When there's no smoke, there's no
fire. Why do 18 trucks show up?

1406
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:44,220
You guys all just bored.
Are you trying to get away from that?

1407
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:48,450
Get that the fat fuck down the firehouse?
Who's making the Chili? You know,

1408
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:51,820
isn't that, isn't there like always
there was always a cook down there,

1409
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:56,470
isn't there? He's got one of those
big mustaches. Yeah. Okay. Hey,

1410
01:26:56,471 --> 01:26:57,900
what do you make it today?
They have Freddy.

1411
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,010
Oh, Megan. Mom. Make some
fucking Chile. Really?

1412
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:06,210
You're gonna make some
you're famous fucking red hot
chili and then I'm going to

1413
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:09,330
have had that in my mouth. Then I'm
not going to go fight a fucking fire.

1414
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,193
You asshole.

1415
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,490
I bought some Koolaid.
Now I'm fascinated.

1416
01:27:15,491 --> 01:27:19,600
Can you hear the rumble of those engines?
You know a lot of chicks like firemen.

1417
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:24,490
They do. There's something about him.
You know, they rescue people. You know,

1418
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:28,780
they got that rain coat sort of
perverted. It's like, you know,

1419
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:32,830
they naked under there. Is he going to
show you to going to show me his hose?

1420
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:37,030
There's a bunch of them walking
around in their fucking rain coats.

1421
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:39,663
Okay.

1422
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,300
Jesus Christ. You know
something? I got to admit,

1423
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,870
you know what? I wouldn't, I
would walk out on my balcony.

1424
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,240
I actually have a little fucking balcony
I could be standing on right now.

1425
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:51,670
I could figure out what
the fuck's going on.

1426
01:27:51,671 --> 01:27:54,250
I can't even do the rest of this podcast.
This is ridiculous.

1427
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,950
Was that really me talking? I just went
to some accent there. I usually say,

1428
01:27:58,951 --> 01:28:02,390
this is ridiculous. This is
ridiculous. Um, all right,

1429
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,670
I'm going to try to fucking answer
the rest of these questions.

1430
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:08,870
It's four fire trucks sit
outside and people walk
around. Is it a chemical spill?

1431
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,540
All right.
That concludes part one.

1432
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:15,770
And I have no idea why there's such a
huge echo on this. I'm using the, uh,

1433
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:20,420
the recorder from my, my fucking
laptop, so that ends part one.

1434
01:28:20,421 --> 01:28:24,890
Now just go listen to part two just in
case you're a complete moron and you

1435
01:28:24,891 --> 01:28:28,910
didn't know that that's what you were
supposed to do. Okay. Hey, what's up?

1436
01:28:28,911 --> 01:28:33,911
This is bill burr and this is part two
of the Monday morning podcasts from May

1437
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,620
25th, 2009. And for the life of me,

1438
01:28:36,621 --> 01:28:39,090
I don't know what that
fucking echo was all about.

1439
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,440
Oh yeah. I started to tell a
story. Yeah. When I was a kid, uh,

1440
01:28:43,441 --> 01:28:47,160
this fucking guy's barn burned down and
evidently he ran this big business and

1441
01:28:47,161 --> 01:28:51,420
he had toxic toxic waste
and these big oil drums.

1442
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:54,990
So evidently they went around to
every house in the neighborhood,

1443
01:28:54,991 --> 01:28:58,380
knocking on the door, telling everybody
to get the fuck out of their house.

1444
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,940
And I don't know if they
forgot to go our house or what,

1445
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:06,660
but we didn't know.
We didn't know.

1446
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:10,380
So me and my brother went out to
do our paper routes in the morning.

1447
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:13,860
That's how white my childhood was.
You know,

1448
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,190
right after I had a piece of toast with
that little square piece of butter on it.

1449
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,053
I went out

1450
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,560
part of this complete breakfast
after I had my complete breakfast,

1451
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:27,150
I went out to do my paper route and
there was all this smoke in the air and

1452
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:29,730
there was nobody. We lived on a
busy street and there were no cars,

1453
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,880
and there was just this firehose going
all the way up right down the middle of

1454
01:29:32,881 --> 01:29:37,680
the street. So we will let a wheel
like, oh wow, that's cool. Right?

1455
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:40,440
We didn't give a fuck. So, uh,

1456
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:43,950
I ride my bike down the street
to do my first customer,

1457
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:46,410
which is in the direction of the fire.

1458
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,290
So I drove down there on my bicycle and
there's a fireman standing there and

1459
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,930
he's got, you know, the,
the fucking oxygen mask on.

1460
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:59,520
And he literally looks at me and he
did literally the cartoon double take,

1461
01:29:59,521 --> 01:30:01,860
like Yeti editor, you
know, like what the F,

1462
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,460
like he couldn't believe what he
was saying is all his smoking here.

1463
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:08,371
Here I come up,

1464
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:13,371
my little howdy doody face comes up to
street riding on my little bicycle and he

1465
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:16,320
comes and he starts screaming at me
through that mass going like dark,

1466
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:18,463
right?

1467
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:25,510
Just dropping the F bomb and I'll
be like, ah, I have a paper route.

1468
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:27,190
I had no idea.

1469
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:32,723
So we ended up,

1470
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,490
you know, maybe that's why my memory
sucks cause I sat there breathing in,

1471
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:42,440
breathe in, all that shit.
Allegedly the guy who's who, uh,

1472
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,380
whose barn it was started radio
shack. That was, that was the, uh,

1473
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:52,760
that was the rumor. So anyways,
here we go. Ah, question number two.

1474
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:56,930
Hey Bill, I want to know what you think
of old people going, going to the gym.

1475
01:30:57,470 --> 01:31:00,500
Every time I see this 60 year
old guy doing sit ups at the gym,

1476
01:31:00,501 --> 01:31:01,520
I felt sorry for him.

1477
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:05,600
I work out so I can stay
healthy and live to see old age.

1478
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,250
Once I see old age, it's
mission accomplished, right?

1479
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,220
I think one, uh, when
I see these old people,

1480
01:31:13,221 --> 01:31:16,790
I think one of two things is going on.
Either he doesn't know he's old,

1481
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:21,320
which is pathetic or he wants to grow
older, which is even more pathetic.

1482
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,390
I mean,
how selfish can you be?

1483
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:26,720
Do you want your family to
be wiping your ass at 90?

1484
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:33,200
The big question is,
at what age will you stop working out?

1485
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:37,470
I'm done at 50. I got
18 more years to go. Uh,

1486
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:42,200
thanks for the podcast. Uh, they
helped my three hour daily commute.

1487
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:45,560
Make it much easier. Well, thank
you sir. I'm glad you like them. Um,

1488
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,430
don't you hate when somebody calls
you serve by the way, are ma'am.

1489
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:54,200
Isn't that the worst the first day that
that fucking happens? You're just like,

1490
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:58,930
Jesus, I really am old.
Okay. When am I going to stop
working out? Uh, I gotta admit,

1491
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:02,380
Dude, I'm never going to stop working
out, but I won't be going to the gym.

1492
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,100
Maybe I will be. You know what,
I, I've just, I just sort of,

1493
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:09,850
I've adjusted my workouts to,
uh,

1494
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:14,200
to with my age. Like I used
to, I used to, you know,

1495
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:19,060
I used to throw the way to round
over there. Oh, right. And,

1496
01:32:19,061 --> 01:32:23,140
uh, you know, used to play full
court hoop running up and down,

1497
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:26,170
but my body just can't take that.
I can still lift weights and shit.

1498
01:32:26,171 --> 01:32:30,370
I just get bored doing that. But,
uh, as I grow older, I, I, I,

1499
01:32:30,371 --> 01:32:35,371
I've told myself that I'm gradually
gonna Morph into yoga and [inaudible]

1500
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:42,670
I just paused there. Wait for every
food you yogo you fucking gay, salty,

1501
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:46,290
where you stretching yourself out.
You can give welcome banged in the air.

1502
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,770
You could do,

1503
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:52,400
guys are so fucking dumb, you know?
And there's just something about,

1504
01:32:52,401 --> 01:32:54,320
anytime you do something smart,

1505
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:58,580
immediately it's considered feminine.
You know,

1506
01:32:58,581 --> 01:33:00,470
if you do something dumb here,
a man,

1507
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:04,430
if you don't work out and he keeps
drinking red bear shove and half a fucking

1508
01:33:04,431 --> 01:33:08,780
cow's head into your colon, then
Dan, Dan, you're a guy. But yeah,

1509
01:33:08,781 --> 01:33:12,890
that's what I'm going to do it. And No,
I'm not going to, no, I'm never stuck.

1510
01:33:12,891 --> 01:33:13,724
I'm going to stop working.

1511
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:17,690
I'm never gonna stop trying new things
and trying to learn shit because when you

1512
01:33:17,691 --> 01:33:20,660
do that shit, dude, you die. You Die.

1513
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:25,190
And it's very easily to be 32 I've
done the math. You're 32 years old.

1514
01:33:25,191 --> 01:33:26,390
It's very easy to say that.

1515
01:33:26,391 --> 01:33:29,390
You know you're going to say
fuck it at 50 you're not dude,

1516
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,450
because the 32 if you're still working
out, that means you still look good,

1517
01:33:32,451 --> 01:33:34,490
which means women are still
kind of checking you are,

1518
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:38,240
but I'm telling you do it starts dropping
off when it starts fucking dropping

1519
01:33:38,241 --> 01:33:42,020
off. You know, you're like, Jesus Christ,
I don't even fucking look at me anymore.

1520
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:42,880
And it's,

1521
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,420
it's going to motivate you or you'll
just go into a depression and you will

1522
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:51,740
spoon with that depression and you'll
eat yourself into an early grave before

1523
01:33:51,741 --> 01:33:54,590
you 50 so those are your options.
All right?

1524
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:56,310
Okay.

1525
01:33:56,310 --> 01:34:00,170
Hang in that dual, keep working out.
You know, you want to come that,

1526
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:03,690
do you want to come that Steph fat?
Fuck. You know what I'm saying?

1527
01:34:03,691 --> 01:34:07,590
We got that big bulge of fat right above
your Dick. You don't wanna be that guy.

1528
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:13,140
You know, he just, you know,
you get that old person,

1529
01:34:13,141 --> 01:34:15,510
I'm going to die soon.
Smell. It's just bad.

1530
01:34:15,511 --> 01:34:18,390
You don't want you to want to be
that guy. All right? Uh, you know,

1531
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:19,410
just out of curiosity,

1532
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:23,280
I wonder who the oldest person is who
actually listens to this fucking podcast.

1533
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:25,051
You know,
that's another thing.

1534
01:34:25,051 --> 01:34:27,810
I always want to stay up on
music and that type of shit.

1535
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:31,590
I think that's easy to do when
you don't have children, but, uh,

1536
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:36,810
I don't fucking know Phil, just shut up
and move on with the questions. All right.

1537
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:39,750
Question number three, Bill.
I'm from Cleveland. Uh,

1538
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:43,600
and I've rules really s and I'm
really psyched about the, uh,

1539
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:48,440
Cavalier Orlando's Wednesday game.
It was amazing.

1540
01:34:48,441 --> 01:34:50,430
He had a bit dis pressing
at the same time.

1541
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:56,030
Fortunately the Cavs lost one oh seven
one oh six dip deck a day the whole way

1542
01:34:56,281 --> 01:34:58,010
through.
Uh,

1543
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,360
do you think what Brian will lead the
Cavaliers to victory against the magic and

1544
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:05,930
who do you anticipate
to win the championship?

1545
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:09,710
Um,
I have to admit,

1546
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:14,720
I don't know shit about basketball and
I've started to watch now that the Bruins

1547
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:16,820
and the Celtics are knocked out.
You know,

1548
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:21,710
I wasn't really even watching the
Celtics, I'm just not in the hoop. And,

1549
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:24,800
uh, I got to met, you
know, Cleveland, Orlando,

1550
01:35:24,801 --> 01:35:28,670
I don't think you could ask for a
better series out, but Lakers, Denver,

1551
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,040
that series has sucked.

1552
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,730
It's like neither team has won a game yet.

1553
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,420
Denver blew the first game,
the Lakers blue,

1554
01:35:38,421 --> 01:35:42,980
the second game and Denver
blew the third game. And, um,

1555
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:49,120
what's killing me is that I don't see
a dominant fucking team in the four

1556
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:53,900
remaining teams. So I think this is
kind of, it's kind of a weak year.

1557
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:59,060
I think Lebron is the shit and I
think that fucking superhero do dare.

1558
01:35:59,061 --> 01:36:03,680
What Howard for Orlando is,
is ridiculous and Colby is ridiculous.

1559
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:04,850
And what's his face?

1560
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:09,230
Carmelo Anthony is ridiculous
and everyone else is regular.

1561
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:14,240
That's just regular standing around
watching those guys doing shit,

1562
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:20,030
you know? There we go. That'll
get me a lot of fucking emails.

1563
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:24,350
All these fucking hoop heads,
dude. Oh fuck. Can you say that?

1564
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:29,120
Stood fucking good. Jamica
whatever. Fucking whatever.

1565
01:36:29,121 --> 01:36:31,730
Some black guy named his fucking regular.
He had,

1566
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:35,120
he had 22 we won't see how many seats.
I don't give a fuck.

1567
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:38,960
Pro Hoop is fucking boring.

1568
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:43,580
The referees control the temple where the
game and the final three minutes takes

1569
01:36:43,581 --> 01:36:48,290
an hour. Fuck that game.
Okay, what does that,

1570
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,510
what does that thing that,
that the commercial that they have,

1571
01:36:50,511 --> 01:36:52,490
when's the next time great will happen?

1572
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:56,600
I'll tell you when the ref stops blowing
his fucking whistle. Every five seconds.

1573
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:02,120
Do the second one team goes into the
penalty. Just kiss the rest of your day.

1574
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:02,690
Goodbye.

1575
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:06,560
It is the most boring fucking hundred
points you're ever going to see in your

1576
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:11,060
life. Coby Bryan shooting the
front end of a one on one.

1577
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:16,190
He's 38 and 39 from the line tonight.

1578
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,320
39 38 39 let's fucking divide that by two.

1579
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:26,180
That's fucking what? 1819 there'll be
night. There'd be his 20th fucking time.

1580
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:30,970
He's gone to the line 20 fucking times
at that point. And Miss, oh no. 18 wait,

1581
01:37:30,971 --> 01:37:34,310
can you be 38 39 yeah, cause you could,
you could go for a three point play.

1582
01:37:34,311 --> 01:37:35,990
So whatever the guy's got on the line,

1583
01:37:35,991 --> 01:37:39,200
like fucking anywhere from
16 to 20 fucking times,

1584
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:43,340
20 fucking times. They blown the
whistle with one fucking guy.

1585
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:48,920
All right. I know 38 is a high number.
Okay. But there's nights where he's,

1586
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:51,110
you know,
20th 22 from the line.

1587
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:58,050
One Guy, one guy has the game 10 fucking
times. It's, it's, it's, it's the worst.

1588
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:03,120
And I got to Mit, I think pro
football really gets boring. You know,

1589
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:06,240
there's nothing worse than a pro
football game against two teams that are

1590
01:38:06,241 --> 01:38:08,190
mediocre.
It's just terrible.

1591
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:12,270
And it's one of the written other reasons
why I love hockey because at the very

1592
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:16,050
least have two teams suck. Maybe
there'll be a fight, you know,

1593
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,091
any other sport.

1594
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:23,091
If there's a fight that is the lead
fucking story on Sportcenter Holy Shit,

1595
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,750
the benches emptied or this guy charged
the amount of fucking or whatever.

1596
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:32,490
And hockey is whatever that
can happen in any game to God.

1597
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,713
Great Sport.

1598
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:37,680
If you like the movie Mad Max and
you don't like hockey and you're very

1599
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:41,180
inconsistent human being. All right,
let's get on with computer tips. Uh,

1600
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:45,090
we've been doing very basic computer tips,
helping people like myself,

1601
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:50,010
a limp along. And uh, just to get
shit moving here, I have to admit,

1602
01:38:50,011 --> 01:38:53,550
this person brought in some computer
tips this week. One, two, three, four,

1603
01:38:53,551 --> 01:38:57,360
five of them and the first four
I knew. So a few guys, you know,

1604
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,570
all you guys who are really into computer,
if you guys can,

1605
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,650
can go to the next level here where
we can talk about preferences,

1606
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:08,910
you know, where you know, they click on
the apple and then Click on preferences,

1607
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:14,040
go into the applications. And, but
if you can break down that shit, um,

1608
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:16,950
that would really help me out because I'm
really getting good at computers right

1609
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:20,610
now or much better than I was because
of you guys, so I appreciate it.

1610
01:39:20,611 --> 01:39:24,640
So here's the, Oh God, my girlfriend's
back. Now it's going to get awkward.

1611
01:39:24,641 --> 01:39:28,050
It's going to get awkward. Um, all
right, here are some of the uh,

1612
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:31,740
the questions here, question number,
uh, or some of the computer tips.

1613
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,710
Computer tip number one.
Uh,

1614
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:40,830
hold the apple command and
the letter x to cut. I mean,

1615
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:41,790
people know this shit.

1616
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:46,880
Apple Command and the letter C to copy
Apple Command and the letter V to paste.

1617
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:50,610
And this is the one I didn't know.

1618
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:54,390
Apple Command and the letter Z to undo.

1619
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:57,060
I didn't know that one.
And that one.

1620
01:39:57,061 --> 01:40:01,830
Basically this guy so eloquently puts
when you just fucked up any document,

1621
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:05,340
email or typing that you just did,

1622
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:08,310
if you delete something by
accident and then hit the,

1623
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:12,000
just hit apple z and you get it back.
Um,

1624
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:13,801
and he goes,
God,

1625
01:40:13,801 --> 01:40:18,570
I know you have to know the f three
button to separate the screens. By now,

1626
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:22,590
but I just want to make sure since that
shit is on the Mac, you know what dude,

1627
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:27,280
I didn't know that one f three. You hit
that and that separates all your windows,

1628
01:40:27,281 --> 01:40:29,700
which in which point I
said what is that for do.

1629
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:32,640
And that's when I found the calculator,
the date,

1630
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,290
my forecast for the week and the time.
So that's pretty fucking cool.

1631
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,280
I'll actually have to start the podcast
with that. So I won't know the dates but,

1632
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,050
and for anyone,
you know,

1633
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,600
I'm kind of being an arrogant
ass here cause I am a moron.

1634
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:49,830
So if you don't know shit like that,
that apple command in the letter x,

1635
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:54,880
uh, is basically when you just
highlight whatever you just did,

1636
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:59,910
if you hit the command button and let her
ex that will just delete the sentence,

1637
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,990
you know, apple, see that will copy it.

1638
01:41:04,991 --> 01:41:08,410
And then Apple v you paste it to somewhere
else. It's very easy to figure out.

1639
01:41:08,411 --> 01:41:11,200
But, um, I think at this point
and everybody's caught up.

1640
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:14,500
So if you guys do computer tips, if you
want to take them to the next level,

1641
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:18,340
that would be greatly appreciated and
all you fucking Douche bags out there who

1642
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:21,400
are good at computer,
just Google good and so fucking basic.

1643
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:26,410
This shit that you suck at and right.
Okay. Look at me getting all defensive.

1644
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:26,771
All right,

1645
01:41:26,771 --> 01:41:30,970
you want to hear a heart warming dog
story and I'll end the podcast here and

1646
01:41:30,971 --> 01:41:31,421
actually I want,

1647
01:41:31,421 --> 01:41:34,600
I'm going to blow through some underrated
overrated because a lot of people sent

1648
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:38,710
some shit in. Okay.
Heartwarming dog story. Uh Oh.

1649
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:41,680
And also I got to have douche bag of
the week. I forgot about that one.

1650
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:47,200
Heartwarming dog story. Uh,
all right, Bill. Uh, you
probably got a lot of emails.

1651
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:50,980
We're going to Doug,
I have a dog that we found five years ago.

1652
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:55,060
I was driving home after work and I saw
a yellow lab mix in the middle of the

1653
01:41:55,061 --> 01:41:55,630
road.

1654
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:59,830
She was running across a busy street
with an e color on one of those things.

1655
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:02,950
The vet's put on a dog and a,

1656
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:07,600
I dunno, it's fucking dog has been
hectic. This is a really long stories.

1657
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:10,630
So she's running across the
street and nobody was stopping.

1658
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:13,270
She was really scared and confused,
running all over the street.

1659
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:16,750
Everyone was honking their horns and
she was just running back and forth.

1660
01:42:16,751 --> 01:42:20,630
Not sure where to go. Basically, she was
freaking out. So I saw her in the middle,

1661
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,770
in the mid section of the street
waiting to turn. When I saw her,

1662
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,870
I call for her to come over,
which he did.

1663
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:28,990
And I opened my car door
and yanked her in the car.

1664
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,370
Dude, you got more balls than me. I
would definitely feel bad for the dog.

1665
01:42:36,371 --> 01:42:40,240
But I saw old yeller at the wrong
age and I've never just like jaws.

1666
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:44,140
I saw jaws when I was young and I will
not go into the ocean and if there's a

1667
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:45,970
fucking stray dog freaking out,

1668
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:50,790
I'm not going to Yank it in my car
for fear of getting rabies. Um,

1669
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,890
I quickly noticed she had a
surgical scar on her stomach.

1670
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:58,360
This dog was scared and she had
the most desperate looking arise.

1671
01:42:58,361 --> 01:42:59,081
It really shook me.

1672
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:02,920
So I brought her home and I put her in
the yard while I got our dogs put in

1673
01:43:02,921 --> 01:43:04,600
place where they wouldn't see each other.

1674
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:07,090
Since I didn't know how
this dog would behave. See,

1675
01:43:07,091 --> 01:43:08,590
this guy really knows about dogs here.

1676
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:12,010
I quickly found that she was
terrified and would not leave my site.

1677
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:16,210
She would come over to me and sit on my
feet and follow me everywhere I went.

1678
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:20,320
So we put her in a different room away
from our other dog and my wife and I got

1679
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:25,030
a plan together to find her owner. Uh,
she was so sweet and terrified. Uh,

1680
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,420
she must need to get back to her
house with her owners. Right.

1681
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:32,410
So we put up signs and went around
to neighbor's house, house to house,

1682
01:43:32,411 --> 01:43:34,840
door to door to see if we could find
the owner. No luck. The next day,

1683
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:38,470
my wife went to the nearest vet office
because we figured that's where she had a

1684
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:43,150
surgery done. Well, they had never
seen him before, but said, uh, the vet,

1685
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:46,810
the vet said he wanted to scan
her for a con, a microchip.

1686
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:51,590
Turns out she had one and she
was from a no kill shelter.

1687
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,730
So we called the shelter.

1688
01:43:52,730 --> 01:43:57,170
She was from turns out they kept her at
a veterinarian's house down the street,

1689
01:43:57,171 --> 01:44:00,560
but blah, blah, blah, blah. And uh,

1690
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:02,270
they said that they would
come over and pick her up,

1691
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:04,820
but by this time I was having second
thoughts. After only two days,

1692
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:08,540
there are other dog had taken
tours of Wa as well. Um,

1693
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:12,680
this dog loved me after only two days
and I can't explain it because my other

1694
01:44:12,681 --> 01:44:17,300
dog could care less about me.
Um, it's my wife's dog and I, um,

1695
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,090
and don't get me wrong, I love
him, but this was different.

1696
01:44:20,091 --> 01:44:24,020
This dog somehow gotten in my heart.
See, this is what happened with Cleo.

1697
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:28,670
I got the dog and half to two days. I
fucking love the dog. Um, so anyways,

1698
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:30,560
the vet told us her story,

1699
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:35,561
which was verified later on by the shelter
rep who came to approve us to adopt

1700
01:44:38,421 --> 01:44:41,630
her for a home.
It turns out she was given up.

1701
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:44,240
I'm really fucking flake in here.
Turns up,

1702
01:44:44,241 --> 01:44:47,240
she was given up by everyone in
the families that adopted her.

1703
01:44:47,241 --> 01:44:52,190
She was adopted five times. Dude,
that's not a red light flashing.

1704
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:55,940
Choose adopted five times and they
keep getting rid of her. Anyways,

1705
01:44:55,941 --> 01:44:56,530
over the issues,

1706
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:59,840
developed some minor behavioral issues
such as digging and getting out of the

1707
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:03,710
yard. She was placed
in when left alone. Um,

1708
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:07,490
but whatever her name is Bella. And while
she was a pain in the ass at the time,

1709
01:45:07,491 --> 01:45:11,150
she is, as you said, what
I come home to. And uh,

1710
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:14,030
basically the dude actually loves the
dog, the rest of the dog. And it says,

1711
01:45:14,031 --> 01:45:18,470
congrats on Cleo. What? Thank you. I
appreciate that. You know, I dunno,

1712
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,810
there was something really cool,
I guess about rescuing a dog,

1713
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:25,550
but there are a lot of, if you're a
realist, there's a lot of red flags there.

1714
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:31,040
Dog have been adopted five
fucking times. Uh, you know,

1715
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,340
I don't know. It's a great thing. God
bless you for your adopted dog. All right,

1716
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:40,160
let's get on to Douche bag of the
week. Eric. His douche bag of the week.

1717
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:45,590
Some reason this person sends me this
email right in the middle of my day.

1718
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:48,560
Hey Bill, nice move.
Assuming I'm a female,

1719
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:52,590
I guess I read one of
this, this person's, uh,

1720
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:56,960
questions and I assumed that they were
a female, so they got all upset going.

1721
01:45:56,961 --> 01:46:01,310
Nice move. Assuming I'm a female,
since I never sign my name.

1722
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:06,580
And when you read my comments on your
podcasts and always refer to me as a male,

1723
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:12,320
it's just interesting how people will
determine if a person is male or female

1724
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:15,950
without ever meeting them and
just reading what they write.

1725
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:20,540
Why can't a woman writes something
about baseball or hockey? Uh,

1726
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:22,460
say saying something true,

1727
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:27,440
saying some true overrated shit
without being assumed. A male.

1728
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:32,600
And uh,
this is after she,

1729
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:36,710
the first email she wrote,
she wrote, Bill, fuck you.

1730
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:42,410
And then I wrote, Hey Sweetie,
happy Monday to you. Okay.

1731
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,590
So then she sends me this
other email, you know? Eh,

1732
01:46:45,591 --> 01:46:47,540
it's just really interesting how,

1733
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:50,100
and people send emails
without ever meeting them.

1734
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:54,670
They assume whether they're male or
female. So I just wrote back really,

1735
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:59,970
you know, that's it. That's all that
deserved, really. You know what I mean?

1736
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,740
First of all, sweetheart, I don't know if
you realize it, but in the subject area,

1737
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:09,490
up top, it has your full
name, which is a female name.

1738
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,860
And I don't know if you realize this,

1739
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:16,290
but I get a ton of fucking emails
and I don't say people's names,

1740
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:20,040
so I delete the names and
I just read them. Okay.

1741
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:24,250
And at that point,
I don't know whether it's male or female,

1742
01:47:24,251 --> 01:47:28,270
it's not a fucking sexist thing.
You fucking psychopath.

1743
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,730
I keep referring to my dog as a male
because I fucking always had male dogs.

1744
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,230
My girlfriend keeps giving me shit. I go,
I got take 'em out. And she's like her,

1745
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:42,460
you know? But it's not like, you know, I
wouldn't hire you if you had the right.

1746
01:47:42,461 --> 01:47:46,090
What a fucking, you're
a Douche bag. All right,

1747
01:47:46,091 --> 01:47:47,920
you're a big fucking Douche.
But you know,

1748
01:47:47,921 --> 01:47:52,690
you're such a big douchebag that literally
12 other Douche bags could climb in

1749
01:47:52,691 --> 01:47:55,750
your douche bag. That's how big a
fucking Douche bag you are. Okay?

1750
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:59,440
I'm not assuming anything.
I get a ton of fucking emails.

1751
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,750
And if somebody writes about hockey,
yeah,

1752
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,350
I do assume that they're
fucking mail the same way.

1753
01:48:06,351 --> 01:48:09,470
If somebody wrote about
crocheting a fucking Afghan,

1754
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:11,330
I would assume that they're a female.

1755
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,960
I wouldn't be trying to insult the Rosey
Greer fucking guy who's into knitting.

1756
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:20,630
Just generally speaking.
That's a fucking a,

1757
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:24,870
that's a female thing to do.
All right?

1758
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:28,830
Doesn't mean I don't respect you and your
vagina and your knowledge about hockey.

1759
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:33,770
You know, do you know what from now on,
I'm just going to, I'm going to fucking a,

1760
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:37,100
I'm going to say the gender of everybody.
All right?

1761
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:40,790
Like here's an email from
someone who has a Dick. Uh,

1762
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:44,360
just a quick notes in regards to the
caveman killer. Remember last week,

1763
01:48:44,361 --> 01:48:46,140
the serial killer thing,
uh,

1764
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:50,030
using a sharpened stick as a
weapon and then burning it is a,

1765
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:53,330
so there would be no evidence. Uh,
there's a bit of a problem here,

1766
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,500
although it's genius and inventive
and inventive way to do it.

1767
01:48:57,501 --> 01:49:00,950
He would get caught. Um, when
the autopsy was performed,

1768
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:05,090
they would come across the fibers, dirt
and residue left behind by said stick.

1769
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:08,570
They would then do an analysis
on the residue to find out what,

1770
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:12,770
what it was composed of and what type
of tree was used to make Swiss cheese of

1771
01:49:12,771 --> 01:49:15,260
the victim.
Now having that information,

1772
01:49:15,261 --> 01:49:18,680
the authorities would then plot out a
map of every single area within the state

1773
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:23,660
or vicinity of the victim to narrowed
down where the stick could have come from.

1774
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:26,390
They would then Jesus crisis as long.

1775
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:31,420
They would then narrowed down that further
based on the composition of the dirt

1776
01:49:31,931 --> 01:49:35,860
in any traces of nutrients and figure
out exactly where the s what area the

1777
01:49:35,861 --> 01:49:36,730
stick came from.

1778
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:41,290
A mass search would then take place
instead area and more likely they would be

1779
01:49:41,291 --> 01:49:45,130
able to pinpoint the spot where the earth
was disturbed or the branch that was

1780
01:49:45,131 --> 01:49:49,990
broken within a 24 to 48 window
concluding that this is the spot where the

1781
01:49:49,991 --> 01:49:51,010
weapon was obtained.

1782
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,640
They would then probably find fibers
from the clothing of the perpetrator.

1783
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:55,960
So they would match that.

1784
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:59,440
Later after putting out a new
story with the evidence they had,

1785
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,810
someone would come forward
saying they saw a car,

1786
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:04,540
a person in their area that
seemed to be out of place,

1787
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:07,690
sketchy sketch drawing
would be done and released.

1788
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,960
The and the caveman killer
would be located in arrested.

1789
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:16,200
Putting a nice tight bow on the case
would be their ability to match the dirt

1790
01:50:16,301 --> 01:50:19,360
from the spot where the weapon
was found in the, to the dirt,

1791
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:24,361
found on the bottom of the shoes that
were in the garage of said caveman killer.

1792
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:29,360
Further investigation in the vehicle
would find more traces of that dirt on the

1793
01:50:29,361 --> 01:50:34,100
floor mats from the shoes and on the seat
where the weapon was placed on the way

1794
01:50:34,101 --> 01:50:39,080
to the, uh, the offing. Sorry to say
Mister Cave, sorry to say Mister Caveman.

1795
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:41,150
Game over.
Have Fun playing.

1796
01:50:41,151 --> 01:50:45,290
Hide the stick in prison over
the next 50 years to life.

1797
01:50:45,950 --> 01:50:48,470
Jesus Christ, he got to give it up
to that guy for breaking it down.

1798
01:50:48,471 --> 01:50:51,230
I know he's kind of a,
he was only semi-serious there.

1799
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:54,440
He's talking about like those fucking
a and e murder things cause that's

1800
01:50:54,441 --> 01:50:58,370
literally how people get caught.
Like I saw one with this guy suffocated,

1801
01:50:58,371 --> 01:50:59,060
somebody with the,

1802
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:03,730
with the trash bag and somehow they
figured it out that that's how they did it

1803
01:51:03,731 --> 01:51:07,630
and they were able to find the impression
of the woman's face in the bag.

1804
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:12,070
It was one of the creepiest things ever.
And uh, but I got to tell you something,

1805
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:14,020
you know,
I know you just half joking around,

1806
01:51:14,021 --> 01:51:16,330
but most of that shit's just
circumstantial evidence.

1807
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:19,990
And if you don't have the weapon,

1808
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:24,940
all you have is all that guys to say
what I like to go hiking in that area.

1809
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:31,120
Yes, I hiked in that area. Yes,
my fibers were that, you know,

1810
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:33,220
it's still all
circumstantial at that point.

1811
01:51:33,221 --> 01:51:35,470
If you have no priors
or anything like that,

1812
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:39,120
that's a whole bunch of circumstantial
evidence. And I don't, you know,

1813
01:51:39,121 --> 01:51:43,930
if you get a good lawyer, you're going
to get off, you're going to get off. Um,

1814
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:46,940
and I think that's it for the
Monday morning podcast this week.

1815
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:50,780
Look at up to 54 minutes. It
happened again and I, you know, why?

1816
01:51:50,781 --> 01:51:54,170
Because the God damn fire trucks and I
didn't even get a chance to get to the

1817
01:51:54,171 --> 01:51:58,340
underrated overrated yet. Uh, but you
know, these things are really building up,

1818
01:51:58,341 --> 01:52:02,450
so I've got to blow through
these. Uh, okay. Overrated.

1819
01:52:02,451 --> 01:52:03,650
Driving fast.

1820
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,710
Not many things make me angrier on the
road then when I'm driving 75 miles per

1821
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:08,920
hour,

1822
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:13,920
per hour and I'm getting tailgated
really is 75 not fucking fast enough.

1823
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:17,370
Few people, you know,
something. I, you know, I,

1824
01:52:17,371 --> 01:52:19,090
that really annoys the shit out of me too.

1825
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:22,450
Sometimes I'll bump it up to 80
and people are still riding my ass.

1826
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:26,260
What the fuck? I can understand
and appreciate the need
to get somewhere quickly,

1827
01:52:26,261 --> 01:52:26,710
but is that,

1828
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:31,630
that doesn't mean that wherever you need
to go is more important than my need to

1829
01:52:31,631 --> 01:52:34,630
arrive at my destination at one
fucking piece. Well that is true,

1830
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:37,540
but you know something I got to argue for
the other guy here that if somebody is

1831
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:42,210
riding your ass, you really should
get out of the way, you know? MMM.

1832
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:44,920
I know. That's that whole guy
thing. Then he feel like a bitch,

1833
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,990
you know?
So what do you got to do?

1834
01:52:46,991 --> 01:52:50,720
You've got to stop on the brakes
and be a fucking asshole. Um,

1835
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:54,920
but really I got to admit though,
if you are doing 75 80 in the left lane,

1836
01:52:54,921 --> 01:52:58,430
somebody still riding
your ass. Uh, I dunno.

1837
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:01,220
When you get a little older and more
relaxed, you don't give a fuck. You Do,

1838
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:04,710
you do go over to the right
and like I do now and a path,

1839
01:53:04,711 --> 01:53:06,410
a one out of 40 times you do that,

1840
01:53:06,411 --> 01:53:09,230
you actually get to see the guy get a
speeding ticket a little further down the

1841
01:53:09,231 --> 01:53:12,320
road.
But the other 30 t nine times,

1842
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:16,850
the other 39 times you feel like a bitch.
I got admit underrated, quiet time.

1843
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,880
I remember when we used to have
quiet time in grade school.

1844
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,410
I wish that was still around.

1845
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:24,320
I work at a TV station and I
liked the guys I work with,

1846
01:53:24,321 --> 01:53:27,860
but sometimes I just need
everyone to shut the fuck up.

1847
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:32,030
Do we have to be running our mouths
every goddamn second for the next eight

1848
01:53:32,031 --> 01:53:36,470
hours? Just sit there and do your
work for a bit. We'll talk later.

1849
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:40,190
Jesus. You know what, dude? I
totally fucking relate to. Exactly.

1850
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:43,670
Some people just don't like
fucking silence. You know,

1851
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:46,660
they find it awkward and they
got to keep running their mouths.

1852
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:50,330
Kind of like me for the last fucking
hour. Jesus Christ. All right.

1853
01:53:50,331 --> 01:53:54,230
Underrated TV show the
deadliest warrior on Spike TV.

1854
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:56,030
Just look the shit up.

1855
01:53:56,660 --> 01:54:01,130
It pits two different warriors together
from different time errors and they see

1856
01:54:01,131 --> 01:54:05,630
who would win. Dude, that really
sounds like some nerdy fucking shit.

1857
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,350
Isn't that like, who do you think
would win an alligator or a shark?

1858
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:14,090
I don't know who either were
when Chewbacca or spark.

1859
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:17,000
I don't get into that shit, but
you know what? God bless you sir.

1860
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:21,290
There's people out there went to it. So
I guess, you know, go check it out. Uh,

1861
01:54:21,291 --> 01:54:25,610
real quick, uh, overrated women's
intuition. I've always heard educated,

1862
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:30,500
intelligent women say that women's
intuition is always correct.

1863
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:33,410
Sorry, you're wrong. If that were true,

1864
01:54:33,411 --> 01:54:36,740
why do women repeatedly date abusive?
Twisted guys?

1865
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:39,380
Wouldn't their intuition
tell them that the guy,

1866
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:44,720
what the guy is like yet another reason
of women patting themselves on the back

1867
01:54:44,721 --> 01:54:47,960
for no reason. All right,
sir. You know what?

1868
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:54,950
Fuck that chick. Okay. Whoever
dumped you just fuck her man.

1869
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:56,990
You know there's going to be
another good girl coming around.

1870
01:54:56,991 --> 01:55:00,620
Don't give into the bitterness.
Don't give into the bitterness

1871
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:05,420
or maybe that's just from dating for
a while because there was a lot of,

1872
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:08,300
there's a major part in me.
They really liked that email yet.

1873
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:11,630
Another example of women patting
themselves on the back for no reason.

1874
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:15,470
Jesus Christ. If that sentence doesn't
describe the Oprah Winfrey show,

1875
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:20,420
I don't know. What does a great great
one. All right, here we go. Uh, in women,

1876
01:55:20,421 --> 01:55:22,040
if you're sitting there getting mad,
you can,

1877
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:25,490
you can always fucking trash
guys cause I'll read them.

1878
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:29,060
I'll definitely read them and I know
we deserve it. All right, number two,

1879
01:55:29,061 --> 01:55:33,560
Disney movies. Okay. I'm
35 years old now, but uh,

1880
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:37,190
even as a kid,
I thought those a sugary shit.

1881
01:55:37,191 --> 01:55:40,640
Movies suck bloody balls.
All right dude.

1882
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:45,710
Fucking wait and let me know how you
feel. Overrated. Interlocking lives.

1883
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:50,480
Interlocking lives.
Movies like crash and fast food nation.

1884
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:54,410
Get it. We're all connected.
This shit is getting old.

1885
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:58,880
That movie crash was so fucking overrated.
So fucking,

1886
01:55:58,881 --> 01:56:00,860
and that's one of those movies
just cause it was about race.

1887
01:56:00,861 --> 01:56:05,030
People thought that it was saying
something. Uh, question number four,

1888
01:56:05,031 --> 01:56:09,350
the movie stir crazy. I love Richard
Pryor. He was one of the best ever.

1889
01:56:09,351 --> 01:56:12,470
But this movie is average.

1890
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:16,310
His talent is pretty much
wasted on this film. Yeah,

1891
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:20,710
I would have to say that. Is that the one
where they walk into the, into the jail,

1892
01:56:21,790 --> 01:56:24,670
you know, that's right.
Ah, we bad. We bed.

1893
01:56:24,671 --> 01:56:28,030
That's like the funniest part
of the movie and I dunno,

1894
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,640
I would have to agree with you.
That's it though guys.

1895
01:56:30,641 --> 01:56:34,540
I'm actually coming up on a fucking hour
here. 59 minutes, 25 seconds. Listen,

1896
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:37,450
that's the podcast.
You guys all have a great memorial day,

1897
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:40,450
and I really should have made this one
short so you could actually enjoy your

1898
01:56:40,451 --> 01:56:43,120
memorial day, but you know what? You
got the whole week to listen to it.

1899
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,250
And if you've listened to this on Tuesday,

1900
01:56:45,251 --> 01:56:47,320
that means you're back at
that fucking job you hate.

1901
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:51,650
And I just killed an hour for you. So
God bless. All right. Have a great week.
