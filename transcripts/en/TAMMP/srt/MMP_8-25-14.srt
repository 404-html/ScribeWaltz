1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,610
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:10,340
August 25th,
2014 how's it going out?

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,260
Why? What's up? Um,

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,740
right off the bat I got to apologize to
the members of the band Chicago because

5
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:24,411
last week I actually credited the Doobie
brothers with that wonderful hit say

6
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:30,450
hey in the black.
Right.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,310
So my apologies.
I've always confused those two bands.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,120
There was always something about Chicago.
They were amazing musicians,

9
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,160
but there was just something fucking,

10
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:45,090
I dunno what it was depressing
about their sound to me.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,310
And then after those, uh,
with Terry Kath years,

12
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,810
then it was the Peter Sitara years and
then it just kind of went all like,

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,380
you know, really high pitchy
trying to think of the site.

14
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:03,960
I just remember stay the night.
I liked that video on MTV.

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,053
Hey.

16
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,470
And then there was some, oh wait,
oh, how the fuck does that one go?

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,010
The hardest skin getting used to a shit.
I don't fucking remember.

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,940
I don't know why. You know, I bought
that stupid easy listening rock shit.

19
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,250
So all that crap is in my fucking head.
Now.

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,290
I woke up this morning and Butoh both
doable and all I hear in my head is just

21
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,090
fucking like, Yay by that Bob
on our door, but I've been,

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,900
and something about this boat that sank.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,120
They were out on the lake and they would
deliver it and Oreos and then there was

24
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:48,470
a big fucking wave mark Walberg
when ended a little water.

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,830
George Clooney state in the fucking boat.

26
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,890
Why does every fucking song about
the c have to be in three, four time?

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,273
Yeah.

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,760
[inaudible] is that once
three, four? I don't know.

29
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,320
What the fuck is that shit. They just
make it. You feel like you're rocking.

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,100
You know sometimes this
c is nice and smooth.

31
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,260
Okay. Billy Joel and all you
are the fucking cops out there.

32
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:24,910
You have it. You never been on a boat in
the water. Look like glass. That's four,

33
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,100
four time. You've got to sit
there and rocking back and forth,

34
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,820
getting seasick and the crowd because
you're up there talking about a Goddamn

35
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,200
Segal is your finish off
another jack and coke

36
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,281
I eight,

37
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:45,170
eight 88 I heard or who I shot
got up black fucking daughter.

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,510
I
even just,

39
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:52,830
one of the reason why jaws was
so amazing was um, you know,

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,270
you had to the actor playing Quinn
and his old Sheltie dog. Right.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,320
And even then, what did they sang? They
sang a song. Show me the way to go home.

42
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:06,940
Boom, boom. Bob Died. Anawana go
to bed. Yeah. Regular common time.

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,000
Not sure need men out there go on
shallow made away. They'll go, oh my God,

44
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,020
I fucking shut up with your fucking pig.

45
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:22,710
Lig. She'll get a prosthetic.
Why don't you come a shore?

46
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,250
Who is she captain?

47
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,040
Who are your rent it from
you gotta stay out of Siebel.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,010
Oresteia like jerking off often mermaids
or you got to come ashore and try and

49
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,840
catch another bus.
It's okay.

50
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,030
God come in and you can cry it out.
You can put you on patch on my shoulder.

51
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,740
Um, I was just going to ask a
fucked up question. You know,

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,090
if you lose an eye when you cried,
a tear still come out of both eyes.

53
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,980
The tear duct isn't exactly the
eyeball is it? Hi. Do you know me?

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,370
I never took a science class
in my life or an anatomy class.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,390
They didn't have that shit when I was,

56
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,680
well they had some of the science classes
and I fucking steered clear of them.

57
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,363
Okay.

58
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,510
Once you will pass junior high and you
didn't get to turn on a Bunsen burner,

59
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,060
you know,
that was the only fun thing.

60
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,250
I remember taking one class
and next thing you know,

61
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm fucking doing like open heart
surgery on a dead frog. And so it's like,

62
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,970
I don't want to do this,
this frog and the die.

63
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:29,540
So I could hack it up.
This fucking dog dog,

64
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:34,520
this frog was having a
great God damn time, right?

65
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,750
Hopping around the Christmas
tree and I bought a bow, right?

66
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,920
Jumping around the fucking
swamp eight and flies, you know,

67
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:46,010
it's what it likes to do. That's
like Fritos for a fucking amphibian,

68
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,690
having a great fucking time.
And then some dude comes along.

69
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,900
I don't even know how they
killed the thing, you know,

70
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,090
they can't like fracture.

71
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:59,780
It's little fuck frog skull
because I got an a, you know,

72
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,470
what do you call that when you
cut open something that's dead.

73
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,950
A grave robber. Necrophilia Nah, that's
not it. That's not it, eh, autopsy.

74
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,660
Okay.

75
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,830
Like I'm on law and order,
I dunno.

76
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,250
Probably shot it with
like a poisonous dark.

77
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,010
Okay.

78
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,040
Yeah, but really look into the eyes of
a frog. It would look at the fucking,

79
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,640
the way it holds its mouth, you know?
It's just like that fucking dude just,

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,770
he's trying to blend in.
It's not hurting anybody.

81
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,070
He's not the quarterback.
He's not the burnout.

82
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,090
He's just filler in the class photo.
Can't you let them be.

83
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:41,180
So next thing you know,
they fucking whack came and then a hair.

84
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:43,350
I am trying to cut this thing open.

85
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:45,810
I fucked the whole thing up
and I got a d minus on it,

86
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,413
you know,

87
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,160
I should honor that frog and
at least got an ae taken out.

88
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:57,770
It's fucking lover.
Um,

89
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,970
anyways, uh, what have I been doing?
I had a a eight, a wonderful week.

90
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:09,680
I want to thank everybody who came out
to the odd ball tour, 15,000 strong.

91
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm coming out to the, uh, to Jones beach,

92
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,050
whatever the fuck they call the,
that's the,

93
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:21,530
that amazing arena out there.

94
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:23,630
I'm not going to call it
by this stupid best buy,

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,670
whatever fucking name they give it.
Uh,

96
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,960
but I dunno man,
it was,

97
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,410
you know what's funny is I haven't done
one of those shows in a long time and a

98
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:38,270
long time. And uh, I always go
back to the virus tour in my head.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,801
I always think,

100
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:44,801
I don't like doing shows at night
outside with tens of thousands of fucking

101
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:50,150
people here because they act like,
you know, they act like animals.

102
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,130
And um, which really wasn't
the case on the virus tour.

103
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,550
They just acted like animals in
the last two dates that I did.

104
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,890
And the second show was
imitating the first show.

105
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,340
So it was really just the one show.
But what it was on the virus tour was,

106
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,950
you knew that show was coming.
You just didn't know when.

107
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,880
It's like when you creep through a
fucking house and there's an ax murder,

108
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,350
you don't know what rummies in,

109
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,220
but you know he's in the house and at
some point somebody's going to try to

110
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:20,270
fucking swing an ax that you had
that was basically the virus tour.

111
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,990
And I'm so I think whenever I go to
do those, I kind of have like a my,

112
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,340
my fucking comedy
Vietnam flashback and um,

113
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,450
okay.

114
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,020
I Dunno. And I went out there and
I was, I was pleasantly surprised.

115
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,750
The crowd was unbelievable.

116
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,650
Like 15,000 people and you can take
them wherever you want it to go.

117
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:44,750
Actually brought him down at one
point, uh, brought him down, you know,

118
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,260
like a song for the little breakdown,

119
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,440
the Bob Seger part where he fucking
sings about how many years went by.

120
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,580
All right, 20 years.
Where did it go? 20 years.

121
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,760
I don't know where they go
home. Yeah, you do, Bob. You,

122
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:02,320
they went up your nose, you're out.
They having a fucking orgy. Yeah.

123
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:06,250
The decades kind of fly by when you
live in the rock style lifestyle.

124
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,600
Can you stop bringing us down?

125
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,130
You're supposed to be up there acting
like you having the time of your life

126
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,120
remember and everything.

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,440
Don't fucking come down to my level in
the crowd and tell me that you're also

128
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:19,540
wondering what the fuck
you're doing with your life.

129
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,900
You know what that says to be Bob?
There's no hope.

130
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,080
Anyways. Um, so I was on a,

131
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,570
arguably one of the best fucking
lineups I've ever been on,

132
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,590
at least since I did the, uh,
the virus tours back in the day.

133
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,250
You guys want to compare it?
You want to compare a standup lineups?

134
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,650
Let's start a fucking Internet lineup.
I mean,

135
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,660
argument here with the
lineups of both shows.

136
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:46,340
This is like arguing Superbowl teams.

137
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:50,090
Who'd you add the have to it would
you rather have the 85 beers?

138
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,140
The fuck is 79 sterilize

139
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,730
or any team with Tom Brady on it.

140
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,900
And I just fucking threw that out there
because so many people fucking hate him.

141
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,890
His cleft Chin.

142
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,200
Tom Brady has an ass on
his chair that he fucks us.

143
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:12,480
Get a check from Brazil.
Um,

144
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,453
okay.

145
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,790
I'm sorry. You know what's
great about three, four time.

146
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,480
I understand why you write it
cause anything sounds important.

147
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,010
I scratched my bows and
I brushed my day empty.

148
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,640
Their head headed a AIG ovaries.
A um,

149
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,810
all right, so let's, let's
compare lineups. All right.

150
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,800
So back in the day, all
right. That virus tour,

151
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,090
the Philly show as much as I can remember
of it, which was a long time ago,

152
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,210
which by the way, there's been more God
damn horse shit written about that show.

153
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:57,211
Some fucking guy wrote this all this
fucking bullshit about what happened that

154
00:09:57,971 --> 00:09:59,680
night. Uh, when I got booed

155
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,800
and I actually tweeted back to him the
correct story and then he just retweets it

156
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,950
like they'd, nothing means
anything to anybody. No. All,
hey, sorry, I got it wrong.

157
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,330
This dude tried to say that
Bobby Kelly got booed before me.

158
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Dom got booed before me and then I was
standing backstage with opie and Anthony

159
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:27,360
and I said, Dang door. That to me

160
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,420
like I'm fucking pop by.
I ain't had my needle spinach here.

161
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,200
Um, everything comes back to
the seat Popeye, the sailor man.

162
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,520
The fucking same
as another dude.

163
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:46,830
Fucking skinny bitch.
All right.

164
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,840
What's what these heroes, they don't
like hips. You don't like some fives.

165
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:57,410
They're little thoroughbred prints
and down the fucking road. Um,

166
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,170
okay.

167
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,060
Yeah, that didn't happen. Bobby
had a great set that night. Dom,

168
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,690
they booed for like 30 seconds and he
just, he told him to shut up and he goes,

169
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:09,730
what?
Why would you think I would ever leave?

170
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,090
And I was sitting backstage going,
I don't want to fucking do this.

171
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,770
Nervous as hell.

172
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,860
And then I went out there and I opened
with a bad cell phone joke and then they

173
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:25,700
started bullying me. And then what
happened? That's what happened.

174
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,180
And then Jim Norton went out after me and
never addressed it and fucking killed.

175
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,140
That is what happened. That is what
happened. The first guy got booed.

176
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,100
It's seven o'clock and then everybody
else had good sets and then I got booed

177
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,540
like three hours later. All
right. That's what happened.

178
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,220
That is what happened. Okay. For the
final fucking time, that is what happened,

179
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,090
right?
He can scavenge no more or

180
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,650
no, it was realized backstage. Oh, I want
to do this, man. I didn't need to be here.

181
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,300
I was like, that dude and platoon, I
got a bad feeling about this one man.

182
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,030
Um, so there you go. All right,
so the lineup that night,

183
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:12,570
I will not name the other person who got
booed because I'm a fucking class act

184
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:15,230
over here with my cute little button nose.
Um,

185
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,550
it was,
let me see if I can remember Tracy Morgan.

186
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,370
Okay.

187
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,530
Bob Saget.

188
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,020
Okay.

189
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,070
Ralphie May, Bobby Kelly, dom Irrera,

190
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:33,050
Patrice O'Neil,
myself,

191
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,480
Jim Norton.
That's who I remember was on that show.

192
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,490
What a fucking lineup that is. Huh?
Patrice? The greatest comic of,

193
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:46,940
uh, you know, my generation
as far as I'm concerned.

194
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,770
I mean that, that's just, that's
fucking murderers row right there.

195
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,710
And I came out like Neil O'Donnell.

196
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,990
Oh Shit. Alright. And then last week,

197
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,140
last weekend I went on a show and we had,

198
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,060
uh, let's see here. Sarah
Silverman, Hannibal Burress,

199
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,140
Louis C, k, David.

200
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:19,880
Tell Myself Jeff Ross,

201
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,980
uh,
Chris Hardwick

202
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,290
and uh,
who else was on that show?

203
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,090
Some yoga comic and I fucked up. What
the fuck's his name? The young dig.

204
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,270
The youngster there are the young
[inaudible], the young fellow there.

205
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,350
Right?
Who Do you like?

206
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,250
Who Do you like about it? That was a
fucking boat shows, you know what I mean?

207
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:52,090
Come on. Those are two of the sickest
shows I've been on. So anyways,

208
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:54,220
I went out there,
um,

209
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,970
and it was unreal and of
course like a fucking asshole.

210
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,530
I didn't get a picture with
anybody backstage. What an asshole.

211
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:07,531
At one point I'm talking to Louie and
Dave like two of my biggest standup heroes

212
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,790
and I got a fucking iPhone Ami
and I never thought to be like,

213
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,060
Hey, let's get a picture.
I never thought to do that.

214
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,240
Now I don't know all of these.
These next weekend I'm doing more of them

215
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,930
to pay for the fucking money pit.
I didn't want to get into that.

216
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm not even going to get into that
because there's no comedy left in this

217
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:31,210
fucking project. Uh, Jesus,

218
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,360
I'm just,
when the job is done,

219
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm going to go downstairs and I'm not
going to have any money to refurnish it

220
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,990
and I'm just going to stand
down there and in the echo,

221
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:41,910
I'm just going to start with.
Yeah.

222
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,120
Um, never again. Never again. I understand

223
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,570
why nobody did shit to this fucking
house because to try to fix it is

224
00:14:55,571 --> 00:15:00,130
ridiculously expensive. And I am, I am.
I am fucking done with it. So anyways,

225
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,070
I, uh, I went out there,
I had a great time.

226
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,040
I was trying out new material and uh,

227
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,910
it was such a cool,

228
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:12,480
I didn't even realize how cool the venue
was until somebody took a picture from

229
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:17,010
the upper deck, the upper deck,
a fucking comedy show. How that,

230
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:21,310
that venue, uh, I'll actually,
I'll tweet it out. Um,

231
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,290
on the Monday morning podcasts,
Twitter, uh, handle there.

232
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,200
Whatever the fuck you kids
say at the m m podcast,

233
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,230
join our Twitter following.
We're only up to,

234
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,180
we're already up to 10,000
followers, you know, 10,000 more.

235
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:41,000
We can start a church. You guys
will start calling me father. Uh,

236
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,970
right. I'll grow a long white beard and
I'll start banging everybody who fucking,

237
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,980
you know,
everybody who was there.

238
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,750
That's what you do when you can't,
when you can't play an instrument,

239
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,580
when you can't tell jokes and you still
want to fuck everything that's moves.

240
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,630
Your only other option is
other than hookers, is you,

241
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:01,950
you have to start a religion.

242
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,340
That's basically what you do.

243
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,580
And you tell people what they want
to hear and you bring them in.

244
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,470
Okay.

245
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,290
And you tell them that there's this
higher thing and it cares about them,

246
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,320
it's going to help them. And,
but I'm the direct route to it.

247
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:19,090
You talk to me and I'll talk to with,
and I know it, it, it loves me and it,

248
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,960
whatever I say it's going to listen to
and I'm kind of it, you know what I mean?

249
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm kind of it, but it's it. But I'm kind
of that thing. And next thing you know,

250
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm it, I'm the, I'm the guy, I'm
Jesus. I'm the father, the son.

251
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,260
I'm the fucking house,

252
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,070
Funny Omega, I'm the fucking, uh,
Fox Trot and the fucking x Ray,

253
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,010
right?
Next thing you know,

254
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,290
you're blowing Jesus. Um, all right. So,

255
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,610
okay.

256
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,960
So we went ahead and we did
the, uh, we do the Gig and, uh,

257
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,800
I flew into New York Friday for the Gig,

258
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,680
6:00 AM flight,
and then I flew back 8:00 AM Saturday.

259
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,600
I like,
I landed at like three o'clock,

260
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,680
jumped in a cab traffic all
the way in to lower Manhattan,

261
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:15,970
Soho, drop my bags, jumped
in the shower, got ready,

262
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,600
ran downstairs, got in the
van, went out, did the Gig,

263
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,640
came back, smoked a cigar, Versie
stayed out until four in the morning,

264
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,970
went right to the fucking airport.
And that was, that was it right in.

265
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:28,781
And I got to tell you,

266
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,500
I had two of the greatest fucking
transcontinental flights I ever had.

267
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,660
I go to the airport,
right?

268
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,390
6:00 AM and I'm sitting there
like a fucking Zombie, right?

269
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,410
And there's a guy sitting
like two seats over.

270
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,580
He's sitting there like
all those people,

271
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:50,090
they don't sit on their ass.
They kind of sit on

272
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,990
their lower back and then the back of
their neck is at the top of the chair.

273
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,710
He was sitting there and his shirt was
up and he was showing his mid drift for

274
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:01,190
whatever fucking reason. So I want
to take a picture of this guy subtly.

275
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,550
You don't not show his head just so
it was awful belly sitting there.

276
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,590
This fucking legs at a 45 degree
angle and I want us, you know,

277
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,080
I was going to text one of my,
uh, Hashtag animal photos, right?

278
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,470
And of course right as they get the phone
out, he drops his shirt down. I'm like,

279
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:19,550
God damn it. You know, and I'm
hating life. I'm tired as shit.

280
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,900
And all of a sudden the lady at the a,
the desk just goes,

281
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,250
Mr. William Day, Kiki plead to pledge
the fucking guest here, please.

282
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,170
So I got shit, what are they going to
say that gave my fucking seat away?

283
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,970
And now I'm sitting on the toilet in
the back and I walked up and they,

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,580
they bumped me up to first class,
first forking clayish.

285
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,300
So I get on the plane and it's those
first class seats that are diagonal,

286
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,200
that fold all the way down into a bed.
So the second way airborne,

287
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,830
I fold this thing down into the
bed or unfolded, I should say,

288
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,480
put on my little sleep mask
and just fucking pass out.

289
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,390
I wake up three and a half hours later,
put the thing back up.

290
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,920
I ask if there's any breakfast left. They
say, yes there is. I've got some yogurt,

291
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:13,970
Granola and a fucking
egg and spinach quiche,

292
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,920
whatever the fuck it is.
It was delicious.

293
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,090
And then I watched Mike Tyson's one
man show and the second it ended,

294

Mike Tyson's one man show. I got to talk
about that here in a second. Let me, uh,

Big Shave companies are charging you

353
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,950
Am I reading the right ones? Ah, fuck me

354
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:47,390
thought there was a, I
read the wrong ones. Oh,

355
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:48,320
what an asshole.

356
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,610
Okay.

357
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,690
Legal Zoom. Okay. Well, no, no, I didn't
read it. And Dollar Shave Club. All right.

358
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:57,230
Those were two I supposed to do. I was
reading last week stuff, but thank God.

359
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,830
All right, those do count. So
listen to what I just said on those

360
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,140
[inaudible].

361
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,080
Don't save all right now
that's out of the fucking way.

362
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,150
Yeah.

363
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,520
Okay. Anyways, let's get back
to the Mike Tyson one man show.

364
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:17,410
If you haven't seen it, I
highly recommend it. Um,

365
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,110
it's a, I dunno, it's Mike
Tyson telling his story.

366
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,740
And what I loved about it was

367
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,280
there was times you love the
Guy Times you will, like,

368
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:35,210
I dunno about this Guy Times
you felt he was being sincere.

369
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:38,540
And then other times you're like,
this guy's, you know, as he says,

370
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,000
he was a hustler.
And I'm just sitting there going,

371
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:44,760
is he doing that right now
to me? And in the end, um,

372
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,170
you know, you don't know
it was, I don't know.

373
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:53,850
It was just a really, first
of all, what killed me was I,

374
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,410
I think Mitch Green or whatever
the fuck the name that back.

375
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:58,920
Remember that guy he punched
in the eye and closed his eyes.

376
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,930
He tells the whole fucking story and acts
out the other guy wearing a Jheri curl

377
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:06,820
wig and

378
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,970
just sit down and watch it and tell
me you don't see Charlie Murphy on the

379
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:14,340
Chappelle show,
you know,

380
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:17,470
and Dave Chappelle doing the ric
Charlie Murphy talking about fight.

381
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:21,270
And Rick James, I'm telling you, this is
his story, could literally be the sequel.

382
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,130
All I kept picturing was Dave
Chappelle reenacting this fight,

383
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,810
this epic fucking street
fight that started in a store,

384
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,740
ends up out in the street fucking with
the other dude on top of Tyson's car and

385
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:42,960
Tyson just giving up boxing and,
and I was just kicking the guy is there,

386
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,120
bolt on the ground. I mean, it was,

387
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:48,210
it was unbelievable story and fucking
hilarious. And I was sitting there going,

388
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:50,290
why is this guy do this?

389
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,360
There was a style with which that he
tells that story that was very reminiscent

390
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,970
of the way Charlie Murphy tells
a story. Then I'm like, well,

391
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,340
these guys are like within
five years of each other.

392
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,480
And they both grew up in Brooklyn
around the same time. And um,

393
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,230
I don't know. It's one of my favorite
things that I've seen in a while. Granted,

394
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,850
I was laying in a bed in FirstClass
eating a spinach and egg quiche,

395
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,840
you know, you know, Judah
Freelander said to me one time,

396
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:22,830
I watched some movie and I
was like, you know, I, well,
you know, I was on the plane.

397
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:23,581
You know what I watched?

398
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:27,580
I watched whatever movie and was a
movie that got bad reviews and uh, yeah,

399
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:29,910
I thought it was good.
I thought it was a good movie.

400
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,520
And they just starts laughing. And
I was like, why? He goes, Bill,

401
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,420
every movie is a good movie. When
you're on an airplane. He's like,

402
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:38,340
you're on an airplane.
You fucking hate in life.

403
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:41,820
You put this thing on and eats up an
hour and a half of your life. I'm like,

404
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:44,850
all right, fair enough. Fair enough.
But I got to say this, this, uh,

405
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:49,650
the Tyson one man show, which was
done on Hbo, uh, shot by spike Lee.

406
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,760
Um,
you know what's funny about Spike Lee's,

407
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,530
how we always trashes Tarantino about it,

408
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,070
how the characters dropping the
n words and that type of stuff.

409
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,630
If you want to see something funny is how,
how Spike Lee views Italians.

410
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,070
Like if Italians could be in black face,
like in [inaudible],

411
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
they should be in his movies
is they always like, Huh?

412
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,300
Oh well you feel good.

413
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,710
They're always wearing track suits

414
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,713
mama.

415
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,710
It's ridiculous.
I just watched summer sandwich.

416
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:33,000
I really liked that movie but I had to
hit mute when they're full and they were

417
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:36,810
fucking showing the Italians when they
was sitting down at that dead end street.

418
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,840
It will, it look like a fucking
bad musical from like 1953.

419
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,690
Um, so, you know, I think he,

420
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:48,880
I think he's got some work to do himself.

421
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,580
Oh, let me get some focused. Um,

422
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,550
all right, sorry. That's my little
criticisms. If you know, you know,

423
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:07,310
there's nothing better than someone
who's never made a fucking movie himself.

424
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:08,420
Never written one or anything.

425
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:11,840
Now I'm going to sit there and criticize
and one of the top directors out there.

426
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:16,360
Right. But anyways, he directed
that and I really enjoyed it. Um,

427
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,280
so check it out if you get a
chance, hey, you don't movie.

428
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,690
I wanted to see and I didn't get, I didn't
get a chance to see anything. You know,

429
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:28,691
I was going to go fucking a cozy planet
of the apes and root against the apes as

430
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:30,080
I was in the first one.

431
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,550
Okay.

432
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,580
I fucking hated, hated, uh,

433
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,750
James Franco's character
in that first one.

434
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,030
I couldn't stay like

435
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,380
I went and I saw it with Nia and
we're sitting there and once he, he,

436
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,730
he gave that fucking,

437
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,170
he gave that fucking ape like pants
and sneakers and shit. You know,

438
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,380
it was just like, dude, what
the f? What are you doing?

439
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,520
Yeah.

440
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,400
What the fuck? What are you
doing? You talking to a,

441
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,960
to an ape.
Don't give it pants.

442
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,243
All right?

443
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,150
You get, you can't, can't have the thing
fucking dress in as good as you are.

444
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,340
Jesus Christ did.

445
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,350
Didn't you learn anything from the British
how they built their empire on that

446
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,500
little shit? Ass fucking little island
out there ran the fucking world out.

447
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:26,560
Did they do it? Divide and
conquer. All right. Yeah.

448
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,210
You don't get to wear shoes.
Anybody at this levels get shoes,

449
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,200
but no pants.

450
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,690
Then the very best of all of you who
get to this level, get shoes and pants.

451
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:41,530
That's what they did.
And then the people with no shoes,

452
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:45,250
eight of the people with shows be wish
shoes for, you know, that's what you do,

453
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:51,210
you know, go into your fucking closet.
A a chimpanzee. Yeah, go ahead.

454
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,750
Pick it.
Pick yourself out of soup.

455
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,100
We'll go down to the track like fucking
Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke and uh,

456
00:28:59,290 --> 00:28:59,810
okay.

457
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,250
The fucking a, I dunno,
the King of Prince Street,

458
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:06,710
whatever the fucking name that movie was.
The fuck was the name of that movie.

459
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,450
The pope of Greenwich
Village. Every, you know,

460
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:14,810
sometimes I watch a movie and I go for
the ride and there's other times like,

461
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:17,600
people just do shit. That's just
so fucking dumb. It's just like,

462
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,260
I don't have any sympathy for,
you should get your face ripped off

463
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,780
fucking sitting there. You know,
you don't give a laptop to a monkey.

464
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,643
What's wrong with you?

465
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,453
Okay.

466
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,120
Think of all the Shit we've done to him.
You know,

467
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:38,560
you can teach them how to drive a car.

468
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,080
Okay.

469
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,100
Like how does that end? Um, anyways, yeah.

470
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:48,980
So I didn't see the second one. I'll go
to the one when we fucking defeat him.

471
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,360
You know, I'm a fair weather fan when it
comes to those eight movies. When the,

472
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:56,690
when the humans win, I'll, I'll, I'll,
I'll come back and I'll watch that one.

473
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,000
You know, I'll come by for the
playoffs. Playoffs. Um, anyways,

474
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,940
so after we do the,
uh,

475
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,820
after we do the Gig right
out there at Jones beach, um,

476
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,300
okay.

477
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,450
You know, I, I'm trying
to get back to, uh,

478
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,260
to New York as quickly as I can so I can
fucking go smoke the cigar with Versie

479
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:22,470
before I jump on a plane and
like fucking three hours. So, um,

480
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,810
Hardwick cat a car.

481
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,270
Okay.

482
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,480
So he goes, hey man. He goes, I'm
going to hang and watch the set.

483
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:32,600
We can ride back to the city together.
I'm like, perfect. So I go out, do my set.

484
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,680
Fucking unbelievable crowd
had a great time. It was like,

485
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,960
oddly like intimate.
It felt like a small crowd.

486
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:42,260
That crowd was so fucking amazing.
And um,

487
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,140
then I'll thank Christ. I didn't bomb,
I had a great set, I got out of there,

488
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,140
said goodbye,
didn't take any pictures like an asshole.

489
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,000
So I jumped in the car with Hardwick
and they gave us a police escort,

490
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,930
swear to God out of the
venue and up to the highway.

491
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,310
But this is what's funny.

492
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,580
The show is still going on so
there's completely no need for this.

493
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,450
And we are basically driving through a
full parking lot with nobody in our way

494
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,030
with the police car,
with its lights flashing.

495
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,060
And we sat that laugh. We're going, are
we wasting taxpayer money right now?

496
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,650
And we're like, no. Well I mean
they were hired here anyways,

497
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,670
so they were already hired for the event.
It's like,

498
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,120
what about the gas and the crows though?
So there you go.

499
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:34,420
I've got my first police escort,
you know,

500
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:38,140
and there was nobody there to witness
it other than me in hardware and our

501
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:41,710
driver, I swear to God
it happened, it happened.

502
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,030
It took me 22 years of this
business and it finally happened.

503
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,500
Just imagine Beatlemania
if nobody gave a fuck,

504
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:56,150
that's basically what we were
experiencing. We had the nice car,

505
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,590
we had the police escort and
other than the screaming fans,

506
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,370
you know, there was just sort of
a, yeah, there was a guardrail,

507
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,610
that's all I saw looking out the
window. Nobody saw it. Anyways,

508
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,770
let's plow ahead here.
So then I get back to the city.

509
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,230
Okay.

510
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,590
And, uh, I meet up with Versie
and another one of my buddies, uh,

511
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,580
Doug send, Yay. I'll be naming
names all over the place.

512
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,640
Two buddies of mine from
the standup world. And uh,

513
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:28,200
we go to the cigar bar and
have the time of our life in.

514
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:31,260
Both of them are golfers and they heard
what the fuck I said on my podcast or

515
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:32,700
whatever.
So we just start,

516
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,190
we just start going back and forth and
back and forth and back and forth arguing

517
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:42,240
this golf point. And I think I can
actually make my point a little,

518
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,530
I guess clearer.

519
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,880
And it's basically a why I considered
golf and activity a difficult activity.

520
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,600
Absolutely mentally taxing
activity without a fucking doubt.

521
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,810
I just,
I just feel like a,

522
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,300
you know when you don't have
to be any sort of cardio shape,

523
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,330
like you can be in whatever shape
you want to be and still win like a

524
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:13,400
championship.
You could be a fat fuck.

525
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:14,880
Okay.

526
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,720
Okay. And how are we going to say? Oh,
what about those offensive linemen?

527
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:20,370
That fat fucks.
Fuck you.

528
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,870
They can run a four 40 or a five
flat 40 those are fucking athletes.

529
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,250
Okay.

530
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,250
And they are that size like the way sumo
wrestlers are because they have to be

531
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:32,334
that size.

532
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,263
Okay.

533
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,940
They're told to get that fucking big.
All right.

534
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Warren Sapp at his biggest weight could
still fucking wind dancing with the

535
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:50,280
stars. Okay. You're talking to an athlete
here. He's still light on his toes there.

536
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,510
All right. I'm talking how you can
just be a complete non athlete.

537
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,130
You can not even throw a fucking baseball
and, but you can be good at golf.

538
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:01,800
So or pool or bowling.

539
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,660
I lump all of those together.
They are a,

540
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,090
there are activities
with elements of sport.

541
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,460
It's like sport that you hit pause
on because there's no defender,

542
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,970
you know what I mean? And then picking
off, if somebody just says, you know,

543
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,430
Voss was saying, you
know that he goes, dude,

544
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,940
the other day I was out playing
golf and I shot in the meeting,

545
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,540
I was shooting in the mid eighties and
he got excited about shooting the mid

546
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,580
eighties and he goes, next thing you
know, I couldn't hit a shot. He goes,

547
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:37,130
there's no other game when that
happens. It's like, yeah, it does.

548
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,850
Not only does that happen in every other
fucking gay goes where you completely

549
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:42,920
forget out of the play the game.
Yes it does.

550
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,560
That happens in every other
sport and it happens in life.

551
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:50,561
It happens in up this man stand up comics
that have gone out to do a late night

552
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:54,710
talk show guts. So fucking in
their head, they forgot their act.

553
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,990
It's called choking in the moment,

554
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,453
you know,

555
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,440
I dunno, I probably be a great
golfer because I don't give a shit.

556
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:04,820
I don't respect the fucking game.

557
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,470
So I would never get in my
head, oh my God, I shot a 14.

558
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:15,040
Who gives a fuck? I'm not even keeping
score. I think that that's the dumb thing.

559
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:18,940
If you start keeping score
and out the whole thing,

560
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,500
it's like asked you if you're playing
cribbage out there and I just don't

561
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:22,640
understand the whole fucking thing.

562
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,540
I don't understand why people won't
come to my way of thinking of it.

563
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,600
Why don't you think my way? So whenever
we're arguing this fucking thing,

564
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,250
okay.

565
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,300
And uh,

566
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,380
just having a great time
and the night ends verse,

567
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,750
he drives me back down to the
hotel. We get out, I get a bacon,

568
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:41,650
egg and cheese

569
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,590
at like four in the morning and then
I walk into a Dunkin donuts and get a

570
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:51,000
chocolate glazed donuts. By the way,
people, I'm off the rails here, um,

571
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,750
with the Diet thing and I'm
starting to go back up again.

572
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,610
So I decided this morning,
I'm like,

573
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,140
I just have to step outside because
right now I got the crack in me.

574
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:03,660
I got the sugar salt thing. Look
at that Bacon, egg and cheese,

575
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,350
salt through the fucking roof. Oh, I
want a donut. I don't want a donut.

576
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,040
Nobody ever wants to fucking
doughnut unless this salts
through the fucking roof.

577
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,030
And I shoved that down my fucking pie
hole like homer Simpson and then I go

578
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:18,600
directly to bed. Horrific. Um,

579
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,990
so that was the end of the night.
Just had a great time. And uh,

580
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,850
so I oversee versus kind of, uh, he bought
this, you know, versus a sedan guy. Right.

581
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,680
Cause I was trying to convince him,

582
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,150
I was saying one of the coolest cars
out there right now is the Mercedes Benz

583
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,110
East 63 AMG formatics station wagon.

584
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,580
They made a station wagon
that goes zero to 60,

585
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:47,480
in like three and a half
fucking seconds to me. You know,

586
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,090
I got this like I love,
I love a fast car,

587
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:55,070
but I love a car that doesn't look
fast. That is fast. The fucking right.

588
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,020
Did I talk about this last week?
I can't remember.

589
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,940
So I was trying to tell him why that car
was the shit and how funny it is if he

590
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:06,760
owned that fucking car. You know, if
you're married with kids, you know,

591
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:09,590
and you pull up next to some punk and
they see you there with your fucking

592
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:12,650
station wagon and then you blow
him off the line, you know,

593
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:15,890
groceries flying out the back end. I
just think that they know, and I'm,

594
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,370
I'm German. Right. And that's
the great thing about Germans,

595
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,280
you know,
is their fucking,

596
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:27,510
their ability with science is incredible.
You know,

597
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,470
they're not the best to get along
with people. Absolutely. Okay.

598
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:36,471
But who the fuck makes a station wagon
that goes zero to 60 in like 3.8 seconds?

599
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,570
The fucking Germans

600
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,733
got to love,

601
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,770
you know, you get dead, you get yourself
some strudel or a fucking Reuben there.

602
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,120
I mean, what, what else do you need?

603
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,040
Sorry. So anyways, um, he's
got this four door sedan, man,

604
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:58,490
and I'm telling you it's a fucking
bad ass car. But I kept, he's got it.

605
00:37:58,491 --> 00:38:03,000
He's got to get some rims on
it, you know? So I said to him,

606
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:05,730
I was going to bring it up.
All right, I'm going to get,

607
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,860
this is what I want to
try to use the power,

608
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:12,030
what little power I have on this podcast
to get Paul Versey to get rid of his,

609
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,830
his fucking, I'm a 55 year old. Awful.

610
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,120
I'm a 55 year old man. Awful rims on
his car. So if you have a rim shot,

611
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,860
a rim, a rim shop, a rim
shot, it's a drumming thing.

612
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:31,350
If you have, if you have a few
owners store and you sell rims,

613
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,300
okay? Can you hook my boy Versie
up if you hook them up? Okay.

614
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:39,580
If you give them a sweetheart
of a fucking deal, okay.

615
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,050
For some rims on his car,

616
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:44,470
you can advertise for free for two
weeks on a Monday morning podcast.

617
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:47,140
I bought that. Okay. I'm
throwing it out there.

618
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,960
You got to hook up
Paul. Dude, I called it,

619
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,230
don't say I'm from Jersey.
Versie okay.

620
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,230
Hook 'em up because I like his cars,

621
00:38:58,231 --> 00:39:01,470
but his rims annoy me and they're going
to affect their fucking friendship there.

622
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:06,060
I said it all right. Um, all
right, let's plow ahead here.

623
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:11,010
Where are we in the podcast? 39 minutes.
Oh Jesus. I think it's time for a,

624
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:15,150
I think it's time for some more letters.
Let me just bang out these last two, uh,

625
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,840
advertising things.
I love this advertising here because this,

626
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:23,310
this reminds me how close football
season ends is, uh, is coming here.

627
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,330
Draft kings, everybody.
The wait is almost over.

628
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,280
Football season is just around the
corner and you could get your piece of 5

629
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,200
million bucks.
During kickoff,

630
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:39,090
we had draft kings.com America's
favorite one week fantasy football site.

631
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,350

634
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:54,120
weekend.

635
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,470
Another player won a million bucks in
one day just playing fantasy football.

636
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,000
All right, who's kitten hope? People you
play in fantasy football. You're a nerd.

637

689
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,440

little bit of something. All right. Um,

690
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:12,810
okay.

691
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:16,200
And with that, let's, uh,

692
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,700
let's get to the letters here.
Alright, girl, smokes a lot of weed.

693
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,040
Hey Cincinnati bow tie. Billy. I
don't even know what that means.

694
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,570
I gotta look that up.
Um,

695
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,410
I had been with my girlfriend for two
years and lived with her for about a year

696
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,540
and a half.
She has smoked weed since the day we met,

697
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,300
which doesn't bother me
because I used to smoke myself.

698
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,390
What bothers me is how many times
she smokes in, in a given day.

699
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,070
We will sometimes be hanging out watching
TV and she will out of nowhere get up

700
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:47,320
to grab her bowl to take a hit.

701
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,310
I've even caught her getting out of bed
in the middle of the night to take a hit.

702
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,700
I don't want to be a dick and tell
her she can't smoke after all.

703
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:58,790
I used to smoke myself. Uh,
she just looks like a drug fee.

704
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,800
Always trying to get a fix. I don't
get why she has to be high 24, seven.

705
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,050
I have a beer,
one beer after work,

706
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:12,550
maybe one to two days a week and sometimes
she will throw that in my face if I

707
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:14,710
comment about her constant weed smoking,

708
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,840
which isn't even close to the same thing.

709
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,150
I've always said this about weed smokers.

710
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,230
I've always said that about them.
Like the level that they get,

711
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,710
they get fucking high at work. Not all
of them. I'm just saying, you know,

712
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:28,760
like they'll fucking go out.

713
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,770
That'd be like if I went out in the
parking lot and shotgun a beer and came in

714
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:34,830
like with booze on my breath.
Um,

715
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,440
and it is addictive not to everybody,

716
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,560
but you can become addicted but sounds
like she is addicted to this shit.

717
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:45,570
Like she needs it to help her sleep.
She needs it so she can fucking deal man.

718
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,700
Um,
anyway,

719
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:51,300
she goes some egos sometimes she'll throw
that in my face if I comment about her

720
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:54,480
constant weed smoking,
which isn't even close to the same thing.

721
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,760
She also complains that she is broke.

722
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,900
It has no problem spending $100
on a bag of weed, a bag of weed.

723
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:04,050
What kills me is she will
sometimes ask me to help,

724
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,040
I'll help her out with the
bill or whatever, and I'm
just like, what the fuck?

725
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,830
How about you don't buy weed?
Our relationship is great.

726
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,530
This isn't a deal breaker or anything.
It's just an annoyance.

727
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:16,800
Should I just deal with it or should I
try to get her to chill out with weed?

728
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,740
What would you do with the lovely
Nia smoked weed all day? Thanks.

729
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:24,390
Go Fuck Yourself. I would address it.
I will definitely address it. Okay.

730
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:25,943
MMM.

731
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,440
Yeah,
she has a problem with that shit.

732
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:32,130
If you're waking up in the middle of
the night and taken another hit. I mean

733
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,380
I always just acquainted to drinking
because for some odd reason people can see

734
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:42,120
alcoholism,
but they can't see addiction with weed.

735
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,113
MMM.

736
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,420
If you were with somebody and in the
middle of the night they got up and poured

737
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:51,190
themselves a belt or to,
you know,

738
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,230
a couple of fingers of Scotch and
slammed it and then went back to sleep or

739
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:59,650
right in the middle of a movie they went
over and just fucking shotgun to beer.

740
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,010
And I that cause that's
basically what they're doing.

741
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,490
It's not like they go out and make a drink
in there sipping it. They're not that,

742
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,760
you know, they're getting high.
Then I gradually getting drunk.

743
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:12,850
It's like you do it. Bump. Yeah. Hi. Um,

744
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,570
and if she's doing it all the
time and she doesn't have,

745
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,620
she's not making any money and then she
asking you to help her out. I mean, if,

746
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:24,220
what if you didn't have a job and you
were drinking at the level that she was

747
00:46:24,221 --> 00:46:29,221
smoking and you were spending 100
bucks on beer every week and sometimes,

748
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,350
you know,
you would ask her for help.

749
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,033
MMM.

750
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,250
What would she do? She would be
upset. Now this is what I would do.

751
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,230
I would bring it up with her.

752
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,820
She's gonna get mad and this is the thing,

753
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,720
you cannot get mad too if she yells
and calls you names and everything,

754
00:46:51,731 --> 00:46:55,720
just do not get mad.
Just sit there and know that she is,

755
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,330
you know,
you're going to lose the fight.

756
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:00,910
Okay?

757
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,400
If you bring up her weed
smoking and then she's like,

758
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:06,220
you know what the fuck you fucking blah
blah blah blah blah blah. And then a few,

759
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:08,380
if you go to where the fuck she is there,

760
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:13,530
you're going to lose because then it's
become a name calling thing and you know

761
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:18,930
she is successfully gotten it out of the
arena of what she's doing is fucked up.

762
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,560
Uh, yeah. You just need to stay
in the pocket and be like, listen,

763
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:28,900
I don't mind that you smoke
weed. I drink beer. Okay,

764
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,990
but you are smoking weed 24,

765
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:36,550
seven you're getting up in the middle
of the night and you're smoking weed and

766
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:39,310
I'm worried about you and
you're asking me on some time,

767
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,970
you're blowing $100 a week on weed and
you're asking me to help you out sometime.

768
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,280
Okay. Now, in all fairness,

769
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,300
if I was blowing 100 bucks on beer
every week and I was, you know,

770
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:52,090
waking up in the middle of
the night drinking a beer

771
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,770
and they're going to pull that shit
dead isn't the same thing. Yes it is.

772
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,820
It is the same thing. You're altering
your mental state with alcohol,

773
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:04,530
but you said if you're using your,
your, you're using marijuana. All right.

774
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,150
And uh, you know, I care about you and
you're kind of going down. You know,

775
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,050
it's basically,

776
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:15,051
it's your job to keep your woman in line
and it's her job to keep you in line.

777
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,200
And that isn't some sexist shit
by when I say keep you in line,

778
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:21,600
which just means when they
see you going out of bounds,

779
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:25,260
they see you going up river a little
bit like Colonel Kurtz Shaving your head

780
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:28,920
gone. The horror is you sit there in
the corner, fucking shotgun a beer.

781
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,290
It's her job to be like, I
think you, you're starting to,

782
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,180
your drinking is getting
a little out of control.

783
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:34,980
That's what you do when you love somebody.

784
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:39,570
So just know that she might not be
ready to hear that shit, but you know,

785
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,730
she asked to hear it from you.
You're just trying to help her out.

786
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:45,720
And if she flips out and calls you a
bunch of names, just say, listen, let's,

787
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,080
I've said what I had to say.

788
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,290
I'm more than willing to discuss this
with you later when you've calmed down,

789
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:54,000
but I'm not going to
get into a name calling.

790
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:55,380
Okay.

791
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,240
Uh,
argument with you.

792
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,200
And you leave it at that and
then they have no fucking choice.

793
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,380
They have no choice other than to
just fucking chill at that point.

794
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,490
Or they continue calling you names.
But after that, they're gonna,

795
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,890
they're gonna owe you an apology.
All right?

796
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:16,350
And if they don't apologize and
they can't admit that they're wrong,

797
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:20,510
that's a whole other fucking red flag,
you know?

798
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,050
Cause I couldn't be in a fucking
relationship with somebody who,

799
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,190
you know, if they fuck up, can't
be like, all right, you know what,

800
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,650
you will write on that one. You
know, you've got to have that.

801
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:33,650
If you don't have that, I don't know what
the fuck you go. So good luck with that,

802
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:37,430
sir. All right, next
one. What the fuck to do?

803
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,000
Serber loved the show
and listen to weekly.

804
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:43,490
Thanks for making my money's entertaining.
Well, you're welcome. All right.

805
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,380
I am 39 and separated with the child
and I started seeing a woman who was 43

806
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:51,890
divorced with their own child, but
uh, but up, up, here's this story.

807
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,330
About two months into the relationship
we were getting serious and we started

808
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:58,520
discussing a future together.
However,

809
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:02,540
our relationship started to erode about
as quickly as it started and we ended up

810
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,420
breaking up after dating
a total of six months.

811
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:09,920
One of the reasons we ended things was
that we didn't agree on wanting more kids.

812
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,840
She wanted more,
but I didn't,

813
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,800
we ended on such a bad note that
we agreed to not talk anymore.

814
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,250
Um, okay. At this point I'm like, good.

815
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:22,400
That was a very mature relationship.

816
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,620
Okay.

817
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,920
Early on. You said what you both
wanted, you realize that you didn't,

818
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,860
you want it to different
things and you walked,

819
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,420
got a little ugly there for a second.
But who gives a fuck? Anyways?

820
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,130
He goes, as luck would have it, about
two to three weeks after we broke up,

821
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:41,940
she called me to tell me she is pregnant.

822
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,040
Oh my God.

823
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,913
Wait a minute.

824
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,650
She wanted more than I did and
she pulled the goalie. A dude.

825
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:57,270
You didn't want more kids. You didn't
use a condom. Oh my God. She go,

826
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,260
he goes, I did not know how
it was possible. Okay, cool.
Cause we took precautions,

827
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,260
but I guess I slipped up.
I slip one past the goalie.

828
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,950
I was devastated and worried because
not only do I not want more kids,

829
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:12,420
my current financial situation would limit
me greatly in my ability to take care

830
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:16,620
of my child and another child.
My question to you is,

831
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:20,350
what the fuck do I do?
Uh,

832
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:21,770
I would get a paternity test.

833
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,120
Definitely get a paternity
test to make sure it's yours.

834
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,920
Um, if you don't want to, I mean
that's, and that's a prayer.

835
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,640
I'm not saying anything bad about
this woman, but just, you know,

836
00:51:35,641 --> 00:51:39,210
you got to throw the Hail Mary here
and hope maybe you get lucky. He goes,

837
00:51:39,211 --> 00:51:41,040
my question to you is,
what the fuck do I do?

838
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:46,041
She doesn't want to have an abortion at
told me that we should get back together

839
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:47,190
and have the baby.

840
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:55,170
Is she lying? She said, if not,

841
00:51:55,171 --> 00:51:57,180
she would try to legally prevent me from

842
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:03,050
having a part being part of the
child's life. As I was writing this,

843
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:06,020
she was about six weeks pregnant,
so a lot of time,

844
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:11,420
a lot of time to stress about it.
Um, yeah dude, fuck all of that.

845
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:18,130
She's going to wait a minute. Let me just
read the last paragraph. This, he goes,

846
00:52:18,131 --> 00:52:22,060
I'm not stupid enough to go to
a comedian for advice. However,

847
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:25,510
I do think you have an
interesting perspective on
life and I'd love to hear your

848
00:52:25,511 --> 00:52:28,540
point of view.
This situation has since been resolved.

849
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,690
See below to see how it turned out.
But the,

850
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,920
but answered the question before you see
the result. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

851
00:52:35,921 --> 00:52:40,750
Well, I don't see the results here. Below.
I'd love to know what happened. Jesus.

852
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:44,170
Now you're leaving me hanging in
there. All my listeners, all right,

853
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:46,690
here's my thing. If any
woman said, you know,

854
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,720
you got me pregnant and I didn't
want to be with her and she said,

855
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:57,130
uh, if you, if you don't live with me and
we have a relationship, you'll never see,

856
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,800
uh, the kid. I would just be like,
that's no way to go into a relationship,

857
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,580
okay? You want to find love, okay.

858
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:12,500
And the way to find true love is
not to hold somebody hostage, okay,

859
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,090
we made a mistake.

860
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:19,190
Now we're going to be adults and
we're going to raise this child in an

861
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:22,670
unconventional way because
we do not love each other.

862
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,940
So it's not going to be fair to the kid.
We're both together.

863
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:30,590
It also will not be fair to the kid
if you prevent the kid from seeing the

864
00:53:30,591 --> 00:53:33,260
mother, his mother or his father, okay?

865
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:38,320
So we need to be adults and put this kid
first and set aside our differences and

866
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:41,960
be as mature about this
as we possibly can.

867
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,880
The next 18 years are critical in this
kid's life. And we need to suck it up.

868
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,660
All right,
so let's get on the same damn page here.

869
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,613
All right.

870
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,620
I mean, somewhere along the
lines, I would, I would say that,

871
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,450
but I would definitely get a
fucking paternity test. Um,

872
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,710
cause you never know what
somebody's doing. And, uh, you know,

873
00:54:05,711 --> 00:54:08,590
you kind of seem like dumbfounded
that she actually got a pregnant.

874
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,590
Who knows what happens.
She seems like she wants more kids.

875
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:16,570
She could be this desperate person
that was, you know, I don't know what,

876
00:54:16,571 --> 00:54:20,380
but a stranger things have happened. So
I would definitely get a paternity test.

877
00:54:20,381 --> 00:54:23,170
And if she gets mad fucker,
who gives a shit?

878
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,690
Yeah.

879
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,820
If she gets mad, it'd be like, listen,
you know, you shouldn't say this,

880
00:54:28,821 --> 00:54:31,370
but in your head you've gotta be thinking
this is somebody who is fucking crazy

881
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:34,400
enough to basically
threaten me into her life.

882
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,530
If you're crazy enough to do that,

883
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:40,490
you're crazy enough to say a kid
that isn't mine is mine. Okay.

884
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,070
She's not acting stable right now.
So

885
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,353
I dunno.

886
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:50,820
And that is healthy paranoia.
That is not, uh, you know,

887
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,250
you know, if I ever said some
shit like that on the view,

888
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:55,690
okay.

889
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,720
You know what kills me is they would just,
they would tow the company line,

890
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,430
but I swear to God backstage,
you know, bitches is crazy.

891
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:08,770
Um, Phil Collins and Genesis, uh, oh
by the way, we're talking dramas here.

892
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:13,180
I didn't realize this. I um, I
just got tickets to go see Primus,

893
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:16,780
a band that I've always
been meaning to see and uh,

894
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,640
Tim Herb Alexander's back in the band
and I loved the way that that guy always

895
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:25,390
love the way that guy he's played.
And um, I got some tickets.

896
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:29,350
Me and roses. Joey roses are
going Joey roses by the way,

897
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:33,730
who has a new comedy CD coming out,
I believe September 2nd.

898
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,520
He's going to give me all the details,

899
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,950
but I'm go to Joe to Rosa
comedy.com I believe is his website.

900
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,330
I don't know what his fucking website is.

901
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:46,840
Why don't I do a better job promoting
an old pals fucking website,

902
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,360
but actually having a decency
of looking it up here.

903
00:55:49,361 --> 00:55:54,070
Sorry for the poor audio
quality right now. All right.

904
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:58,060
Joe Doe Rosa has a website.

905
00:55:58,061 --> 00:56:01,030
I don't know what it's fucking called.

906
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,970
You call yourself. Yeah. Jody
rose a comedy.com. All right,

907
00:56:06,971 --> 00:56:08,140
let's see what he's got here.

908
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,340
Okay.

909
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,380
He has some shoulders.

910
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:16,570
Body lacks the meat between
his neck and ball socket.

911
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,640
All right, where do we go here? Why is
my fucking Internet so God damn slow,

912
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:24,430
whatever it's showed a rosa,
comedy.com.

913
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,030
He's got a new fucking comedy
CD coming out and a God damn.

914
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:30,910
And I stand behind it as does
everybody else here on this podcast,

915
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:35,830
but should basically be me. But anyways,
so, uh, I, I didn't realize that,

916
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:39,460
uh, Tim Alexander had a heart attack. Um,

917
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,640
but he's doing great and
he's recovering well. Uh,

918
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:46,210
judging by the stuff that I've seen him
post on his Twitter account and that

919
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:47,770
type of thing,
uh,

920
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,610
I'm really happy for him because he's
truly is one of the great drummers are the

921
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:55,220
lives. Uh, 24 years. Jesus Christ.
Has it been that long since? Uh,

922
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:59,710
I've been listening to him, but, um, so
whatever, if this somehow gets to them,

923
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:04,600
happy to hear that you're doing well
and, uh, continued healthy lifestyle.

924
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,000
A righty. Okay. I'm Phil Collins
and genesis may have been done.

925
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:15,300
Oh, by the way, thank you to everybody
that also donated to a Benny grubs.

926
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,260
Um, DVD. He's, he's, he needs like
a, he's raised 99% of the money,

927
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:25,000
so that really means a lot to me and uh,
it's going to help other drummers,

928
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,660
which will help music, which we'll come
back around. Even if you don't play drums,

929
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:31,910
you get to listen to better drummers,
make it better music. So, uh,

930
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:36,490
I really appreciate everybody who donated.
That was pretty awesome. All right.

931
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:38,740
Okay,
last time starting this bill.

932
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:43,180
Phil Collins and genesis may have been
done before, but hey, Billy Bruford,

933
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,290
you're a drummer. Stupid.
You must know him. I am.

934
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,980
You'd have to insult me because your,

935
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:53,920
you felt insecure about
your obscure reference. Um,

936
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,140
all right.
On last week's podcast,

937
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,200
you brought up Mr Phil
Collins and genesis.

938
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,590
You absolutely nailed how
incredible Phil is as a drummer.

939
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,920
I am an early genesis fanatic from
trespass nursery crime foxtrot selling in

940
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:14,250
England by the pound and the lamb
lies down on Broadway and he has in

941
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,030
parentheses dope.

942
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,400
You know what's funny is I don't
know anything about early genesis.

943
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:20,980
I just know Phil Collins is
a fucking amazing drummer.

944
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,200
I know that they were a a prog
rock band and that Peter Gabriel,

945
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:30,880
who later sung sledgehammer gave himself
a reverse Mohawk at some point when he

946
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:35,710
was in that band. Anyways, he
says that dude, as you may guess,

947
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,450
should be boss, Mo Bostonian
because it's the best album. Oh,

948
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:44,650
the lamb lies down on Broadway dough.
That's what,

949
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:47,800
that's how that was supposed to be red.
All right, well I'll check that one out.

950
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:48,761
Anyways,

951
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:53,761
he said when Peter Gabriel left the band
in 1975 these guys audition singers for

952
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:58,390
months. No one could get it right.
So what it old Phil Collins do,

953
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:03,400
he stepped out from behind the drum kit
like a bad ass and took over the role as

954
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:07,990
front man and drummer from there. They
remain true to their roots for a while,

955
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,830
I'd say at least three to four albums.
And until of course, as you pointed out,

956
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:16,150
the cash cow came along and they climbed
aboard the proverbial money train. Uh,

957
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:19,240
but that should,
but that should not discredit these guys.

958
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,420
They have my ultimate respect.
It gives a fucking, in the end,

959
00:59:22,421 --> 00:59:26,260
you finally wanted to get paid and go
out and get yourself a fucking station

960
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:29,770
wagon that went zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds.
I totally get that.

961
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:35,110
You know, and Phil Collins kept it real.
He never got hair plugs are a toupee.

962
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,000
He just held onto that landing
strip forever. Um, however,

963
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:44,470
that's not to mention, uh, however,
that's not to mention brand x,

964
00:59:44,471 --> 00:59:47,470
which was Phil's jazz fusion side project.

965
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:52,330
That's where his drumming
really flourished. The
album product is a must do.

966
00:59:52,331 --> 00:59:57,160
This is like some hardcore music Geek
Shit, and I'm loving every second of this.

967
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:02,200
Um, Phil always surrounded himself with
brilliant drummers bay there, Cleo,

968
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,820
Bill Bruford there,
and a chest to Thompson of Zappa fame.

969
01:00:06,821 --> 01:00:09,880
Not to mention that bitch
and Tarzan theme, right?

970
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:14,950
No Tarzan theme. Tarzan. I'm sorry,

971
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:17,020
I've been out here too long.
Stick and Tarzana.

972
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:18,250
Okay.

973
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:22,270
Um, Thursday, August 21st genesis
posted to their official Facebook page,

974
01:00:22,271 --> 01:00:24,790
a new logo and a promise
for exciting news.

975
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:29,440
Summer speculated a possible
reunion with the 71 to 75 lineup,

976
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:34,030
including Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett,
which I would come buckets forth.

977
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:37,390
Jesus Christ. Dude, I don't
need that visual. He said,

978
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:40,240
I am a musician bill and I love
when you bring up your drumming,

979
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,240
you bring your drumming up and
music and Jen will keep it up.

980
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,990
And the Mike and the mechanics
named Mike and the mechanics.

981
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:51,940
Dude's name is Mike Rutherford. How
British can you get cozy, smug cunt?

982
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:56,290
Um, I am uh, yeah, I love
all that type of shit.

983
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:59,500
Do you know I'm going to do another
one of those goddamn comedy jams.

984
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:03,670
I can't figure out what
song I'm going to do. Um,

985
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:08,560
but some of the songs I've been messing
with have double bass in them and uh,

986
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,730
that's something that,

987
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,733
uh,

988
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:16,120
when it comes to double bass
drumming, I am, I am a snob.

989
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:17,470
Okay.

990
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:19,240
When it comes to it,
I'm actually a cunt.

991
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,510
When it comes to double bass drumming
because I can't do it on any level,

992
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,450
but I have some hardcore
opinions about it.

993
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,183
MMM.

994
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:33,140
I don't like when somebody uses it to
enhance all their fucking fills around the

995
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:38,940
kit, just running underneath that,
just doing the quad thing or whatever.

996
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:42,660
Like I that always annoyed me
because it makes you sound,

997
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,150
you're doing these bottom quads,
but I know you kind of cheat.

998
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,810
But uh,
however,

999
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,840
if you get somebody who actually utilize
it to enhance a groove or even a fill,

1000
01:01:56,051 --> 01:01:58,170
like I would say, uh, Tim Alexander,

1001
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,850
like some of the drumming that
that guys recorded is, is just,

1002
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,640
it's astounding. Like, I feel like,

1003
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,780
like I kinda got into this thing where
I felt guys who played single bass drum

1004
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:15,140
could play a better groove then somebody
that played double bass because they,

1005
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm trying to, I, how do I equate

1006
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,480
if you just had this extra f,

1007
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:26,240
it's like he had this Howard
Sir underneath you and
they just couldn't resist

1008
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:31,750
jumping on those fucking things every
chance they had to do some insane

1009
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:35,600
sounding.
Phil and I always felt like the guys,

1010
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:40,070
I just felt like the guys that had the
least amount of shit played the best,

1011
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,640
like a Steve Jordan, you know, it
played a little four piece kit.

1012
01:02:43,641 --> 01:02:45,620
I mean that guy could literally,
you could just give them a high hat,

1013
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:51,020
a ride Cymbal, Bass Drum and snare,
like a quest love, same thing.

1014
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:53,960
And that guy could get more goddamn music
out of it than some guy that has like

1015
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:58,430
a 50 piece set. Like I kind of
went into that and then, which was,

1016
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:00,410
there was an element of truth to it,
but it was a,

1017
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:04,590
it was an arrogant like mindset.
It would be the same thing as that.

1018
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:08,180
There'd be like a clean comic is better
than a dirty comic and you're not

1019
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:11,000
listening to what they're saying. So, uh,

1020
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:13,880
I've actually come around now and
there's a bunch of players that, uh,

1021
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:18,680
that I like, but it's, but like, if
there's no groove, I can't get into it.

1022
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:21,170
If he just fucking plane
like a zillion miles an hour,

1023
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:25,580
like I've got to admit like those, uh,
those blast beats and that type of thing,

1024
01:03:25,581 --> 01:03:28,160
that's fucking insane
that somebody can do that.

1025
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:33,161
But after a while it's just
played so fucking fast.

1026
01:03:33,171 --> 01:03:38,080
I, it all sounds the same. Maybe I need
to listen to more of it to be able to, uh,

1027
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:38,960
hear it.

1028
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,960
But my favorite part and death metal is
when the singer for like half a second,

1029
01:03:44,151 --> 01:03:47,300
you actually hear what his singing voice
really sounds like before he goes back

1030
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,020
to that type of shit. So, um,

1031
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:56,810
anyways, um, so I've been,
I'm fucking around with some,

1032
01:03:56,811 --> 01:03:59,330
uh, some of that double
Bass Shit. I'm not,

1033
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,640
I'm not going to say
what it is because uh,

1034
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,750
you know the reveal like I guess I wasn't
supposed to say that I was going to

1035
01:04:05,751 --> 01:04:10,610
dress up like Tommy Lee last week.
Um, did I talk about that by the way?

1036
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,490
We fucking, we smashed it, man.

1037
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:18,140
We got off to have a little rough start.
I fucked. I always fuck up the beginning.

1038
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,330
Um, but I was psyched because I fucked
it up in that I didn't stop and I was

1039
01:04:23,331 --> 01:04:25,820
supposed to then restart,
but I just kinda kept going.

1040
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,790
And if you didn't know the song,
you wouldn't notice that we fucked up.

1041
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:33,530
So I felt good about that. And
uh, and you know, once again,

1042
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,270
it took us a second,
then we got on track.

1043
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:40,271
It's just kinda hard to come walking
out and be doing standup and then finish

1044
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:43,250
that and then walk behind the
kitten that count off a band enough.

1045
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:47,780
Fuck it up at my, at my drumming level.
It's a very difficult thing to do.

1046
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,340
Uh,

1047
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,580
hang on a second. I've been given
a note here. Need to get my stuff.

1048
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:02,170
Okay. All right, I'll see. Um, anyways,

1049
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,650
so let's go, let's go. Let's plow
ahead here. All right, girls stock.

1050
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,700
Hi Mr Belt. I'm from the Czech Republic.
Well, how are you? How's it going?

1051
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:16,240
Do you ever go up to a hungry and get
some of that fucking a art deco furniture

1052
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:19,800
that they send over?
What does it from Budapest,

1053
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,560
you don't charge us a fucking zillion
dollars for it anyways. He goes,

1054
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:27,440
I listened to the mandate Monday morning
podcast like every single week and I

1055
01:05:27,441 --> 01:05:28,910
love what you're doing.
Well thank you. He goes,

1056
01:05:28,911 --> 01:05:31,820
I know you don't owe me anything but
I really need some advice right now.

1057
01:05:31,821 --> 01:05:35,380
Yes I do all you because you're walking
around the Czech Republic going,

1058
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:39,620
have you fucking heard about
this redheaded cont over
there in the states and

1059
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:41,870
some day I'll do a gig in Prague.

1060
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:47,150
You guys got a funny bone over
there cause I'll do it. And he said,

1061
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:50,810
there's a chick living in my
neighborhood and she's really into me.

1062
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:54,140
I mean a lot in much more.

1063
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,700
I would like to also say your English
was fucking unreal and I wasn't believing

1064
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:01,130
that you were from the Czech
Republic by going, this is,

1065
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,540
there was a chick living
in my neighborhood. You're
using the slang properly

1066
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,400
and he then the next sentence he goes,

1067
01:06:08,401 --> 01:06:10,890
I mean a lot and much
more I would like to.

1068
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,833
All right.

1069
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:16,450
She calls me in the middle of the night,
keeps knocking on my door,

1070
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,380
calling my name,

1071
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:21,610
throws rocks at my window and once
climbed on a tree next to my house,

1072
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,470
came inside my room and wait,
waited under my bed until I arrived.

1073
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,790
Yeah, dude, you can't have
this. That's fucking creepy.

1074
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:36,250
I didn't even know she wasn't
barefoot. Was She? She's barefoot.

1075
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:37,300
I think she's a vampire.

1076
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,020
You don't have to always barefoot and
they have like their breadth is cold.

1077
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,840
I Dunno how Jesus,
he goes,

1078
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:47,320
I didn't even know there is
something like girls stocking,

1079
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:49,090
but now I'm starting to be worried.

1080
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:54,091
The only thing I did was helping her
back on her feet when she fade out on my

1081
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:56,920
friend's party couple of months ago.

1082
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,460
I don't want to be mean or hurt her
feelings. She's pretty nice girl.

1083
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:04,810
But this is way over the line. Any advice?
Yeah, you got to tell her to screw.

1084
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,773
MMM.

1085
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,010
You have to totally cut her off and
he can't have any interaction with her

1086
01:07:11,011 --> 01:07:15,300
because any sort of interaction with
this woman is going to make her feel like

1087
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:20,850
you guys had dead justifies her
relationship. You know what I mean?

1088
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,560
Um,

1089
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:29,140
I feel bad that she's in this mind state,
but you don't have to deal with it. Uh,

1090
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,760
first of all,
lock your fucking window and um,

1091
01:07:33,761 --> 01:07:37,510
if she ever comes in your house again,
you need to call the cops.

1092
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,010
I would stand outside and have the cops
go in and get her out and I would have

1093
01:07:43,011 --> 01:07:47,510
legal record that that's what she did.
Okay. And then don't talk to her at all.

1094
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:51,080
Don't answer the phone.
Don't nothing,

1095
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:52,903
nothing.

1096
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,430
And you have to, you have to cut
her out of your life because, uh,

1097
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,530
she's out of her fucking mind.
All right. That's what I would do.

1098
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:04,330
And when she cries or does whatever,
do not comfort her and go, I'm sorry,

1099
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:06,250
but I'm just not into you.
Because in her world,

1100
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:10,480
the relationship just started over again.
You have to fucking you up to.

1101
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,700
You got to cut the head off
the snake and it, alright.

1102
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:18,610
There you go. All right. When
is too old to start a band?

1103
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,593
Okay,

1104
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:24,010
well listen, I just started playing
out with, I'm out in a band,

1105
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:25,750
but I got to tell you dude,
it was fucking,

1106
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,830
I got to tell you some going down and
doing that goddamn comedy jam is sitting

1107
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:32,170
in with the band is the most fun
Shit I've done in a long time.

1108
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:37,270
I literally drive down there with like
butterflies, like this nervous excitement.

1109
01:08:37,271 --> 01:08:37,391
I,

1110
01:08:37,391 --> 01:08:40,420
you know how long it's been since I've
had that I've getting outside my comfort

1111
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:44,800
zone and uh, I know obviously I'm
not going to join a band or anything,

1112
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:49,630
but whatever that experience
is artistically is going
to help me in my acting.

1113
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:54,310
It's somewhere down the road.
That experience is going
to fucking help me. And um,

1114
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,100
okay.

1115
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,890
I don't know. It's just the, it's
the fucking best. Anyway, so he goes,

1116
01:08:58,891 --> 01:09:03,600
when is too old to start a band? He
goes, hey bill, my boyfriend, oh,

1117
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:07,740
she says, sorry. Oh Nice. A
female wrote in, God dammit,

1118
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:11,460
I love when this happens.
This is my boyfriend of two years,

1119
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:15,360
has been involved in is always, it's
been very involved in theater and music.

1120
01:09:15,361 --> 01:09:19,230
He was in bands throughout high school
and college as a drummer about a year ago

1121
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:23,160
he joined a cover band, which
I'm totally supportive of. Uh,

1122
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:26,190
it's a really nice hobby and
I love going to his shows.

1123
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:30,930
Now we're getting pretty close
to two moving in together. Um,

1124
01:09:30,931 --> 01:09:33,810
he talks at length about
our future that um,

1125
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,810
what we need to do to get there,
et cetera.

1126
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:40,230
Basically we are being grown ups and
despite what you're probably thinking,

1127
01:09:40,231 --> 01:09:43,740
he is actually the one that brings
up our future and more than me.

1128
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:46,980
I'm not judging you. I know I'm
[inaudible] but I'm not judging here.

1129
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:50,100
I'm reading this open mindedly
he goes, well, she goes,

1130
01:09:50,101 --> 01:09:54,430
well I'm leaving this open.
Mindedly is, I keep calling you. He,

1131
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,360
she says this,
um,

1132
01:09:56,550 --> 01:10:00,630
well about a week ago he
says that he and the chicken,

1133
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:05,430
the cover band want to start their own
two person original band and based on

1134
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:06,720
certain things he has said,

1135
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,500
he seems pretty serious about
trying to make something of it. I,

1136
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:15,501
he comments about me going on tour
with him or about becoming a rich music

1137
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,680
musician, et cetera. My
first reaction, you're 31,

1138
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,560
you don't really like your job much.
Parentheses,

1139
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:26,760
people that hate their careers tend
to want to try something else. Uh,

1140
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:30,000
you talked to me about our future
and what we have to do to get there.

1141
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:33,780
You want to start dedicating
your time to a two person band.

1142
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:37,890
I haven't said any of this to him
because I don't want to come off as

1143
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:38,724
unsupportive,

1144
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:43,910
but I mean at what age do you face the
reality and stop trying to live out of 15

1145
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:46,710
year old's dream?
Granted,

1146
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:51,270
it seemed very unlikely that anything
will come of it. Sorry, just being honest,

1147
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:56,520
but doesn't this seem like a
midlife crisis? 10 years too early,

1148
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,020
I should mention.

1149
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:02,880
He also sent me this horrendous skull
tattoo today that he suddenly wants on his

1150
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:07,710
arm a or am I being selfish
and an asshole? Be Blunt.

1151
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,470
I can take it. All right. Um,

1152
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,540
there's a lot of shit
going on in this one.

1153
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,370
MMM.

1154
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:23,320
Is 31 to late to start in a band?
Technically, no, I don't think it is.

1155
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,890
MMM.

1156
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,193
And

1157
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:34,450
when you said you know that he's
having a midlife crisis, um,

1158
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:35,720
I hate that expression.

1159
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:37,893
MMM.

1160
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,000
And however, I actually, I,

1161
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:43,780
I at first I didn't like that you used
it until he was talking about getting the

1162
01:11:43,781 --> 01:11:48,070
awful skull tattoo on his arm that gave,
that loaned a lot of Krill.

1163
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:50,380
That credibility too.

1164
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,360
Uh,

1165
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:55,440
the midlife crisis comment,
I would say this,

1166
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:58,530
I think this is a person that,

1167
01:11:58,940 --> 01:11:59,240
yeah.

1168
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:04,190
Wanted to be in a band, a successful
band, and is now 31 and is realizing like,

1169
01:12:04,191 --> 01:12:07,070
fuck, if I'm going to do
this, I need to do this now.

1170
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:08,170
Yeah.

1171
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,003
All right.

1172
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:09,843
MMM.

1173
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,280
But going out and getting the skull
tattoo, is it that really, I dunno.

1174
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,620
I Dunno about that part.

1175
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:22,190
That's making me feel like your assessment
of the situation and me without me

1176
01:12:22,191 --> 01:12:24,410
seeing this guy play, I
can't tell you. But like

1177
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:26,103
mmm,

1178
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,460
at this point he's in a cover band
and he has a job and that is your

1179
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:34,990
relationship.
This guy has a job,

1180
01:12:34,991 --> 01:12:37,490
he has a steady income
and he has his cover band.

1181
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:39,470
Now all of a sudden he's
going to give skull tattoo,

1182
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:43,120
quit his job and potentially go
on the road and take you with him.

1183
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,160
Now I'm assuming you have a fucking job.

1184
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,820
So he is creating an entirely new dynamic.

1185
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,720
So you're in the right to be like,
what the fuck are we doing here?

1186
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:54,523
MMM.

1187
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,830
And you're in a tough position where
you don't want to be like, listen,

1188
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:01,150
this dream that you've had,

1189
01:13:01,151 --> 01:13:05,290
but for some reason it didn't go after
it the way you should have. You know,

1190
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:08,290
I understand being in a cover band to
like pay the fucking bills, but you know,

1191
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:09,820
if you're not making original music,

1192
01:13:09,821 --> 01:13:14,050
there's only so far that you can fucking
go as far as my understanding of it.

1193
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,660
Um,
so

1194
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:22,290
I actually, I don't think
that you're being an asshole.

1195
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:23,480
Okay.

1196
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,500
The skull tattoo thing is really
like a major fucking red flag to me

1197
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:30,090
that uh,

1198
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:34,140
does he have any other tattoos?
Fee,

1199
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,150
doesn't have any other tattoos and
out of nowhere he's like, all right,

1200
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:38,920
I'm going to stop being
in this cover band.

1201
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:42,940
I'm going to finally take this fucking
thing seriously and I'm going to go out

1202
01:13:42,941 --> 01:13:46,360
and get some fucking awful
God damn tattoo. Yeah.

1203
01:13:46,361 --> 01:13:49,780
I would be kind of concerned about
the guy and what he was doing,

1204
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:51,940
but as far as the whole
midlife crisis thing,

1205
01:13:51,941 --> 01:13:56,941
that gets thrown around a lot when
somebody goes after a dream and there's

1206
01:13:56,951 --> 01:14:00,160
nothing wrong with being 31 years
old and then to assessing your life,

1207
01:14:00,161 --> 01:14:02,590
being like, wait a minute, I've been
on this road, I don't want to go on.

1208
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,050
I need to go on this other road.

1209
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:10,330
And I think a lot of times people who
aren't going after a dream can't relate to

1210
01:14:10,331 --> 01:14:11,900
it.
I'm saying this is you,

1211
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:15,560
but they can't relate to somebody going
after a dream and taking a big risk.

1212
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:20,890
And they attributed to having a midlife
crisis or they don't have a dream,

1213
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:26,081
they're just going to work and that's
fine working for somebody else and,

1214
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,200
and you know,
doing the nine to five grind,

1215
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:34,370
as long as you make enough money and you
have your benefits and you like where

1216
01:14:34,371 --> 01:14:39,020
you live, like that's fine. Like that's
your dream and they can understand,

1217
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:43,670
um, somebody going after
something. But, um,

1218
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:49,200
I would definitely not call it
a Midland.

1219
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,770
I Dunno. I guess it is technically
a midlife crisis. I mean,

1220
01:14:51,771 --> 01:14:53,600
I'm doing all a midlife crisis is like,
fuck,

1221
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:56,210
I better get on the stick or the
things that I wanted in life.

1222
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,250
I'm not going to have,
it's like,

1223
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,340
you know me when I'm sitting
here talking about you,

1224
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:03,110
I'm finally going to get myself a nice
fucking car if I can ever get finished

1225
01:15:03,111 --> 01:15:06,590
with this God downstairs.
And you know,

1226
01:15:06,591 --> 01:15:10,040
I'm talking about some of the cars
that I'm looking at, you know,

1227
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,700
and it just comes to, it's like if I don't
ever do this, I'm never going to do it.

1228
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,440
I think when you're young you can
be like, oh, I'll do this someday.

1229
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:23,090
I'll do this someday. Someday I'm going
to do this. She can lie to yourself and

1230
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,500
in life you have to understand
that, no, if I don't do this,

1231
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:29,850
I'm never going to do this.

1232
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:31,530
Okay.

1233
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:33,840
Does that make sense? If I don't
go over to fucking Europe, I'm not,

1234
01:15:33,841 --> 01:15:37,230
I'm never going to go to Europe unless
I get my fucking ass over there.

1235
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,590
I'm never going to have this car that
I always wanted unless I go down to the

1236
01:15:40,591 --> 01:15:43,990
dealership and fucking
by the goddamn thing. Um,

1237
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,950
in an hour and on.
People see you.

1238
01:15:46,951 --> 01:15:50,910
When people see you step out of what
they think that you are, which is,

1239
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:54,180
I play in a cover band and I have
this job that I fucking don't like.

1240
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:58,170
It's very easily to say,
are you having a midlife crisis?

1241
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:01,110
He could also be having an awakening.
Okay,

1242
01:16:01,111 --> 01:16:05,310
so this is a very delicate thing.
Oh man,

1243
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:10,140
it just keeps coming back to
that awful skulled tattoo. To me,

1244
01:16:10,141 --> 01:16:14,280
that just seems like, first of all, that's
the hackiest fucking tattoo out there.

1245
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:18,630
You know, to get, you know,
fucking I'm in music to like die.

1246
01:16:18,631 --> 01:16:21,210
What's going to be a guy with
a skull fucking playing drums?

1247
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,610
I mean that's just bad.

1248
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,540
And I just look at that like you're
dressing up like a rock star rather than

1249
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:31,830
legitimately being one. And um, I
don't think you're being a dick here.

1250
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,440
I think what you're an asshole.

1251
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,260
I think what you're
doing is he's going to,

1252
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:42,090
he's making this big decision that's
going to affect both of your lives in a

1253
01:16:42,091 --> 01:16:46,230
major way so you're
not being a an asshole.

1254
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:50,850
So right now what you have to do is
literally try to like defuse a bomb.

1255
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:54,600
Okay? You got to make sure
you cut the right wire.

1256
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:59,640
And what I mean by that is you're able
to convey your concerns. Like, listen,

1257
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:03,630
I support you and all of that.
And I know you don't like to day job,

1258
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:09,120
but you know, I mean, there's
just no way to say yes, 31,

1259
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,090
you know,
you are 31 years of age.

1260
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:15,570
MMM.

1261
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:20,610
I would say,
look,

1262
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:27,420
he's kind of making a move from himself
here. So you gotta make a move yourself.

1263
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:32,350
What I would do is it's like I would talk
him out of the skull Tattoo. Just say,

1264
01:17:32,351 --> 01:17:35,050
listen, this is, this is how you decide
to get rid of the skull tattoo. Just say,

1265
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:39,940
listen, I will support you. Okay.

1266
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,410
You get with this woman, you guys
start making this fucking music. Okay,

1267
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,250
but you're not getting the skull tattoo.

1268
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:48,580
Yeah.

1269
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,120
All right.
And then go down and watch them.

1270
01:17:51,121 --> 01:17:52,920
And if they seem like they have something,

1271
01:17:52,921 --> 01:17:54,930
who the fuck knows stranger
things have happened?

1272
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,080
I would never tell somebody
not to go after a dream.

1273
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:00,510
I would tell them not to get
the skull fucking Tattoo,

1274
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:05,760
but a see if they have something,
even if it seems like they have something,

1275
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,550
then I don't know.

1276
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:09,780
Yeah,

1277
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:12,600
I dunno. I, I don't
know that is that as a,

1278
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,640
that is it then I guess
you have to assess,

1279
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,940
do I want to take this fucking ride
because that is a motherfucker of a ride.

1280
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:21,723
Um,

1281
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,140
okay.

1282
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:26,440
Yeah, that's, that's
what, uh, that's, I guess

1283
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:31,810
I kind of was all over the map there,
but I think I came to a point,

1284
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,040
no skull tattoo.

1285
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:37,360
You can start making this fucking
original music together and like,

1286
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:40,830
I mean,
I dunno,

1287
01:18:40,831 --> 01:18:43,560
how do you go out on the fucking road
unless you were actually doing well,

1288
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:49,010
what are they going to do? You know,
they have to make some great music.

1289
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:53,120
Um, I would just lay it on the line.
It's like you're asking me, you're,

1290
01:18:53,121 --> 01:18:56,270
you're making a major change here where
music was your hobby and now you're

1291
01:18:56,271 --> 01:18:58,940
going to make it your full time thing
and you're talking about taking me out on

1292
01:18:58,941 --> 01:19:03,860
the road. How are we going to afford to
do this and all of that type of stuff. Um,

1293
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,410
I will support you making
them the original music,

1294
01:19:06,411 --> 01:19:10,910
but you are by no means getting a skull
tattoo on your fucking arm because that

1295
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:15,200
is a, that is the tramp
tramp stamp for a guy. Okay.

1296
01:19:15,201 --> 01:19:17,930
Unless you're in a motorcycle
gang and you murdered somebody,

1297
01:19:17,931 --> 01:19:22,820
like there should not be any skulls on
your body. All right. There. I said it.

1298
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,210
Okay. And that's it. That's the
Monday morning podcast for this week.

1299
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:30,320
Go fuck yourselves. Football, bup,
bup, bup balls around the corner.

1300
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:34,700
CanNot wait for college football
and all of that type of shit. Um,

1301
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,190
that's it. I got nothing else to say.
Don't take any shit. Go fuck yourselves,

1302
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,890
and please don't get a tattoo of a
skull on your body. All right. See you.
