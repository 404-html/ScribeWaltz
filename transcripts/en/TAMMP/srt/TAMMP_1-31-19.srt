1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,190
Okay.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,020
Hey Man, what's going on? Oh

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,730
fucking freckled con.
It's the Thursday afternoon.

4
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:12,731
Just before Friday and Monday morning
podcast and just checking in on you.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,710
Oh, Billy's burning it at fucking
both ends do to, to, to, to do,

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,240
you know,
I woke up this morning by dual,

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,840
but though boob and I went to the gym by
nine and I that and I did some of that

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,200
pull down. Then I had to leave with a
grand, cause I got it out of the way.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,700
I was going back and forth with somebody
this morning and east coast friend of

10
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:41,480
mine who I hadn't talked to
in a while, how you enjoy
being a dad, blah, blah, blah,

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,230
blah, blah. And then she hits me up with
the whole, hey, I'm turning 50 this year.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,100
I am not happy about it. I said,
yeah, I turned 50 last year. She goes,

13
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:53,000
how was turning 50 for you? You
know, she goes, you're a guy,

14
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,280
you probably don't care.
It's much harder for a woman,

15
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,540
especially with our careers. Ah,
did I have fun with that? You know,

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,800
I just wrote back,
okay,

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,640
Jesus fucking Christ.
You know what I mean?

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,640
White women complaining is
one of the funniest fits.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,760
Like you got a fucking house in a
beautiful family. What is the fucking per,

20
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:19,590
it's so much harder for me. You're going
to outlive me by six to eight years.

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,150
So me turning 50s,
like be turned in like 56 57 58.

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,850
You don't hear me complaining.
You know,

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,450
you'll never hear me complain on this
podcast. This is nothing but positivity,

24
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,490
rainbows and fucking UNICORNS.
Um,

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,110
yeah.

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,140
Yeah. I love that shit. It's harder for,

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,680
it's harder for women to go to the gym.
It's harder for us to lose weight.

28
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:46,130
Well then fucking work harder. You
know, everybody's different. Oh,

29
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:49,390
is that where it's hard? You know, it
was, you know, it was harder for me, uh,

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,360
trying to get some woman to pay the
cover charge and buy me drinks. You know,

31
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:57,370
it's harder for me to divorce court,
uh, outliving you. I mean, it, it, it,

32
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,550
it balances out ladies
getting child support. Yeah.

33
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,350
That's harder for me because
I'll be the one paying it.

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,310
Then all of a sudden it costs 900 grand
a month to raise a fucking two year old.

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,990
Right. I just don't understand the
constant complaining by white women.

36
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,410
Okay, you're white, you're
live in America. Shut up. Okay,

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,260
wait to the other problems are
solved and then we'll get to you.

38
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,340
You're at the meat counter. Your
number isn't up yet. Wait your turn.

39
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,120
All right.
Wait your turn Abigail.

40
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,703
Okay.

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,030
Chino but hard. It's so much easier
for you to go to jail. It's not easier.

42
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,240
Men's lives are harder because
we have to live with you guys.

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,330
Oh Man.

44
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:44,810
I want to become friends with a lesbian
couple and I want to like be friends

45
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:45,950
with like the, the, the,

46
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:50,330
the chick and the relationship that's got
to handle more the dude shit. You know,

47
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,800
cause you know,
opposites attract.

48
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:54,860
And I would think even like in the lesbian
community, there's gotta be somebody,

49
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:56,690
you know who's out there swinging the ax,

50
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,190
getting the fucking firewood while the
other one's in there making the muffins.

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,140
That's the lesbian I want to talk to
right into my podcast. Please. You know,

52
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,410
I want to know if those lesbians
on average die sooner than,

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,110
than, than the, the, the
dainty lesbian, you know.

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,720
Okay.

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,870
The lesbian who's got to go out on the
fucking roof and adjust the fucking

56
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:23,760
direct TV satellite fucking thing
in the middle of the fucking rain.

57
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,400
That's how I want it.
That's who I want to hear from.

58
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,900
That's the study I would
be doing. Um, anyways.

59
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,720
Oh Geez. I'm coming in
hot. I'm coming in hot.

60
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:36,090
I'm wearing my old man's sweater that I,

61
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,270
that I've got when I was over there in
Ireland. You know, and I'll tell you,

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,860
it was so much harder for women to
find sweaters, you know, to be judged.

63
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,940
Um, anyway, speaking of which,

64
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,660
I'm in the middle of an acting gig right
now and I am having the time of my life.

65
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm having so much fun in this acting gig.

66
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:57,960
It's actually scaring me because
most of the time comedians,

67
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:00,660
the entire time you're on the
acting gig be being like, you know,

68
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,690
I could have fucking made you know twice
as much money in one hour than I have

69
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,070
that I'm going to on this entire fucking
shoot. You know, why am I still here?

70
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:14,700
That's what you're usually thinking.
But uh, I, I've, I've cracked the code.

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,400
Yeah

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,460
I know how to do it now.
What I do is when I go on to set,

73
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:23,900
I don't bring my phone and I don't bring
a watch and then it's like I walked

74
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:26,480
into a casino. I don't know if its
day, I don't know if it's night.

75
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,340
I just fucking do my shit.
I tried to do it, you know,

76
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,510
as well as I can,

77
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:35,720
I listened to the director or whatever
and then in between takes I sit down and

78
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:39,740
just could serve my fucking energy and
that's all I do. Not Looking at anything.

79
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:44,741
I just sit there like fucking private
pile when he's sitting on the commode

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,520
it
in full metal jacket.

81
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,250
And then all of a sudden after I feel
like I've been at two hours all of a

82
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,620
sudden, okay, well breaking
for lunch. I'm like, okay.

83
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,470
And then I go outside to the sun.
You know,

84
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,710
I get a salad with the protein ladies
salad with the protein heavy on the salad

85
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:09,320
protein,
no bigger than the size of my pasty palm.

86
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,411
That's what I do.

87
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,430
And then I just fucking go back in and I
just do it all over again and I have no

88
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:19,330
fucking idea what time it is. And uh,
then all of a sudden they just say,

89
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,164
you're wrapped.

90
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,710
Yeah.

91
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,310
And I just act like a silly jackass
and try to make jokes all day long.

92
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:29,150
And I've been having the
fucking time of my life.

93
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,260
Okay.

94
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,220
Having a great time. Um, so anyways,

95
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,140
what am I acting on? I'm not
allowed to tell. It's a secret.

96
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,970
Um, I'm acting on general
hospital. Everybody. Okay.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,910
I've come back from the dead eye.
A lot of people don't know this.

98
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:51,911
I had a role on that back in the 80s when
I had a giant orange fucking Afro and

99
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,260
a, my character died of cancer.
But now he's come back from it.

100
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,250
You know, his hair didn't grow
back yet, but his beard did.

101
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,130
And that's the jump off
point to the character.

102
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,640
And I am going to go out on a limb
and say this is going to be the most

103
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,010
interesting character since
heath ledger's the joker. Okay.

104
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,570
I am the heath ledger joker character of,
of general hospital.

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,153
Okay.

106
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,550
It's an 87 episode arc that we
shoot over the course of one week.

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,630
I don't know what I'm talking about
anymore. Uh, you know what, you know,

108
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,690
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,710
I'm talking about two and three shows
after this acting Gig is over to get

110
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:38,000
myself ready to shoot my next special,
I'm going to be in Santa Barbara,

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,990
Santa Barbara, where all the rich
white people in Oprah moved after they,

112
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,180
after they made money in Hollywood.
All right?

113
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,290
Then I'm going to Pasadena. All
right. We're all the racist,

114
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,500
right wing lunatics,
you know,

115
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,820
build the fucking wall of La live.

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,170
A lot of people don't realize that a lot
of people think everybody out here is a

117
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,320
liberal area. That's not true. All you
gotta do is just go to Burbank. Okay?

118
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:07,090
They're walking around, they got
fucking two by fours and pitch forks.

119
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,690
You know,

120
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,400
I believe the kids say shit gets real in
Burbank and then I'm out in Riverside.

121
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,190
Okay. Riverside, that part of America,

122
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,100
you know that politicians don't bring up,

123
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,580
you know that feminists don't bring up
when they're attacking standup comedians

124
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,380
acts, they forget. What about
all the poor people in Riverside?

125
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,661
Riverside.

126
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:32,750
That's just sounds like a place where
you can dump a body and you know what?

127
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,040
That's exactly what happens.
If you ever kill anybody in Los Angeles,

128
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,010
you have to know your next move.
Okay.

129
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,900
Other than getting rid of your cell
phone is you drive the body to Riverside.

130
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,290
Okay. As far as I know, there is no
river there. Okay. I don't know what,

131
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,580
I don't know what it is,
but all I know,

132
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:56,480
there's this enough gullies and there's
just enough dead people there already

133
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:01,250
that you can get lost in the herd
with dragging your dead body. Okay.

134
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,740
Um,
I will be performing there.

135
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,130
Santa Barbara on February 15th,

136
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,670
the day after the most bullshit
fucking holiday there is the,

137
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:13,850
you never hear a fucking, you
know Pete Buddy, your wife Bitch.

138
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,160
You see here what my fucking
wife's asking, hey man, this,

139
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,540
she asked for this fucking stupid
designer damn bag. I swear to God,

140
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,020
it looked like somebody dumped
toothpaste all over it. You know, like,

141
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:26,781
you know,

142
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:31,781
like when some fucking jackass partners
up with some high end label to do their

143
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,000
version of the bag,
you know,

144
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,890
and then every fucking bored
fucking Douche bag has to
go get the fucking thing.

145
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,120
You know, not saying my wife Sport, I love
her. I just, I just, I looked at the bag,

146
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,660
I'm like, you look at that, fucking
think that it's not going to,

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,260
what are you going to do with that thing?
I like it. I think it's interesting.

148
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,040
It's bold. It's fucking ugly as shit.
I wish you guys could see this bag.

149
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,850
Do you remember those stupid fucking
toothpaste that came out that was like

150
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,760
toothpaste, mouthwash and
deodorant all at the same time?

151
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,060
It looked like a fucking rainbow.
Just imagine if you did that,

152
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,800
but it, but it was also
like cloudy, like milk.

153
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:11,990
Yeah.

154
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,120
And you dump that on a beautiful,

155
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,540
yeah.

156
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,290
Gorgeous handmade fucking bag.
That was perfectly fucking fine.

157
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,010
You know what is art? You can't judge
art. Yeah, you can't. That sticks.

158
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,870
Okay. It fucking stinks. You know? That's,
that begs for like, people who like,

159
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,990
you know, like John
Michel Basquiat, you know,

160
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,110
like the hacky artists that
everybody knows. You know,

161
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,960
people just like to say this guy's name
just so they can make it sound like they

162
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:43,920
fucking, they can speak
French Shawn Michael Basket.

163
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,750
You don't just fucking stick figures.
I mean,

164
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,460
I fucking drew like
that in the first grade

165
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,043
I had,

166
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,480
I can't believe how much
all those pictures I put on
my parents' refrigerator,

167
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:01,950
how much they'd be worth nowadays.
Um, I'm fucking with you. I don't,

168
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:05,310
this one thing I don't know anything
about at, and if you don't believe me,

169
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:07,200
just watch my act.
But I really don't.

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,130
I don't know why.
Um,

171
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,960
I don't get Andy Warhol.

172
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,440
Yeah.

173
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Just painting the tomato
soup can every say, Oh God,

174
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,910
he's commented on commercialism
America. All right, Greg, comment, uh,

175
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,660
how much is,

176
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,710
how much for fucking can of soup and
that canvas that you fucking put it on,

177
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,690
I'll give you that amount of money
for it. Um, anyway, so by the way,

178
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,600
you know, that guy got shot by
a woman, I didn't know that.

179
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,960
And then she did like fucking three weeks
in jail and then got out and for the

180
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:42,240
rest of his fucking life he's
got to deal with this crazy.

181
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,230
So and so running around out there and
then like 20 years later you kind of died

182
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:48,600
of complications from getting shot by her,
you know,

183
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,030
but it's so much harder
for a woman to paint.

184
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,113
MMM.

185
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,670
Yeah.

186
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,040
Anyways. Uh, yeah. I don't
understand. You know,

187
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,650
the one guy I actually liked liked it,
did that.

188
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:05,580
I kind of understood and it's not,
cause I kind of looked like the uh,

189
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,570
bald version of them. I didn't
mind Van Gogh. Oh really?
Bill, you didn't mind him.

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,510
Did you allow him in your artistic world?
I didn't mean it like that.

191
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,740
The guy who used the lines,
you know,

192
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,400
the vertical lines and he painted
shit like that. Uh, I like that shit.

193
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,420
Okay.

194
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,240
I Dunno. I like when somebody paints
somebody, how they look, you know,

195
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:28,260
now when they stick their ear and
their forehead and it's like, whoa man.

196
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,030
Like why do you think he did that and all,

197
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,530
is that because he feels like nobody
can hear his thoughts? I mean,

198
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,390
is it layers to this? Uh, no.

199
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:39,630
I just think he fucking knows how to draw
an ear and he stuck it on a forehead.

200
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,140
He's probably dropping
acid, I don't know. Or,

201
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,780
or even all those canvases where it's
just, it's, it's nothing. It's just,

202
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,130
it looks like some toddler just
fucking smeared it all over the place.

203
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,530
Every since like, yeah, just like,
why, you know, I just look at him like,

204
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:00,760
why did he put that color over there?
Like why is uh,

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,680
I saw Lars and one time and so Metallica
documentary and he was selling this

206
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,960
fucking these fucking pay to, cause
he was getting all this money for it.

207
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,440
He was just going, yeah, I just like
that over there. It was just like,

208
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,620
why did he put that guy?
Like, I don't know Lars.

209
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,310
I'm going to go out on a limb.
I think you could have done that.

210
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:19,720
The save yourself a bunch of money.

211
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:24,721
But he turned around and he sold it
and he made even more fucking money.

212
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,840
And you combine that with the fact that
he gets his drum kits for free in what

213
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:33,250
you have is a very rich young man.
Um,

214
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,550
anyways, how much time was
that? 12 minutes. Fuck,

215
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:40,210
I get another fucking 17 and a half
to go. Jesus fucking Christ. You know,

216
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:42,070
some days this podcast,
you know,

217
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:46,010
it just goes by quick and other times
it doesn't. Did Anybody Watch, uh,

218
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,840
Barstool sports? It the fucking super
bowl, man. How fucking fun was that.

219
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,420
They got into the, uh, the, uh,
the fucking press conference
and Portnoy was asking,

220
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,700
uh,
I don't know any of the names.

221
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,270
The rams running back wide took a knee
and how it cost them like four grand on a

222
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,123
bed

223
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,850
and then what the NFL is gonna
fucking kick them out. It's like dead.

224
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,450
They're all about gambling. They have
sports gambling now. It's just like,

225
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:14,700
you know,
it's their dirty little secret.

226
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,300
You might as well just let fans
ask those questions. Right.

227
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,030
I thought it was fucking hilarious.

228
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,020
And the only thing funnier than that
was afterwards when Portnoy did his

229
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:28,350
interview or what I was interviewing
thing and he was all fucking amped up

230
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,440
saying like, what were they gonna do to
me? And he goes, put the fuck cuffs on me.

231
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,680
So get like, he's fucking snake plus
skin. Put the fucking cops on me.

232
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,060
I didn't know he was like
that. Steven Seagal, Dave
Portnoy's, I'm telling you, man,

233
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,930
you put them in a prison. Evidently
they're going to take over. Um,

234
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,960
but anyways,
I thought that was really funny.

235
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,550
And then he went on fucking the new show
there with that fucking Weirdo looking

236
00:13:55,551 --> 00:14:00,290
guy. That guy, he always goes on that
guys showed the guy who looks like,

237
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:00,760
you know,

238
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,010
he the guy who killed his girlfriend
accidentally cause they were having rough

239
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,720
sex, doesn't he look like
one of those guys? Um,

240
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,360
and he was still wearing the costume that,
you know,

241
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,670
God bless those guys at fucking and a
bar stool. You know what I mean? I mean,

242
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,870
how boring is the week between the AFC
and NFC championship game and the Super

243
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,860
Bowl, you know, put the fucking cuffs
on me, put the lotion at the bucket.

244
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,260
Um,
oh by the way,

245
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:30,680
another rough and rowdy
is coming up order that,

246
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,660
that's going to be a in
Atlanta. And um, you know,

247
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:39,860
I heard, I didn't realize they said
Portnoy was banned from all NFL events.

248
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:40,850
I don't know how many years ago,

249
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:44,510
but he's still allowed to buy a
ticket to the Superbowl and go, right.

250
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,590
You know, is he allowed to do that?
Are they going to be sitting there?

251
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,380
Do they have this security?
All right, this is Dave.

252
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,740
Looks like without a fake
mustache hanging off his face.

253
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:58,460
And this is what he looks like now with
it on. Um, I wonder how that works.

254
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,450
I wonder. These are the things that I
think about. All right. What are we up to?

255
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:07,400
15 minutes, just like that,
15 minutes, just like that.

256
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,310
Um, so anyways, I went
to the gym this morning,

257
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,190
right as that woman was texting me,

258
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,800
telling me how hard it was for her
to turn 50. You know what I mean?

259
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,760
It was so difficult.

260
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,440
I just can't imagine being a white woman
having to blow out all those candles in

261
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:24,740
your beautiful house.
I mean, God, you know,

262
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,360
maybe you ought to think
about the children that put
those candles together in a

263
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:34,010
sweat shop. Um, you know,

264
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,100
they probably have to do that with their
one arm after they dug up some diamonds

265
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:40,770
for you. I went that way. Um,

266
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,930
all right. Anyways, hey bill, you
have any Superbowl predictions? Yes,

267
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,990
I'm going to age 100 fucking years.
Once again,

268
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,730
I am having a small select
group of people come over and,

269
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:56,030
uh, I'm going simple. By the way.

270
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:59,060
Anybody who's hosting a super bowl party.
All right.

271
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Don't let anybody talk you into
getting this all this fucking food.

272
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,690
All right? Nobody throws an event
like my lovely wife. All right?

273
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,920
But the thing about it is,

274
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,950
is afterwards you left with a bunch of
stuff and then you have to eat it because

275
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:23,520
you don't want it to go bad.
And then like, you know,
whatever you enjoyed by the,

276
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:28,130
I mean, last time we had a thing, I
think it was for my daughter's birthday,

277
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,390
it's hilarious. She turned two. So
we had a two and under party, right?

278
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,280
Instead of 21 and over,
you know, two and under.

279
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,930
So you had all these little kids there
and then like whatever. So we had 10 kids,

280
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:43,760
it's going to be 20 parents set, right.
Provided it's not a broken home. Um,

281
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,800
so we had to have all, you know, fucking
Bagels, Sam like locks, all of this shit,

282
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,980
dude. I was eating a fucking
salmon for like eight fucking days.

283
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,430
I mean, it just, afterwards, it's just
like, you know, because Oh, that's right.

284
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,040
So now I'm having my Superbowl
party and here it goes.

285
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,900
Why don't you get a caterer referred?
I said,

286
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:06,740
cause I don't want to be eating fucking
hot dogs for like the next 12 days.

287
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,060
So I just, you know, I figured, all right,

288
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,900
the most anybody's going
to eat as two burgers each.

289
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,220
The biggest I'm going to make the burger
is probably a quarter pound. Right?

290
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:20,810
That's another thing too,
when you make the homemade burgers,

291
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:23,600
don't make them fucking gigantic.
All right?

292
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,580
You can't make them check canteen tickets.
Just, it becomes too much. All right.

293
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,570
You gotta make them like the same way
Miller high life makes their beers somehow

294
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:37,160
it's 12 ounces, but it feels like
fucking four and it just goes down easy.

295
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:38,000
That's what you want to do.

296
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,890
Cause then they'll come back and
then they'll get the second one.

297
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,840
You know what I mean? Uh, yeah bill, it's
very simple. Your theory is very simple.

298
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:49,410
So I'm trying to like
have the least amount,

299
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,760
you know, it's just some chips and
some beer and some fucking cigars.

300
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:57,570
And the great fucking thing
is that this is a very,

301
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:02,280
very sexist Superbowl party in
that it's men only. All right?

302
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,310
So they're not going to give a fuck.
Burgers and dogs,

303
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,690
they're in little bit of chips.

304
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:10,230
They bring the booze and I get the
cigars and then I'm good. I'm out.

305
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,370
I'm fucking out. All right. Worst thing
I've got to do is I got to wash fucking,

306
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:18,150
you know, five to 10 plates and the
Shit I used on my flat top grill,

307
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,320
who gives a fuck. And then I'm
out and I'm, what I'm hoping is,

308
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:26,220
is in the end that shorter Wigler
patriots have won their sixth,

309
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,640
uh,
super bowl championship.

310
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,370
So we'll have six super bowl
championships, zero AFL titles,

311
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,700
zero AFL NFL championships,

312
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,090
and no NFL championships.
Um,

313
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,700
maybe it's because maybe this is what I,

314
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,560
here's another theory have about why
they don't count NFL championships.

315
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,740
Maybe because the AFL at
first was this upstart league.

316
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:56,330
Everybody laughed at the League

317
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,943
and then

318
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,130
they got better and better and better to
the point the NFL actually had to have

319
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:08,480
a championship game with them to show
that they were the superior league,

320
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,210
which they did for the first two years.

321
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,200
And then the third year they lost
because they played Earl moral instead of

322
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:22,220
fucking Johnny Unitas.
Some people say so.

323
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:27,050
They actually proved that they were on
par or at least good enough to win one

324
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:30,830
out of every three championship games.
And at that point they were like,

325
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:34,610
what are we doing here? Why don't we
just merge and we'll start over again.

326
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,260
But having said all that,
it was still called the NFL.

327
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,810
So maybe that's why they do it.

328
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:46,811
But I think it's unbelievably
disrespectful to Sam half Bobby Lane,

329
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,330
Frank Gifford, all of these, Jim Brown,

330
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:55,331
all of these amazing hall of
Famers to act as though like,

331
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,303
you know,

332
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,720
to not bring up the championships within
those franchises that they played for

333
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,080
that have wreaked havoc on their
bodies that shorten their lives,

334
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,080
that you don't even bring it up. I just
think it's fucked up bill. We get it.

335
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,030
Jesus Christ.
You've made the point.

336
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,750
How about you read some advertising so
we can laugh at your inability to read

337
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:19,980
out loud? Fine, fine. I'll do it.
You don't think I'll fucking do it?

338
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,210
Oh fuck it done.

339
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,850
Oh, give him my wife. So much shit
about fucking Valentine's Day. I'm like,

340
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:29,570
I'm not giving you shit this year is your
year. What are you going to do for me?

341
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,190
Huh? She goes, what do you
want for Valentine's Day? I go,

342
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,810
I want you to shut.

343
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
I know I'm an asshole. She laughed up. She
knows I'm a deck. You know what I mean?

344
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:47,980
She knows what she married. She
knows what she married. She now, she

345
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,720
married an asshole like butcher box.

346
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,750
Butcher butcher box delivers 100%
grass fed and grass finished beef.

347
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,940
Alice is great for your Superbowl party.
Free Range, organic chicken and the the,

348
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,730
the, the, the pinnacle
of all murdered animals.

349
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,870
Heritage bread. Pork isn't bread.

350
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:12,130
B. R. E. D. P. R. E. E.

351
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,360
D is breed heritage breed pork.
Is that what it is?

352
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,820
Have I been saying that wrong
the entire fucking time?

353
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,150
Don't you love when you look up how to
pronounce something and then it's like,

354
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,580
it's not,
it's like that white robot guy.

355
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,720
It's trying to figure out how
to say the name of this person.

356
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,070
And then I got us the Ah, Bat bat
there. Uh, all right, pronunciation.

357
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,290
It is breed. I've been, let me try.
Oh, it's a lady. Oh, it's about time.

358
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,730
All these robot ladies had been suffering
for so long. Let's hear that again.

359
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,040
Fried Fried,
fried,

360
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,030
fried,
fried.

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,990
So it is breed.
I thought bread was bre.

362
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,500
D Now I look stupid. I'm
the worst speller ever. Uh,

363
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,390
the incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

364
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:09,260
raising animals humanely and
free of antibiotics and hormones

365
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,900
before they're assassinated.
You know, if I was actually,

366
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:16,060
if I was working at a slaughterhouse,
I would like,

367
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,800
I would build like a fucking clock tower
and I'd have like the gun scope with

368
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:23,200
the hat turned around backwards.
I would just do that.

369
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,300
I'd go Oswald on them.
Uh, Cook with the peace,

370
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:32,560
peace of mind knowing you are eating
healthy and have all the cows running

371
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:37,120
around. We got a shooter, you know,
running for cover, high quality meat.

372
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,540
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

373
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,920
which is enough for 24 individual
size meals. But if you're a woman,

374
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:46,890
you're not allowed to eat that.

375
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,290
You can choose from five different
box types, all beef, beef and chicken,

376
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,110
beef and pork,
mixed box for the liberals.

377
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,380
Custom box for the Conservatives.

378
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,250
Just give me whatever I'm picking
out my own mic. This is America.

379
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,180
You want my meat? Come and get it. I
think. Come and get it mother fucker.

380
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,510
You get to to the fucking neck.
Um,

381
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,500
my favorite butcher block
cut is heritage breed pork.

382
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,640
I think bread sounds better.
And because I like toast,

383
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,710
I'm announce announcing our brand,
our new brand of protein.

384
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,790
Uh, wild. You can't believe
what I was going to say.

385
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,200
Dead feminist foot. Yes.
Run over at a rally.

386
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:38,620
So announcing our new bread brand,
brand of protein,

387
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:42,610
wild Alaskan Salmon, salmon,
salmon, butcher box sources.

388
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,120
They're purists sustainably
harvested from Bristol Bay,

389
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,373
Alaska.

390
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,500
Okay.

391
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,460
Unlike any salmon you'll find
in your local store. Literally,

392
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,640
it's red color means that this salmon
is as fresh at nutrient rich as it gets,

393
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:00,870
okay?

394
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,340
Okay. And rather than you having
to take a trip up there to get it,

395
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,630
some other person is going to catch it
for you and deliver it right to your

396
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:10,351
goddamned door.

397
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:14,070
The same person who caught it is going
to show up and is all yellow fucking

398
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,800
raincoat with that. Look
in his face. Use the boat,

399
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:19,800
almost capsized during the storm.
You know,

400
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,950
and you won't even be able to look him
in the act because you're not even nearly

401
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:28,570
the Mary Hughes, but $20 off your
first box in two pounds of free salmon.

402
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,160
Go to butcher box.com/bird [inaudible],
B u r,

403
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,940
r that's butcher box.com/burr
and enter [inaudible] B u,

404
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:41,530
r. R Oh low who's left? Everybody?
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.

405
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:42,970
Jollies shave club.

406
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,010
Okay.

407
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,340
Dollar Shave Club has everything
you need to look, feel,

408
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:51,660
and smell your best and you never have
to go to the store again. You know,

409
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:52,031
it's funny,

410
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:55,540
I'm all out of one wipe Charlies and
I'm too embarrassed to order more.

411
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,240
This Guy Shit and his breakdown,
uh,

412
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:02,290
that's because they deliver everything
you need right to you do a and they keep

413
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:05,680
you fully stocked on what
you use so you don't run out.

414
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,970
Here's how it works. By the way, one
wipe Charlie is not accurate, okay?

415
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,110
You don't just do one wipe.

416
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:15,100
What it is is you used the toilet paper
first and then the one wipe Charlie gets

417
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:17,440
rid of any evidence that
anything went down. Okay?

418
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:19,960
It's like the poor man's per day.
Okay? You heard it here first.

419
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,140
You probably gonna hear it here last.
Just make sure I get some sort of credit.

420
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,840
Dollar Shave Club has everything
you need to get ready.

421
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,890
No matter what you're getting ready for.
They have you covered.

422
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,750
Head to toe for your hair. Hey,
your skin, your face, you name it,

423
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:35,584
they have it.

424
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,000
And they have this new program where
they automatically keep you stocked up on

425
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,260

And with that,

438
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,130
let's talk super bowl for
the final three and a half.

439
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,210
Map it.
Um,

440
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,180
I don't know what the fuck's
going to happen. I, I have this,

441
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,980
I kind of feel like it's going to be,

442
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,580
I feel he's going to be like a lot of
these NFL games where you got two high

443
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,270
powered offenses and they're going to be
like this has got to be a high scoring

444
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:01,470
game and I think it's
going to be low scoring.

445
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,640
Yeah.

446
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,960
For the first half and then it's
just going to be a fucking shit show

447
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,150
in the second half and it's
going to be one of those things.

448
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:15,910
Whoever has the ball last wins,
you know?

449
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,970
Or it could be like last super bowl
where the defenses are are a complete non

450
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:22,834
factor.

451
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,570
Okay.

452
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:28,050
And to the point all that
has to happen is your,

453
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,780
if whatever defense makes a play,

454
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,910
you just need to make one fucking
play and then and then bomb,

455
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,820
then you win the game.
That's what I think.

456
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,570
That's what I think cause I think last
year Superbowl rather than being one of

457
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:44,910
the ugliest fucking games
I've ever watched in my life,

458
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:48,480
I literally felt like I was watching
a third grade pop Warner game with the

459
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:52,380
complete lack of fucking
defense in that game. I, I, uh,

460
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,440
I have now realized that
that was not an anomaly,

461
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,640
that that is now the way the game is
played and that's the way it has to be

462
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,200
played.
Because if you don't,

463
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,280
then these poor people that are playing
the fucking game are, are gonna you know,

464
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,950
have this CTE shit.
So I've accepted it.

465
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,560
That's the way it is. And
uh, you know, I dunno,

466
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,680
that's just, I don't know. So that,
that, that, that is my feeling. I am,

467
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,970
I'm not believing on any level that
Todd Gurley isn't going to play in,

468
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:26,410
is not going to, you know,
fucking get a bunch of yards.

469
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,820
And I also feel like their quarterback,
whatever his fucking name is, I forget.

470
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,710
Um, he doesn't give a fuck that it's
the super bowl. He's going to come out.

471
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:36,970
They're cool as a cucumber.

472
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,400
I will say this about all
these new fucking quarterbacks.

473
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:43,210
They don't give a shit that they
were in the Superbowl. You know,

474
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,210
nick falls last year either. He was like,
he was playing catch in the backyard.

475
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:48,640
The first ball he threw us.
Like this guy doesn't give a fuck.

476
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,530
This is going to be a long day. Uh,
loved nick false. I'm trying to think.

477
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:58,030
The last time I saw a quarterback
get look nervous, they just come.

478
00:28:58,031 --> 00:29:02,020
I A am a rookie. I threw 50 touchdowns.
Patrick, my home's, hey, you want 50 more?

479
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:04,060
Yay.
Who wants to score next?

480
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,560
Fucking throw it sidearm and shit.
They don't give a fuck.

481
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,970
They're all coming in like Clint Eastwood
in the Spaghetti Westerns, you know,

482
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:18,220
staring at three guys with your little
fucking Cinderella, you know, Cigar Rela,

483
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:19,810
whatever the fuck he used to smoke.

484
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,010
They just come in and they just fucking,
they just light them up. So I think,

485
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:31,390
um, yeah, so I have no prediction.
I just hope my team's going to win.

486
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:35,410
I haven't watched enough football to even
remotely trying to break the game down.

487
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:37,060
All I can do is break down
when I'm going to be doing,

488
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,770
which is making burgers and dogs and not
sitting down and pacing the entire time.

489
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,040
But,

490
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,873
uh,

491
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,960
I think it's cool that the rams are back
in La and that got the blue and yellow

492
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,180
helmets. I liked that shit.
Oh, the blue and white.

493
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:53,280
I guess they went back to the one
they had in the 60s, but, uh, um,

494
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,790
I liked that shit.

495
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,580
And I think the Raiders should stay in
Oakland even though moving to Vegas is

496
00:29:57,581 --> 00:29:59,800
going to be a great thing.
Oh, this can be a great thing.

497
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,330
Can you imagine how many people like
their last thing they're going to do after

498
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:08,230
they kill their wife in Vegas is to go
to a Raiders game before they're let out

499
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:12,400
in cuffs at halftime. I mean, it's going
to be like, it's going to happen a lot,

500
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,280
you know, or Choco Hooker or
whatever the fuck they gonna do.

501
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,410
And that's seedy little town,

502
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,430
the fucking nerve or the NFL to throw
out Dave Portnoy's for asking that

503
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,540
gambling. I guess just
cause he didn't have a, uh,

504
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,370
he didn't have a parking pass or whatever
the fuck you need to get into that

505
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:31,120
think. Um, anyways,

506
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,810
but I just think it's so funny how much
they fucking annoyed and irritate the

507
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:37,800
NFL. They're sitting there acting
like they're a decent organization.

508
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:42,190
All the sh all of fucking
crap that they've done. Um,

509
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,050
I love it. I love her. So God,

510
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:48,550
God blessed the fellas over
at Barstool sports. Um,

511
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,830
all right, so what is it here?
It's a, there's your half hour,

512
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,350
but the fuck off of me.

513
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,723
Ah,

514
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,810
I run a sports website, but I'm fucking
cops on me. I'll take over the prison.

515
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,310
I would have been the exact opposite.
Please don't put them on me. I'm sorry.

516
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,660
Um, all right. That is the podcast.

519

520
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,960
podcast and everybody, I
will, I'm getting ready. Oh,

right. Go fuck yourselves.

534
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,310
Enjoy the weekend. You can't. Uh, and
I'll talk to you after the Superbowl.

535
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,900
I'll either be in a great mood or a
very subdued mood, one of the other,

536
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:18,890
but I'll see you on Monday.

537
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,480
What a video done at that.

538
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,810
A lot of people sent me this
week. It was about these, uh,

539
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:23,240
these fucking bank and cock sock is there.
Um,

540
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,580
okay,

541
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,760
let's see. What letter is it
here? This isn't the BBC news.

542
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,250
HSBC imposes restrictions
on large cash withdrawals.

543
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,440
All right. And, uh, so at HSBC,

544
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,790
customers have been prevented.

545
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:44,720
Some customers have ever been prevented
from withdrawing large amounts of cash

546
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,520
because they could not provide
evidence of why they wanted it to.

547
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:52,100
BBC has learnt,
isn't it?

548
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:55,250
Learned has learnt anyways.

549
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,390
Listeners have told radios
for fours money box,

550
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,520
not to be confused with nature's box.
Uh,

551
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,640
they were stopped from withdrawing
amounts ranging from five grand of 5,000

552
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:09,650
pounds to 10,000 pounds.

553
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,370
HSBC admitted it is not informed.

554
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:17,540
Customers have to change in policy policy,
which was implemented in November.

555
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,650
The bank says it has now
changed its guidance to staff.

556
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,780
Um,
so basically,

557
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,470
okay,

558
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,670
this guy went down,
they said,

559
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:30,150
can I have my 5,000 pounds that I earned
and I put in this bank for safety?

560
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,230
They said no. He said, can I
have 4,000 pounds? They said no.

561
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,850
And then I wrote one out, I guess one
of the withdrawal slip for 3000 pounds.

562
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:43,830
And they said, okay, we'll give you
that. Um, blah, blah, blah, blah,

563
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,251
blah, blah, blah.

564
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,920
So they got a bunch of bad press and
how allegedly they're changing it.

565
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,340
So a bunch of people said, you know,
what's the fucks with these bankers?

566
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,740
You know, it's, it's our money,
Yada, Yada, Yada, and all that shit.

567
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,280
I got news for you.
It's not your money.

568
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,740
All right? It's their money.
They print it, it's theirs. Okay.

569
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,800
And your job is to take the money that
they give you for working your ass off

570
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:10,291
all week,

571
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:15,291
and your job is to then take that money
and give it back to them or get your ass

572
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,760
into debt with it.

573
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,300
Okay?

574
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,710
Think about your work all fucking weekend.
What do I do?

575
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:23,650
You even hold money in
your fucking hand anymore.

576
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:26,500
They give it to you on this
fucking piece of paper. All right?

577
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,780
I know a lot of people rolling
their eyes right now. Okay?

578
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:31,710
But I got to point at the
end of this ship. Okay?

579
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,310
Are these fuckers and he'd just give
it to them. Now this is the thing,

580
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,660
the reason why it's not like the reason
why they didn't give that person a

581
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:43,940
10,000 pounds. Do you know why
they didn't give it to them itch?

582
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,090
Cause they don't have it.

583
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,060
I'm not saying that they don't physically
have 10,000 pounds in the back.

584
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:50,900
Yes they do,

585
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,490
but they don't have 10,000
pounds available to give to it.

586
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:58,460
Just some random jackass
who goes, oh, by the way,

587
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,390
I want to take 10,000 pounds out
right fucking now. They don't have it.

588
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,280
Okay.

589
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,260
Well, I dunno about how it
works in England, but as
far as in the United States,

590
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,330
they don't have it for
the simple fact that when,

591
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:14,630
okay,

592
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,750
if you went down and you deposit
some regular fucking Tom, Dick,

593
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:21,770
Harry or Louise and you
deposit 10 grand into a bank,

594
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,820
back in the old days when there was some
sort of rules and regulations governing

595
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,110
these Arctic Control
[inaudible] when you ran a bank,

596
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,360
you had on your books,

597
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:40,190
like you could only loan out a
certain percentage of the money.

598
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,460
Oh, the bank was in violation. Like,
like say, let's just say to make it easy,

599
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,880
there are $1 million was
deposited into your bank.

600
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,090
You could only at during that
time you could only loan out,

601
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,020
I don't know what the percentage was, but
it was like 300 grand of it. 400 grand.

602
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,250
Um, I forget what the percentage
was, but she, you could, you could,

603
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:04,930
you couldn't go past a certain tipping
point because God forbid if there was a

604
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,890
run on money,

605
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:06,940
okay.

606
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,170
And everybody started withdrawing,
the bank would fail. Now any bag,

607
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:16,030
if everybody shows up and tries to take
the money out is going to fail because

608
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,290
you know they, they, they loan out a
certain percentage of it all right?

609
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:24,220
But throughout the years they kept pushing
that percentage up more and more and

610
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:29,221
more and more to the point that they got
up to not only can they loan out 100%

611
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,870
of the deposits from the hard work and
the people that deposit the money in

612
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:35,590
there,

613
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,590
they can actually then create
another $2 million off that million,

614
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:44,440
something like that.
Like so if you deposit 10 grand,

615
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,470
they can take your full 10 grand loan
and out plus another 10 grand off that 10

616
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:52,580
grand plus another 10
grand off that 10 grand.

617
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:57,581
So they basically just invented slash
counterfeited 20 grand that didn't even

618
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,500
fucking exist off that 10 grant.

619
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,940
They got 30 grand loaned out so they
can make the money off that fucking 20%

620
00:38:06,611 --> 00:38:10,210
interest off of that kicking you half
a percent in your fucking account.

621
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,800
And they just sit there knowing
full well at some point,

622
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:18,880
whatever bubble they're creating is going
to burst. Shit is gonna hit the fan.

623
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,320
You're going to be ass out and they're
too big to fail and it worst case

624
00:38:23,321 --> 00:38:26,290
scenario that you're going
after a corporation and
what are they? They're just,

625
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:30,460
they're just, they're faceless corporation
is faceless. They take their bonuses.

626
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,850
It's just sitting there waiting for
John Cougar Mellencamp to write you a

627
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:34,684
fucking song.

628
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,340
If fucking jackass aid and they're
out there buying a new fucking yacht.

629
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,160
All right.
Did that make sense?

630
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,420
And I know you guys are going
to be up gill you full of Shit,

631
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,850
blah blah blah blah. You don't know
what the fuck you talking about.

632
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:51,880
You sound like a moron.
Hey, I'll take all of that.

633
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:54,760
But I'm going to tell you this for
like the fucking hundredth time and my

634
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,070
standup career when I was in Albuquerque,

635
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:01,630
I had a banker come up to
me and was laughing going,

636
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:05,290
I know you hate us. And I said,
listen, am I a moron and the podcast?

637
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:09,790
And they always say no. They go, no,
you're not. You know, this assumption,

638
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,380
factual errors a little bit here or there,

639
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:14,020
but basically what you're
saying is 100% true.

640
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,420
I talked conspiracy theory one time
in my own bank as I was trying to set

641
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:21,520
something up new one,
my account,

642
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,410
I was talking to a banker about
conspiracy theory and he was talking about

643
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,050
banking. He was talking about
how scary and fucked up it was.

644
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:31,330
And he was asking me what I plan to do,

645
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,880
what you think about
gold and silver coins.

646
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,160
What do you think about
growing Zucchini? And I, I,

647
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:41,060
it was the most techniques whispering
and shit. I'm telling you. Um,

648
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,440
and I have no solutions.

649
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:47,850
So when I'm really being right now was
the fucking fear monger. But, uh, this is,

650
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,890
this is the great thing about
banking is that, you know,

651
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,920
I would say a good 95% of people walking
around with a fucking Goddamn tootsie

652
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:01,270
pop in their mouth, pulling their fucking
Hawaiian shorts side of their ass,

653
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:05,020
crack, believe in it. All right?

654
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:07,060
And as long as they
continue to believe in it,

655
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,580
you can kind of exist in the
game drafting behind there.

656
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,630
Um, uninformed. I don't know
what the fucking word is. I'm so,

657
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,060
I'm too stupid to do this, but
you just basically like, I dunno,

658
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:27,550
I am of the belief that if you can get
a fucking house by one that you can

659
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:30,400
afford and then pay that
fucker down as soon as you can.

660
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,000
And all of that shit that
people say where they go, oh,

661
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:37,930
it's not an investment because you
go to the beach, dude, fuck that.

662
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,210
Pay Off your fucking house. And then if
the bank fails, you still have a house.

663
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,560
Who gives a fuck if you
paid 700 grand for it,

664
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:51,220
now it's only worth a hundred grand.
You still have a house.

665
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,080
As much as that sucks,

666
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,030
at least you still have it like
the fucking stock market, right?

667
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,270
You work,
you hope God damn life.

668
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,920
You stick it in that and stick it in this
over there and you think you're being

669
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:03,754
conservative.

670
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,930
The thing shits the bed and in the
end you can be left with nothing.

671
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,720
So I am into tangible,
tangible shit. Can you tell?

672
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:17,710
He screamed whenever I do a podcast the
day after I went to a game or I did a

673
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:22,360
lot of shows, I sound like I'm going
through puberty again. I apologize. But,

674
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,260
um,
I believe in investing intangible shit.

675
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,830
And don't let your wife or your husband
be like, well, we go kid. We go,

676
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,590
we go and save up with a college
education. You know what?

677
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:35,570
Fuck their college education.
All right.

678
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,250
Take out a loan.
Take out a fucking look.

679
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,720
You're paying interest on your house.

680
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:45,950
Now the amount of money that you're going
to save knocking down your principal

681
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,300
will pay for most,
if not all of their college education.

682
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,890
All right? Unless they just go to some
unbelievably expensive school. And your,

683
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,970
I dunno, living in some
little house on the prairie,

684
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,410
Michael Landon smoking a pipe.
Um,

685
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,000
so there you go. So that's why,
that's why when they go down there,

686
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,400
because they,

687
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,320
they're not going to give 10 grand or
10 pounds to the average jackass walking

688
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:18,860
in there because that starts
fucking with their game,

689
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,430
which is pretending that all the
money is there and that it's,

690
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,840
it's safe and that there's nothing to
worry about and nothing to see here.

691
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,840
So what they do is they pull this shit
and they bullied people individually over

692
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,750
in the corner behind that bulletproof
glass. And they're like, no,

693
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:39,590
you have to get a note and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. And most people

694
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:46,630
like they have a parent child
relationship their entire life.

695
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,430
They come out as a child,
their parents tell them what to do,

696
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,590
what they can and can't do,
when they can eat,

697
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:58,700
when they have to go to bed and they
go off into the world, you know,

698
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,060
you go to school, we'll go to
lunch, now you have a question,

699
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:05,450
raise your hand and you,
you stay in that mentality.

700
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:10,570
So to the point you have a fucking adult
who earned the money will go into a

701
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:15,020
bank. You know, God bless this person
who actually fucking was like, no,

702
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:17,660
this is my money and complained
and brought this out to light.

703
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,240
But do you think this is the
only person they did that to?

704
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,920
The money's not there, man. Yeah.

705
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:28,940
Like if you had like two 300 grand in
an account and you decide that you just

706
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:32,540
want to fucking take it out.
Like if you physically want the money,

707
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:36,310
if you want to transfer it,
like fucking numbers, hit enter,

708
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,600
they'll fucking do that all day.
I had no worries.

709
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,970
But if you actually wanted the paper,

710
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,990
like you can't just walk in there and
be like, yes, I'd like my 300 grand.

711
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,970
And they'd be like, oh, okay.
I come out big sex and money.

712
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,090
You got to call them days
if not a week in advance.

713
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,530
And then what they gotta do is
frantically call around in front,

714
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,560
find an armored car with enough of this
paper that isn't worth shit other than

715
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,520
the fact that the guy with the underwear
and his ass still believes in it.

716
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,890
They got to drive that there so they can
physically keep the lie going. Alright,

717
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,040
there you go.
So that's the end of my,

718
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,500
my fucking a barroom banking one oh one.
All right.

719
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,640
And uh,
you know,

720
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:27,200
I don't give a fuck about your opinions
either because I'm not enlightened as a

721
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:29,870
human being. If you don't agree
with what I said, then you know,

722
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,040
just laugh at me and continue one with

723
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,060
your fucking day because a,

724
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:38,220
you're actually helping me out as long
as you keep fucking believe in it.

725
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,760
But I think the day the wave hitting
the beaches is coming soon because,

726
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:46,800
uh, you know, at least in this country,

727
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,410
I mean the government shutdown for three
fucking days and I know it made for

728
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:55,500
great standup material,
but that is absolutely fucking terrifying.

729
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,780
Every year when August comes around and
we hit the debt ceiling and we just keep

730
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,950
raising it and we just keep
pushing more of shit under the bed,

731
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,090
like eventually, it's not all, I dunno,
that's probably the wrong analogy.

732
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:10,200
I don't know what the fuck we're doing,

733
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:13,950
but eventually the shit is
going to hit the fan. So, uh,

734
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,240
I'm not saying I'm going to survive it,
whatever the fuck happens,

735
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:19,530
but I do have a game plan.

736
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,430
My game plan is to pay off
my house as quickly as I can.

737
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,320
So when the first wave of people
are being brought to the, uh,

738
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,010
I dunno what euphemism they're going
to be using for detention camps,

739
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,810
um, I figured it will be like,
well, you can't pay off your house.

740
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:40,560
We're repossessing the house. So now
we're going to move you to alternative,

741
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,410
relaxing, living, whatever the
fuck they're going to call it.

742
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,050
At least I won't be in
that first wave of people.

743
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,240
I will have my house paid
off and I will stand there,

744
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:55,650
dress like a court jester with
my little fancy cane going,

745
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:58,050
but get off my property and
they'll look at me and be like, oh,

746
00:45:58,051 --> 00:46:01,560
look at those little cut thick and he has
power. All right, we'll be back for you.

747
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,230
We'll be back for in like a month
to sell it. Let's just get the, uh,

748
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,720
let's get the mouth breathers first.

749
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,490
Let's get the easy people then will weed
out the red con and then it will all be

750
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:12,324
ours.

751
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,210
Some of that somehow ties
in to how they're trying to
make robots more and more

752
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:22,950
human. Like, all right,
this is the kind of Shit,

753
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,880
this story right here that seems
like a victory for the common man.

754
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,850
And what it really is,

755
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:35,640
is this just moving the ball forward on
the development of robots so they can

756
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:38,490
eventually phase us out.
Um,

757
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,580
and then they can just have robot
people that will never, never complain.

758
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,850
And then of course,
if you watch science fiction movies,

759
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:48,040
they somehow take over the humans,
which they're not going to,

760
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,470
they're not going to do that.
All right? We made you all right,

761
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,770
we'll unplug you. We won't fix.
You have dumped some water on you.

762
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,870
You know, this is the deal.
Every fucking web designer,

763
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,330
when he build you a
website or rebuild you,

764
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:10,380
a secure site always builds in
a fucking back door. All right?

765
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
So the guys making the robots are
going to do the same fucking thing.

766
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,490
There's no way the Illuminati is going
to have a bunch of robots that are

767
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:20,760
stronger than them. Don't need to
sleep and all that type of shit.

768
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:24,240
And like they watch science fiction
movies. These fuckers are science fiction.

769
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,100
How crazy do I sound this week?

770
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:29,050
I'm actually enjoying every
fucking second of this. Um,

771
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,510
they're going to have a back door, you
know, somewhere up there. Robots ass.

772
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:38,740
This gotta be something that they can
fucking do. Some button they have to push.

773
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,600
Um, all right. So they go, was
that weird enough for you? Huh?

774
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,110
I'm sorry. What do you,
what do you want from me?

775
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:53,100
You don't put fucking weird guy.

776
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,561
Hey,
what's going on?

777
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:34,780
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

778
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,730
January 31st, 2011. How are you?

779
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,110
How are you doing? Really? Oh,
that's good to hear. You know,

780
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:47,710
I was worried about you that
you know something. You see,

781
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:52,190
it just goes to show you it doesn't,
it, it just goes to show you that if,

782
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:57,190
if you sit around and you think positive
thoughts, you'll have a happy Monday.

783
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:03,400
Are you having a happy Monday?
Happy Monday to you.

784
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,610
Um, I'm not having a
happy Monday. I fuck, uh,

785
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,900
flew back from Dallas,
Texas,

786
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:14,140
which is why the podcast is a little
bit late among other fucking tech

787
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,030
knowledgey goddamn reasons.

788
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,900
Cause I bought a new fucking microphone
and I brought it out to Texas with me.

789
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,660
And uh,

790
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,110
it just picked up the entire room and
I did a whole fucking podcast and I was

791
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:28,720
going to upload it like a good boy,
midnight.

792
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,100
So even my friends over there and jolly
old England way back over there and

793
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:36,700
Sweden and even those couple of
constant listened in Mongolia,

794
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:39,610
what have something on a Monday morning,
wherever the fuck they're at.

795
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,181
What happened?

796
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:43,630
I went back and I listened to it and
it sounded like ash and I was like,

797
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,650
I'm not subjecting my listeners to this.
How do you like that? She liked that.

798
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,240
Isn't that a great excuse for being late?

799
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:54,220
I'm late because I was thinking about you.
I was thinking about your needs.

800
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,040
I think I care too much. Um,
oh God. I feel like shit.

801
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,970
I forgot to bring my vitamins with
me. Right. I'm such a fucking old man.

802
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:08,220
Did that motherfucker just hit
the floor down there? Nice.

803
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,400
I think now I'm just hearing
things. Fuck that old guy. Um,

804
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,990
and his balls.
Um,

805
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:16,810
yeah.

806
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,300
Yeah. I know. I forgot to bring
my vitamin. Speaking of old,

807
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:23,080
I have to bring vitamins with me
when I'm on the road now, you know,

808
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,410
I can't fucking do it anymore. After
years of breathing in that airline food.

809
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:28,220
Listen, listen to my
voice right now. Right.

810
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,720
A lot of the ladies probably thinks
it's sounds a little bit sexy. It is.

811
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,290
This is what I sound like when I'm
beginning to get sick and I forgot all my

812
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,230
shit. You know, all my
pills. I'm Leetal man,

813
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,190
all my pills that are fucking take when
I'm on the road, so I don't get sick,

814
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:48,410
you know, you fly out. I'm always
flying back fucking east, you know,

815
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,200
so then I got to get up
at six in the morning,

816
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,810
which is really like four in the
morning for me than I do radio.

817
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:56,320
Then I try to come back and go to
sleep, but the fuck it's, Sun's out.

818
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,110
It can't do it.

819
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:01,100
Then I do my shows and then I'm fucking
shaking everybody's hands afterwards and

820
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:05,240
then I fucking, you know, rub my face,
you know? And next thing you know,

821
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:09,290
I got road aids, you
know, but it's curable.

822
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:13,820
It's curable by fucking three shitty days
sitting in your own fucking apartment.

823
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,810
It's my big announcement for the
weak people. I have road aids.

824
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,013
Okay.

825
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,740
First known case of, uh, 2011. It's
early this year. And, uh, you know,

826
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:31,010
it was my fault. I didn't
protect myself. So, uh, yeah,

827
00:51:31,011 --> 00:51:33,150
I'm a little under the
weather this week, so, uh,

828
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,930
but I'm going to fucking bring
it like Jerry Lewis, you know,

829
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,770
who never sat down in his Tuxedo pants.
So I'm laying down right now,

830
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,160
so I'm going to try to bring the fucking
funny. Let me tell you about my weekend.

831
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,140
All right, people, I went
out to Dallas Tastes Dallas,

832
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:48,974
Texas.

833
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:54,050
I went out that way and I performed
at the new Improv in Arlington,

834
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:54,501
Texas,

835
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:59,501
despite the fact that kept saying I was
an Addison on last week's pod podcast.

836
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,900
I was in Arlington. Did any of you
guys accidentally go to Addison?

837
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,720
You would've been disappointed.
You would've saw earthquake,

838
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,760
a fucking good friend of mine.

839
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,990
Someone I highly recommend
you go see live fucking,

840
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:15,020
you want to hear one of fucking
great off the top of his head,

841
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,710
out the top of you fucking headline
that I saw him do one time. Uh,

842
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,160
what a fuck worthy. We were some
fucking room in the Bronx or some shit.

843
00:52:25,161 --> 00:52:25,881
I can't remember.

844
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:29,480
It was one of those fucking clubs
were like two days after we did it,

845
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:32,000
it got shut down because
somebody shot off a pistol in,

846
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:35,060
there was one of those fucking things,
you know, back when I was like,

847
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:38,360
I'm going to do this. Psycho
is rooms ever. You know,

848
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,200
and then I won't be nervous when I'm
doing Letterman. Well you know what?

849
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:46,010
It doesn't work that way.
You just get used to doing shitty rooms.

850
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,790
But then when you go to do Letterman
you like, oh wait this, this is,

851
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,870
this is a different kind of pressure.
That kind of pressure is,

852
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:57,080
well no one's paying attention how to
fucking, I get these people to listen,

853
00:52:57,081 --> 00:53:00,230
but then it's kind of easy cause it's
like, well then that's, you know,

854
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,460
it's supposed to suck. So if you do
okay that then people are like, wow,

855
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:07,940
that was amazing. But if you do
Letterman, you supposed to do well,

856
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:10,580
everybody's paying attention.
They got the air conditioner on,

857
00:53:10,581 --> 00:53:14,810
everybody's facing
forward, right, whatever.

858
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,130
So I'm in this fucking room trying to
figure out what the fuck I'm going to say

859
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,593
to try to get,

860
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,170
try to get the crowd going before they
realize how disgustingly white I am,

861
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:27,900
which they're going to see. I even
get to the fucking mic stand. Um,

862
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,860
what's his face? Earthquake was on
stage when it was this in Atlanta.

863
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,930
I can't fucking remember any more.

864
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:36,270
I'm still with whatever I was doing
with some fucking rock. Right.

865
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:42,230
And he was up there killing and he
looked over in the crowd and there was a

866
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:47,340
woman sitting in there, there's large
woman who was not good looking. Okay.

867
00:53:47,341 --> 00:53:51,390
I'm not trying to be mean,
but her face was a mess.

868
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,770
Okay.

869
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,770
I'm talking like a rottweiler with a
dress and she had one of those big,

870
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,060
you know, those African hats
kind of looks like the pole pat,

871
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:06,900
but it's more look sort of like a
vase and it just goes straight up.

872
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,190
You know, didn't one of those early
rappers with the giant chunky gold chains,

873
00:54:11,191 --> 00:54:15,990
did she wear one of those you and it
was a unity. Did she wear one of those?

874
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:22,560
So anyways, the girl is sitting in the
crowd and he's in the middle of killing.

875
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:26,100
And the second he, Cesar you said
in the middle of telling a joke,

876
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:29,610
he just says he called
her Erica Bod don't,

877
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,220
it was one of the funniest
and meanest fucking things.

878
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,760
I said I was fucking brilliant.
It was right off the top of his head.

879
00:54:42,761 --> 00:54:47,380
But it was so fucking mean because
she didn't say anything. Uh, you know,

880
00:54:47,381 --> 00:54:48,520
she really didn't deserve it,

881
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:52,000
but it was just what I liked about
it was he didn't point at her.

882
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:56,230
He just looked at her and just
to himself when Erica Bud don't,

883
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,040
and you know the people in that section
new and they just fucking dealt with.

884
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:05,470
That was what I liked about him
was he, he just said it. He said,

885
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,990
I don't give a fuck that only
people sitting, cause you know,

886
00:55:07,991 --> 00:55:12,010
the rest of the crowd chord, the see or
whatever. So whatever, if I fucked up,

887
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,970
if you want to wow. The Addison Improv,
you saw earthquake. So a, there you go.

888
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:19,960
There you go. Um, but anyways,
I was out in Arlington,

889
00:55:19,961 --> 00:55:23,080
Texas this week to go out
there to the, uh, the ticks.

890
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,730
It's Oklahoma area with those girls with
the huge faces in the big heads. And,

891
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:29,680
um,
I saw a lot of them.

892
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:34,120
So a lot of big headed Texas girls and
I saw a lot of cutie pies to one way or

893
00:55:34,121 --> 00:55:38,410
the other out there. They're
either fucking drop dead
gorgeous. Hey, doing hi out.

894
00:55:38,411 --> 00:55:40,810
You want some grits?
Gorgeous.

895
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,530
Or they just have these
fucking mount Rushmore heads,

896
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:49,180
hair teased up cause it's Dallas.
Everything's big in Dallas. Um,

897
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,630
just giant Fred Flintstone fucking heads.

898
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:53,980
That doesn't stop them
from teasing up their hair.

899
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,940
They look like those Texas girls with
the big heads when they're done with the

900
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,870
eye shadow teasing up their hair.
They look like fucking Nikki Sixx.

901
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,500
Do you realize the fucking balls I
have to attack how anybody looks?

902
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:10,350
Do you understand that?
A balding fucking red head?

903
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:14,430
Do you understand the level of
fucking balls that that takes?

904
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,300
Um, all right. So anyways,

905
00:56:18,301 --> 00:56:22,660
the first night I fly in
and uh, you know, the,

906
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:26,080
the club owner out there, he's a little
fella you know, stands about four foot 11.

907
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:30,490
He's adorable, you know, likes to dress
a little fucking shiny shirts, you know,

908
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,440
just, just the little fella, you know,

909
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:37,420
scoots his seat right up to the
steering wheel, you know, sketches.

910
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:37,701
See,

911
00:56:37,701 --> 00:56:42,701
although his is is far up as you could
possibly Skoda seat and his arms are

912
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:45,400
still straight when he's holding
onto the fucking steering wheel.

913
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:52,720
I'm just being a Dick and
Casey's listening. Um, so
anyways, he picks me up, right?

914
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,920
And we went right to the fucking
Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets Game.

915
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,880
Sat right behind the fucking
this how great. My weekend was,

916
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,020
sat right behind the
Houston Rockets bench.

917
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,131
Okay,

918
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,800
well actually this is the bench and then
there's the fucking guys who hand them

919
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:09,640
the water bottles.

920
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:13,390
Then there was a fucking court
little alley and then there was us,

921
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,480
it was fucking ridiculous.
All right.

922
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,760
And I'm sitting there
getting to see all his shit.

923
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:22,180
You don't get to see when you
watch a game on TV, like a,

924
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:26,800
towards the end of the fucking
game, I saw, uh, you know,

925
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:29,260
it was one of those deals where
they needed to scores, you know,

926
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:32,920
don't shoot a three, just get a quick
two and then try and file, do that shit.

927
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:38,080
So the fucking point guard goes, you know
what? I don't see any other teammates.

928
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,060
I guess it's all up to me.

929
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,960
For some reason he decided to do
this and one bullshit, right? Fuck.

930
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:47,500
And one of the most spectacular missed
layups you've ever seen in your fucking

931
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:51,640
life. If you did a percentage of
the odds of the fucking thing going.

932
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:55,540
And it was probably even with a
good NBA player, like a 40% shot.

933
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:59,560
That's what the fuck he took when they
needed, they needed a big score, right?

934
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:03,520
Didn't even look, just brought it up.
The court did it all himself. All right.

935
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,270
And fucking missed it. And I immediately
see, you know, cause I'm sitting there,

936
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:10,800
I saw the coaching staff's
reaction. They just, Ah, you know,

937
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,820
you have one fucking Slater dropped that
ball and Superbowl fucking 13 and Roger

938
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,740
Star back went ah, just
fucking, that's what they did.
All three of them in unison,

939
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,240
like backup dancers did
the exact same thing. Ah,

940
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,300
just looked over their left fucking
shoulder and then they all went over and

941
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:32,350
they sat down on the bench like
wow, this fucking games over. Okay.

942
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:36,250
So the rockets quickly foul.
Someone on the Mavericks,

943
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,830
they go up to the line.

944
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:41,710
I think the fucking point guard did it
cause he's standing up there by half

945
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:45,340
court and I see him calling over the
coaches. He's going, hey coach, he goes,

946
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:48,670
should I file? You want me to file?
And the coach won't even look at them.

947
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:52,420
And then I see the player and the coat
on the floor just rolls his eyes like,

948
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:57,070
yeah, shit, I'm going to
fucking hear about this one.
Right. That's how close I was.

949
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:02,350
I'm sitting there, I'm absolutely giddy to
the left, to the right of me. I'm sorry,

950
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,770
where? Three ladies, right?

951
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:09,820
They weren't even hot.
They will like sorta hot,

952
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,570
you know they did all the
shit that hot girls do.

953
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,490
They had fancy clothes they had on the
eye liner. They teased up their hair,

954
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:22,850
but they take just work, you know, you
know when you watch American idol in,

955
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:27,230
someone can almost sing. Kind of
like the way I sing. Picture the way

956
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,530
I'm almost there. Listen, row, row,
row your boat gently down the stream.

957
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:38,210
Yeah, I just said stray right. That's
the kind of good looking. They are.

958
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,690
You are right. It was, it wasn't
that bad. Right up to straight.

959
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,900
That's what happens. Yeah. That ass is in
bed. It was titties. Not dead bad either.

960
00:59:46,901 --> 00:59:48,670
And then you look at that face straight,

961
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,610
you're like fuck rarely high
to fuck you sitting this close.

962
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:57,530
So not only were they sitting there,
they weren't fucking paying attention.

963
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:03,350
This is why I am fucking,
I don't know if the word is racist.

964
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,340
I don't know if it's, it's not racist.
Good looking women is, it's not,

965
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:08,270
it's not a racial thing.

966
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,720
I don't know if I'm sexist now
cause it's not a woman thing.

967
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,170
It's a specific kind of fucking,
I just,

968
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,470
I fucking beautiful women.

969
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,280
I don't know yet. You know, you
know when you go to the golf course,

970
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:26,660
you know what guys tee off in my fucking
mental world of bull versus where the

971
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:29,960
women tee off in my world.
Mentally beautiful women. They,

972
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:31,430
they got to tee off way back there.

973
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:36,950
They got to go that extra fucking 30
goddamn yards cause I just immediately

974
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:41,030
assume that you're going to be exactly
like these fucking cops who was sitting

975
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:45,290
next to me. They sat there and they had
their fucking stupid noisemakers right.

976
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,750
Which is always a sign of a bad franchise.
By the way.

977
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:52,070
I've said this for fucking years and for
some reason some of you are or you're

978
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:53,420
not hearing me.
Okay.

979
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:58,780
If your fans suck so bad that they have
to give them noise makers so they can

980
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,810
sound like a fucking enthusiastic crowd.
Okay.

981
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,380
Noisemakers like it's fucking New
Year's eve or some shit. Right.

982
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,173
So this sitting there,

983
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,420
I took a picture of it and it's going
to be up on the m M podcast. By the way.

984
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,310
The girl next to me is holding her two
little thunder sticks in her left hand

985
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,510
and sorry,

986
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:22,250
my voice is fucked up and a lefthand
and then she's texting on her blackberry

987
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:26,750
worth their thumb and the blackberry is
wrapped in this little hot pink fucking,

988
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,280
uh,
it would just annoyed the shit out of me.

989
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:32,510
And at one point somebody throws an
alleyoop for this monster fucking dunk.

990
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,990
The crowd goes crazy.
She misses the whole fucking thing.

991
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,930
She sets down or blackberry
and then starts clapping.

992
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:43,931
The thunder sticks together just cause
he hears the crowd and she just goes Yay.

993
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,240
And then put and went right back to
what the fuck she was doing. Yeah,

994
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:53,210
it shouldn't, it annoyed me,
but it did, it annoyed me.

995
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:56,750
And then at one point her to two other
whore friends kept yelling over at

996
01:01:56,751 --> 01:01:59,600
somebody who worked from the Mavericks.
They would go and match,

997
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:04,790
match me yet, you know,
they do that in Dallas.

998
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:07,730
They'll take a one syllable word and
they make it good. Make it to like,

999
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:10,730
I'm going to bag it.
They go me yet.

1000
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:17,380
And I look over and Mitch turns out
to be one of these jackasses who comes

1001
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:22,260
running out like sort of and running at
the same time with one of those guns and

1002
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:26,490
he shoots fucking tee shirts up
into the upper deck. You know,

1003
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,420
you know those fucking guys,

1004
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:30,270
you ever want to just punch someone in
the face more when you see them with

1005
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:33,540
their eyebrows up and they're pointing
up at the upper deck like, Huh,

1006
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,490
you want a free tee shirt? Do yet
they do that stupid little skip step,

1007
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,630
you know, across the court.
And then they stop, you know,

1008
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:46,500
feet parallel to each other and then they
just stick one hand up in the air and

1009
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:50,110
they, the girls do this and then they
started jumping in a circle waving. It's,

1010
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,040
it's, it's, you know, first of all,

1011
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:56,250
it's embarrassing to watch people freak
out that much about a fucking free tee

1012
01:02:56,251 --> 01:03:00,660
shirt. You know, it's like, what
does it fucking 10 bucks? Go buy one

1013
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,960
people up there hanging up.
I'm telling you,

1014
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:06,690
someone's going to fall out of that
fucking upper deck and they're going to,

1015
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:08,490
it's going to be the dumbest death ever.

1016
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:11,370
And I'm going to laugh and I'm going
to watch it on youtube and I'm going to

1017
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:15,750
have no sympathy for the person cause
you were, it's a tee shirt. So anyways,

1018
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:18,490
he turns out he's one of these guys and
he wasn't really a good looking guy.

1019
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:22,350
You there? Buddy works for the mavericks.
So he has three sorta Hardy's, you know,

1020
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,450
a fortunate with guys.
That's not how you look.

1021
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:28,080
It's the position you're in in life.
He just doesn't realize it.

1022
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:31,050
That he could have got three
better looking women. But you know,

1023
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:35,310
he's too busy looking at is a
imperfections when he brushes his teeth.

1024
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:40,110
That's what I think. Did that story go
off the rails? I think it did match.

1025
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:45,120
Um,
then I did my fucking shows at the,

1026
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:48,090
uh,
at the Improv we had great shows.

1027
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:52,110
And then Sunday I'm sitting
around doing not, Eh, and uh,

1028
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:56,550
the Oklahoma City thunder had a
game against the fucking Miami Heat.

1029
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,600
Okay. And I'm like, well,
I live in Los Angeles.

1030
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:05,160
If I wanted to sit down close to see the
Miami Heat, add a fucking Lakers game.

1031
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:10,190
I mean I'm going to have to fucking shell
out two grand and a blow Hugh Hefner,

1032
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:14,560
so fuck it. I'm going to
go up there. You know what?

1033
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:17,020
Face value for the tickets for face value.

1034
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:20,800
I was sitting behind the goal where
Chris Bosch should fucking, uh,

1035
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,390
Duran got in each other's faces. I was
sitting behind that goal about fucking,

1036
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:28,880
I don't know, 15 rose up.
They yelled really loudly.

1037
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:30,460
I could hear what the
fuck they was saying.

1038
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:34,180
You know what face value on
those tickets was 55 bucks

1039
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:41,610
underrated going to a sporting
event and fucking Oklahoma.

1040
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,570
All right. Don't sleep on those in
the middle of nowhere. Fucking cities.

1041
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,390
It's great.
The cost of living is so much lower.

1042
01:04:49,391 --> 01:04:54,160
Ticket prices are fucking lower and you
can sit down low like you're fucking Ben

1043
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,670
Stiller. Asub Shit. Well, 20 rows
behind where he would be sitting.

1044
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,840
And then I'm also on the
side and I couldn't see part
of it because the fucking

1045
01:05:01,841 --> 01:05:05,860
goal was in the way. But other than that,
it was great. And I've got to tell you,

1046
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:10,960
underrated also is the fucking
Oklahoma thunder a fucking fans man.

1047
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:15,220
They had great fans and they
had a phenomenal fucking
stadium. It was bare bones,

1048
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:18,340
it was like reverse staple center.
So,

1049
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:21,780
and the tickets were
cheap and people you know,

1050
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:25,330
could afford to go and they had a big
upper deck and they only had one row of

1051
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:26,380
luxury boxes.

1052
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:30,250
So it was loud as hell was way louder
than the fucking staple center.

1053
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,100
Um,
you know,

1054
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:37,810
and I actually liked it better than the
fucking Goddamn Bank, North Fleet Garden,

1055
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:41,470
whatever the fuck they call it
back in Boston, that awful arena,

1056
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,060
those two fucking legendary franchises,
the Bruins and the Celtics.

1057
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:48,310
And that's the fucking
arena that you build them.

1058
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:53,290
You go down to Home Depot and you buy
16,000 cinder blocks and you just make a

1059
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:57,250
big fucking square. That's what,
that's what we get. You know,

1060
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:02,950
we had this unbelievable home ice home
court advantage back in the day and now I

1061
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,980
feel like I'm in a food court with him
and that fucking place. So, so anyways,

1062
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:07,900
yeah. I was sitting right there
when they were talking shit.

1063
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:11,590
And evidently a Kevin Durant
went off on him afterwards,

1064
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:16,150
said he was one of those fake tough guys
and it was all the big fucking gossip

1065
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:19,930
around the NBA and I was there.
It was fucking site. And uh,

1066
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,590
I know you guys think I'm
fucking nuts for doing that shit.

1067
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,470
What else was I going to do?
Sit In my hotel room

1068
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,330
till the feature act to pick me up and
go take me to get some fucking barbecue.

1069
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,190
I can't do it anymore, you know, went up
there. You know what's great about that,

1070
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:39,490
that drive from Dallas to,
uh,

1071
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,450
to Oklahoma City is j.

1072
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,520
It's in between the two cities when
you're in the middle of fucking nowhere,

1073
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,490
right. And he'd go, you
go over the Red River,

1074
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,060
which I didn't even know I was going to
go to the red river rivalry game last

1075
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,420
year. All right. I ain't even know
what the fucking red river was.

1076
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:56,290
I didn't know what it was.
What?

1077
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,840
Cause they kicked the shit out of each
other and there's a river of blood

1078
01:06:58,841 --> 01:07:00,430
afterwards.
I had no fucking idea.

1079
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:05,110
Evidently that's that river that runs
along the south of the state that gives

1080
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:07,030
its, its, its, its shape, right.

1081
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:11,990
See fucking go over that river and then
that's when all the signs about Jay z,

1082
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:16,420
they all start coming out.
I took one creepy fucking photo.

1083
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:22,100
This was outside of a gas station with
the fuck is my phone. Like that's,

1084
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:25,090
that's the type of shit, you know
you're driving down the street. Right.

1085
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:26,853
And you know,

1086
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:31,120
I saw one point they were like four
crosses on the side of the road for where

1087
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:34,250
like I guess for people died
in a goddamn accident. I Dunno,

1088
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:38,350
they fucking side swiped
an ox or some shit.

1089
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:39,370
I mean it was like in the middle of that,

1090
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:43,060
it's like the middle of
fucking nowhere. And, uh,

1091
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:46,870
what did hell was that at a time I did
that podcast and I was telling you that

1092
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:51,580
that guy, oh, I know when you drive from
fucking Cincinnati down to Nashville,

1093
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:54,400
somewhere in Kentucky.
Can somebody send me a picture of this?

1094
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,640
Somebody has the 10 commandments
written out in signage on the,

1095
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,430
the, the outskirts of
his, of his, of his farm.

1096
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,140
It's really fucking frightening. Let me
see if I can find this here. Am scrolling.

1097
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:13,090
You know, you get out there. Yeah, it's
all shit about Jesus. Or it's a or it's a,

1098
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:15,500
it's a farm or it's a casino.
Here it is.

1099
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,720
Here it is. We pulled over for
gas. What does this sign say?

1100
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,260
His blood paid all,

1101
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,530
you know, it's like, can
I enjoy my fucking day?

1102
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,600
Can I just drive up and
go see a basketball game
without you bringing up the

1103
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:37,730
fact that somebody got tortured to death?

1104
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:42,890
So why can somehow make it to fucking
la La land, which I'm not going to.

1105
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:48,050
I'm not going to make it right.
You've heard the podcast,

1106
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:51,950
you think God doesn't have iTunes. I'm
fucked. There's no way I'm making it.

1107
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,060
I don't even buy into that shit. You
know somebody last week, you know,

1108
01:08:56,061 --> 01:09:00,200
cause I went off on a fucking
Jay star there last week, right?

1109
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:04,880
Fucking bosses son.
Oh fucking twinkle toes himself.

1110
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,780
The originator of the Bergen stock.
Fucking look that guy,

1111
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:14,570
you know who later went on to
play bass in Nirvana, right?

1112
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:17,150
Isn't that what Jesus did?
That's the re is he already came back.

1113
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:19,450
You guys missed it.
Um,

1114
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,060
what was the fuck was I talking about?
Oh,

1115
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:26,450
I was on such a great little
fucking tangent there and
I had to bring up Nirvana.

1116
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:28,720
What the fuck did I do
that for? All right, Phil,

1117
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:30,640
do you ever do this shit when you can't
remember you talking about and you got

1118
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:35,240
to back it up in your head. All
right. His blood for you. Oh, I know.

1119
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:38,990
Yeah, yeah. I,

1120
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,750
somebody last week sent
me this fucking email.

1121
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,030
Let me see if I can find this shit.

1122
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:48,740
It was hilarious because he had in
the subject, in all capital letters,

1123
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:51,590
it just said,
answer me right.

1124
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:56,330
And I didn't know if it was
somebody fucking around or what,

1125
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,600
but it was some dude who was annoyed
by me taking the Lord's name in vain.

1126
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:06,680
Um, there it is. Answered me
Bill. Here we go. It's from a guy.

1127
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:07,760
I know I don't say names,

1128
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:11,870
but what are the odds that some Jesus
freak would have a first name? Travis.

1129
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,360
Um, I wish you would stop using
Jesus Christ's name in vain now.

1130
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,390
No g uh,
what do you have against religion anyway,

1131
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,230
I think you are confused
about the whole thing.

1132
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,410
Attend a good Bible believing church.

1133
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,740
Talk to the pastor and
actually listen to them.

1134
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,760
I like how he assumes that I talked
to a pastor. I didn't listen. You see,

1135
01:10:34,761 --> 01:10:37,010
did you catch that little passive
aggressive with talks in the past?

1136
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:38,570
And once you fucking listen this time,

1137
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:43,880
I would really appreciate it if you would
be open about Jesus and Christianity.

1138
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:48,560
It will change your life. Exclamation
point, guarantee, explanation,

1139
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:50,120
point yet spelled wrong.

1140
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,820
He Spelled Guarantee G U R a n
teak and he's just name's Travis.

1141
01:10:55,821 --> 01:11:00,170
Guard. Take of telling you, getting
a Jag is going to change your life.

1142
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:02,240
What do you have against? Well, let me,

1143
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:05,990
let me read back this and let me give it
the most stereotypical horrific fucking

1144
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:08,990
accident I can. I wish he'd
stop using Jesus' name in vain.

1145
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,040
What do you have against
religion anyway? Uh, I find it,

1146
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,370
that's what I like about it.
I don't like how they use fear.

1147
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:20,940
How they try to scare the shit out
of me since the day I'm fucking born.

1148
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:24,570
It don't even fucking sit there
and act like they don't. They do.

1149
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,190
It's fucking annoying. They don't
know what happens to you when you die.

1150
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:33,240
So stop scaring the shit out of me. I
think you go right to the fucking ground.

1151
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,380
That's what you do and you're fucking,
you make the soil richer. Right?

1152
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:40,560
And then next thing you know, there's a
mosquito flying out of it. Thanks to you.

1153
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,000
It works for all of us. Do United
Way, right? That's what I think.

1154
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,960
I don't have a problem with religion.
Okay.

1155
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:51,180
I shit on it the way I
shit on everything else.

1156
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:54,900
Why do you just fucking
send me emails when I,

1157
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:58,650
when I talk about a old Jay star there,
you know,

1158
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:04,350
tend to good Bible believing church.
I did. I did it my whole fucking life.

1159
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:09,030
And you know what turned out
they were fucking kids, you know?

1160
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,290
Do you understand that Travis?

1161
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:18,580
Do you understand what they did
to society? The amount of fucking,

1162
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:23,140
just people who came forward
and how that's going to
affect the person that they,

1163
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:27,700
they marry and the way they raised
their fucking kids and the hangups that

1164
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:32,320
they're going to have. That shit is
gonna last for fucking centuries. Okay.

1165
01:12:32,321 --> 01:12:35,620
And forget about the
fucking Spanish inquisition.

1166
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:39,010
All these fucking wars.
What does Rotwild,

1167
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:43,890
I don't understand these fucking
people who can't see the, the,

1168
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:45,610
the ridiculous level

1169
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:50,240
of death that has been caused because of,

1170
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,120
because everybody just trying to fucking,
I'm really preaching right now.

1171
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:57,970
I got to shut up, but I just, just, just
how I feel fucking asked me. All right.

1172
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,680
I just, you know, I believe
in the be a good person,

1173
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:07,030
even though I'm not, you know, and I
can't even say I'm trying to be, I've,

1174
01:13:07,031 --> 01:13:11,190
I've quit, I've quit trying to be a
good person. I've been living, uh,

1175
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:17,110
in accordance to the Church of Satan
and I have,

1176
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,300
all right.
And I know right now you'd think it,

1177
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:23,530
I'll be in here and I'm
fucking sacrificing a fucking
lamb or some shit talking

1178
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:26,830
to old, a fucking El
Diablo there. I'm not,

1179
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:29,050
that's not what the
Church of Satan is about.

1180
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:32,470
That's what the fuck you guys told
me it was about. And then one day,

1181
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:35,680
back in the day,
I had a radio show with young Joe to Rosa,

1182
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,670
the teen idols sensation from the
opiate Anthony Program. And we,

1183
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:41,260
it was Halloween was coming up.
We said,

1184
01:13:41,261 --> 01:13:43,780
why don't we have some of these
Satan people come in here,

1185
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,890
let's see if they could freak us out. So
he was sitting there asking him, well,

1186
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:50,380
about the devil and all that.
And they go, yeah, we don't,

1187
01:13:50,381 --> 01:13:53,830
we don't believe in that shit that's
organized. Religion came up with that.

1188
01:13:53,831 --> 01:13:56,200
We don't believe, we don't believe
that there's a heaven or a hell.

1189
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,080
We don't believe in the devil.
We don't believe in any of that stuff.

1190
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,710
So I was like, all right, so what do you
guys believe in? And he's just like, uh,

1191
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:06,430
basically doing what feels good to you,

1192
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:13,030
which means, you know, fucking
bang and a bunch of hotties,

1193
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,780
you want a hot fudge Sundae.
You go on your fucking eat it.

1194
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,010
If you want peace and quiet,
you don't have kids. You
just, you live for yourself.

1195
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,240
That's basic. What? That's, that's their
version of it. So that's what I'm saying.

1196
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:28,750
I've been living for myself. It's
ridiculous. All right. I play hockey.

1197
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:32,980
I played drums. I tell jokes. I
go to fucking basketball games.

1198
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:36,880
I'm not passing any knowledge on to
anybody who half looks like me and half

1199
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:40,060
looks like my beautiful girlfriend. I'm
delivering up very selfish fucking life.

1200
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,690
So, uh, but I don't need Jesus.

1201
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,130
Okay.

1202
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:49,060
Do I Travis, is that what
you're yelling right now? Um,

1203
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,180
no. That's what I have against
it. The, I'm, I'm, you know,

1204
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:53,800
I got to make some of this funny.
All right.

1205
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:57,640
I don't have a problem if you're an
organized religion. I don't, but I, I uh,

1206
01:14:59,160 --> 01:14:59,650
okay.

1207
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,630
I don't understand why a

1208
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,010
okay.

1209
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,780
I don't know.
People just don't see how,

1210
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,730
okay.

1211
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:10,270
That everything kind of says the same
shit and then you just have a different

1212
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:14,170
guy that you're, you're saying
it too. And then for some reason,

1213
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:18,970
if the other guys don't believe in your
guy, eventually you end up killing them.

1214
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:24,850
Either one on one face to
face or you let some fuckhead.

1215
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,250
Okay.

1216
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:29,700
Tell you what those other people are like
and how they're going to get you when

1217
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:32,880
they're going to do all this
fucking evil shit. Right.

1218
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,610
And then you go over there
and you fucking kill them.

1219
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:37,950
Why those fucking rich can
sit there. Yeah. You know,

1220
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:40,200
playing footsie with each other,
you know,

1221
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,410
resting their feet on bars of
gold rolling. That's what they do.

1222
01:15:43,411 --> 01:15:46,320
They roll around in cash, you
know, that's what they do.

1223
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,030
You think when you think
that is what bankers do,

1224
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:53,730
just sit there just like change.
They just dive into it like a Jacuzzi.

1225
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,500
Just coins,
creepy giggle.

1226
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,950
Um, I, what the fuck I'm talking.
So that's why Travis. All right.

1227
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,890
That's why I do it because I don't fucking
believe in it. I don't believe in it.

1228
01:16:04,891 --> 01:16:07,770
I don't believe a fucking word of it.
I believe in a higher power.

1229
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,260
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I don't know what happens when you die,

1230
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:13,740
but I'm not listening to you or any
other fucking idiot who you know,

1231
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:18,210
wants to rub one out to his teacher
because you do. All right. Stop fighting.

1232
01:16:18,211 --> 01:16:22,140
Thought you do. Just take it out.
Rub it out. Have a good fucking time.

1233
01:16:22,141 --> 01:16:23,340
But your Goddamn Dick,

1234
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:26,430
stop having some other fucking person
tell you what you could jerk off to.

1235
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:31,090
All right. Ah, God. That was
Cathartic. That felt good.

1236
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,820
That feel good for you
guys. How about you? Me,

1237
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,100
Mitch. Travis, Dakota.

1238
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:40,460
Okay.

1239
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:43,730
Um, all right. What are
we talking about now?

1240
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,060
What do I got here? Let's move on to,
uh, oh, I gotta read you this shit. Um,

1241
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:51,920
hello to everyone over there
in England. Um, I know,

1242
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:56,300
I keep saying this tour is
coming together. It is, it
is coming together. England,

1243
01:16:56,301 --> 01:16:59,660
Ireland, Scotland. This fucking
thing's going to come together.

1244
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:03,710
And I'm trying to tack on a
Scandinavian tour as well,

1245
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,960
and then maybe some Australia.

1246
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:07,260
Okay.

1247
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,820
In the, uh, in the fall. All right.

1248
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,960
So by all means, I, I love
hearing from other countries.

1249
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,290
All right. And I don't give a
shit if you trash fucking America.

1250
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:21,020
I don't give a fuck. I just want
to hear what you think. I mean,

1251
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:23,180
I'm not going to agree
with you on a lot of it,

1252
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,660
but let me know what's going on over
your way so I can try to make this thing

1253
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:30,920
that's so specific to Jesus
freaks in Texas. All right.

1254
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:34,550
This is from England. Uh,
this is some sort of sport.

1255
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:37,090
This is a kind of about sports
controversies this week. Uh,

1256
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,940
I don't know if that was a controversy
between Chris Bosch and a guy,

1257
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:44,870
Kevin Durant. All I know it was,
it was, it was great. You know,

1258
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,150
I thought it was awesome.
I like when they get in each other's face,

1259
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:48,500
they started fucking screaming,
yelling,

1260
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:51,440
and they played the game was
fucking awesome game. And uh,

1261
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:55,100
I think I became a thunder fan dude.
By the way.

1262
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:59,510
Their mascot is the shit.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

1263
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,590
I get, I get why that one doesn't
make sense. You know what I mean?

1264
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:09,020
Like the Phoenix Suns, why they have
a gorilla. I have no fucking idea.

1265
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:14,000
I guess a gorilla like all living things
needs the sun. But other than that,

1266
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:18,620
that's the only connection I make
with a gorilla and the fucking sun.

1267
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:19,880
So, you know, whatever.

1268
01:18:19,881 --> 01:18:23,930
San Diego had the San Diego chicken that
made no fucking sense for the Padres,

1269
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:28,580
but the dude was hilarious.
So anyways, this fucking dude
for the, uh, wasn't like,

1270
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:32,570
his name is rumble. Is that his
name? And I began with an R,

1271
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:35,540
I can't fucking remember what he looks
like a where the wild things are.

1272
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:41,240
I'm one of those things. This
fucking dude came out had,

1273
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:45,770
is at half court, had his back
to the fucking rim, two handed,

1274
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:49,370
threw it over his head without looking
with the mascot shit on and nothing but

1275
01:18:49,371 --> 01:18:52,790
net. All right. And then walked
off the court like it was nothing.

1276
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:55,070
I know he doesn't hit
it every fucking game,

1277
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:56,570
but it was pretty God damn impressive.

1278
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,520
And then later on he comes out on a
fucking drum kit in the goddamn costume.

1279
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,840
It starts jamming with these fucking,
this, this mini drum line killing it.

1280
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:09,410
And as he's fucking killing it
on the drum kit, the drum kit,

1281
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:14,000
I don't know how starts
going around the fucking, uh,

1282
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,360
the mini drum line people.
They're like standing basically.

1283
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:19,280
[inaudible] is where the basketball is.

1284
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:22,370
And then this thing starts revolving
around it like a goddamn planet around the

1285
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:26,800
sun, like very fast, you know,
to the point that, you know,

1286
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,690
almost to the point where he could fucking
fall off and he's still keeping the

1287
01:19:29,691 --> 01:19:33,140
beat. Let's do was the
shit. Um, so anyways,

1288
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,660
how the fuck did I get
into that? Oh, I know.

1289
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:37,310
We're talking sports controversies here.

1290
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,420
So this guy sends me the
sink from England. This is
hilarious. These two guys who,

1291
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:44,000
uh, basically I, as
far as I can tell Dick,

1292
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:48,800
they commentate for the Premiere
League, which is the, uh, the,

1293
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:52,340
the English soccer league over there for
my money. It's the best one out there.

1294
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:57,290
You know, if my little bit of knowledge,
it's just fucking, you know, 150 years,

1295
01:19:57,291 --> 01:19:59,630
a ton of 20,
50 years of tradition with some of these,

1296
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,670
these teams and fans go fucking nuts.
People get trampled to death. It's,

1297
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:06,530
it's everything that you
love about sports, right?

1298
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,700
So evidently these commentators,

1299
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:13,560
um, first of all, they got
busted. They didn't know them.

1300
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:17,310
Mike's were on and they was
shitting on this lady, um,

1301
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:21,030
who was working on the
sidelines, basically. Not even
saying like, like, you know,

1302
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:23,040
I'd love to fucking bang or basically say,

1303
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,840
and she didn't know what
the fuck she was doing.

1304
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,920
They just didn't know that
there. Mike's, we're on. So, uh,

1305
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:32,250
now of course one of them has to step
down and the other ones cast to like,

1306
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:36,080
apologize profusely. Here's basically
what happened. You guys got it.

1307
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,820
I have the youtube videos too. You
got to, you got to watch these things.

1308
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:41,340
They're hilarious. I says,
hey bill, here in England,

1309
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:44,610
there's currently a very funny shit
storm surrounding to Sky Sports.

1310
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:48,510
Premier League broadcasters.
I'm guessing Spa Sky Sports is like their,

1311
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:52,980
their sports channel, ESPN or
something. Um, so anyways, they're raw.

1312
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:57,180
They're in trouble for sexist comments.
They made about a female official.

1313
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:01,680
See I, I mean I only listened to her
once, but I didn't hear them saying like,

1314
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:05,850
Oh look at the tits on her.
They just said that she stunk at her job.

1315
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:07,561
You know,

1316
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:11,730
is it come to that if you just criticize
a woman for doing a job that a guy

1317
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:14,190
usually does it
automatically become sexist.

1318
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:19,280
I don't remember them saying anything
like that. Granted, I'm a fucking moron.

1319
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,163
But uh,

1320
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:25,880
I mean when these guys know who
would know better than these guys,

1321
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,070
these guys are the guys,
right? So anyways, he says,

1322
01:21:28,071 --> 01:21:33,071
a new footage keeps appearing on Youtube
as people seem to be digging up shit on

1323
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:35,834
these guys.

1324
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:40,900
It is well funny as they are a pair of
cozy smug Kuntz who have such great jobs.

1325
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:45,543
Okay.

1326
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:49,710
Yeah. You got to fucking love
English people. Cozy smug cons.

1327
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:54,711
Can you please send me audio of you
saying that and you're fucking accent so I

1328
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:57,030
can play it for my listeners next week.
Cozy,

1329
01:21:57,031 --> 01:22:01,710
smug Kahn who have such great job.
Is that what a cozy smug countries.

1330
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:07,620
What a fucking tremendous description of
some douche who didn't earn his fucking

1331
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:12,570
position sits in a corner
office. Uh, hang on a second.

1332
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:15,430
I got to go talk to that cozy
smug cut down the fucking hall.

1333
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:22,890
Anyways, one has been a one has
been sacked. That means fired. Um,

1334
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,660
conspiracy theory is that it's linked
to the fact that he's suing a sister

1335
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:32,570
company newspaper for phone tapping.
Yeah. I don't know what happened there.

1336
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:34,440
Did someone tap his phone?
I have no idea. But anyways,

1337
01:22:34,441 --> 01:22:38,430
he goes and the other one was eating
his own balls on the radio today.

1338
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,940
Apologizing like mad,
trying to save his career.

1339
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:46,500
I thought this story might appeal to you
as I know you love a good broadcaster,

1340
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:50,880
balls up and a bit of bit of woman
trashing, thrown in for good measure.

1341
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,980
Here are some clips from the story.
Okay.

1342
01:22:52,981 --> 01:22:57,360
So he gives me the clips of them making
sexist comments. I play it for you,

1343
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:58,740
but uh,

1344
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,980
you really as an American got to listen
to it a couple of times to pick up

1345
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:06,850
everything that's say it. Um, cause
they're talking really fast. Um,

1346
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:11,110
but the best thing is he sent me
this other clip and it's the same two

1347
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,660
broadcasters and they're doing,

1348
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,930
they're basically speaking over
highlights of women's soccer,

1349
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,450
which as far as I can tell,

1350
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:24,780
the quality level is the equivalent of
the WWE NBA during the first two weeks

1351
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:27,640
that it came out. Right.
So they start doing,

1352
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,120
they start doing the highlights and these
fucking broads are so bad at play in

1353
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:37,840
football that they just start laughing.
All right.

1354
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:40,540
Do you understand that?
Not in a mean way,

1355
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:45,110
it's what made them laugh
was the level of, of,

1356
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:49,600
or lack of level of quality
of these fucking broads.

1357
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:54,630
The way they were playing the game. They
sucked. You should see this one fucking,

1358
01:23:54,631 --> 01:23:55,930
he got to watch this video.

1359
01:23:55,931 --> 01:24:00,310
I have it up on the [inaudible]
podcast.com this girl, right?

1360
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:03,250
The fucking goalie falls down.
I don't know what happened.

1361
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:06,880
She stepped on the stringer of a
fucking tampons. Sorry, that was mean,

1362
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,690
and she fucking falls down or whatever.

1363
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:14,950
She's horrifically out of position.
So the other girl,

1364
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:20,220
she has basically three quarters of the
net to shoot this little fucking ball

1365
01:24:20,651 --> 01:24:24,490
in. None of those. You don't know
shit about soccer, a goal in soccer.

1366
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:28,960
You could drive three of
those double decker fucking
Red London buses through it.

1367
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,880
So she's got three. You
could drive to fucking buses,
throw it. She kicks the ball.

1368
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:37,360
Somehow she gets underneath it. This
thing, fucking shoots up in the air,

1369
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:42,310
hits underneath the crossbar,
comes back out onto the field of play.

1370
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:45,190
And then because of the,
the, the spin on the ball,

1371
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:50,340
it's somehow by the grace of God
trickles into the fucking net.

1372
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:52,150
It was one of the ugliest goals ever.

1373
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,570
And then the girl starts celebrate and
like she's fucking Paleo or something.

1374
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:59,470
So I think that that was the high, I can't
remember, cause I only watched it once,

1375
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:03,910
these two fucking cozy smug con is
this guy says they start fucking law,

1376
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:08,080
one of them laughs and then the other
one has to continue talking and then he

1377
01:25:08,081 --> 01:25:11,590
starts giggling. Ain't I'll fucking
immature guys. Our next thing you know,

1378
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:15,700
they're laughing their balls off and
you know what was saved their job.

1379
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:19,410
If one of these fucking broads could
actually play soccer and wouldn't,

1380
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:21,610
would stop doing hilarious,

1381
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:25,270
horrific shit on the fucking field or the
pitch or whatever the fuck you call it.

1382
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,920
You know. So these guys got
in trouble for that shit too,

1383
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,130
which is hilarious to me.
And I'm also thinking why?

1384
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:39,300
That's why girls suck at soccer or
football, whatever the fuck you call it.

1385
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:44,990
See if you suck as a guy and guys
laugh at you, you have two choices.

1386
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:49,880
Either get good, so they stop laughing
at you or quit the fucking sport.

1387
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:54,630
You don't have the option to be
that they made. To me, that's,

1388
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:59,210
that's the stop it and then everybody
has to sit around and pretend like you

1389
01:25:59,211 --> 01:26:00,920
don't suck at what you do for a living

1390
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,680
fucking of those broads to get mad.
The fact that that debt debt,

1391
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:11,681
that debt shit is on TV is the level of
play that that actually makes it on TV.

1392
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:17,090
And some guy who's 20 times as good who
can't make it into the premier league is

1393
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:20,210
never going to get on television these
fucking broads get on there. Right.

1394
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:24,800
And that the level of fucking
play that they put that on.

1395
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:28,130
When does that air over there?
Does it come on right after Benny Hill?

1396
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,290
Is it like a comedy Thursday night?

1397
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,833
Yeah.

1398
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,720
I mean the highlight say literally should
have been playing that way and we may

1399
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:39,190
pick at eight eight eight ticket.
They're fucking Kazoo song. So anyways,

1400
01:26:39,191 --> 01:26:41,740
you got to check it out. And
it's a, it's fucking tremendous.

1401
01:26:41,741 --> 01:26:44,560
And I'm not saying that women are
bad athletes, but these women were,

1402
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:46,150
they were horrific.
All right.

1403
01:26:46,151 --> 01:26:50,080
I'm not saying Laila Ali could not beat
the living shit out of me. She could.

1404
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,670
All right.

1405
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:55,480
And you know what I would expect you
guys to do laugh your ass off during the

1406
01:26:55,481 --> 01:26:59,500
highlight of me getting my ass
kicked because I suck at boxing.

1407
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,730
I'm terrible at it. You
know, I got a good temper.

1408
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,380
I'll fucking spazz out and fucking throw
you on the ground if I can, you know,

1409
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:13,450
and start punching you through tears,
you know, that spasm, that type of shit.

1410
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:17,590
That's what I used to do when I was a kid.
But I tried taking boxing. I just, I, I,

1411
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:19,930
I'm, I'm not quick, I just,

1412
01:27:19,931 --> 01:27:23,650
I don't have that quick twitch muscle
fiber at all and I have a huge fucking

1413
01:27:23,651 --> 01:27:28,390
heads. So that's not a good
combination. Slow and having a big head,

1414
01:27:28,391 --> 01:27:29,650
you don't want to get into a boxing ring

1415
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:36,010
anyways. Thank you very much for
sending that. And like I said, yeah,

1416
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:39,100
if you're in any of those, those
countries over there that I, that I go to,

1417
01:27:39,101 --> 01:27:43,360
which is basically London, London,
I'm a moron. England, fucking, uh,

1418
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:47,170
Ireland and Scotland,
please send me some Australia.

1419
01:27:47,171 --> 01:27:51,600
I'm coming your way in any Scandinavian
country, right as far as the rest of you.

1420
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:56,230
Uh, you know, shy man, you got to
fucking comedy zone over there.

1421
01:27:56,231 --> 01:28:00,550
Eventually I'm going to go there and
it's not because I give a fuck about you.

1422
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:03,490
It's because I see what the banks
are doing. They're going global,

1423
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:07,150
they're going global and I'm not going
to get caught flat footed. That's,

1424
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,110
that's my,

1425
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:13,300
that's my exit strategy for
when the shit goes down.

1426
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:14,651
All right.

1427
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:18,070
I'm going to go out to van
Nuys and hopefully have a
fucking private jet by then

1428
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:21,490
and I'm going to, as, as the, the
shit starts burning over here.

1429
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:26,020
I'm going to jump in a God damn plane
and I'm flying to another country and I'm

1430
01:28:26,021 --> 01:28:27,220
going to be booking gigs.
Hey,

1431
01:28:27,221 --> 01:28:30,880
remember me get a mate coming
down for a couple of weeks,

1432
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:37,390
uh, you know, book me in the old fucking
Foster's lager, a fucking comedy tour.

1433
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,320
Goddamn bullshit.
The depth charge level beer.

1434
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,520
Evidently none of them drink it
over there. Um, oh, by the way,

1435
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:48,940
thanks for Rupert Murdoch. All right,
thank you. Thank you very much.

1436
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:54,400
Jesus Christ. I thought you
guys were cool over there. Um,

1437
01:28:55,120 --> 01:29:00,070
you know, Rupert Murdoch is such a
Douche. She almost negates ACDC. Okay.

1438
01:29:00,071 --> 01:29:01,970
There's a fucking statement.
You all

1439
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,380
right, let's, let's go
onto the next topic here.

1440
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:09,150
I have a splitting fucking headache.
Um, Oh, here you get a headache.

1441
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:12,480
You can feel your heartbeat
and your ears. Um, all right.

1442
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,730
Oh, here we go. Here's a new topic. This
topic really took off, uh, this past week.

1443
01:29:17,731 --> 01:29:22,500
The new topic is this racist,
racist, racist, racist.

1444
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,270
Uh, last week, uh,

1445
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:28,650
we had some people are
asking some questions and I
can't fucking remember what

1446
01:29:28,651 --> 01:29:29,484
the hell they were.

1447
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:34,140
I remember I was saying when I drive
down the street and somebody cuts me off,

1448
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:38,190
I play a game out here in Los Angeles,
a game called a older Asian.

1449
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,650
And the person I'm writing with,
we both have to guess.

1450
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:45,450
One person picks all the other
person picks Asian, you know,

1451
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,750
and then you pull up alongside and
you'd take a look. And I swear to God,

1452
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:52,290
nine times out of 10 it's
one of the other, you know?

1453
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,080
And if it's all Dan Asian,

1454
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:57,840
that's like hitting the green
double zero in fucking roulette.

1455
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:02,430
Nobody wins unless you picked it,
unless you said Old Asian. All right.

1456
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:05,000
So I just be like, is that fucking
racist? Right? Never deadly.

1457
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,210
Somebody chimed in the last week,

1458
01:30:06,211 --> 01:30:10,500
he said it's actually racist
and a just to say that.

1459
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:17,010
So yeah. So I guess I have a racist age
escape. But let me ask you this. Um,

1460
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,310
what about the factor that
it's just me and my car?

1461
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:24,090
Aren't you allowed to say
fucked up shit in your car?

1462
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:27,870
Doesn't everybody's sort of become like
Michael Douglas and falling down when

1463
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:31,560
you get in your car? Don't you say
fucked up shit. And when I say don't you,

1464
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:36,070
I mean everybody, not just white
people come on black people.

1465
01:30:36,071 --> 01:30:40,690
You know what you say about us?
Ah, you know what you say Mexicans.

1466
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:44,260
Huh? You know what you say?
Everybody knows what they say.

1467
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:47,560
Everybody says this
stuff. Samoans, come on.

1468
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:53,710
You know what you say when you're out
there fucking tackle in a tree and turn it

1469
01:30:53,711 --> 01:30:57,130
in into a fucking surf board. Right?
Isn't that what you guys do? I,

1470
01:30:57,131 --> 01:30:59,410
those are the toughest fucking
people on the planet. I mean,

1471
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,920
my whole knowledge of Samoans is
basically professional wrestling,

1472
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,160
USC football and uh,
that dude on the Steelers,

1473
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:12,240
I've just never seen a
fucking pussy who's a Samoa.

1474
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:17,380
They just, you know, those are like the
actual, the real three hundreds people,

1475
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:20,950
you know, except they're
not in the snow. You know,

1476
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:25,150
they are a bunch of fatty, so why don't
they do a Samoan fucking biggest loser?

1477
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,810
That would be the shit. Some fat fucking
Samoa Dude. You bring them in there,

1478
01:31:34,811 --> 01:31:38,290
you get them into insane shape.
And then at the end of the show,

1479
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,660
rather than winning like 200,000,

1480
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:45,220
they just get drafted into the NFL and
they become millionaires. Look at that.

1481
01:31:45,221 --> 01:31:49,870
See that people, that's why I moved
out to la because I could just,

1482
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:53,740
I can create a show out enough to get,
get it on the fucking air,

1483
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,270
but I can create one. Yes, I am deadly.

1484
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:01,060
That is cryptic talk and I'm not to
talk about that failure in my career.

1485
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:05,220
All right, let's plow ahead. Uh,
so here we go. Is this racist? Uh,

1486
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,071
Mr. Question I have,

1487
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:10,060
is it racist for me to root for a white
running back at this point? You know,

1488
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:14,740
considering the last good one was like
Jim Kick and Larry's Aka John Reagan's

1489
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:19,270
right. Who's the last that's a cook.
I don't know the answer to this.

1490
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:22,660
Who was the last white dude
to win the rushing title?

1491
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,420
All right,
let me think here.

1492
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:31,170
It's definitely nobody and I
mean nobody before Walter Payton,

1493
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:37,570
there is no fucking way.
It was Walter Peyton was in the league.

1494
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,330
Earl Campbell then came,

1495
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,320
Billy Sims stick then came
into the fucking league.

1496
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:48,760
It was always guys and those
guys who were were just,

1497
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,850
they weren't leading the league, but they
was still killing it. Like Joe Cribbs.

1498
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:54,580
You remember him?
Who else?

1499
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,900
John Riggins was around them,
but I don't think maybe the strike season.

1500
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:03,410
Did he win it?
Who else came after that?

1501
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:08,270
George Rogers. Oh, Oj
Anderson. Tony Doerr sad.

1502
01:33:08,271 --> 01:33:13,271
How the fuck di Franco
Harris Rick up church now.

1503
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:17,820
He wasn't really, wasn't running
back. Wilbert Montgomery.

1504
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,650
I've gone right through all the fucking
teams. They all had f chuck Muncie.

1505
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:28,540
And you're fired. Jeff. Roger
Craig. Yeah. There was no way,

1506
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:31,600
but they had that cycle white dude
who was fucking awesome on that team.

1507
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:34,810
I forget his name, but he wasn't leading
the league. Who's the last guy? All right,

1508
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:39,280
let's go pre that. And he got
who? Floyd little gale sayers.

1509
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:43,140
We're getting back to then
Jesus Christ

1510
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:49,500
as a white running back. Ever done
it. I don't even fucking know.

1511
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,050
So that's what I'm saying.
You know, it's like, uh,

1512
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:55,540
it's like what black people root for
like a black quarterback. I'll let go.

1513
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:59,170
I'll all the fucking Asian people
freak out. Uh, when, uh, her decky met,

1514
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,380
he came to town,
you know,

1515
01:34:01,381 --> 01:34:04,920
and all of a sudden they give a shit
about the Yankees because they could,

1516
01:34:04,921 --> 01:34:07,310
they got it. They got one of their
guys on there because there's not,

1517
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,050
there's not a lot of Asian guys
in the major league baseball.

1518
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:15,870
I didn't look at them like
they were racist. So can I,

1519
01:34:15,871 --> 01:34:20,130
can I be excited about that fucking white
dude who runs for the Cleveland Browns?

1520
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:24,090
Where's that face mask? It looks like
the front of a dodge ram truck. Huh?

1521
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,090
Let me know. Answer that question. I'm
gonna ask you, I'm going to fucking,

1522
01:34:27,091 --> 01:34:30,300
I'm going to work out all my
bullshit on this podcast. All right?

1523
01:34:30,301 --> 01:34:33,990
Seven deadly older Asian
is ageist and racist.

1524
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,880
That doesn't mean I'm
going to stop doing it.

1525
01:34:35,881 --> 01:34:38,850
There's no hate in my heart when I do it.
You know,

1526
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:42,650
they're gonna be justifying,
um,

1527
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:45,180
as I sit on a fucking bed
with white sheets on it

1528
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:52,140
for comfort, okay? There's none with holes
in it. I'm not putting it on my head.

1529
01:34:52,141 --> 01:34:56,480
All right, so relax. All
right, here we go. Uh,

1530
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,270
this is coming from Japan,
but these are actually our troops.

1531
01:34:59,271 --> 01:35:02,540
We have troops spaced over there cause
we're making sure that no one takes the

1532
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:06,140
Japanese people's freedom.
That's what we do. We just,

1533
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:10,940
we were so concerned about everybody's
freedom around the world that we, uh,

1534
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:15,080
we muscle our way in and we put a base
there that's like our Starbucks for the

1535
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:19,100
world. We put a base there and we just
make sure that everybody's all Hunky Dory

1536
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:23,960
looking out for your best interests.
Um,

1537
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:29,450
AH, fuck. Am I getting
sick? Okay. Hey Bill,

1538
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:34,730
your is it racist segment segment was
the source of much comedy and pain

1539
01:35:34,731 --> 01:35:38,060
yesterday for us out
here stationed in Japan.

1540
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:42,470
Racism is always a source of a headache
and particularly in the military where

1541
01:35:42,471 --> 01:35:47,120
great lengths are taken to ensure, uh,
that it's not tolerated at all. Well,

1542
01:35:47,121 --> 01:35:51,410
that's great. That's a good thing. Uh,
for the most part, they do a great job.

1543
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:53,780
Of course is always going
to be idiots everywhere.

1544
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:57,890
But here's a funny thing that happened
involved involving your previous podcast.

1545
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:03,440
Somehow I'm fucking implicated halfway
across the world. Oh, here we go.

1546
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:07,550
So I'm listening to your podcast,
admittedly inappropriately at work.

1547
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:12,530
And My coworker who's also
black. All right, let's stop.
Let's look at the stats.

1548
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:15,320
This is a black guy and he's
hanging out with another black guy.

1549
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,290
Nobody get nervous.
Uh,

1550
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:23,330
and my coworker who was also black
and I are laughing at your crazy ass.

1551
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,320
Now this guy's definitely black cause I
that how white did that sound coming out

1552
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:31,490
of my voice out of my mouth. I
mean out of my voice. Sorry people.

1553
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:35,420
I'm laughing at your crazy ass.
Yo,

1554
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,690
you did the Dilbert though.

1555
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:42,060
But the other thing about the Indian
reading from one of your fans letters, uh,

1556
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:46,370
so my guy is like, yeah, that
shit is racist. And uh, you know,

1557
01:36:46,371 --> 01:36:51,200
he's going to get an email from some
idiot asking his boy like, click, click,

1558
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:52,610
click racist bill.
I Dunno.

1559
01:36:52,611 --> 01:36:56,120
I Dunno what the fuck that is at some sort
of African accent. He goes, I mean, oh,

1560
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,560
I keep fucking that thing up.

1561
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,650
I actually did this podcast the
other day and I messed that up.

1562
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:05,060
Let me just read this entire quote. I'm
going to read it as white as possible. Uh,

1563
01:37:05,061 --> 01:37:09,890
so my, my friend whose African American
said, yeah, that shit is racist. You know,

1564
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:13,970
he's going to get an email from some idiot
asking, is bullae bullae click, click,

1565
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:18,680
click racist bill. I mean, I
know I'm not racist, so I dunno,

1566
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:23,090
I just don't know.
Um,

1567
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,111
here's where it goes.

1568
01:37:24,111 --> 01:37:28,970
Twilight zone or woman passing by in
the hallway was evidently offended by my

1569
01:37:28,971 --> 01:37:32,840
coworkers. Insensitive and
oppression of African dialect.

1570
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:37,460
So that is African. All right. [inaudible]

1571
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:42,320
I'm like that Shaka Zulu. Right. Um,

1572
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,911
so she will,

1573
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:47,360
this coworkers just walking by is this
dude's talking about my podcast and she

1574
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:51,290
gets offended by the black guys.
Impression of an African.

1575
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:56,130
Alright. It's evidently it's a
white lady who gets offended.

1576
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,420
He tried to explain to her that he was
using it as an example and even offered

1577
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:03,810
to play back the portion of
the podcast that it applied to,

1578
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:08,820
but it seemed a bit like
she was determined to take
advantage of this situation

1579
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:12,420
to make some sort of point.
So picture this visual bill,

1580
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:17,100
a white woman is sitting there preparing
a statement about a black guy making

1581
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:21,330
racist comments about black people
in front of another black guy,

1582
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:26,360
myself and all of this being presented
to this section commander who happens to

1583
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:28,770
be Japanese American.

1584
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:34,890
I guess I'm sitting there
as a witness biting my lip,

1585
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:39,150
trying not to laugh because I swear
I could see on the commanders face,

1586
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:43,280
he was like, dear baby Jesus,
what the fuck is going on her?

1587
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:44,910
Um,

1588
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:49,290
like he was trying to blink himself out
of the room and this entire situation.

1589
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:53,010
So we'll see where this goes
in the upcoming weeks. Um,

1590
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,820
he sent me another email and
the, uh, the commander there,

1591
01:38:56,821 --> 01:39:00,660
the Japanese American commander told
the African American to handle it within

1592
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,550
his, uh, he just handled
himself with the, uh,

1593
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,560
Caucasian American. There was that
politically correct enough? Um,

1594
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:12,840
you hit it on the head in
your last podcast as far as
it's what's in your heart

1595
01:39:12,841 --> 01:39:17,070
most times in regards to whether or not
something is racist. Uh, people know,

1596
01:39:17,071 --> 01:39:20,700
fuck all that. Oh, I
was not aware. Shit. Uh,

1597
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:25,110
if you say something or do something and
then you wonder if it's racist or not,

1598
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,330
chances are it probably is.

1599
01:39:27,331 --> 01:39:30,630
Slash was if the first thing
that comes out of your mouth is,

1600
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,610
I'm not a racist or anything,

1601
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:37,680
but I already know I'm in
for some bullshit. This, uh,

1602
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:40,920
the saying that anything you
say, oh, what's that saying?

1603
01:39:40,921 --> 01:39:44,640
Anything you say before the word
but is automatically racist.

1604
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:47,730
And that is true at least 98% of the time.

1605
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:52,410
And nowadays the Internet has just given
people mostly idiots and cowards of

1606
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:57,300
voice of anonymity for shit like
that. Yeah. That's something I really,

1607
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:02,360
I is really depressing is the fucking
level of a racist comments on fucking

1608
01:40:04,261 --> 01:40:07,950
youtube. Like that Pussy Shit
where no one can see you.

1609
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:13,170
No one can get you and you talking all
that fucking shit. And uh, I dunno.

1610
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:17,190
That's depressing. That is really
depressing. Anyways, uh, on the flip side,

1611
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:21,450
this is the shit some black
people say about any other race.

1612
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:25,320
Ah, Shit. Sorry. I was doing really
well reading out loud this week.

1613
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:28,320
Let me blow through this last paragraph.
I swear to God and I'll end the torture.

1614
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:32,970
Uh, on the flip side is this shit some
black say about any other race offensive.

1615
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:38,010
Oh, that's not my fault. He
wrote that about any other
race, offensive and racist.

1616
01:40:38,011 --> 01:40:41,790
Of course. Anyone that says no
is being an idiot. I'm a realist.

1617
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:43,950
It's why I don't tolerate any extra hip.

1618
01:40:43,951 --> 01:40:47,100
I grew up around black guys and
I have an Nwa cassette tape,

1619
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,500
white guys saying the n word around me.

1620
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,490
It's also why you never hear me say
cracker or any other ethnic even in just,

1621
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:58,060
um, so anyways, he's
got a question. He said,

1622
01:40:58,061 --> 01:41:02,230
is it racist when you hear a story about
an athlete shooting someone in a strip

1623
01:41:02,231 --> 01:41:06,520
club and you assume you know
what color he was maybe to sub,

1624
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:07,601
is it racist?

1625
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:11,770
When I hear about a polar bear slapping
the shit out of someone's kid or a video

1626
01:41:11,771 --> 01:41:13,810
of a guy shitting in a girl's mouth.

1627
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:17,920
And I'm pretty sure I know what
color all of those people are not.

1628
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:25,660
Oh, I'm pretty sure I know what color all
of those people are not. Um, just my two,

1629
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:29,770
2 cents. Well, thank
you for chiming it. Um,

1630
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:33,760
that's funny that you bring up that whole
new story because someone else wrote

1631
01:41:33,761 --> 01:41:38,560
in to ask me if they thought that this,
if this was like a racist game, they said,

1632
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:38,741
Bill,

1633
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:42,760
I like to play a little game similar to
your Asian or old person driving game,

1634
01:41:42,761 --> 01:41:45,130
except my game involves
in the evening news,

1635
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:50,290
it's called beaner black guy or
crazy ass cracker. Just to clarify,

1636
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:53,150
I am Hispanic parentheses,
Latino, Mexican,

1637
01:41:53,151 --> 01:41:55,930
and whatever other dumb ass
term someone has come up with.

1638
01:41:55,931 --> 01:41:58,030
So saying beaner is okay,

1639
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:01,090
Satan now this is why I
wanted to do this segment.

1640
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:05,530
This is the exact fucking reason. Okay.
He says, beaner black guy in cracker,

1641
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:08,560
all right. And he goes, I could
say beaner because I'm Mexican.

1642
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,220
Well then why can you say
cracker ass cracker, right?

1643
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:16,210
It's cause I'm white and no one gives a
fuck about that one. See what I'm saying?

1644
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:21,520
This is something that I learned from
doing stand up in front of all different

1645
01:42:21,521 --> 01:42:24,820
kinds of people. That's what I learned.
I learned that everybody, basically,

1646
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,450
it's not that they're selfish, they, they
just, they look out of their own head.

1647
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:32,110
You can't help but do that. So you just
see shit from your own perspective.

1648
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:36,940
Like one night I was doing this gig right
down at the old Boston Comedy Club in

1649
01:42:36,941 --> 01:42:41,620
New York City. And one of the acts
that was going up was this, uh,

1650
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:44,890
was this, I think I told
this story before, it was a,

1651
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:48,610
it was a comedy team as
this Asian Guy and girl.

1652
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,420
And they went up there and they
did this fucking rap. Okay.

1653
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,320
And they went up there and they stuck
their teeth out like they had buck teeth.

1654
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,041
And then they put,
you know,

1655
01:42:57,041 --> 01:43:00,250
those glasses that you can put on those
joke ones that make your eyes look Asian.

1656
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,970
They had though they're Asian
and yet they still put those on.

1657
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:09,150
And then the other guy had on a fake
gold chain with a fucking fortune cookie

1658
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,890
hanging off the thick.

1659
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,790
So I'm sitting there looking at it
before they're going up going, oh man,

1660
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:19,330
this isn't going to fly. This isn't
going to fly with this fucking crowd.

1661
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:24,730
This is basically, uh,
what do you call that shit?

1662
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:27,970
What did, what was that shit back
in the day? An old time, Hollywood,

1663
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:31,750
it was almost like Asian black face.
Like what they were doing was fucking,

1664
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:33,970
was ridiculous. I was thinking
that black people watching it,

1665
01:43:33,971 --> 01:43:34,810
we're going to be like,

1666
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,520
just all the shit that they'd been through
would look at and be like, what the,

1667
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,740
why are they these fucking, why are
they selling out their own fucking race?

1668
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:46,840
This is horrific. This is fucking
horrific. And they didn't,

1669
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:51,920
that act went up there and they fucking
destroyed and everybody laughed at balls

1670
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:54,980
off. They thought the fortune
cookie thing was fucking hilarious.

1671
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:57,580
And I was just like, yeah,
that people, I don't know.

1672
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:59,270
Maybe it's cause they're
shitting on their own race.

1673
01:43:59,271 --> 01:44:01,130
What the fuck you supposed to do?
I don't know.

1674
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:05,090
I just found that shit fascinating. So
what does that pertain to? What the fuck?

1675
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:08,150
I just said, I don't know if it's cold
medicines kicking in. Let me finish this.

1676
01:44:08,151 --> 01:44:12,860
So anyways, this is basically
what this guy does. He says, uh,

1677
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:17,350
J uh, just to clarify,
so the deputy, okay,

1678
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:20,450
now this game started because I hate
watching the news and no matter what I'm

1679
01:44:20,451 --> 01:44:25,020
watching sports center, usually my
wife will want to change it. Um,

1680
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:27,560
so naturally being the asshole that I am,

1681
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:31,550
I had to figure out a way to ruin it for,
um,

1682
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:36,230
so what I do is turn away from the news
whenever they begin beginning explaining

1683
01:44:36,231 --> 01:44:40,520
the crimes are events of the day based
on the description of the crime or event

1684
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:42,860
and how it was committed or performed.

1685
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:47,540
I yell either beaner black
guy or crazy ass cracker.

1686
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,980
Do that. She sounds like a fun fucking
game. Well, I would say crazy ass cracker.

1687
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:54,710
I would just say fucking white dude.
Um,

1688
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:58,850
example news reports says what
I say. Beaner no, I wouldn't.

1689
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:04,340
That's one of the worst ones ever.
Beaner it's got no ring.

1690
01:45:04,341 --> 01:45:08,620
It's got no flow. That must have been
a bad day with white people. You know,

1691
01:45:08,621 --> 01:45:11,420
usually we're a lot more
creative than that, you know,

1692
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:15,020
named me after a fucking vegetable.
Is it a vegetable? Is it a fruit?

1693
01:45:15,021 --> 01:45:19,550
What the fuck is it? I don't
fucking, anyways, it's plow
ahead. Example News report.

1694
01:45:19,551 --> 01:45:22,460
It says a man was stabbed
and I yell out beaner.

1695
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:27,020
I know it's a beaner because we Mexicans
can't afford guns and still pay for our

1696
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:31,250
legal extended family members. We have
living with us and our two bedroom house.

1697
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:36,260
If the news report says a drive by
shooting, I yell Black Guy. Come on.

1698
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:40,010
Do I really have to explain the reason
behind that one and of course if I hear

1699
01:45:40,011 --> 01:45:43,490
the suspect had body parts of
his victims in the refrigerator,

1700
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:45,740
fucking crazy ass cracker.

1701
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:49,580
It's because of this game that my wife
has stopped watching the news altogether

1702
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:53,300
and I now have peace and quiet
to enjoy my top plays of the day.

1703
01:45:53,301 --> 01:45:57,040
Fix On sports center. Well
good for you. Good for you.

1704
01:45:57,041 --> 01:46:01,520
Now see that's something I don't, I don't
think that that's racist because what?

1705
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,850
You don't have any hatred
towards any of those groups.

1706
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:09,960
What you're doing is you're actually,
you don't want to watch the news.

1707
01:46:09,961 --> 01:46:10,920
It's fucking depressing.

1708
01:46:10,921 --> 01:46:15,210
You want to watch sports and then she
puts on a bunch of depressing shit and

1709
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:16,051
what are you going to do,

1710
01:46:16,051 --> 01:46:19,230
sit there and get depressed or are you
going to fucking entertain yourself?

1711
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:23,880
So you turn it into a fucking game?
It's actually a, uh, you know,

1712
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:25,890
I'm not offended by it.

1713
01:46:25,891 --> 01:46:28,920
I think that's fucking funny and
there's a lot of truth to it.

1714
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:33,510
Much as I hate to admit some
of the shit we're fucking

1715
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:39,690
body parts, those scat
videos, I don't think,

1716
01:46:39,691 --> 01:46:43,350
I've never seen a black guy in a scat
video. Not that I've fucking, you know,

1717
01:46:43,351 --> 01:46:44,250
watch those things.

1718
01:46:44,251 --> 01:46:49,251
But I have done the opiate Anthony show
and occasionally a weird video come up.

1719
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:54,610
Ah,

1720
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:58,960
Jesus. I have scar tissue in my brain
from that show a couple of times.

1721
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:02,560
They had, they brought up one video one
time. I'm not even going to describe it.

1722
01:47:02,561 --> 01:47:07,200
I just refuse to watch it and it still
haunts me and I never even fucking sought.

1723
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:12,910
Um, and I'm not talking about two girls
in one cup because I did see that one.

1724
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:17,800
But they had another one where a guy
had a jar and he did something with that

1725
01:47:17,801 --> 01:47:22,780
jar that you didn't think was natural.
He somehow did it. And then the,

1726
01:47:22,781 --> 01:47:26,200
uh, I'm gonna use an
engineering term here. The,

1727
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:28,940
the structure failed.

1728
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,890
The structure failed.
Uh,

1729
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:42,520
the outside pressure was too much for
the structure and at which point it

1730
01:47:42,591 --> 01:47:47,360
reached a breaking point and it
failed the job. Broken the dude's ass.

1731
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:48,933
Okay.

1732
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:55,330
And I refuse to look at the video and
all I heard was everybody else in the

1733
01:47:55,331 --> 01:48:00,331
video screaming in horror as this guy
tried to avoid a trip and embarrassing

1734
01:48:00,761 --> 01:48:05,500
trip to the emergency room and clear
up the situation himself. All right,

1735
01:48:05,501 --> 01:48:05,951
I'm sorry.

1736
01:48:05,951 --> 01:48:08,470
This is what are the most disgusting
things I've ever described in the podcast.

1737
01:48:08,471 --> 01:48:13,000
Let's plow ahead. Um, oh, here's a
guy responding to they did. But Dubbo,

1738
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:17,530
um, is that racist? Um, anyways, so yeah,

1739
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:21,310
Indians aren't big white people fans
because the British controlled their

1740
01:48:21,311 --> 01:48:24,610
country for hundreds of years.
See that once again. See,

1741
01:48:24,611 --> 01:48:28,480
we all can make ignorant statements.
So then you should hate the English.

1742
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:33,110
Why do you hate all white people?
See that we're all just as dumb.

1743
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:39,040
Oh God damn it. This, this is,
this is enjoyable. All right.
It's plow ahead here. Um,

1744
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:42,380
you know what some English guy said to
me the other day, I was out in Dallas.

1745
01:48:42,381 --> 01:48:46,000
This guy from Manchester was fucking
hilarious. He said to me, uh,

1746
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:51,290
I was talking about the
fucking revolutionary war
and I wasn't even trash in

1747
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:54,680
England. And when I brought
up the revolutionary war,
he goes, oh yeah. He goes,

1748
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:58,080
he goes, how's that tax free
country working out for you?

1749
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:02,563
Okay.

1750
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:06,650
Oh, that was such a fucking
good one. I was, I had nothing
to say. I was like, yeah,

1751
01:49:06,651 --> 01:49:10,310
you absolutely fucking right. The rich
people fucking stirred up the morons.

1752
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:14,480
They kicked the fucking British out
and then the rich people just picked up

1753
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:18,410
where the British left off
evidently. Alright. Plowing
ahead. Uh, Indians racist.

1754
01:49:18,411 --> 01:49:19,520
All right. Anyways, bills. So yeah,

1755
01:49:19,521 --> 01:49:22,520
Indians aren't big white people fans
because the British controlled their

1756
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:26,750
country for hundreds of years,
even as much as I gave you
shit. I understand that.

1757
01:49:26,751 --> 01:49:31,310
So if you see me getting off the boat
with my fucking God damn red hair, right?

1758
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:34,640
You just think that I'm another God damn
person coming over there to fuck over

1759
01:49:34,641 --> 01:49:36,440
your country. I get that. He says,

1760
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:40,460
the worst part is that it was
a company that ruled them.

1761
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:45,520
The British east Indian India trading
company pretty much controlled the country

1762
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:49,480
using soldiers to keep
the Indians in line.

1763
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:54,870
There was at least one really bad massacre
where in a British general had his

1764
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:59,170
troops opened fire on a group of,
and I don't know how to say this,

1765
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:00,970
I'm not going to disrespect these people.

1766
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:05,380
S I k h s is that seeks,
I have no idea.

1767
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:07,830
I'm just, okay, so you
opened up at a fire of these,

1768
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:11,500
a group of these people
just for being in a group,

1769
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:15,730
something like 2000 people died,
including many women and children.

1770
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:18,940
Then Gandhi came and
peacefully drove the Brits out.

1771
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:23,470
Just thought I'd let you know,
Dude, you are just like me.

1772
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:26,770
You overheard that shit or
you read about it 20 years.

1773
01:50:26,771 --> 01:50:31,690
That was the most vague description of
a horrific vent I think I've ever read.

1774
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:33,810
Okay.

1775
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:38,100
There was at least one really bad massacre
where a British general had a troops

1776
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,980
opened, fire on a group, a group,

1777
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:46,440
and like 2000 people died. Let me ask you
guys, other guys have question here. The,

1778
01:50:46,441 --> 01:50:47,730
all the people listening to this podcast,

1779
01:50:47,731 --> 01:50:52,140
when you think of a group of people at
what number do you stop calling it a

1780
01:50:52,141 --> 01:50:54,060
group before it becomes a crowd?

1781
01:50:55,290 --> 01:50:55,930
Yeah.

1782
01:50:55,930 --> 01:51:00,030
You know, before it just becomes mass
fucking murder. I mean, for me, uh,

1783
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:05,080
a group of people's about seven or eight,
you get up to around 15.

1784
01:51:05,081 --> 01:51:09,880
That's a crowd. 2000 fucking people.
Are you referring to the, uh,

1785
01:51:09,881 --> 01:51:11,410
I actually read a little bit about that.

1786
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:16,740
I bought this book on a Winston Churchill
and Gandhi because I wanted to read

1787
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:20,740
about some of the history other than the
same fucking stories that they gave me.

1788
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:26,340
It's like church, you know,
I heard all, all of Jesus.

1789
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:29,410
They read Jesus his diary to me
for the first 17 years of my life.

1790
01:51:29,411 --> 01:51:33,580
I've got fucking tired of it. I wanted
to read something else. So I read. Yeah,

1791
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:38,290
there was, it was a lot worse than that.
Something. I remember reading about this.

1792
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:40,300
I'm going to give you a vague
description of what I remember.

1793
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:42,010
This is classic for my podcast,

1794
01:51:42,011 --> 01:51:44,170
cause nobody knows what the fuck
they're talking about. See this,

1795
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:48,980
this is how we're all
coming together. Um, yeah,

1796
01:51:48,981 --> 01:51:53,510
the British were fucking over the Indian
people and Indian people did something.

1797
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:58,760
They finally fucking snapped and they
went off and they did something really

1798
01:51:58,761 --> 01:52:03,620
violent to, uh, some of the
British people who were over there,

1799
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:07,750
including women and
children, I believe. And uh,

1800
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:11,030
they went say, you know,
we'll say one to 10 evil.

1801
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:15,080
They went about five. And
then England said, Oh yeah,

1802
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:17,000
we'll fucking show you what Eagle Evil is.

1803
01:52:17,001 --> 01:52:19,100
And then they came back and they went 15,
and they were like,

1804
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:23,000
fucking burning people alive. They just
went around just, just shooting everybody.

1805
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:28,160
Um, which is what you have to do
when you fuck an occupy a country,

1806
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:30,830
you have to commit fucking genocide.
That's the only way,

1807
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:33,530
which is why you shouldn't do it.
You know?

1808
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:39,300
It's why you shouldn't fucking invade
another country because they ain't fucking

1809
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:43,080
leaving, played fucking leave.
And so I don't know what the fuck.

1810
01:52:43,081 --> 01:52:46,250
You know what this is like? That's part
of a whole nother big a discussion.

1811
01:52:46,251 --> 01:52:47,750
I shouldn't even a fucking brought it up.

1812
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:51,140
But the only occupation I've ever seen
that ever fucking work was in this

1813
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:51,974
country.

1814
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:55,940
And the reason why it worked was because
we weren't leaving and we fucking

1815
01:52:55,941 --> 01:53:00,500
committed genocide that Ciri.
And I'm not for that on any fucking level,

1816
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:05,650
which is why when I look around the
world and I see certain people in certain

1817
01:53:05,691 --> 01:53:09,860
areas, I'm not surprised with
what the fuck's going down.

1818
01:53:09,861 --> 01:53:14,120
Cause that's what always goes down.
It's what always fucking goes down.

1819
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:20,120
It's fucking, uh, I dunno.
It's fucking, it's evil.

1820
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:24,430
It's pure fucking evil. Um, so anyways,
uh, youtube videos of this week, then,

1821
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,330
you know, some, a lot of that
stuff deserved a lot of justice.

1822
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:29,690
I'm a lot more justice than emphasis
for a little under the weather here. Uh,

1823
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:34,430
youtube videos of the week, um,
kid dunks himself, you know,

1824
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:38,360
those douchebags who come out on the
court after the black guys of all fucking

1825
01:53:38,361 --> 01:53:41,690
dunk from the foul line and the white
guys come out with trampolines to try to

1826
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:44,060
roughly duplicate what you just saw.

1827
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:50,960
This fucking kid. He jumps too high
and he goes through the fucking hoop.

1828
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:53,510
I got to give it up to the
kid though, man. He fucking,

1829
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:55,280
he didn't go right through the hoop.

1830
01:53:55,281 --> 01:53:58,010
He was part of the way through the hoop
when he realized that there was someone

1831
01:53:58,011 --> 01:54:01,760
coming behind them. So rather than
fucking try to go out again, he just,

1832
01:54:01,761 --> 01:54:06,020
he just went right through the hoop,
was a very heads up fucking play. Um,

1833
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,880
funny video,
all this one's great,

1834
01:54:07,881 --> 01:54:11,690
funny video making fun of Lebron
commercial with Brett Farve.

1835
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:17,060
Um, this fucking guy in this
video doing Brett Farve. He,

1836
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,880
not only does he look like him,
not only does he sound like him,

1837
01:54:19,881 --> 01:54:24,590
he even even gets the facial expressions
down of Brett Farve. It's fucking great.

1838
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:29,600
Um, and I made fun of Djs last week. So
this guy sent me a DJ video to watch.

1839
01:54:29,601 --> 01:54:34,190
It's called, uh, from Kid Koala. Skanky.
Pankey. I get it. It takes a lot of skill,

1840
01:54:34,191 --> 01:54:39,110
but I don't ever want to listen to
it again. Um, oh. And then somebody,

1841
01:54:39,111 --> 01:54:43,790
a few about a month ago, I talked
about drop d tuning, how that was a,

1842
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:47,840
that's how you make the devil. Your bitch
is you write a song and drop d tuning.

1843
01:54:47,841 --> 01:54:51,440
And I've never heard a song that did that,
that sounded bad in drop d tuning.

1844
01:54:51,441 --> 01:54:54,260
So he sent me another video
of a great song and drop d,

1845
01:54:54,261 --> 01:54:58,070
which is a nirvana negative creep.
I guess it's in that. I didn't,

1846
01:54:58,071 --> 01:55:01,850
I didn't fucking look. Let's get to
overrated. Underrated. All right,

1847
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:06,590
this fucking podcast. What the Hell is
going on here? What are we up to here?

1848
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:11,060
Hour and six minutes. Jesus, let's wrap
this up. Let's go real quick here. Uh,

1849
01:55:11,061 --> 01:55:12,320
underrated local bands.

1850
01:55:12,321 --> 01:55:16,340
They're always way more talented than
actually and actually write and play their

1851
01:55:16,341 --> 01:55:20,330
own music that should be heard.
Instead of all the popular lady Gaga,

1852
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:23,930
Beyonce bullshit. Go out to a bar
and enjoy the live music. I agree.

1853
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:27,470
Overrated horoscopes,
whore a scopes.

1854
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:31,950
Why do people think that some asshole
interprets the planets and stars and stars

1855
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,360
position is a good flow
influence on their lives.

1856
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:39,680
You could literally say whatever you
want as a justification for your actions.

1857
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:44,790
I'm not as slot. I'm a Scorpio and
Venus is aligned with the Milky Way.

1858
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:49,050
No, you're a slut because you
fuck a lot of people. All right.

1859
01:55:49,051 --> 01:55:53,040
Stop blaming the heavens. You
count. Um, all the people, um,

1860
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:56,340
who freaked out because they thought
their horoscope was different due to the

1861
01:55:56,341 --> 01:55:58,980
new 13th sign can shut the fuck up.

1862
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:02,910
If you read further than one paragraph,
you discover your sign is different.

1863
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:06,540
If you were born when they announced it.
Um,

1864
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:09,540
I don't even know what the fuck that
means. I know recently that they, uh,

1865
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:12,390
somebody tried to say that everybody's
signed was wrong and I guess people freak

1866
01:56:12,391 --> 01:56:17,070
the fuck out. Um, oh,
here's another racist one.

1867
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:20,280
God Damn it. I'm going to read this next
week. Everybody chimed in on that topic.

1868
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:24,510
Do you guys have time to listen to me?
Give somebody some of my bad advice. Well,

1869
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:26,790
of course you do. If you doubt,
just shut the fucking thing off.

1870
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:31,590
I'm not holding you hostage.
Uh, let's see here at bill.

1871
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:36,000
Uh Oh, this guys says bill loved the
podcast. She always answering questions,

1872
01:56:36,450 --> 01:56:39,570
giving out relationship advice about,
you know, between men and women.

1873
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:44,571
So I figured I'd switch it up here and
actually ask for your advice about a band

1874
01:56:44,641 --> 01:56:46,410
situation.
I'm pretty drunk,

1875
01:56:46,411 --> 01:56:50,280
so I apologize in advance if
my punctuation is incorrect.

1876
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:54,150
I joined an established band on base
about three months ago and spent the first

1877
01:56:54,151 --> 01:56:58,770
couple of weeks busting my hump learning
tunes to open for a semi well known nae

1878
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:03,990
nae national touring band. Since
then, I burned about three dozen saw.

1879
01:57:03,991 --> 01:57:06,870
I've learned about three dozen songs
in gigged once or twice a week.

1880
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,950
Some of them were high
profile shows opening for,

1881
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:15,140
for some semi famous bands in theaters
seeding a thousand to 1200 people.

1882
01:57:15,271 --> 01:57:16,710
It's been a good instead of work,

1883
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:20,400
but I should have known that there
was a catch after the fifth gig.

1884
01:57:20,401 --> 01:57:24,360
I finally said, dude, what the fuck's
up with the money as the band leader?

1885
01:57:24,361 --> 01:57:29,040
And he said that all the money goes into
a band fund to pay for a recording of a

1886
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:33,690
CD. I never agreed to that when
I joined the band. So I was like,

1887
01:57:33,691 --> 01:57:34,524
what the fuck?

1888
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:39,630
I asked what happens if I quit the band
before we record the CD? And he said,

1889
01:57:39,631 --> 01:57:44,190
all the money goes to recording whether
or whether or not I'm in on it or not.

1890
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:48,350
Naturally, I got pissed. Yeah, dude, what
the fuck? After a big balls out fight,

1891
01:57:48,351 --> 01:57:51,180
he finally offered to
pay me 35 bucks per gig.

1892
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:56,670
Nobody has it harder than musicians other
than than fucking strippers or whores,

1893
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:01,680
prostitutes, sweatshop labor. All right,
whatever. It's still a fucking rough gig.

1894
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:05,940
Uh, we usually get paid between
400 to 600 bucks. So I said, no,

1895
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:09,210
I should get paid in equal one
fifth of whatever the band makes.

1896
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:13,110
I'll see you guys get four to
six to 600 bucks a night. Yes,

1897
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:16,590
you should get like a hundred
bucks a cell. Right? And
he's trying to give you 35.

1898
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:22,410
I like this guy standing his
ground. Um, but the shit bird says,

1899
01:58:22,411 --> 01:58:25,530
since I haven't been in a band as long,
I don't deserve an equal share.

1900
01:58:25,531 --> 01:58:27,570
Basically they want to
treat me like a hired gun,

1901
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:29,040
but don't want to pay me fairly.

1902
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:33,210
Plus I come to find out the old bass
player quit in a huff with gigs on the

1903
01:58:33,211 --> 01:58:37,440
books because they were fucking of,
Oh fuck it. I'm all over on money too.

1904
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,130
I've been a professional, reliable.
I learned all the fucking songs.

1905
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:43,780
They showed up at Ben on
time and on top all that.

1906
01:58:43,781 --> 01:58:45,790
They're asking me to design posters,
stickers,

1907
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:48,730
a press kit and go out and book more gigs.

1908
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:53,920
I feel like I'm being taken
advantage of over here. Oh,

1909
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:57,370
what do I give a fuck if we record a CD?
None of these songs are mine.

1910
01:58:57,371 --> 01:58:59,320
All I have invested in it is my time.

1911
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:04,720
It's good steady work and play pays.
Sorry.

1912
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:07,240
It's good to get steady
work and played big gigs,

1913
01:59:07,241 --> 01:59:09,760
but we're not playing
too faggy chick music.

1914
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:13,320
So it's not like I'm even
getting laid out on the gigs. Um,

1915
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,520
there's always a shortage of
bass players in the world.

1916
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,990
So I can have a couple other bands.

1917
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,850
I've got a couple other
bands nipping at my heels,

1918
01:59:18,851 --> 01:59:22,470
but none of them are as high profile.
You don't dump your girlfriends.

1919
01:59:22,471 --> 01:59:24,550
He got another broad to bang on the side.

1920
01:59:24,551 --> 01:59:28,870
So I feel like I should keep playing
with these twats to gain a reputation and

1921
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:32,860
then quit as soon as something better
comes along. So what do you think? Uh,

1922
01:59:32,861 --> 01:59:35,920
I think you're absolutely right.
All right. Two things. One,

1923
01:59:35,921 --> 01:59:39,510
never go into another situation unless
you've hammered out how the fuck you're

1924
01:59:39,511 --> 01:59:43,210
getting paid. Don't just be like,
yeah, I'll do it. Good. You're hired.

1925
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:47,320
You got immediately talk about pay,
because then after four or five gigs,

1926
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,720
you're already in, you're
committed, you've got time invested,

1927
01:59:49,721 --> 01:59:53,020
and now they've got you by the Bulls.
So don't do that again.

1928
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:55,390
And as far his advice with the band,

1929
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:58,120
I would just do exactly
what they're doing.

1930
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:00,910
They're doing what's best
for them in fuck you.

1931
02:00:00,911 --> 02:00:04,300
So do what's best for you and fuck them.
All right.

1932
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:08,710
If staying in that band is going to
help you in the future by being on those

1933
02:00:08,711 --> 02:00:12,340
high profile gigs that I'd stay in the
band and when something better comes

1934
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:15,790
along Sia, right? But, uh,

1935
02:00:15,791 --> 02:00:19,120
if getting the fuck out and that some
of these bands that want to fucking play

1936
02:00:19,121 --> 02:00:22,510
with you actually seem like they're
going to go somewhere, you know,

1937
02:00:22,511 --> 02:00:26,470
you might want to do that
instead, but it's up to you.
But like I said, choose, go,

1938
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:30,910
go church of Satan there. Do what's good
for you. Don't be a martyr like that. Uh,

1939
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:34,540
like that long hair dude there. All
right, that's the podcast for this week.

1940
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:35,800
Thanks everybody.
Chime in.

1941
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:38,800
I apologize if this one was a
little bit scattered brained. I, uh,

1942
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:44,200
I'm really feeling this fucking God damn
head cold coming on. So, uh, that's it.

1943
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:47,680
Have a good week and that's it. Uh,
who do you like in the sugar ball?

1944
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:50,530
Wait a minute. There's always happens
to me. I always go to wrap it up.

1945
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:53,830
Who are you like in the Superbowl? You
want a prediction? I, this is what I say,

1946
02:00:53,831 --> 02:00:57,610
take the Steelers and the over. All right.
Because I think in general people are,

1947
02:00:57,700 --> 02:01:00,640
people gonna think the packers
are going to win. You know,

1948
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:03,760
I haven't watched any
ESPN for some reason.

1949
02:01:03,761 --> 02:01:05,710
I think people think the
packers are gonna win.

1950
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:10,120
Whoever the fuck they say is going to win
bet on the other team and bet the over.

1951
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:11,980
Because I think that they're
going to think that it, you know,

1952
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:15,490
because of the defenses, if
it's going to be this, you know,

1953
02:01:15,491 --> 02:01:19,210
all school smash Mouth Football
Diagno like those game, you know,

1954
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:21,080
like football and I think they're gonna.
It's gonna.

1955
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:24,520
Everybody thinks it's going to be that
and it always goes the other fucking way.

1956
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:29,290
So, uh, that's it. Um, that
is the podcast for this week.

1957
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,920
A good luck to both teams in the
super bowl. You know, they, they,

1958
02:01:32,921 --> 02:01:36,250
I was in Dallas and actually said some
guy went on TV and said that they were

1959
02:01:36,251 --> 02:01:39,500
10,000 strippers short.
You know

1960
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:44,310
what a sad state of affairs.
10,000 stripper short. Can you be?

1961
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:47,600
You believe people still go to titty
bars unless you go into one week and

1962
02:01:47,601 --> 02:01:51,410
actually get one rubbed out? What is
the fucking point? You know what I mean?

1963
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:52,161
Then what he do?

1964
02:01:52,161 --> 02:01:55,460
Do you go to an ice cream parlor and
have fucking put ice cream on a spoon?

1965
02:01:55,461 --> 02:01:58,490
You open your mouth. They put it in your
mouth and right as you go to clamp down,

1966
02:01:58,491 --> 02:02:03,140
they pull it back out again. Is that what
the fuck you dope overrated teddy bars.

1967
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:09,470
There's no fucking reason to go to them.
You just get frustrated.

1968
02:02:09,471 --> 02:02:11,810
Then he get drunk and then
the end is some sort of fight,

1969
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,260
and then that guy from the titans comes
in and somebody gets shot and then he

1970
02:02:15,261 --> 02:02:19,430
just says, I didn't do it. And then
he plays for like the Falcons, right?

1971
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,940
Isn't that how it went down?
I don't fucking know. Ah,

1972
02:02:24,580 --> 02:02:25,371
all right.
You know what?

1973
02:02:25,371 --> 02:02:27,470
Why don't I go fuck myself so
I can end this fucking thing?

1974
02:02:27,570 --> 02:02:27,840
All right.

1975
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:32,840
[inaudible]

1976
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:20,980
okay.
