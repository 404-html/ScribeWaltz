1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,090
Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird. It's
the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:10,290
September 9th, uh, 2013.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,810
Is that what year it is?
2013. Absolutely it is. Um,

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,980
how's it going? How are you?
Did you have a good week?

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm fucking out of it cause I had to get
up at five o'clock this morning and I

6
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,690
had to do a bunch of phones for
our upcoming shows, you know,

7
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:32,220
answering all the questions.
Some good, some bad,

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,060
some repetitive, but you know,
it's what you do as a professional.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,650
The answer him every time, like it's the
first time. So, ah, how do you, well,

10
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,360
how do you come up with your
material? The is itself, the egg.

11
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:47,100
Do you write every day or is it
more spur of the moment? What?

12
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:52,101
Strike what strikes you as funny
and then you got to go into it.

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,300
Wow. Fucking, you know,

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,980
fucking teardrop coming out
of your eye. But um, whatever,

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,800
whatever. So here I am. I'm fucking
groggy. You knows. You know what sucks is,

16
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,830
I used to be a morning person.
I really did. But granted,

17
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,110
I also used to go to bed at like fucking
nine 30 10 o'clock at night because

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,300
when I was a young fella,

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,260
a little lad with orange hair
running around the playground,

20
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,520
try nice to get the shit kicked out of me
whilst bullying people smaller than me.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,820
That's how you did it back then,
right? You beat the shit out of me.

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,270
I can't beat the shit out of you.
I have this awful feeling. Oh,

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,880
I'll take it out on that little
kid over there smaller than me.

24
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,290
That's the way it was done. It was the
70s there wasn't social networking.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,740
Okay. People couldn't get
all get on and be like, Hey,

26
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:45,510
sign this petition man and let's
end the bullying. It wasn't,

27
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,530
you just had to go to school everyday
and you fucking took it and no local news

28
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:53,610
reporter came down and I didn't get
to go on the fucking TV with my stupid

29
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:57,840
freckled face, you know,
lower bottom lip quivering.

30
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:01,770
As I tell the story of somebody who
beat the shit out of me, nobody cared.

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,520
All right, that was it. So anyways,

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,790
now I'm in this fucking business
so I'm not a morning person.

33
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,940
I used to have a paper route. Everybody,
I get up at the crack of fucking dawn,

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,770
you know, jump on a bicycle, be
pitch black out in the wintertime,

35
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,330
freezing my fucking small balls off,
prepubescent,

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,660
prepubescent, and he said that
word fucking balls off, you know,

37
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:29,640
nostrils sticking together and
nobody gave a shit. This is,

38
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:34,641
this is back when a child did that job
that nowadays an adult has to do the job

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,900
either because the dollar is so fucking
weak or because that Chris Hanson has

40
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:43,980
everybody so paranoid that there's some
pervert with his dick out behind every

41
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:47,220
goddamn tree out there. That's
why you got fat kids. Right?

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,730
Did I do a bit about this back of
my fucking earlier standup days.

43
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:55,230
I can't even remember. I'm so tired right
now. But yeah, we still do that shit.

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,100
Parents didn't hover over, children
didn't have play dates, none of that shit.

45
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,170
What it was, was your mom fed you
and then there would be, you know,

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,310
she'd gets Sickey of bright around when
like the game show started coming on and

47
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,040
then she would just open the door and
just be like, you kids need to go outside,

48
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,680
go outside.
And you just go outside.

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,390
And there was other kids that were also
banished to God's side and then you'd

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,233
link up.

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:20,940
Hmm.

52
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,560
And then you just went
about your business.

53
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,520
You fought your tide kids to
trees you to fireworks. Adam, you,

54
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:29,790
you played with matches you
through shit and people's pools.

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,110
You vandalized a new house that was
being built, you know, sweet, innocent,

56
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:38,670
fun like huck Finn and Tom Sawyer.
That's what the fuck you did.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,130
But uh,
those days are all gone to it.

58
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,380
Keep kids inside and you feed them and
you get a big and fat. That's what you do.

59
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:50,100
Well, that was the bidder. You get them
so fat that they're unfuckable. Right.

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
It's not what it was.

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,950
I can't remember what if there's a
pervert is into fat kids. You know,

62
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,420
it was a lot of holes in my
jokes this week. People. I'm
not gonna lie to you. Um,

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,190
so anyways,
I hope you guys had to go wake up.

64
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,740
Is it that NFL football's back
that, that, that, that photo photo?

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,610
Would you do put you do? Um, I actually
went to the, uh, the Denver Broncos.

66
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,200
Who the hell do they play?
The Ravens?

67
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,840
So I get into this big tex battle with
Paul Versey Paul verse. He's going like,

68
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,820
dude, it's a lock. Take Denver
given 10 points. It's a lot,

69
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:30,030
dude. I called it and all this
type of shit, right? Typical VRC.

70
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,510
And I'm sitting there going like, Paul,
it's the first week of the season.

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,600
Nothing's a fucking lock.
You have no idea. Okay.

72
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,480
You're throwing a fucking yacht and
you throw in a boat into the ocean.

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,670
All right? Is that if you an
expression. Um, but I like it.

74
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,810
Okay. If you can't do the math on that,
I can't fucking help you. All right.

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,060
Anyways, so he's telling me it's a fucking
lock it up. Just going like, you know,

76
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:58,500
10 points. I know ed reads not
there. I know Ray Lewis isn't there.

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,510
They still got a defense. They still got
Joe Flacco, they got ray rice. I mean,

78
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,260
ray rice can eat up a lot of God damn
clock. And as good as Peyton manning is,

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,480
if he doesn't have the ball, what
the fuck's he going to do? So, uh,

80
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,200
I, and another thing that bugged me was
everyone on ESPN was picks picking the

81
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:18,810
Broncos ball versus picking the Broncos.

82
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:21,090
Everybody I know was saying the
Broncos are going to kill him.

83
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,710
Like this fucking team wasn't
just in the Superbowl last year,

84
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,610
beaten the 40 niners getting
10 points. So I said, fuck it.

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,780
I think the ravens are going to win. We're
not, when I think that they're there,

86
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,060
they're going to cover.
And uh,

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,590
the first half when exactly
how I said it was going to go,

88
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:44,100
ray rice was running all over the place.
She went up the fucking clock.

89
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,910
Joe Flacco never looked good,
but he was looking good enough.

90
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,590
Defense had a big hit right in
the beginning, eh? Uh, thanks.

91
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,250
[inaudible] right. And then,
uh, the second half Cape,

92
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,830
and it was just, it was over.
Broncos are like, all right,

93
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:04,190
we can't run a,
let's go into a hurry up offense.

94
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,820
Joe Flacco looks like he hasn't thrown a
fucking ball since the last he threw in

95
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:11,090
the super bowl. He's got his
big contract, he got married,

96
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,290
let's say we a blitz them every other
play and see how he deals with this shit

97
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,270
and they fucking didn't
make any adjustments.

98
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,450
And I sat there watching one of the
greatest quarterbacks of all time have one

99
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:26,000
of the greatest performances of
all time and I could not enjoy it.

100
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,720
Just sitting there and knowing that Paul
Versey was going to be right and I was

101
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,554
going to be wrong.

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,800
And I was literally sitting there fuming
for like 24 fucking hours that the

103
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:42,281
fucking ravens had no answer to
the Broncos halftime adjustments.

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,740
The fact that I was fucking sitting
there with Paul Versey, I mean with,

105
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:49,340
with Jason Law head going like,
don't, the Broncos can't run the ball.

106
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:53,420
They should just fucking throw it now and
throw it to the sidelines because he's

107
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,330
fucking picking them apart.
It's exactly what the fuck they did.

108
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,610
I thought what's his face was going to
settle down. Jesus Christ. Joe Flacco,

109
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:04,460
I finally believe in the guy,
never believed in the guy.

110
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,370
I know it's only one week,
but he looked fucking horrific.

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,160
So I'm not saying he's going to be
horrific all year, but, uh, anyways,

112
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,000
long story short,

113
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,030
I had a great time and I really should
have enjoyed watching Peyton manning

114
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:20,690
throw for seven touchdowns cause that
was a legendary performance in any era,

115
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,710
even with the new rules of passing where
you just supposed to escort the fucking

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,630
a receiver down the field and get out
of the way when the quarterback under

117
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,240
throws him and shit,
it was still an unbelievable performance.

118
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:36,740
And I was actually had great seats and a,
he threw a couple of fucking balls.

119
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,700
Like they looked like they were
coming at our seats and you know,

120
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,620
the receiver came back and caught him.

121
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:46,610
He just got to see the speed of the NFL
and how fucking accurate manning was.

122
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:50,690
It was amazing to watch it if I
wasn't such a fucking grumpy cunt,

123
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,730
uh,
during the game.

124
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,693
MMM.

125
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,980
And I gotta tell you,
I actually enjoyed, uh,

126
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,560
watching the patriots trying to figure
out what we're going to do now on offense.

127
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,590
Now that Gronk has hurt and Hernandez
is looking at some serious jail time.

128
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,743
Uh,

129
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,090
I dunno, I actually enjoyed watching
them play the fucking bills.

130
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,170
I got to see a whole other level.
That's what it's going to be this year.

131
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,680
It's going to be a watching
Brady do what he does best,

132
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:27,900
which is make people
around him even better.

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,100
And that's what the
truly great ones can do,

134
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,633
you know?

135
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,650
And that's why I have issues with
some people that they say are great,

136
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:39,280
but they're just individually great. They
don't make people a better around them.

137
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,050
In fact, they borderline
annoy people around them.
Koby Bryant. Um, but you know,

138
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm not going to name names, so, uh,

139
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,190
I don't know. We shall see. This
is going to be a tough season

140
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,830
for I think the Patriots. I don't know.
I don't how good we're going to be.

141
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:58,920
The sheer it is. It is early on, but uh,

142
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,520
but I'm all right with this is when you
actually become a true fan when your

143
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,310
team is in a fucking lock and a,

144
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,090
I liked that that quarterback that the
bills had ega manual. I liked effect.

145
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,530
Is that his last name?
I can't even remember.

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,980
But the fact that the guy can fucking run,
but uh,

147
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:18,930
he didn't seem like he only ran as
a latch as the last, like ditch.

148
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,400
Like I just got to fucking run.

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,730
He seemed like he tried to use his speed
more to stay in the pocket and thrill.

150
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,730
So a,
they look pretty God damn good to me.

151
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,180
And that's it for my boring ass football
talk. How'd you like that everybody?

152
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,780
How about a funny story bill?
All right.

153
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,080
Hop out the fact that I have a bruise on
my back the size of a fucking softball.

154
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,000
How'd you get that bill?
Well,

155
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:44,290
I decided to go hiking in the rocky
mountains and the beautiful state of

156
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:48,880
Colorado. I went up there with
Rosebowl legend Jason Law had,

157
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,430
you know, we went up there like we were
on a second date. Let's go on a hike.

158
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,070
Do you like hiking too?
I'm so excited.

159
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,840
So we decided to go on this fucking hike
and I'm nervous going into the rocky

160
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:06,010
mountains cause I, I'm thinking they
got bear, you know, fucking l Barracuda,

161
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,930
whatever the fuck they got up and there,
you know what I mean?

162
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,670
This is the real deal.

163
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,690
This isn't like the fucking Hollywood
hills out here where, you know,

164
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm going to run into fucking Kevin
Bacon before I run into any sort of fuck.

165
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,373
You know,

166
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,040
I'm going to run into fucking
Louie depalma before I
run into even a bobcat out

167
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,940
here. That's all it is. Maybe
Lee majors visa in a bad mood.

168
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,470
Maybe you'll fucking
throw something at me.

169
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,510
That's the worst I have
to worry about out here.

170
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,630
These are the fuck can rocky mountains.
All right.

171
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,980
These are the mountains that they create
cause light with. This is the real deal.

172
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,570
So, um, we're going in there, you know,
with nothing but fucking, you know,

173
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,240
our workout clothes,
I have no weapon on me.

174
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,400
Everything is telling me
this is fucking stupid.

175
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,570
And,
uh,

176
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,320
we're in boulder, Colorado, which I'm
telling you, man, boulder, Colorado,

177
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:01,700
arguably the best,

178
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,990
the most in shape people I've
ever seen in my fucking life.

179
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,630
Yeah.

180
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,810
We were sitting there walking up this,
this, this hiking trail and we're all,

181
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,720
you know this, pardon me? I'm fucking
nervous cause I haven't gone up there.

182
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,520
I'm with somebody who hasn't gone up here.

183
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,550
This has all the makings of
one of those readers digest.

184
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,880
I almost fucking died stories
that they have in there.

185
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,610
And all of a sudden his fucking lady,

186
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,310
she had to be in her late fifties,
comes running down the trail.

187
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,920
People not walking,
running,

188
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,910
wearing those sneakers that look
like feet that are fucking annoying.

189
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:40,080
But you have to look at them
with this spring in her step.

190
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,530
Okay.

191
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,420
Like Walter Payton running on the balls
of her feet came running by barely

192
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:50,980
breaking a sweat. Big Smile,
fucking glow interface.

193
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,820
Hadn't let life beat her down or anything.
It was unbelievable.

194
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,910
And I'm like me and Jay, but at that
point we'd been in, we'd been in, um,

195
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,790
in boulder for like three days.
We did the show at the boulder theater,

196
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:09,290
did two shows. There were fucking
awesome, uh, unbelievable crowds,

197
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,550
great theater, a part of the Billy
red state tour, the rescheduled one.

198
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:16,540
And everybody showed up
and it was awesome. Uh,

199
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,960
the next day we went to the Broncos game
and then this was the morning we were

200
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:23,210
going to drive down to Colorado
Springs. We were like, well,

201
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,120
we got to work off all the booze.
We drank at the Broncos game,

202
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,730
so we decided to go on this
fucking hike. All right. All right,

203
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm back on track here.
So we go into the,

204
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,760
into the wilderness with no weapons or
anything. And you know, I'm nervous.

205
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,440
I mean that lady run it by made me feel
good, but for half a second, I'm like,

206
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:42,950
cause she running from a mountain lion
because people where I'm from in their,

207
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,050
in their early thirties can't run
that fast. So we go up the hill and

208
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,630
it's just amazing. It's fucking
amazing. Like it's so beautiful.

209
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,550
You're like whispering like, oh
my God, look at those fucking,

210
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,200
I don't really have a view like that type
of shit. Right. But I'm also nervous,

211
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:03,710
like, uh, I just got this
feeling like, I don't know,

212
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:06,020
like I just don't want to get my face
ripped off. I mean, call me weird.

213
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,400
Call me a coward.
I don't give a shit.

214
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,650
Getting mauled is not on my bucket list.
Okay.

215
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,900
That just sounds so much
worse than getting stabbed
and shot because it like get

216
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,310
you need stabbed and shot from the,

217
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,670
unless you get riddled or stabbed
multiple times, for the most part,

218
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:26,600
you have a wound, but it's in one
area, one of your limbs, hearts,

219
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,180
the other three can
still use you get mauled.

220
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,120
That is just an all
encompass encompassing.

221
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:36,540
Like it's like you went through
a paper shredder. Alright,

222
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,100
I don't need that.
So,

223
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:41,920
okay.

224
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,560
We're, we're about half hour
into the hike and I'm like, wow.

225
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,260
I'm a half hour into the rocky
mountains with no fucking weapon.

226
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,840
And my guide is a fellow standup comedian.

227
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,140
So we decided to sit down on these
rocks. I'm like, let's sit down.

228
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,240
Just take a break because we're fucking
winded because we're middle aged guys,

229
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,980
we're out of shape and we're a mile
high in Denver or whatever folder.

230
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,510
So we sit down on these rocks and I'm
like nervous looking around making sure

231
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:14,360
there's nothing deciding
to fucking pounce on me.

232
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,950
And all of a sudden I hear a car
drive by and I'm like, what the fuck?

233
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,290
And like a hundred yards away,
there's like a road.

234
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,290
And then I looked over another 20 feet
and there was like a picnic table.

235
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,260
So I have a deli,
there's fucking trail we were going on.

236
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:34,280
This isn't like some deep forest
shit like we pulled off the road.

237
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,790
Evidently we could've just kept driving
and gone all the way up to the top.

238
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,760
So in the trail were on crosses
the road a couple of times.

239
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,880
So we're totally fine for the most part.

240
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,570
So I see the picnic table
and I pointed it to Jason.

241
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:51,590
We just start fucking laughing cause was
sitting down on these rocks like Lewis

242
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,130
and Clark and we're in the middle of
nowhere and we're, we're, we're fucking,

243
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:59,720
we're right there. We're in the middle of
silvers. Civilization. Long story short,

244
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,280
we get all the way up to the top.

245
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,680
Okay.

246
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,990
Um, we're standing on these rocks were
looking down, actually looking down into,

247
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,950
why was it Findlay
stadium, whatever, with uh,

248
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:13,170
the buffaloes play absolutely gorgeous,
was so high up,

249
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:16,680
we could see the Denver, the skyline
in Denver. It was fucking awesome.

250
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,410
So we start walking back and uh,

251
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:23,970
we're coming down the trail and it's
really loose kind of dirt and we keep

252
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:27,030
slipping, but we're all right. You
know, we keep regaining our balance.

253
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,631
At one point,

254
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:30,600
La had slips to the point where I thought
he was going down and then he was able

255
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:35,100
to recover. You know, he
was an athlete and I said, I
said, hey, go. That was nice.

256
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,220
You can see you, you know, you played hoop
yet, you've got an athletic background.

257
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:41,460
I said, had you been Joe de Rosa? Um,

258
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,800
I'd be carrying it down off the mountain.

259
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,370
And we were sitting there laughing at Joe.
Right?

260
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:47,790
Cause that's the kind of friend I am.

261
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,620
I throw my friends under the
bus when they're not there
to defend themselves. So,

262
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,600
okay.

263
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,201
When you know,

264
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:58,230
Karma comes back and bites me in
the ass like a fucking minute later,

265
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm standing there taking a picture of
something and I go and I take a step or

266
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,810
two, dude, and I'm telling you,
it's like somebody took my legs out.

267
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,920
I didn't even know what happened.

268
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,630
I just fell and I landed on a rock.

269
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,180
Like first of all,
my,

270
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,160
my elbow scraped first on my
right arm and it pushed my,

271
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,080
it like hyper extended.

272
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,340
Like I almost snapped my fucking humorous
and all I was doing was falling from a

273
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:29,550
standing position down to
the ground in the dirt.

274
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:33,660
But they just happened to be this
fucking rock there. Um, and I almost,

275
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,550
and I think I would have broke it,

276
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,460
but fortunately the
rest of my body hit the,

277
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,250
the other part of the rock basically.
Just imagine jumping up in the air.

278
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,580
So you're horizontal and then just landing
on the rock with like a baseball size

279
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:54,030
part of your back. Dude, I
wish I could recreate the,

280
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,400
the fucking noise I made.

281
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,423
MMM.

282
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,400
And I,
that was it.

283
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,780
I was just down and I was down for
like a good 10 seconds, you know,

284
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:10,550
like when when somebody gets knocked
out or knocked down when that boxing and

285
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,650
they kind of sit back up at four seconds,

286
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:14,510
but they wait until the
nine and a half seconds.

287
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:15,770
Yeah.

288
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,090
Mark to fucking stand back up. That's what
I did and lie. I was going like, dude,

289
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:24,770
you are right. You are right. And I
kept saying, yeah and I wasn't. And uh,

290
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,780
so I start walking down the hill and um,

291
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,490
I'm kind of laughing because
I feel like a fucking idiot.

292
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:35,660
But laughing at this point hurts because
I guess you use those muscles in your

293
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:38,120
back Ed. Uh, I dunno.

294
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:41,720
About 30 seconds later la heads going,
yeah dude,

295
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:46,721
I can see blood coming through
your fucking tee shirt at a,

296
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,200
yeah, it was gross by the
time I got down to the bottom,

297
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:53,940
like my fucking tee shirt was
like stuck to my back and uh,

298
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,290
you know,
but it wasn't bleeding profile.

299
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,040
It was more like the cut was more like
a scrape because after I landed on the

300
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,670
Rock,
I then slid down it.

301
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,950
So I lifted up my shirt and I go,
how bad is it?

302
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:13,410
And I knew it was going to be
bad cause I knew what I did.

303
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,360
And not to mention I'm a pasty fucking
redhead and we don't bruise. We look like,

304
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:21,630
you know where somebody with pigment
would look like they had a bad bruise.

305
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,510
We look like we got bitten by
like a fucking Maaco Shark.

306
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,770
That's basically what I look
like. Um, and uh, you know,

307
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,510
I shook it off, went to the
pharmacy, got some Neosporin,

308
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,740
slapped it on my elbow, left it off
the back, figured it back was fine.

309
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,540
And then I went and I got a salad
and that was my fucking Denver Story.

310
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,640
How was that? So, uh,

311
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,600
my back has been killing me the last
couple of days and a, it's weird when I,

312
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,340
the only time it hurts is when I go
to stand up and I got to make a noise.

313
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,600
I'll make the noise for you here. Let
me see if I can get it. It hurts. Oh,

314
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:02,220
of course. Now it doesn't hurt. I think
I did it. I freed it up. All right.

315
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:06,480
That was a big, that was like
Geraldo looking into that
safe. Sorry about that. Um,

316
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:09,280
anyways, let's get to some fucking
advertising for this week. Every one.

317
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,630
I know this is kind of a
disjointed podcast this week. Uh,

318
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,680
cause I got up early with a fuck. Is it?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Bill, come on,

319
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,290
come on. Can we do this? All right.
Dollar Shave club, everybody, you know,

320
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,680
there is so many things in the world
that irritate me. Um, you know, slipping,

321
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:29,290
falling on a rock, inconsiderate con, uh,

322
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,960
the fact that I have a motorcycle license,

323
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,250
but I'm too scared to get one and drive
one down the street. Well, actually no.

324
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,940
You know what, considering what just
happened to me from a standing position,

325
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:43,370
I can't imagine going 40 miles an
hour and falling on the tar. Uh,

326
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,370
that bugs me not being able to
gas your own people. You know,

327
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,270
what's the world coming to, uh, when
so many things can irritate you.

328
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,370
Why add razors to the list.

329
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,470
It's time to stop milking your razor
blade. I know with brand name razors,

330
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,970
you used to paying
outrageous prices and x,

331
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:05,040
so then you then exhaust those razors
until they start to look like a rusty soda

332
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,020
can. It's time to move on. Everybody.

333
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,400
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing
quality blades to your door for just a few

334
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
bucks a month.
Never think about it again.

335

They send a pack every month so you
can change your blades every week. Uh,

336
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:19,710
I love these guys and your
face is going to love him too.

They always got a new product all.

339
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:29,040
They also got a new product
called one wipe Charlies.

340
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,490
It's a but wipe for men and it's classy
as opposed to those unclassy butt wipes.

341
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,290
You know the ones I'm talking about?

we got here? Um, yeah, that's it.

367
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,070
That's good for the advertising for the
moment. You know, I touched on there,

368
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,650
I mentioned some of that
serious stuff about them. Uh,

369
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,200
so theoria are you Syria?
Um,

370
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,320
I mentioned that, uh, you know, what's
the deal there? That they got a little,

371
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:32,950
uh, against some shit there
for gas and their own people.

372
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,280
I don't understand that whole thing of
if you don't sign a treaty saying that

373
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:40,030
you're not going to guess other
people or I guess maybe they did.

374
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:44,470
I tried to figure out whether they did
or not and I got onto this colored map of

375
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:47,230
the world where they had
people who signed it,

376
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,310
people who signed it and said to hell
with it and people who never signed it and

377
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:54,880
then people who sort of signed it and
there was all these colors and these

378
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:57,010
graphs. I can't figure out
if they signed it or not,

379
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:01,060
but let's just say for the sake of the
argument that they went to the Geneva

380
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,050
protocol in 1949 and they decided that
they were going to sign that thing and

381
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,380
they weren't going to gas people.
Now as far as how it's written,

382
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,050
isn't it written that basically
you're not going to get,

383
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,190
you don't guess our people and we
won't guess your people, but is,

384
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,460
is there anything in there that
says you can't gas your own people?

385
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,860
We're not saying you can, you should do
it, but those are your people. Right?

386
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,470
Like if I go out and buy
myself a new outfit, you know,
to show off my thick. Yeah,

387
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,760
there's nothing preventing me. Says I
can't go out and go jump in a mud puddle.

388
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,030
Right. This is my fucking clothes. Now,

389
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:40,320
if I take those clothes off and then
throw them in some old lady's face now,

390
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,320
now there's a problem. But if I
just roll around in that mud puddle,

391
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,130
I'm just doing damage to myself,
aren't I?

392
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,390
I don't fucking know how dumb
do I sound right now? Well,

393
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:53,990
you know when you're done tow, fuck
you. It's a legitimate question.

394
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,130
I don't understand why you can't
gas people. He can't do that.

395
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:01,190
But you can fucking firebomb
cities and you can straight people.

396
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,320
You know you can do area bombing. Oops.
Did that land on a nursery with babies?

397
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:10,560
Why can you do that? You know what it
is? I think it's too easy. I get it.

398
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,560
Chemical weaponry. That's like the
PE Dee of of mass murder. All right.

399
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,340
No, just send. That's what it is.

400
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,320
Being able to gas people, that's like
everybody gets their own ribbon. Okay.

401
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,180
You know what, I worked at out,
you don't need to write in,

402
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,370
but if you want to write in,
I'd love to talk about it.

403
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,800
Something fucking
different as you see that,

404
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,560
that story ESPN had that they ran with,

405
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:37,580
I guess very little facts
at least according to the
very pissed off woman that I

406
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,680
wrote,
I read her little article about it.

407
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,790
They were trying to claim that Bobby
Riggs through that match against Billie

408
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,860
Jean King. I'm showing
my age here. I mean,

409
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,520
I don't remember when this shit happened,
but back in the 70s,

410
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:54,440
they had the battle of the sexes
and Bobby Riggs, a former champion,

411
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:58,730
55 fucking years old,
plays Billie Jean King 29,

412
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:02,900
the number one seated woman's
player in the world at the time.

413
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,200
And uh,
he played her and he lost.

414
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,290
And evidently that was some sort of
big thing for women that a woman in her

415
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:14,480
prime could beat an old man at Tennessee.

416
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,460
So now somebody was trying
to claim that was fixed.

417
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:22,550
It sounded like bullshit that he threw
the match because the saying that I guess

418
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:25,880
he played the number two woman in
the world and beat her handily.

419
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,330
But there's a big difference between
number two and number one as you saw

420
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:33,490
yesterday with a Serena and uh,

421
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,930
what's her face that she played?

422
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:39,350
They fucking battled for the first two
sets and then Serena just took over.

423
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:40,930
It was like, fuck this. You know,

424
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,810
it's so fucking hilarious about Serena
Williams is when she's playing tennis.

425
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,040
I swear to God, it's just raw. Like
she doesn't make too many noises,

426
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:53,000
but she just looks like I would
duck if she hit the ball. You know,

427
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,270
it's like a fucking linebacker out there.
Right.

428
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,280
But then the second she wins the match,
she turns into a girl again, like,

429
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:04,550
oh my God, she, if it's like our
one hand up and starts waving,

430
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:08,240
jumping up and down, really girly,
like, but when she's playing the game,

431
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:12,770
I swear to God,
it's like she could fucking kill somebody.

432
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,000
So she's playing this other
lady and I'm telling you,

433
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,620
they were playing like dude's,

434
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,060
there was some volleys to couple times.
They went to the net,

435
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:27,440
but pretty much they would just
at the baseline, just power shots,

436
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,600
fucking home run hits.
I'll tell you,

437
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,080
I was watching the packers 40 niners
and I started flipping over just to see,

438
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:38,690
you know, I mean, how often do you get
to see a legend? Plain. I mean, she went,

439
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,590
she just want her 18th major I think so
she's closing in on Steffi Graf and then

440
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:48,060
after Steffi Graf, is that Australian
broad? I forget her name. I know the guy.

441
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,070
What is it? Not Stan Smith. Rod
Laver. He's won the most of any guy.

442
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,250
The fuck's her name,
Margaret or meg.

443
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,270
She's got some one of those
old people fucking m names,

444
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,070
so she's closing in on her.

445
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:04,950
So I wanted to watch a little bit of
that and it was a fucking great match.

446
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,890
I had a fuck that I get on with this,
but whatever that is,

447
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:11,640
you know that that's always bugged me.
That Bobby Riggs thing,

448
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,640
when Billie Jean beat Bobby Riggs,
like that proves something.

449
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,850
See Women in the prime of their life are
just as good as men whose Dick's don't

450
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:21,120
really work anymore

451
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,360
and are in the early stages of prostate
cancer. They can beat us at badminton,

452
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,850
a faster game of badminton. So I dunno,
so some, some woman wrote this article,

453
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,570
you know, it doesn't matter
whether it was fixed or not,

454
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,010
it doesn't matter any more.

455
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:42,810
Like the problem with women is they
actually give a shit what guys say,

456
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,610
you gotta be like, guys, if you
really want to become free of men,

457
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,830
this is what you have to do.
Two things.

458
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,130
You have to stop giving
a fuck what we say.

459
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,550
You have to talk down to us more.

460
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,930
And then what you have to do is
you have to start your own shit.

461
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,630
The problem with women,

462
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,060
how many my pissing off right now
is you keep trying to join our shit.

463
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,640
You know,
we have a gym,

464
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,330
we have the water buffaloes club
and there's no women allowed.

465
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,200
You should be like, great,
get the fuck out of the house.

466
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:22,950
Go down there the same way we would do
you think we give a fuck that you'd have

467
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,370
a women's only gym?
Go down there,

468
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,390
do a double session, get the
fuck Outta, I don't care.

469
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,770
Especially now with all these
great ways of tape and TV,

470
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:39,190
you can watch all these fucking games
by all means. You know, beat it.

471
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,140
Beat it. Right? You don't
just get Outta here, you guys,

472
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,880
you got to start having that
fucking attitude because that's,

473
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,300
that's,

474
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,040
that's the genius of guys is we act like
we don't give a fuck about you but we

475
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:57,300
till, but we act like we don't and we
act like what we're going to go do.

476
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,830
We're excited about it.

477
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,580
And you guys drink that Koolaid and
you actually think what we're doing is

478
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:07,320
exciting. So you want to become a part
of it. You want to join a dump gyms,

479
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,550
right?

480
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,270
You want to join a fucking golf clubs
because you think there's something going

481
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:15,240
on that you think you're actually
missing out on something you're not.

482
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,350
She punches stupid guys walking
around scratching at Dick's.

483
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,780
Every other fucking sentence.
Why would you want to be around them?

484
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,930
I don't want to be up on a bunch of women,

485
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,790
like I don't even know what
you guys talk about. To me,

486
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:29,340
it sounds like a bunch of birds
fighting over a French fry.

487
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,470
I don't want to listen to that
shit. All right. I love art.

488
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:36,870
Like I'm berating a guys out
of fucking nowhere. I thought,

489
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:40,590
I thought I was beyond this in my life.
Evidently I'm not.

490
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,240
Um, all right, let's plow ahead
here. Everybody. You know what?

491
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:47,260
I did this this week.

492
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:49,720
I really watched the offensive
line of the New England patriots.

493
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,210
That's what I did.
And uh,

494
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,220
I actually liked what I saw it,
man.

495
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:58,220
I thought they were protected time really
well. And I think if you're a true,

496
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,650
if you're a true football fan,
if you're to true your team,

497
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,550
you should know your offensive line to
the point where you're actually recognize

498
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:07,010
them when they go down the street.
You know,

499
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,040
if you actually know what who, what Ryan
Wendell looks like, where Dan Klein,

500
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,200
Lee Logan Mankins,

501
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,230
nobody knows these fucking
guys need sold my AA. Not,

502
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:20,600
they've seen the fucking names where,
cause you never hear him. You know why?

503
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,860
Because they never get busted
for holding Sebastian Vollmer.

504
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,473
Right.

505
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,040
I actually paid attention to the offensive
line this week was the first time in

506
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,830
30 years of watching football,
35 fucking years.

507
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,040
I actually noticed in the
huddle how they're lined up,

508
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:40,340
how the offensive line is lined up,
where they just turn right around there,

509
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:43,280
right in position. And it's like,
of course they are bill you dumb.

510
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:46,280
Fuck the clock is ticking.
What do you think?

511
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:48,350
They just all go into the
huddle all willy nilly.

512
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,900
Is that because you never played organized
football? I played for a few weeks.

513
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,530
I actually played for a few weeks.
This is kind of a sad story.

514
00:30:57,531 --> 00:31:02,090
And then Darryl Stingley got paralyzed
and my parents got freaked out and they,

515
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,620
they, uh, actually I've got
to tell you, uh, you know,

516
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,420
they had the foresight to see what I was
doing in my brain playing football and

517
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:14,990
they also saw my athletic abilities. So
it's just like, you know, they were like,

518
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:17,720
he's already kind of dumb and,
uh,

519
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,000
he's not the most athletic person,

520
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:23,900
so why would we want them to sit here
smashing his head to another third graders

521
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:28,770
head? Let's have him play baseball game.

522
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,620
Hey about those red sox. Huh? God dammit.
I wish I was watching baseball this year.

523
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:35,960
You know, excited. I would be,
I'm not going to lie to you.

524
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm going to jump on the
band wagon come October.

525
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,940
I always watch October baseball.
Anyways. I love it. Like,

526
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,310
I don't know if they have
extra microphones or whatever,

527
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:47,960
but there's just the sounds of the
ballpark is better. But uh, you know,

528
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,350
take it three out of four from the
Yankees. That's pretty fucking impressive.

529
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,220
And I,

530
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,220
and I really am kind of amazed at the
fact that that trade with the Dodgers

531
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,020
worked out for both teams.

532
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:05,650
That's so rare and a blockbuster trade
that it works for both people that should

533
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:10,540
have been like great for one team and
horrific for the other or as certain as

534
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:15,410
such for both teams. Like that's what
usually happens in a blockbuster trade.

535
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,190
Either works for nobody. I bill, you just
said it. You don't need to repeat it,

536
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:21,710
but very rare does it work
out for football teams?

537
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:26,120
I don't know why those superstars
started playing for the Dodgers,

538
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:31,040
but I'm glad they did. I've always liked
the Dodgers and uh, I'm glad that we,

539
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,280
uh, saved a bunch of fucking money in
whoever the hell we have on our team.

540
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,280
He's evidently playing fucking great.

541
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:41,180
Could I say evidently one more
fucking time this podcast? Um,

542
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,520
evidently I can shoot,
uh, let's plow ahead here.

543
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,590
Uh, oh, I was watching some
greater youtube videos last night.

544
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,720
Um, I've become obsessed. Let me see.

545
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,510
I don't even know his fucking name is
great. I've become obsessed with them.

546
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:03,290
I don't even know his fucking name.
Where the hell is it?

547
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,690
A for God's sakes,

548
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,830
what the fuck is this guy's name?
You know what?

549
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,740
I just, this is, this is why right here.

550
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:20,741
I at some point need to bring somebody
else into the fucking fault so I can

551
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:21,764
actually,

552
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,570
okay,

553
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:26,560
where is it? Here we go. Put this
on here and then we hit mute.

554
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:28,690
So enough to pay any money
for the fucking song.

555
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:31,850
Okay.

556
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,440
With a,
God dammit all there it is.

557
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,310
I become obsessed with this drummer,
raw James Gadson.

558
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,390
He basically, a lot of people,
if you're a bill withers fan,

559
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,500
I highly recommend downloading us.
Still still bill.

560
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,960
That's incredible fucking album.

561
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,600
Bill withers is one of the greatest
singers of all time and I also think

562
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:55,710
unbelievably underrated as a singer.
And uh,

563
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,870
he's got this killer drummer James
Gadson and just, I don't know,

564
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:02,830
that guy just doesn't get the attention
he deserves. So long story short,

565
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:04,420
I started,
you know,

566
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,880
youtube and him and watching him
play does not a lot of stuff on them.

567
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:08,680
There's a lot of,
uh,

568
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,680
videos and shit of interviews with them
and that led me to one of those great

569
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,500
youtube runs. Well, you
don't end up on a slap fight.

570
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,060
You actually stuck to learn stuff.

571
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,230
And I came across this other drummer,

572
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:24,820
okay.

573
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,810
Like Fred, Fred Bellow of, I don't
know how to say his fucking name,

574
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,600
which led me to this concert film

575
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,200
and Otis rush singing, I
can't quit. You baby. Um,

576
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,600
that led Zeppelin raids did a remake
of called, I can't quit you babe,

577
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,350
as opposed to I can't quit you baby.
So that's how they switched it up.

578
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:49,250
And then that's why they never paid Otis
rush until they settled out of court.

579
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,960
I don't know if that's true, if they
had to settle out of court with them.

580
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:58,400
I know they had to do that a
couple of times. But uh, Otis Rush,

581
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:04,090
one of the greatest live singers I ever
heard and he plays guitar lefthanded and

582
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:05,720
he doesn't string it.

583
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,950
He plays a right hand and guitar upside
down and did not string it the other way.

584
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:14,240
He just plays it upside down strong,
right handed.

585
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:18,050
And the only other guy I knew who
did that was, uh, was Dick Dale.

586
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,070
I didn't know there was someone else who
did it, but he's fucking unbelievable.

587
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:24,170
I'm going to send you a link to
this concert concert film, uh,

588
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
the podcast this week cause
you really should see it.

589
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,710
It should know about this guy, a case
you don't know about them. And, uh,

590
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,710
and also I want to know what concert does,

591
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:36,740
is if anybody has any information on it
and how somehow I can watch the whole

592
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:41,190
concert because it's crazy.
It starts with, you know,

593
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,690
this older black dude who's like playing
like Boogie woogie piano and he see

594
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:49,890
he's part of that generation and then it
kind of leads into these guys who were

595
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:52,280
more R and B guys and it's right before a,

596
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,633
okay.

597
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,470
I Dunno, it seems, it's
like right around that time,

598
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,360
right as James Brown was
coming out or whatever.

599
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,300
But it's just a great period where
people can actually play music and shit,

600
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,660
play instruments and sing live.
It's fucking awesome. And then the,

601
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,010
they're playing performing of course,

602
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:10,480
to this horrific white crowd that is just
sitting there like their entire lives

603
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:13,960
have been mapped out in front of them
and they made no decisions and they have

604
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:16,450
no passion in life. I don't know what
it is. It's fucking embarrassing,

605
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:20,560
but it's incredible concert footage. All
right. I'm done. Run in my fucking mouth.

606
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,180
Let's go to, uh, let's go to some of your
questions and information this week. Uh,

607
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:27,370
I got a ton of shit last
week by saying a port,

608
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,150
a pork shoulder was
actually the ass of the pig.

609
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,910
I guess it actually is the shoulder.

610
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:38,740
I guess a Christmas Ham is the ass
or you can eat it on thanksgiving.

611
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:43,480
Just say Ha. Ham is the ass of the pig. So
this guy says, Bill, I love your podcast.

612
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,280
I'm a former butcher and I wanted to
correct you on your smoke shoulder comment

613
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:52,840
on yesterday's podcast. A pork shoulder
is the front shoulder on a pig.

614
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,670
The confusing part is they are also
called pork butts. It's not the,

615
00:36:57,671 --> 00:37:01,600
but the butter. The pig is
the ham. Hope this helps.

616
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,920
Um, blah, blah, blah. Well, you
know, what can you write back?

617
00:37:05,921 --> 00:37:10,710
Why do they call it a, but
then I have no idea why.

618
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,640
Why do they call it that? All I know is
it's fucking delicious. As is the acid.

619
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,800
The pig.
I eat the whole fucking pig.

620
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,210
Wherever the fuck the Bacon
is, you know, that'd be,

621
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,860
do they have classes like that?

622
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,390
Do they have a class that teaches you how
to butcher an animal in case you know,

623
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:30,730
whenever the dollar collapses
and I'm out there, I mean,

624
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:32,010
I know how to shoot a bow and arrow.

625
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,720
Now I know how to fucking
gut a fish pretty well,

626
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,160
but I'd like to know how to fucking
shoot a wild pig. Hey, fuck this.

627
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:42,400
I'm on the Billy red state tour people.
I'm coming out to El Paso.

628
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,690
I'm coming out to San Antonio. If anybody
out there it goes wild boar hunting.

629
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:49,510
I want to do that shit.
I want to do it,

630
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:52,960
but I don't want to fucking kill one just
for the sake of killing it. All right?

631
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,500
I want to fucking kill it. Clean
it, do the whole fucking thing.

632
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:59,510
You make me do all of this shit.
Uh,

633
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,110
I know animal lovers out there
probably don't like it. I'm,

634
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:05,740
I'm doing it not to do it all the
fucking time. I want to have that skill.

635
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,600
All right? Basically, I'm slowly,
I want to become macgyver.

636
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,150
I want to not firing on to shoot a fish
with a bow and arrow sort of. Okay.

637
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,370
I know what a loaded gun
and shoot it sort of,

638
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,880
I got some vegetables growing and Rhonda,
my house Kinda.

639
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,300
So if I know how to take down a
fucking pig, got that fucking thing,

640
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:31,270
it's got to translate to a god damn deer.
Right.

641
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,280
Sort of the same shit I would think.

642
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,600
Yeah.

643
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,190
Then all I to do was get a helicopter

644
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,160
license and I'm good to go.
I know how to ride a motorcycle now.

645
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,800
You see what I'm saying?
So you got fucking,

646
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,780
if he have a helicopter that like what
I love about the helicopter is you just

647
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:48,610
go right up.
You can escape so easily.

648
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,450
It's almost like you literally know
how to fly. We're like, you know,

649
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:56,710
with an airplane you need that run and
start, you know. Oh fucking though.

650
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,620
But anyway, so somebody who wants
to take me wild boar hunting,

651
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,300
I would fucking do that.

652
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,560
And as second I go down to ll
bean and show of my brand new,

653
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:08,650
I'm going hunting shit,
looking like fucking, you know,

654
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,640
like those old Vietnam movies when you
first get there and you buckle your Chin

655
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,050
strap to your helmet.

656
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,600
And then all of grizzled veteran
veterans tell you not to do it.

657
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,690
Cuts the concussive force of the shells
is gonna blow your fucking head off.

658
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,540
That type of stuff. But what are
you talking about? I don't know.

659
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,670
I want to shoot a pig,

660
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,570
you know, fucking great. That would be,
take that fucker down. Wait. Alright.

661
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,320
Take that fucker down.
Clean it.

662
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,400
Bring the fucking meat home and
then smoke it on my fucking grill.

663
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,270
How much of a man I would feel like how
much cowardice I could fucking push down

664
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:47,400
that I have the pussy.

665
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:50,700
Pardon me would really be shut down
and I wouldn't have to listen to those

666
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:51,600
voices in my head.

667
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,600
And for a few minutes I could actually
act like I was actually a stud.

668
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,320
Yeah.

669
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,000
Hey, fuck you. I have my dreams,
you know. All right. Whatever.

670
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,050
40 minutes. Then here we go. This time
to read some, some of your letters. Uh,

671
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,880
seriously. Fuck your American
sports. Another positive email here.

672
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,600
Hi Bill. Big Fan. Got Tickets to
see you in London in December.

673
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,040
I got to take a time out here. Ah,
the response to a, some of my shows,

674
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,760
pretty much all of them over there
has been unbelievable in Europe.

675
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:26,350
And I can't thank you guys enough.
Uh, we added a show in London,

676
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,830
added a show in Helsinki.
How crazy is that?

677
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:32,710
And some promoter and
Astonia just asked me to add,

678
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,300
I'm not going to be able to do it this
time, but I'm doing it next time. And uh,

679
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,250
it's been unbelievable.
So, uh, I'm really,

680
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:44,650
really excited to go over there.

681
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,960
I'm going to and this time rather than
just go in there and landing and, uh,

682
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,520
you know, being a Zombie during the
day, I'm coming over like three, three,

683
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:58,840
four days early to, uh, get acclimated.

684
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:03,370
I'm going to actually go to Italy. I
haven't decided where yet, but, uh,

685
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm just going to go there and eat

686
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:05,790
okay.

687
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,571
And,
uh,

688
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:09,810
I'm going to try and see an opera when
I'm there and some old opera house.

689
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,780
I don't have too much time to go there.

690
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:18,290
I don't think I want to go to Rome
and go to the see the Roman Colosseum.

691
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,940
I feel like that's going to times square.
That's what I've learned in my travel.

692
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,850
You like, you go to New Orleans, I
guess you have to see Bourbon Street,

693
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,140
but you really don't
want to be down there.

694
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,470
That's just a bunch of drunk tourists
which you want to go down is uh, you know,

695
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,630
you know what, I'm not going to
tell you the cool places to go.

696
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:35,540
You gotta go there and talk to the
locals cause I don't want to fuck up the

697
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:39,230
locals. Good places to go.
It's kind of like, you know,

698
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,150
I stayed at one of the greatest fucking
hotels I've ever stayed at when I was in

699
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:46,790
Colorado and uh,

700
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,640
I'm not going to tell you guys where it is
because I don't want to ruin it.

701
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,650
If you just by dumb luck
discover it is fucking amazing.

702
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,530
We stayed at this place
if for dinner we had lamb,

703
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:06,830
an elk,
and uh,

704
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,230
and was this quiet town off the beaten
path and they had this little fucking bar

705
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,210
that we went to.
We're like,

706
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:19,250
the bartender wasn't even behind the bar.

707
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,790
She was over in the middle of shooting
pool. One of those kinds of things.

708
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,360
And for the first time in my life,
like country music made sense.

709
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,370
I finally realized, I knew Willie Nelson
was good. I didn't know he was that good.

710
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,870
All right.

711
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,980
And I went up to the fucking jukebox and
I just started every fucking legendary

712
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,510
country guy that I knew.
You know,

713
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,020
I throw in a couple of fucking rock
songs or whatever, but you know,

714
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,360
Merle Haggard, all these guys
and I, and I wouldn't pick,

715
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:50,330
they'd have their greatest hits.
I wouldn't go off that. I go off,

716
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:54,470
I pick a different album then pick like
the third track rather than the first

717
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,240
track. Cause they usually
lead with the radio hit.

718
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,960
I wanted to hear something different
dude. And I fucking loved it. So, uh,

719
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,890
but then when it was weird,

720
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,940
I got to La and I tried to download some
Willie Nelson and didn't feel the same

721
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:08,570
way, you know, so I'm going
to download some fucking,

722
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,820
some of that shit for my drive from
El Paso to San Antonio this week.

723
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:19,160
Uh, play in El Paso on Thursday
and then San Antonio on Friday.

724
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,770
Uh, there's still some
tickets left in El Paso.

725
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:25,550
I mean they picked a really
big place because, uh,

726
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,780
it was either play a little place,
there was data,

727
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,470
they didn't have the middle ground one.
So we just picked a big place.

728
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:35,450
I don't know if they're going to
close out the balcony, whatever,

729
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:37,910
but there's definitely tickets left.
Um,

730
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,070
but then after that I
drive down to San Antonio,

731
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:41,450
listen to this fucking amazing week.

732
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,520
And then Saturday I'm hanging around and
I'm going, me and oversee of going on.

733
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:51,020
A couple of other buddies were going to
go to the, uh, Texas a and M Alabama game,

734
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,830
going to go see Johnny football go
up against one of the great fucking

735
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,710
college football teams.

736
00:43:58,711 --> 00:44:02,580
I mean that the run that Alabama's on
his fucking insane being an Lsu fan and

737
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:06,900
fucking annoys the shit out of me.
But, uh, you can't not appreciate it.

738
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:10,770
So we're going to go to that game and
that's going to be our week. So, uh,

739
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,590
anyways, so I'm trying to do more of
that type of stuff when I do the road.

740
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,040
And as a comic it's great because you
get excited to go on the road when you

741
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:23,640
plan shit like that and it, if
you're excited, you don't dry up,

742
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,040
you just don't start hating your act and
you don't end up like just saying fuck

743
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,530
it and hosting a game show,
not to say there's anything with that.

744
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:33,270
And not to say that I
would never host a game,

745
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,780
show them that might become a point my
fucking career where I just can't do it

746
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:40,980
anymore. And I'll go on and
I'll fucking host card sharks.

747
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,210
The dope card sharks with
bill burr all a bit higher.

748
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,240
You got arrest all of it. Here
we go. And that can be fun.

749
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,540
You know what's great about
being a game show host?

750
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,780
You know you got a fucking fat ass fucking
house with an in ground pool and at

751
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:59,430
that point who gives a shit,
right?

752
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:05,140
And every fucking woman who comes on
the show, they fucking, they, they,

753
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:08,100
they, I don't know. They make
you feel special. Oh my God.

754
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:11,340
I watch his show every day.
Fucking kiss you on the cheek,

755
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,570
or you can be a pervert like Richard
Dawson and kiss him on the mouth. Man. Uh,

756
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,570
who knows? I might do that. When I get a
little older, I still got some fight me.

757
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,810
All right. This business hasn't
dragged me in the boat yet.

758
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,240
I'm on the hook without a doubt.
They're reeling me in,

759
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:32,100
but I'm not on the boat yet. They haven't,
they haven't fucking club me yet. So, um,

760
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,290
yeah,
so that's my thing.

761
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,540
I'm going to go to fucking Italy
and I'm going to go see an opera.

762
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,080
Bring a little fucking handkerchief
there and hope I actually,

763
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,580
it moves me rather than
sitting there going like,

764
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,780
dude, I don't get what they're
talking about. Why? See, so fat dude,

765
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:49,570
that skinny chick would never
hook up with that fat guy.

766
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,040
I don't want to be that dude. So anyways,
let's get to the question here. Uh,

767
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:53,880
I'm in the UK,

768
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:58,230
I listen to your podcast and I hear the
names of these little teams and games

769
00:45:58,231 --> 00:46:01,770
that you have, uh, that you have there.

770
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:05,160
So last night I'm going to bed and um,

771
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,170
I've been slowly growing this tiny amount
of gambling money, just small change,

772
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:13,380
just so just for fun.
And I thought I'd drop it on him.

773
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,460
I drop it on a banker that was played
while I slept and then I have a little bit

774
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:23,130
of interest in the morning. Okay.
This guy. So I like this guy. He's,

775
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:26,430
he's doing his little train spotting slang
here and I'm trying to figure it out.

776
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,500
Drop it on a bank or,
I mean,

777
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:32,550
do you want to put money on the game so
you putting up money on a game overseas

778
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:34,830
and while you're asleep and you're
going to wake up and see if you made any

779
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:36,630
money or not. Wow. Dude,

780
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:41,180
you just took gambling to a whole of year
of fucking international gambler dude.

781
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,390
You have like a fucking white Tuxedo that
you get up and put on like Roger Moore.

782
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,560
Okay.

783
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,880
That's kind of fucking fun.

784
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,470
Okay.

785
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,810
That's actually, you know, for people
to have a serious gambling problem,

786
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,900
they probably didn't need to know that
because the only time of serious gamblers,

787
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:59,350
not gambling is probably when he's going
to sleep. This mother Fucker is sin.

788
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:01,360
So God damn DP figured
out a way though it,

789
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,760
I commend you and I also feel bad for you,
sir. That's fucking amazing. So anyways,

790
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:08,260
he goes,
I went to my bookmakers,

791
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,760
but bookmakers site inside the Yankees
being the Red Sox, eight to three,

792
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,420
they were giving odds on the Red Sox,

793
00:47:16,421 --> 00:47:21,421
nine to one in a two horse race
and a one to 100 on the Yankees.

794
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:25,900
So I put the equivalent of $30 on
the Yankees and thought, ah fuck,

795
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,990
it's an extra 30 cents I'll
have in the morning. So wait a,

796
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,390
you can bet on a game
that's already going.

797
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,540
So it's eight to three
two,

798
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,480
why wouldn't you take in the fucking, oh,
you did take the Yankees, right? Wait,

799
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:47,650
the Yankees were being the red sox. Eight
to three I got, oh, I'm dumb people.

800
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:51,220
I get to work this out. They were giving
odds on the red sox nine to one. Okay,

801
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:55,510
so you got to put up 900 bucks to make a
hundred at that point or $9 to make one

802
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:58,000
bill. They took out the Zeros,
they tried to make it easy for you.

803
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,360
And then the Yankees, you throw down
a dollar, you can make a hundred

804
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,730
so you said fuck it. There's no
way the Yankees are going to lose.

805
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,430
And let's see, you could have made 30
cents. You put down what? 300 bucks?

806
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:18,380
Is that how it works? What'd you
put down? Three, three bucks.

807
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:22,100
You put down three bucks. It's cheap.
Fuck your bitch in about three bucks

808
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:28,070
a fucker. What's going on in this? So
anyways, he said, what? What the fuck?

809
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:32,270
Sort of Mickey Mouse Bullshit team or
the Yankees to fuck that up so bad.

810
00:48:32,271 --> 00:48:34,640
It's brutal.
Losing 30 well 30 bucks,

811
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,700
losing 30 bucks trying to win 30
cents do the math doesn't oh yeah,

812
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:42,830
that's right. That's right.
Yeah. Okay, great. 30 cents.

813
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Imagine I could be fighting in a war
alongside you guys with a bag of live hand

814
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:51,290
grenades on my back. Yeah, dude,

815
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:54,950
I don't know how you made the lept
from the leap from fucking, uh,

816
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,550
that game to fighting in a war.

817
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,753
Yeah.

818
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:05,890
I don't know what kind of fucking asshole
goes to sleep trying to make 30 cents

819
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:09,710
serves your right. Your cheap fucker. You
should have bet the under dog. Oh wait,

820
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:14,270
you did? No you didn't.
You bet the favorite. Well,
you know what your deal is,

821
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,020
you guys overseas, all you know is
the Yankees the same way over here.

822
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:22,730
All we know is a,
what the fuck are they a man United?

823
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:27,340
That's the only team we know. I mean, I
know some of the arsenal, uh, or arsenal,

824
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,170
I don't know Liverpool,
but I don't know what they're called.

825
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,120
I just know man United, Manchester
United. That's all I fucking know.

826
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:35,631
And you know what?

827
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:38,930
I don't like them cause this shit's
over here and they're like the fucking,

828
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,460
I dunno. I don't want, I don't like the
team that everybody likes, you know,

829
00:49:43,461 --> 00:49:45,890
fucked him. So I'm sorry sir. I'm sorry.

830
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:48,590
You lost $30 trying to make 30 cents.

831
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:52,930
Would that even by a half a fucking cup
of tea or whatever the fuck you going to

832
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:56,510
do over there by your one chip for
your fish and chip fucking breakfast.

833
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,980
Um, anyways, but either way, dude,
thanks for buying tickets to the uh,

834
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:05,780
the London show. Uh, like I said,
it really is humbling to have that.

835
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:07,970
If I can use that fucking
phrase without getting trashed,

836
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,850
it really is that people over there
give a shit and want to come out.

837
00:50:10,851 --> 00:50:15,740
So I hope I'm funny. I'm all
right. Ken Burns. Dear Billy boy,

838
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:20,990
I heard you talking about the Ken Burns
documentary recently and why don't you

839
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:21,843
turn on,

840
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:26,600
turn you on to one of his documentaries
that I've yet to see but I hear is great.

841
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,290
Um, and for those of you
have been listening the past
few weeks, I've been slowly,

842
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,680
when I have the time getting
through a Ken Burns the war,

843
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,700
it's all about World War II.
I think I'm through five episodes.

844
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:43,330
It's a seven part series and it
is absolutely fucking incredible.

845
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:47,210
The footage.
I think a lot of the footage,

846
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,150
like they wouldn't show
for the longest time,

847
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:54,710
like the really shows the, uh, it's,

848
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,950
it's not a propaganda film.
Put it that way. It's,

849
00:50:56,951 --> 00:51:01,250
it's an absolutely
astounding thing to watch.

850
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,840
It's so amazing. It's actually
caused me to, I'm starting to read,

851
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,910
not only read but read about the war and
for dummy like me to actually want to

852
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:13,240
go out and start reading books.
Um,

853
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,100
although I had to take a break because it
was so fucking heavy, some of the shit,

854
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,890
uh, than, uh, right now I'm reading a,

855
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,390
that guy from ministry and reading his
autobiography and if you want to feel

856
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:25,310
better about some of the
choices you've made in life,

857
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,340
like maybe you think I'm a piece
of shit. I did this, I did that.

858
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:30,680
I partied too much.
You got to read this guy's book.

859
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,250
You're going to feel like you don't have
any sort of substance abuse problem.

860
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,240
I'm not shitting on the guy.
The guy's a fucking genius. Um,

861
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,320
and I'm totally late to the party when
it comes to great music from the 80s.

862
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:46,570
I listened to so much shit
music in the 80s, and uh,

863
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:51,250
I completely missed out on all this
amazing stuff that was going on.

864
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:55,460
Ministry being one of them. And what's
funny is the song that I liked the best,

865
00:51:55,850 --> 00:52:00,850
he hates and says he hates it because
the people who like it or like people who

866
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:06,050
were into metal, uh, it's
Stigmata I fucking love it.

867
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,790
And I like it because it sounds like a
metal song with all this in a industrial

868
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:12,320
shit. Don't, I don't even
know anything about it.

869
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:14,090
He would cringe if he heard any of this,

870
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,630
but I actually had to put the book down
and started laughing cause he totally

871
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,930
called me out as I'm reading
the book. Uh, he used to say no,

872
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,780
there was just a throwaway song.
But anyways,

873
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:27,880
it's on this album called the land of rape
and honey, which is an avid, it was a,

874
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:32,060
I guess as a fucking classic and I never
heard anything about it because I was

875
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:35,630
listening to Motley Crue theater
of pain when that came out.

876
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,510
Um, so anyways, so he says,
let me get back to this.

877
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:47,900
So he says, Ken Burns has another great
documentary. By the way, I'm watching all,

878
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:52,370
I'm watching all of Ken Burns'
documentaries, uh, on Netflix. Uh, I've,

879
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:57,050
I'm doing civil war next, but this
guy's actually suggesting, uh, he's, uh,

880
00:52:57,051 --> 00:53:00,140
there's a new one called prohibition.
He goes,

881
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,200
I haven't seen it yet because I'm in
the middle of a book about prohibition,

882
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:05,090
but I find the whole subject fascinating,

883
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,690
not only because it talks about how
the majority of the working class were

884
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:09,524
drunks,

885
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:13,130
but it gets all into the politics and
cultural issues associated with drinking

886
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:17,240
back in the day and how the
breweries changed America. Also,

887
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,530
Merck also,

888
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:23,210
there are many similarities to the
whole weed movement we see nowadays. Uh,

889
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:27,510
did you ever find yourself in a dry
county or a state where you can't find a

890
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,410
beer in the grocery store with some of
our alcohol related laws can be traced

891
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:35,730
back to prohibition and the crazy shit
that caused it are drunk and forefathers.

892
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,970
Uh, you know, it's funny, dude,
you're just like me. You spent,

893
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:43,290
you spelled fore fathers, f, O,
u, R as in one, two, three, four.

894
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,520
Isn't it for free? I don't
know. Fuck it now. Uh,

895
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:50,070
our drunken forefathers would get out of
their industrial jobs at the end of the

896
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:54,030
day. Look to decompress a bit and
stay in pubs all night. Soon enough,

897
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,710
these guys started bringing home STDs to
their wives and banging all the horrors

898
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:00,360
that also stayed in the pubs all night.

899
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,200
Their wives started getting upset and
fast forward a bit and then you have

900
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:08,790
prohibition. Some guys just
ruined it for everyone really.

901
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:12,450
Well, I knew it kind of came out of
the church. Uh, I didn't know that.

902
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:16,050
I just heard somebody say
that and I took it as law. Um,

903
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,330
thanks for the heads up
and thanks to everybody.

904

Hairy situation here that did something

Podcasts.
My girlfriend,

969
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:13,540
who I've lived with for the last seven
years is starting to constantly ask me to

970
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:17,350
shave my chest. Oh, I went the other
way. Oh, you went the other way?

971
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,030
Um, I'm pretty hairy, but
not fucking Chewbacca Harry.

972
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,720
Just mainly my chest.
This is not a problem,

973
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:29,200
but sometimes she won't
have sex with me until I do.

974
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,020
Whoa. All right. That's, that's a,
okay. That's red flag number one for me.

975
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,813
Okay.

976
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,750
Unless you're, you're
not perceptive as to, uh,

977
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,020
how Harry your chest is a,

978
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,360
it can take over an hour
to properly to do properly.

979
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:50,020
And sometimes I can't be
fucked after a hard day's work,

980
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:55,960
so I just rub one out. I know times
change because in the 70s, Harry was sexy,

981
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,110
but now every pop stars dying
to look more like a woman.

982
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,090
I swear Justin Bieber is prettier than
half the women. I Bang. What do you think?

983
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,640
Um,
yeah,

984
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:10,840
that whole manscape looked I
guess is supposed to be in.

985
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:14,440
I have no idea. But um, I find it odd.

986
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:15,830
Okay.

987
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,870
I don't find it odd that you're,
you're

988
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,840
girlfriend is asking to uh, you know,
maybe trim down your chest a little bit,

989
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:28,100
but the fact that she won't
even have sex with you, um,

990
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,270
I dunno what happened.

991
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:32,530
Okay.

992
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,420
Did some pervert with the fucking

993
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,320
full full chest of hair fucking lay down
on top of her and do something to her.

994
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,220
Like that's kind of weird to me.

995
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:48,000
Like how do you think she would feel if
you were like, Hey, can you a, I dunno,

996
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,380
trim up here or there or I
literally can't have sex with you.

997
00:59:50,381 --> 00:59:55,150
That's kind of fucked up. She's really
making you jump through some hoops there.

998
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,330
Um, so you're either way
hairier than you're letting on.

999
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,940
I get women being grossed
out by back here, you know,

1000
01:00:03,941 --> 01:00:07,630
especially those guys who have it like
up on their shoulders and then they just

1001
01:00:07,631 --> 01:00:11,560
have like the two patches just above
the kidney and just below the shoulder

1002
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:14,900
blade. This, those two,
like they got, I dunno,

1003
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,220
like they got hugged by someone
who jerked off too much.

1004
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,740
Um, I would sit down with
her and just be like, listen,

1005
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,470
I'm not going to say I'm not
going to fucking shape my chest,

1006
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:31,920
but it's kind of weird
to me that if I don't,

1007
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,140
you don't even find me sexually
attractive. I mean, what do you,

1008
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,790
are you having sex with my
chest or you end to me. I mean,

1009
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:41,700
I could see if this is a one night stand,
you're like, listen, I'm into this.

1010
01:00:41,701 --> 01:00:45,990
I'm not into that. Do this, do this. And
for the love of God, shut the fuck up.

1011
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,540
All right. And you have your little
grocery list on how you need,

1012
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,820
what you need me to do to get you there.
I get that.

1013
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,350
But if I'm in a fucking relationship
with you, you know, that's,

1014
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,180
that's kind of a, but you know,
you didn't really even ask that.

1015
01:00:58,181 --> 01:01:00,850
I don't even know what
the fuck he asked me. Um,

1016
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,140
okay.

1017
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,460
It takes you an hour to do it.

1018
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,800
Don't they have like those fucking
things you can just kind of,

1019
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:11,250
I know that's weird.
That's fucking weird to me.

1020
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,170
I would, I would do, that
would be my biggest concern.

1021
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,870
I would be asking her like what?
You can't even have sex with me?

1022
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,480
I know what I understand on your face
because some women have sensitive skin,

1023
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:27,560
you know, and when you know, if you're
on top of her missionary style hood,

1024
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:32,440
you know, pumping away, if you're out of
shape, you land your head right down next.

1025
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,880
You can get a little razor
burn other side of the face.

1026
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:44,850
I understand that if you have like,
you have like a beard,

1027
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,530
if you have whiskers,
I I fucking get that shit.

1028
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,170
Can I just do that again
and I'm not going to do it.

1029
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:55,040
Cause some people that it might hurt
your fucking ears. Um, I understand that.

1030
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:59,400
But chest hair, why don't you,
why don't you come up with like a,

1031
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,490
a compromise. Be like, all right,

1032
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:06,020
how bout if my chest is to Harry,
we still bang. I just do it.

1033
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:09,830
Doggy style. I promise. After
I get to where I need to go,

1034
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:13,700
I won't collapse down on top of
you making you feel like, you know,

1035
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:16,790
Burt Reynolds just got out of the
pool and is using you to towel off.

1036
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,050
I won't do that.
Okay.

1037
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,930
Maybe you could do or just sit down
with her and just be like, listen,

1038
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:25,980
I'm not trying to be a dick here.
What is your issue with Harry Chess?

1039
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:31,170
And uh, cause it's, you know,
I, you know, it's funny,

1040
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:34,140
I'm getting more weirded
out by it by then. You are,

1041
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,960
I'm probably putting bad ideas and he had,
so I'm just going to shut the fuck up.

1042
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,880
I'm all right. Military history.
Ah, this is a great one. Hey,

1043
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:44,670
grateful read. Ah, I love it.

1044
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:50,370
Just when you think they've run out of
creative ways. Ah, that's a good one. Uh,

1045
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:54,450
the past couple of shows you mentioned
you enjoy reading about World War II.

1046
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:58,230
Just wanted to give you a
couple of recommendations.
First I'd like to mention,

1047
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,070
uh, Oh, before he gets going.
I, I read that book a fly boys,

1048
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,500
which I swear to God is not
about boy bands. It was by,
I forget who wrote it. Uh,

1049
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:12,420
Jesus Christ on the worst, the same
day I did flags of our fathers, um,

1050
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,440
wrote the same thing. Anyways, the past
couple of shows you mentioned blah, blah,

1051
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,300
Blah books on World War II. Going to
give you a couple of recommendations.

1052
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:22,200
First I'd like to mention
Dan Carlin's part podcast,

1053
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,180
hardcore history. I'm telling you it's
right up your alley, dude. Good call.

1054
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,320
I'm listening to that.

1055
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:33,120
He's covered many aspects of history
from the bronze age to the relatively

1056
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:37,290
modern age. If he can make the bronze
age, which I don't even know what that is.

1057
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:38,790
Okay.

1058
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:42,880
Like, uh, I, I can't
deal with it. You know,

1059
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,460
you'll leave people I
can really read about.

1060
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:46,770
Yeah.

1061
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,900
From way back in the day,

1062
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,440
which is basically anything before cowboys
and Indians is you have to be a mass

1063
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:59,270
murdering psychopath. Like I can read
about these, the inquisitions, uh,

1064
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,010
or the inquisition. I don't
fucking know if it's plural or not.

1065
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:06,330
I agreed about that. Gaviscon
oh, I could read about, um,

1066
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,500
Attila the hun.

1067
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:08,750
Okay.

1068
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:13,580
You know, basically the original scarfaces
I could read about those guys. And,

1069
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,080
uh, but other shit, you know,

1070
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,460
ancient medieval history and the fucking
Lilliputians we're going up against the

1071
01:04:19,461 --> 01:04:23,300
fucking, uh, Persian empire.
I don't, fuck, I, I dunno,

1072
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,120
I can't deal with that shit. Um, so
if he can make that interesting, I,

1073
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,640
I dunno, maybe I could listen to enough
of it and actually sound intelligent.

1074
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,770
Who knows. So anyways, he says, uh,

1075
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,880
but I suggest is series ghosts ghosts
of the the what does that asked front?

1076
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,820
It's the mind blowing,

1077
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:47,360
but little talked about conflict between
the Russians and the Germans. Yeah,

1078
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:50,360
they really do skip over that.
Um,

1079
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,690
in fact a lot of few people
don't live in this country.

1080
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:57,980
A lot of what they talk about when World
War II, they do talk about Pearl Harbor,

1081
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,010
which set the whole thing off,
but there's very,

1082
01:05:01,011 --> 01:05:05,720
they don't talk even about the Japanese
that much. It kind of Pearl Harbor. Uh,

1083
01:05:05,721 --> 01:05:09,050
they were winning at first battle of
midway and then we're dropping the two

1084
01:05:09,051 --> 01:05:10,520
fucking bombs and that's it.

1085
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:14,740
And then you watch jaws and you hear
about the Indianapolis right signature and

1086
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,880
may go into water.
Dad,

1087
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:21,820
[inaudible] all we eat away to go
home. And that's how you learn. Right?

1088
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:27,240
But they mainly talk about fighting
the Germans and mainly d day.

1089
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:29,910
Hmm.

1090
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:34,170
Basically from France going right
into German concentration camp,

1091
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:39,960
Schindler's list. All right. Hitler killed
himself in the bunker game set match,

1092
01:05:39,961 --> 01:05:43,470
wipe your hands of it all right.
Then we're immediately into the Cold War.

1093
01:05:43,471 --> 01:05:48,120
But they also ignore, you know,
fighting the Germans in, in Africa,

1094
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,020
uh,

1095
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:53,610
fighting the Italians in Italy there and
how we went about it and all this stuff

1096
01:05:53,611 --> 01:05:54,930
that happened.
And uh,

1097
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,350
yeah.

1098
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,990
And then they certainly don't
talk about all we hear about the,

1099
01:05:59,991 --> 01:06:04,991
the Russians is basically they just
retreated and they drew them in and then

1100
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:06,860
when the winter came,

1101
01:06:06,861 --> 01:06:10,310
they just mercilessly hacked them to
death all the way back to fucking Berlin.

1102
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,250
That's all we hear.
I didn't know that they were just,

1103
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,800
first of all,
as they were retreating,

1104
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,800
they were blowing up their
own bridges and dams and just,

1105
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,160
yeah.

1106
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,650
Scorched scorched earth
thing that they did,

1107
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,200
literally destroyed their
own fucking country.

1108
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:29,440
So there was nothing there for the
Germans. It was fucking brilliant.

1109
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:34,150
And absolutely fucking ruthless.
I would love, you know what,

1110
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,150
that's something I'm going to do
on the rug. Thank you very much.

1111
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:39,190
What a wonderful suggestion.
As I got to there.

1112
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,870
Do you know what's great about those?

1113
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,720
Both of those will make me more
informed and hopefully a better person.

1114
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,390
Look at you guys paying it forward.

1115
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,450
Maybe I can give somebody
some good advice there. Well,

1116
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:53,140
let me just continue here
since incidentally I discovered
your podcast because

1117
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:53,890
of him.

1118
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:57,790
He was a guest on the Joe Rogan experience
and I started listening to Joe Rogan

1119
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:02,020
regularly, which led me to your glorious
show. Oh, isn't that great? Yeah.

1120
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:05,600
Rogin has done a lot for me. He
really has, when he hyped that, um,

1121
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,710
that Yoko Ono thing I did,

1122
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:13,711
that thing was like a year old and then
he talked about it and then that was it.

1123
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,540
There was like a zillion people,
he's like the,

1124
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:19,600
he has like Oprah Winfrey level power,
like were more than Oprah Winfrey said,

1125
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:22,630
hey man, I don't think you should
be eating red meat anymore.

1126
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:27,370
And all of Texas declared war on her
because she had that level of power.

1127
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:31,420
That's what Rogan is.
It like the podcast world.

1128
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:35,470
If that fucking guy says,
hey, check out this thing,

1129
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:39,310
all of a sudden like it
gets a million hits. So, uh,

1130
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:43,930
I got to do something for him. What,
what, what do you, what do you get?

1131
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:47,980
What'd you get for Joe Rogan? I should
buy him a new pair of Mitts, you know,

1132
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:52,270
by him as his fucking vitamins for the
week. Some sort of workout shit, not ana.

1133
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,350
He has all of that stuff. I got to
go against the grain with Joe Rogan.

1134
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,050
What should I, you know,
I'd buy him a nice son. Had,

1135
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,920
you know,
really thoughtful gift like Joe,

1136
01:08:05,921 --> 01:08:10,921
I know you have everything that involves
choking somebody out or ending their

1137
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:15,780
life if they fuck with you on any
level. You know, Bob on a nice sun had,

1138
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,710
has anybody done anything to help keep
the sun out of that wonderful man's eyes?

1139
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,940
I don't think they have.

1140
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:28,850
And I think he's comfortable enough
with himself that he could accept the

1141
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:32,510
unbelievably awkward, intimate moment of
me handing them that hat. You know what?

1142
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:37,070
Next time I do is fucking podcast. I'm
bringing them a nice sun hat. You know,

1143
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,380
I don't know. He might have
a convertible. Who knows?

1144
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,920
Is there such a thing as a sun hat?
This is sun dress.

1145
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:47,870
Then I just invent a new fucking hat.
There you go. People right there.

1146
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,580
Look at me creating a whole new business,

1147
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,270
creating jobs here at the Monday
morning podcast. Either way.

1148
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:56,750
Listen to the Joe Rogan experience and
when you're done doing that, by the way,

1149
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,700
uh,
me and Al Madrigal and some other,

1150
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:02,690
a wonderful people have started
the all things comedy network.

1151
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:06,860
If you like this podcast, if you'd
like to have a nice, incredible,

1152
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:08,960
wide variety of podcasts,
listen to,

1153
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:12,680
I suggest that you go to the all
things comedy podcast network and uh,

1154
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,230
have listened Harlan Williams,
Tom Papa,

1155
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,540
a baron Vaughn.
Tom Said Gara wow.

1156
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:23,900
With the fucking, uh, we
got all kinds of people.

1157
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,290
Your mom's house podcast there where
you'd think I would have them in front of

1158
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:31,040
me. Minivan men. There's all kinds
of great one Harlan's highway.

1159
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,990
All right,
here we go from a lady higher bill.

1160
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:41,690
Hi a kid, uh, lady listener here.
I have two questions in one email.

1161
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:43,880
I hope that's alright with you will.
Absolutely.

1162
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:47,840
I'm just like that a woman actually is
listening to this podcast and wants to

1163
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:52,020
contribute. I've been asking you guys
borderline begging you, you know,

1164
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:56,810
to get out of the kitchen, figure out how
a computer works and send me an email.

1165
01:09:56,811 --> 01:09:57,710
But she just,
you know,

1166
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,990
you're too busy making a sandwich
for the man in your life,

1167
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:03,800
which is what you're supposed to do, you
know. But you know, every once in a while,

1168
01:10:03,801 --> 01:10:08,600
don't be afraid of the computer
ladies. Um, all right, lady.

1169
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:11,630
Listen. Okay, the two questions,
the first one is about marriage.

1170
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,690
I'm just wondering how
do you feel about it?

1171
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,840
I'm only 18 and seeing what it is doing
to my parents recently is making me not

1172
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:23,810
open to the idea in the future. Um,
all right, well this is the thing,

1173
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,780
just because your parents don't
seem to have a happy marriage,

1174
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:31,280
it doesn't mean that you
can't. All right. I think, uh,

1175
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:36,110
if you go into to being married, married
for the right reasons, and if you're,

1176
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:39,140
uh,
you're mature enough,

1177
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,420
which I've never have been and I've been
a fucking complete piece of shit with

1178
01:10:44,421 --> 01:10:46,700
women and all that type of
stuff and I've been an APP

1179
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,770
is your 20s are coming up.
Um,

1180
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:59,840
you know, as your 20s
are coming up, you know,

1181
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,320
you're going to meet some people that
you're going to look at and that you're

1182
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:07,430
going to feel like you have a heart attack
and don't fucking walk away from the

1183
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:08,540
go up to that person.

1184
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:13,260
Just because your parents may be haven't
found true love doesn't mean you can't.

1185
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,690
Eh, you know, you can find true love.

1186
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:19,710
And then if you work at it and you
do the things you're supposed to do,

1187
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:23,910
what you'll learn naturally
as you get older, you can
have a great time. You know?

1188
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:27,510
Is there anything better than seeing
like two old people sitting together and

1189
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:30,160
you can see they still have
that connection and they got to,

1190
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:34,230
they literally enjoy life together.
What I wish I knew when I was younger,

1191
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,630
how important that was.
You know,

1192
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:40,260
I'm finally starting to see it through
all of my fucking horrific mistakes that

1193
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:42,450
I've made in that category.
But like a

1194
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:44,913
mmm.

1195
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,740
I think you should be open to it.

1196
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:50,520
You should be open to your 18
you should be open to things.

1197
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,090
I'm not saying drug use and
being promiscuous and that
type of thing. Smartsheet.

1198
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,890
I mean, uh, finding love. You
should definitely be open to

1199
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,300
not happy, particularly your
parents. And you're like, well,

1200
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:09,720
this just seems like a lot
of work to just be miserable.

1201
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:11,390
MMM.

1202
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,150
That doesn't mean you have to be
miserable. All right, there you go.

1203
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:17,440
So there's just, that's
your first one. All right.

1204
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,000
My second question she says is about
how and when one should introduce a

1205
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:23,800
significant other to parents.

1206
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:25,823
MMM.

1207
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,680
Just to give you more information.

1208
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:32,210
My boyfriend's 21 and in the last year
of college we've been together for about

1209
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:35,060
a year and five months.
All right.

1210
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,660
That's some scary math there
depending on what state you're in. Uh,

1211
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:44,030
every time I am going to hang out with
him or have a sleep over at his house,

1212
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,770
I've been making up an excuse.

1213
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:50,570
Like I'm going to a concert that ends
really late going to stay with a friend.

1214
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:55,070
I can't seem to work up the nerve
to tell either my mom or dad.

1215
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:58,460
I am more worried about my dad
because he's a fucking big mouth.

1216
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:01,550
The whole family would know by the
end of the night when he's drinking on

1217
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:02,031
weekends.

1218
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:06,470
He likes to bring up conversations just
to work on people's nerves in the house.

1219
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:10,190
I don't want my boyfriend to be the topic
in the House for my dad to get on my

1220
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:13,850
nerves with. So do I just go
with the, if it ain't broke,

1221
01:13:13,851 --> 01:13:18,851
don't fix it route and keep making shitty
excuses until they either find out on

1222
01:13:19,071 --> 01:13:23,570
their own or I move out of the house or
do I just work up some balls here and

1223
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:25,070
tell them that I have a boyfriend?

1224
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:30,820
Well they're gonna find out eventually
and when they find out you're not going

1225
01:13:31,221 --> 01:13:35,390
to have control over
the situation. So, um,

1226
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:36,990
okay.

1227
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,790
I kind of got lost there.
We you,

1228
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:44,000
you make up excuses to your parents or
to your boyfriend. Let me go back here.

1229
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,480
Micro.
Second question is Alba.

1230
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,590
Okay.

1231
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,050
How do I introduce my
boyfriend and my parents? Okay.

1232
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:53,170
Every time I'm going to hang out
with him with sleep over his house,

1233
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:57,910
I've been making up an excuse.
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Uh, this is what I would do.

1234
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:01,960
They are probably the more you say I'm
going to another concert that's going to

1235
01:14:01,961 --> 01:14:06,720
end like they're going to figure it
out. How do you introduce your parents?

1236
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,860
Uh, do your boyfriend. I
would just, I would do this.

1237
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,880
I wouldn't say shit to your parents other
than I have a boyfriend now and I want

1238
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:20,260
to introduce him to you guys and I would
leave it at that because your parents

1239
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:22,570
are your parents and they're
going to behave how they behave.

1240
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:26,410
And then what I would do is I
would give a pregame speech to, uh,

1241
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:31,390
to your boyfriend and be
like, look, I love my parents.
They're a little bit nuts.

1242
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:36,160
And this is the thing too. You're
probably going to overreact, you know,

1243
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,700
like the fear you have of what they're
going to do is going to be so much bigger

1244
01:14:39,701 --> 01:14:41,620
probably than what they're
actually going to do.

1245
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,720
It's because they're your parents.

1246
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,000
You want their approval and you
fucking hate them all at the same

1247
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:56,610
and it's going to be like just
walking into a store like, hello sir,

1248
01:14:56,611 --> 01:15:00,960
can I help you? Yes. I like
that shirt. There you go.
That'll be nine 95. Thank you.

1249
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:05,650
Goodbye. It's going to be at
that level a little bit more. Um,

1250
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,300
it's just going to be nice. They just
going to be exchanging niceties. Okay.

1251
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,040
That's what I'm predicting
is going to happen.

1252
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,730
And then what's going to happen is
when he, when your boyfriend leaves,

1253
01:15:14,731 --> 01:15:18,960
he's going to tell you how nice your
parents are because why wouldn't you?

1254
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:21,600
And then that's probably going to know
you want some level cause you're gonna be

1255
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:24,000
like, no, they're fucking assholes.
You haven't had to live with them.

1256
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:26,640
So don't do that to him either.
Um,

1257
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,580
I would take control of the
situation and just introduce him.

1258
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:31,843
MMM.

1259
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,510
And if they ask how long you've been
seeing him, you know, when you first say,

1260
01:15:36,511 --> 01:15:39,420
I want you to introduce, I want it
to introduce my boyfriend to you.

1261
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:41,520
And if they asked how long
you've been seeing him,

1262
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,850
I don't know your dad's
drinks. And he says, Shit,

1263
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,300
you might want to lie about that.
I Dunno, I'll fuck him if he does.

1264
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,320
Don't lie to them.
Say about a year and five months.

1265
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,550
And if they say, well why have you brought
him around? Just be like, well dad,

1266
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:59,550
cause you have a tendency to get drunk
and talk about everybody's business in a

1267
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:03,750
row is really, uh, made me
nervous. That's why I didn't,

1268
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,040
you can't fuck with the truth.

1269
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:06,650
Okay.

1270
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:11,300
What's he going to say to that? I don't
get drunk and say all that type of shit.

1271
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:15,890
I guess he could be in denial.
I don't know. At some point,

1272
01:16:15,891 --> 01:16:18,540
you know what you have to do.
You got to like you,

1273
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,280
you got to man up or woman up and you
just have to live your fucking life and

1274
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:23,570
you just have to understand that yeah,

1275
01:16:23,571 --> 01:16:25,820
your parents are your
parents to fucking awesome,

1276
01:16:25,821 --> 01:16:30,310
but they're just people and
you just really have to, uh,
in a, in a healthy weight,

1277
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:34,790
not give a fuck what they think anymore
in a healthy way. Okay. I don't mean like,

1278
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:37,940
like I said, go out and start doing
drugs and being a fucking idiot.

1279
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:43,550
You should always care about not
bringing shame to your family name,

1280
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:46,850
but like as far as that other stuff,
like I wanted you to be a doctor,

1281
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:51,080
but you're going to fucking, I
dunno. Open your own bakery. The,

1282
01:16:51,081 --> 01:16:53,660
I'm so disappointed. Well,
be disappointed. Okay.

1283
01:16:53,661 --> 01:16:57,410
Cause I don't want to fucking sit there
vacuum and out somebody's ass or looking

1284
01:16:57,411 --> 01:17:00,440
at somebody's toes or working on a brain.
Whatever the fuck a doctor does,

1285
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:05,930
I want to make pop tarts. All
right. That's gonna make me happy.

1286
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:09,860
If you can't accept that, then I don't
want to tell you. All right people,

1287
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:13,460
