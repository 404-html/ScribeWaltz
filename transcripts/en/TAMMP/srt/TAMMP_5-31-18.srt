1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,040
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:10,960
Just before Friday. Monday morning
podcast. And I'm just checking in on you.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,910
All right? I can't even tell you what a
great mood I was in seven minutes ago,

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,350
seven minutes ago. Everything was
fucking fine. And then what happens?

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,530
What happens in my whole
technology fucking world?

6
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,720
Just it just, you know,
Internet's not working.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,500
I got to go into the one room in my house
where the Internet works for whatever

8
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:37,120
fucking reason. Uh, you
know, it's a cloudy day.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Uh, you gotta upgrade your fucking
something or other, you know,

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,560
all I wanted to see,
you know,

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,790
I found out that Liverpool lost the cup
final and I know what all you assholes

12
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,200
and doing the fuck do you find
out now? You know why? You know,

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,020
I just found out now because I
have American Internet. Okay.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,070
Do you know how many pages I have to
scroll through to find fucking soccer

15
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:03,130
highlights and meet? It's after
the Germans scat films. Okay.

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,650
That's where the fuck it is in
this country. And by the way,

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,450
I found out that most solid guy

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,140
got his shoulder yank out by some
content, the other team. And,

19
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:16,150
and good luck trying to find a
video of the actual God damn play.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,101
I swear to God,

21
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:22,150
I want to fucking find every content out
there that is acting like they have the

22
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:22,871
video.
Do you don't,

23
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:27,520
one of the websites I went to head
it had the silence of the crowd.

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,820
That was the video. I don't know. I
see that. I want to see the injury.

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,001
Fuck.

26
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,570
I want to sit there and look at some
fat cunt crying over his fish and chips.

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,840
I want to see what happened.
Cause this,

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,920
the picture that I saw looked
like that guy grabbed adi,

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,940
pulled the Kelly Olynyk you
fucking grabbed onto the
thing and fucking yanked it

30
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,084
out.

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,003
MMM.

32
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,960
Anyways, uh, I mean, what, what kind
of fucking world do you live in?

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,250
Okay,

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,580
we'll you're trying to get more money
off of advertising by pulling some shit

35
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,414
like that.

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,220
Swear to fucking God will get
legal. We'll have fun. Edge babbled.

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,730
We'll have them walking out of the
stadium with his fucking arm in a sling.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,510
Hey, you got you got, you got the Zapruder
film. Oh yeah, we got it. You know,

39
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:26,330
what do they do?
They show somebody fucking with it.

40
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,150
They hand over their mouth. They don't
show the actual fucking assassination.

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,000
God, I was in such a good fucking
mood since such a great mood.

42
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,320
You know, I woke up, daughter woke
me up. Who's kidding? Who Right.

43
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,260
Made a breakfast as I always do.
We had a great time.

44
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,810
We sang the Itsy bitsy spider 5,000 times.

45
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:52,730
I was in a great mood and then for
whatever reason, my stupid recorder,

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,600
the metronome got turned on. I
did not turn that off. So, uh,

47
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,310
rather than relaxing and trying to
figure it out, I broke my headphones.

48
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,330
Can you believe this? This
all all unraveled. You don't,

49
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,460
my wife loved me seven minutes ago.

50
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,410
I'm turning 50 and I'm still behaving
like this. I just broke one of my toys,

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,700
like a goddamn toddler. Do you
guys realize that? That's you?

52
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,920
You're listening to a child?

53
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,250
Maybe that's why God had me go bald
because I was acting like a baby.

54
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,100
He wanted me to look like

55
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,093
one

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,260
big old baby,
a big old bearded baby.

57
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,360
I should be down in Coney island.
Right.

58
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,530
And they should just have me one of the
cages next to the bearded lady and just

59
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:40,520
have me trying to fucking figure out
something that involves any remote basic

60
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:44,930
technology. You know, look
at that big all angry baby.

61
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,090
He's 50 years old,
but you wouldn't know it.

62
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:50,480
Just watching me breaking
fucking headphones and recorders.

63
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,963
Ah God.

64
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,800
And I'd love to tell you that turned
50 is this profound thing and that I'm

65
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:00,260
going to change, but I swear
to God I'm not all going to be,

66
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,810
I'm going to be breaking my
walkers when I'm fucking 90.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,100
Alma said 80 and then I bumped it up
to 90 cause I just said walkers. Um,

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,290
just no fucking way, you
know, speaking of which, um,

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,540
I'm back to working out to get yet
another time attempting with the shoulder.

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,830
Cause I,
I'm impatient,

71
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:20,720
I moved to up too quickly and
weight and I reactivate my shoulder.

72
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:24,770
I don't hurt it again, I just aggravate
it. But, uh, I really do miss,

73
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,910
I miss working out and lifting
weights and all that shit.

74
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:33,200
Get a little pump going, you know, so
I'm doing it with very lightweight,

75
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,270
like put it this way. This is
how light the dumbbells are. Uh,

76
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,310
my dumbbells are,
are like pink baby blue.

77
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,860
I have one pound. It's
a girls. I have, uh,

78
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,700
three pounds. It's a boy.
All right. Are those no,

79
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,970
I don't wait. No. Two
pound, two pounds or purple.

80
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,610
I got the purple rain to pounders
the, it's a girl, one pounder.

81
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,370
And then I got the, it's
a boy, five pounder,

82
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,510
and then I got a six pound

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,120
color. They're orange. All right.

84
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,860
It's like I'm living, I'm working
out with Fisher price weights here.

85
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,910
Um,
anyways,

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,450
but I got that TRX band and that thanks
kind of been saving me a little bit. Um,

87
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,740
it's weird. I can't, like,

88
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,820
I can't bring weighed up to
the side and up to this side,

89
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,240
w like much more than three pounds
is out reaggregate my shoulder.

90
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,640
But for some reason I could do 50 pushups.

91
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,183
MMM.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,110
I don't know why I just told you that.

93
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:46,080
Cause now every person was even
remotely a personal trainer. You know,

94
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,720
they're gonna start giving me advice.
You can't bring up dogs

95
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,020
working out or uh, I don't
know. Something else.

96
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,890
How to shade your beaver. I don't, I don't
fucking off. You need three examples.

97
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,570
I'm sorry. I choked. I ran out of out
of thinks they're anyways, do you,

98
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,960
have you guys been watching the
Stanley Cup final? Not Finals,

99
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,580
the NBA finals start tonight,
but the standing Stanley Cup final,

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,590
the first two games in Las Vegas.

101
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:17,591
And I gotta tell you something I really
wanted to hate on the intro that the

102
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:18,680
vikings,

103
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,680
the Vikings thought the nights the Vegas
Knights had that game of Thrones shit

104
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,630
that they were doing. Uh, but
I get it. I get it. It's Vegas.

105
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,010
They got to put on a show.

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
They can't have strippers out
there cause there's kids there.

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,840
It was a kid friendly Vegas show.

108
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:39,050
I thought that shit that they were
doing on the ice was amazing. But, uh,

109
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,330
it was kind of funny how I remember
in the NBA when guys would dunk,

110
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,380
Aka black guys would dunk and
then they would do make that,

111
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:50,660
that motion across the neck. Like we just
slit your throat. And they were like,

112
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,840
that's too violet. That
A, is that a gang side?

113
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,830
They can't do that Eddie by right.
And then you turn on hockey.

114
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:02,120
It's a basically a bunch of white people
there out there dressed like nights.

115
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,100
They're not even miming
going across the neck.

116
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,910
They literally have a fucking
sword right across the neck.

117
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,070
Does all those kids there?
You know what I mean?

118
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,110
Maybe because he's dressed up like a
a night or something. Maybe, you know,

119
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,000
I have no fucking idea. But anyways,
uh, the games have been outstanding.

120
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,863
Uh,

121
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,450
it's really hard to root against
the Vegas Knights with that story,

122
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,570
whatever that GM or that coach said at
the beginning of the year than being an

123
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:32,650
expansion franchise.
He said to the players,

124
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,750
all of you are here for the same reasons.

125
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,280
Whoever you were just playing with tin
think you are worthy of being protected.

126
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,880
Something like that. And that's like the
beginning of all those fucking movies.

127
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,840
What, you know, they're going to
win the championship, you know,

128
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,440
sneak away from the Nazis like that
Sylvester Stallone movie where they played

129
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:55,400
soccer. Right. That's what the, how
this whole thing's playing out. But,

130
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,540
uh, I've become a capitals
fan just because, uh,

131
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,570
been hanging with Josh Adam
Meyers all these years,

132
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,490
so I got a root for his capitals.
Plus they've been waiting since 1974.

133
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,190
Who gives a shit? It's been great hockey.
I loved, uh, the shootout in game one.

134
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,430
Um,
as far as 10 goals being scored,

135
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,760
I was blown away by how fast uh,

136
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,050
Vegas was and just how relentless
there for check was. But, um,

137
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,370
and I did like that the,
uh, capitol stuck up for Tj,

138
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:33,400
Yoshi and knocked that one guy in
the nights on his fucking ass, uh,

139
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
which he got off easy by the way,

140
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,340
compared to what the fuck you guys
have been through and to a t j Oci.

141
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:43,520
They just decided that we're just going
to fucking go after this guy. Huh?

142
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,000
Is that what it is? Because he's getting
facewash slash boarded crosschecked end.

143
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,990
He finally fucking snapped and takes
a dump penalty. What's that guy? Well,

144
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,400
set needs to come and beat
the fuck out of somebody.

145
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,810
But I loved how the capitols in the
second game played a really physical game

146
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:05,250
and they slowed them down.
And um, and Jesus Christ,

147
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:09,930
that fucking safe.
That is the save of that might've saved.

148
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,200
Like if the capital's win the Stanley Cup,
he got us today, right there, that, that,

149
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:17,040
that fucking saved. They go,
they go back to Washington.

150
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,820
I'm going to go out on a limb here and
say really obvious stuff out there.

151
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,000
They got a big uphill climb to escape,

152
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,630
although the Cavalier's foot down o two
to the Celtics and came back at one four

153
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:31,464
out of five.

154
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,090
Oh God am I see when the red sox lost
to the mets and 86 we won the first two.

155
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,040
You realize that if you win,

156
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,450
the first to the other team has to have
to win four out of the next five and all

157
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:46,380
you gotta do is go two and three and
you're fucking blow it. Oh, it hurts.

158
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,330
Um, hats off to the Vegas crowd.
I got to give it up. You know,

159
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,370
the NHL chose so many wrong
cities throughout the years,

160
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,860
you know, to try to get excitement
going. You know, Carolina,

161
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:06,060
Phoenix, Atlanta, I mean, you know, Miami,

162
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,830
it just, you know, and I just was,

163
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:13,800
I was of that mindset of
what the fuck are they doing?

164
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,120
You know, why don't you just
put one in mobile, Alabama,

165
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,040
nobody gives a fuck about this shit.

166
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,880
You're going down into basketball
and football, country stock,

167
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:27,210
car racing in moon moon
shining. Well, you know,

168
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,321
I mean they,

169
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:33,060
they would rather stand along the
Appalachian trail and cheer on a hiker,

170
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,770
then go to a fucking hockey came south
of the Mason Dixon line. That was my,

171
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,620
my belief and my God, am I fucking
a, I'm quoting Paul and Scott,

172
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,490
that's mad.
Dabbin Jip.

173
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,870
Um, but I, I stand corrected
because I got to tell you something.

174
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,310
Fucking Nashville in Las Vegas,

175
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,080
the level that the fans are
going crazy in the stands,

176
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,500
that they're going more nuts
than anybody in the original six.

177
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,510
Granted we understand the game more so
we don't have to fucking scream and yell

178
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:09,871
like that,

179
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:14,160
but I think the Trifecta is going to be
Seattle as much as I trashed him earlier.

180
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:15,780
Those are great fans in Seattle.

181
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,380
They don't need any help to be
any louder than they already are.

182
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,060
But I will always contest the volume of
that football stadium cause I went to a

183
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:26,640
home game there and people were just
chatting before the game and I was like,

184
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:31,210
this is really fucking loud. And
people just talking normally. Um,

185
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,650
anyways, it was like that
fucking Metallica album would,

186
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:36,420
they made it like louder than 10.

187
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,320
The one that looked like a coffin in
a pussy on the, on the, on the, uh,

188
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,370
the album cover you had to like halfway
up and it was still blowing your

189
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,940
eardrums out. Did the owner of
the Seahawks produce that one

190
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,570
better? Um, anyways,

191
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,120
uh, I don't know. I'm just think that
that's going to be this research and,

192
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,390
and resurgence

193
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,940
after some missteps and some
of these cities by the NHL. And

194
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,600
I don't think that it will ever
quite go mainstream though. You know?

195
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,940
I actually watched game one at this
cigar butt. Oh look who's here.

196
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:19,440
The lovely Nia.
What's that?

197
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,470
Who's that from your agent when the
one of the batteries for her little uh,

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,500
toy going to come?

199
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,770
Yeah,
they are like watch batteries.

200
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:37,771
She has this little creepy little purple
monkey that she absolutely loves and it

201
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,070
just freaks me out.
It's like this.

202
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:43,940
It's something you'd seen a horror movie
right with that high pitched voice?

203
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,620
Yeah.
It's fucking head spinning around.

204
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,390
Stays on your finger.
Can you,

205
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,730
can you close the door near so she doesn't
hear all my feel filthy talking here.

206
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,740
Oh, bringing red. Bring a
red. Oh, it's the kid hour

207
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,870
she's coming in.
Oh,

208
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,730
the itsy bitsy spider went up the water
spot of saying this thousand times

209
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:11,564
today,

210
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,430
Dow came the rain and
washed the spider out. Hi.

211
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,120
Can you say hi?
Can you say hi?

212
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah. Yeah, go. Can you
say, can you say Dada?

213
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,970
Say Mama. Yes. Right.

214
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,790
You know where your bread's buttered.
Can you say Mama?

215
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,470
There you go.
Can you say baby

216
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,120
you go,
can you say thanks?

217
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,540
Can you say please?

218
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,200
Can you say dog?
What else should she,

219
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,200
she could say,
Hi Dad.

220
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,130
Nice. Very. Hi Mama.

221
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,980
Yeah,
that's right.

222
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,200
No love for Mama.
My favorite thing,

223
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,080
I love that I get the mornings
are mine, but with her. Ah,

224
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,800
that's right. I wake, I wake,
you wake me up a change a diaper.

225
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:25,820
If we give you your Baba, right. And then
I always make a breakfast. That's right.

226
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,180
Jitsu breakfast. And after
every bite she has to go. Yeah.

227
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,860
Yeah. Um, yeah.

228
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,790
What did you think about what the
capital's didn't game to how they, uh,

229
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,930
oh my God,
it was a real showing and saw you.

230
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:48,890
They got out there and they played
that game and I was like, whoa.

231
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,580
Can you say whoa? Wow. Yeah.

232
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,620
She likes you. The bubbles, those
little bubble things. She likes,

233
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:58,850
she blow the bubbles.

234
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,110
She likes to run into them and
break them with their face and go,

235
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,760
whoa. Bubbles. Right.

236
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,570
You like bubbles.

237
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,310
Um, all right, so nia, can you,

238
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,260
can you break down for the white audience?

239
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:23,210
What's going on with Drake and push your
tea? I actually listened to the song,

240
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm like, all right. So, you know,
he knocked up a porn star, allegedly,

241
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,180
allegedly,
uh,

242
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,440
this isn't going to end with a gun battle,
is it? No, that is not. No, that's not,

243
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:40,460
a lot of those guys are, those days
are over by that. Oh, it is. Okay.

244
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,820
No more gangster. You shot me in my
live or you shot me. You shot me.

245
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,150
Like I, that guy drives me up
the wall. No push. See had,

246
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,860
I can't listen to Drake
that took shots at Drake.

247
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,140
Drake shout back,

248
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,690
Pusha t shot back and Pusha t shot back
in a way that was even more devastating

249
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:10,070
than Drake's. Do you ever listen to
white music when that happens? Uh,

250
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:14,030
white music when, what happens?
Uh, answer songs, whatever,

251
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,950
giving each other crap,
but whatever.

252
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,180
Do you know what the original one was
as far as I know, the original one?

253
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,700
Uh, well maybe it was the
Flintstones when they had bug music.

254
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,130
Bug Music. I can't stand
bug music. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,380
He said, yeah. Yeah. You
remember that episode? They will.

256
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,820
They were trashing the Beatles
and the Beatles never answered it.

257
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,110
They were above. I'm
kidding. The, uh, the first,

258
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:43,580
the first one was a Neil young made
a song called southern man. Okay,

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,680
good. Tom Petty trashing
them? No, no, no, no, no, no.

260
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:52,950
Sweet Home Alabama. Okay.
Is An answer song. Okay.

261
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,540
It's all in the thing. I hope Neil
young will remember southern man.

262
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:01,540
Don't need them around anyhow. Sweet home,
Alabama, you know, and they, they never,

263
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,310
uh, they never shout at each
other anything. Wait, why
are you being an asshole?

264
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,250
Because you're like, wow. Yeah. Wow.

265
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,740
Heatedly that's impressive.
Why are you being an a hole?

266
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,320
I don't know what happened. Neil
young and who saying, all right,

267

You're always unit. Did you
hear her? She just talked to me.

270
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,880
That's the way she talks to it. Like wait,
staff people going out to eat with you.

271
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:39,060
It's just like, oh my God.

Bye.

Why?

280
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,580
All right. She gets so mad at
me when I bring that up. Um,

281
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,130
anyways. Yeah. I actually
listened to the song,

282
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,910
the Pusha t song so I could be informed
about what was going on and uh, you know,

283
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:28,500
I thought he brought up
a lot of points and a,

284
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:33,330
I don't know my answer song be like,
Ya. Yeah, I banged a porn star.

285
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,150
We got a kid and it's
costing me a lot of buddy.

286
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,850
Anyways, I still got enough of my own
Lamborghini. I Dunno what, what, what,

idea? What am I talking about here? Why?

288
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:51,501

video of this most solid guy getting a,

289
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:58,030
this, this cheap shot here. That is what
happened, right? Because I was thinking,

290
00:18:58,031 --> 00:19:01,180
how the hell do you separate
your shoulder playing soccer?

291
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,830
You're not allowed to use your hands.

292
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,450
I would think like the one thing that
never happens is you don't have any

293
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,730
fingers, hand, wrists, any of that type
of stuff. Injuries in soccer, right.

294
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,320
Although with all the diving, I'm sure
you know, if you dove a little too hard,

295
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,880
maybe you could break your wrist. Why
do I trust soccer? I actually really,

296
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,350
really starting to enjoy it. I have no
idea why. You know, why I started off?

297
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,120
I was in a crabby mood. I just tease
my wife about the fact that she, um,

298
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,110
you know,
is less than cordial to wait staff.

299
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,670
You know what's funny is when she goes
into a restaurant, she becomes me,

300
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,800
which is she has expectations of people
and when they're not met she like,

301
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,140
you know,
gets a fucking attitude.

302
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,160
I'm not saying she starts throwing plates
or anything like that, but good Lord.

303
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Um, anyways, uh,

304
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,660
let me read some of the advertising
here for this this week.

305
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,690
This is an offer Thursday,
isn't it? Hey. Hi. Hi.

306
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,860
Hi. Do you have any respect for the
fact that I'm doing a podcast right now?

307
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,880
No.
Cause I have to ask you something.

308
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,090
What are you going to be
leaving after your podcast? Oh,

309
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,840
I take an Uber to my appointment that I
was going to come back and take my car.

310
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,250
Because your car is blocking my,

311
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,290
okay. No, I can move it if
you want right now. Yeah.

312
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,120
Now I don't want to be talking
about this on the podcast.

313
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:31,500
This is not interesting to people
with that. Our driveway is so small.

314
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,310
I have to move my car so you can move.

315
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,270
Okay. Well, um,

316
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,650
oh, it is for reads. All right. I
got to read the advertising here.

317
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,330
When do you need me to do that now?

318
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,170
Or I get taken over and just, you
know, if you're going on a later,

319
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:46,400
I'll be able to take a car later.

320
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,710
Okay. Do that. Do that then.
All right. I'm almost done
with the pockets. All right.

321
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:55,300
Four sigmatic Nia. Sigmadek,
that was a big Nas album, right?

322
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,410
No,
sorry for Sig Sigmadek.

323
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:04,000
Four sigmatic mushroom coffee for Sig.
Oh my God.

324
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,520
He can be tripping.
Four sigmatic comes from Finland,

325
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,160
the same country that gave us Santa Claus.

326
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:13,960
Angry birds to go rask
and mushroom coffee.

327
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,540
Uh, also, uh, what's his face? Uh, um,

328
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,870
from Formula One,
the hell's his name.

329
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:26,480
They're not Nico Rosberg.
The guys who's driving their,

330
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,630
no felt Terry Botox.
Right?

331
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,010
Finnish people consume more coffee
per capita than any other country,

332
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,820
almost three times more than Americans,
you know,

333
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,040
and they don't seem to be out of
their minds when I've been over there.

334
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,350
They seem very clearly levelheaded people.

335
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,580
You'd think they'd be all wired
and shit during World War Two,

336
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,540
when there was a shortage of coffee,

337
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,860
the finish boiled mushrooms that
grow on trees to make coffee.

338
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,750
Mushroom coffee has half the
caffeine of regular coffee,

339
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:59,620
but it's twice as magical
al magical,

340
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,200
easy on the gut,
less acidic,

341
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,110
and you don't get the jittery
feeling you get from regular coffee.

342
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,300
I'm already ready to drink this stuff.
I love mushrooms.

343
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,510
The flavor is add your thoughts on
the flavor. Well, I haven't drank it,

344
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:17,511
so I'm going to say it's like hot and
mushrooms and definitely not as shrew.

345
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:21,430
Me As the mushroom you take on spring
break or a Coachella. All right,

346
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:25,240
so you don't start tripping.
This product is ideal for adult children.

347
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,670

hippies that smell good, uh,

364
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,040
but just because a sense of style seems
elusive for some doesn't mean it's

365
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,760
impossible to attain. Oh my God,

00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:03,560
you'll get it.

432
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Have you seen that patriotic fucking
beer that Budweiser is making?

433
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,240
I mean, how much money can
you make off of it? And it's,

434
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,530
it's w and then they had like the
name of a veteran on the side of it,

435
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,970
you know, it's like, dude, I was
already going to drink your beer. Okay.

436
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,570
I already support the troops.
You know,

437
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,770
I don't support what the fuck we're
doing over there in the Middle East.

438
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:32,450
So I can tell you that, uh, w which is far
as I can tell is slowly going bankrupt.

439
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,710
You know, I'm all for getting
these bastards, but can we,

440
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,580
can we get like a fucking more
cost effective way of doing it?

441
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,680
Can't you just drawn it up?

442
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,730
Me undies is so sure you'll love your
first pair that if you're not happy,

443
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:53,440
they do whatever they can to get you
into the right pair. And if they can't,

444
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,150
they can't keep them in, they'll
return, they'll refund you.

445
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,860
Okay?

446
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,190
So it's really is a risk free.
Try the best underwear ever.

447
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:05,800
Do you realize what a cheap, best you
have to be to order this underwear?

448
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:10,480
I'd be like, I didn't like them. And if
you keep them and get your money back,

449
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:15,040

family, I'm sorry, the Mandy's Fam.

through their referral program.

Yeah, I feel like the u s government
right now with the money, you know,

462
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:00,560
considering there's no
end in sight to this war,

463
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,000
there's really no exit strategy or any
of that shit and how much money it's

464
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:04,850
fucking costing.

465
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,140
They're kind of the ever see like one of
those talk shows where the husband's at

466
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,890
work or something and he finds out like
his wife ran up all this credit card

467
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:17,330
debt, you know. Then of course it's a talk
show so they still side with the woman.

468
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:17,931
Ah,

469
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:22,931
you need to work longer to
pay off all of her yoga pants.

470
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,490
That's my doctor Phil.
Um,

471
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,970
right now I'm copying and
pasting that wine advice, uh,

472
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,980
wine town advice to my wife too,
my wife.

473
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,660
Um, why did I give a shit about being
rude to the wait staff? You know, why?

474
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:43,520
Cause she always trashes
me and my behavior.

475
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,940
I'm going to use that in the future when
you start treating the people and in

476
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:51,300
and out burger a little nicer.
Maybe I will work on my attempt,

477
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,750
but you know what's so weird about ft?

478
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,440
Ft you flip up and then you calm down
and then you just looking at your broken

479
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,670
headphones on the floor.

480
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,050
It's just that sadness, you
know, why did I do that?

481
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,660
Where's the other piece of plastic
that used to hold this thing in? Um,

482
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,400
anyways, that's 31 minutes. I
wouldn't say it was inspired,

483
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,770
wasn't inspiring podcasting
today. It was kind of, you know,

484
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,060
I kind of fed off the energy of the
weather, which is a little bit Thad.

485
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,970
Um, I'm going to be running my hour
around La, wherever I can get up.

486
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,810
I'll be doing 10 minutes spots, 20
minutes, boy, fuck, I can do it.

487
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,120
Getting ready next week
for Dublin in London,

488
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:40,690
England. Um, some people would ask me,

489
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:44,440
why aren't you playing
more cities over there? Uh,

490
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,240
it's because I'm going over there
for my birthday. That's why.

491
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,780
And I'm doing two quick shows and um,

492
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,970
and then I'm going to just,
you know, turned 50, I guess.

493
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,760
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing,

494
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,840
but I'm definitely going to
come back and um, I dunno,

495
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,770
maybe next year or something like that.
I want to go back and do a,

496
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,010
a toy like I did the last time.
Um,

497
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,860
except I dunno, I just, you
know, I got the kid now,

498
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,440
so I don't know how long
I could go over there for.

499
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,880
And there is just something weird leaving
the country with your wife and kid.

500
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,740
You know, maybe I could bring
them along. Maybe I'll do that.

501
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,110
Maybe that's the fucking move. Maybe
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll do it that way. Um,

502
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,140
you know what, I'm getting off the phone
and I'm talking to my agent right now.

503
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:41,630
How about look at that. It just worked
that out right in front of you guys. Uh,

504
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,340
that's how much thought
I put into my career.

505
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,370
I just talked to myself while
talking to you guys and there you go.

506
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:49,250
Look at my broken headphones.
I'm sorry, headphones.

507
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Now I'm going to have to throw you out
because you know they don't make that

508
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:56,870
plastic piece there. It's going to end
up in the fucking ocean floating around.

509
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,010
They didn't even have to be out there.

510
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,240
I kept these things so long that they
like, like the shit was flaking off,

511
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,940
you know, that goes up and over
your head and people always be like,

512
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,010
you got something on
your head. It's like, oh,

513
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:11,210
it's just the spongy shit from my old
headphones. I'm sorry, old headphones.

514
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,340
You know,

515
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,730
this is like when somebody kills their
wife like fucking 50 years into the

516
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:20,240
marriage, you know, a fit of rage.

517
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,960
I feel really bad right now. Are you
comparing women to inanimate objects? Uh,

518
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,300
yes I am. All right, that's the podcast.

519
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,330
I have a great weekend. [inaudible]
can somebody please send me the video?

520
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,070
Dee Dee got a flip phone video of most
solid get in his fucking shoulder yanked

521
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:38,720
out. I just want to see if it's
his filthy as the pictures.

522
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,120
All right. That's it.
Have a wonderful day.

523
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,033
No.
Was

524
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,550
God Danton God and come

525
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,473
back.

526
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,730
I turned from black and
white

527
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,610
was from Gaza and smash.

528
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:20,490
Oh

529
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,933
mmm.

530
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,950
Here's something that I actually read
a quote from one of these magazines.

531
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,970
I guess evidently a Clint
Eastwood was hyping that movie.

532
00:34:38,971 --> 00:34:43,470
Gran Gran Torino. I don't know
if you guys have seen that movie.

533
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,860
I'm sure you see any ads for it.
Where he basically is.

534
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:50,430
I get up late a lot and you
fucking person of another race.

535
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,440
I'm a white man and I represented my car
represents back when America was good

536
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,900
in the early seventies.
Um,

537
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,610
I guess when he was doing the
interview for that movie, uh,

538
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,150
he called I guess the current generation,
the pussy generation.

539
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,410
And at first it made me laugh
and I'm thinking like, yeah,

540
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,670
Clint Eastwood obviously has earned
the right to call people pussies.

541
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,100
And I'm thinking, wait a
minute, Cleese was, is an actor.

542
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,640
Okay. Who plays tough guys
who never loses a fight?

543
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:34,230
Rarely any of it. If he does lose a
fight in a movie, it's a fake fight.

544
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,210
So at the risk of making
second sack religious comment,

545
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:42,810
first trash and the Great Mickey Mantle,
uh,

546
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:46,140
now I'm going to go off to Clint Eastwood.
Unlike where has Clint Eastwood,

547
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,930
I want it. This is my question
for you guys this week.

548
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:53,931
Where's Queenie's would god off like
where's he earned the right that he's this

549
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:59,820
tough guy? Cause like he plays
a tough guy. I've known one.

550
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:04,350
Understand that with like actors, like I
remember like after nine, 11, like, um,

551
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,000
for some reason they wheeled out Tom Hanks
and like that was supposed to make me

552
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,860
feel relaxed as an American.

553
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,850
And I remember during that time I was
doing a joke on stage going and talking

554
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:19,440
about Tom Hanks saying he's done so many
army movies. He thinks he's a veteran.

555
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,640
You know what I mean? It's not like you
did army well, but he played an astronaut.

556
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,870
He was in saving private Ryan.
You know what I mean?

557
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:31,620
And like all of a sudden like he
becomes like a, all these guys,

558
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,220
like I said, you know, here's, here's
one for you. I got fucking, you know,

559
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,150
friends out here.

560
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,350
So we're doing the touristy shit out
here in La and I take them down to Mann's

561
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:43,590
Chinese theater or grooming's,
whatever the fuck they calling it now.

562
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,510
And they got those,
uh,

563
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,200
they got the hand prints in
the feet prints and the, uh,

564
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,530
footprints there in the, uh, the cement.

565
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,610
And I found John Wayne.
I swear to God,

566
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,760
John Wayne had the smallest
fucking feet I've ever seen him.

567
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,930
I couldn't believe it. This is the
Duke John Wayne. This is the guy.

568
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:07,230
Everyone's one.
Just thought if even breathed on you,

569
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:11,280
he fucking knock you in into next week.
This guy had like,

570
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:14,570
I think he went to fucking lady
gap to buy his cowboy boots.

571
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:18,900
He's fucking the smallest fucking things.

572
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,800
He could have fit both his
boots and his cowboy hat.

573
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:24,270
That's how small his fucking Fida.

574
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,810
If you ever go to La and you
go to Mann's Chinese theater,

575
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:31,050
it's on the right hand side.
He had tiny little ass feet,

576
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,780
you know, actors a fucking
annoying, you know what I mean? Sit.

577
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,490
Then they put on fucking leather jackets
and they play these bad asses and it's

578
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:46,410
just like, dude, you're a fucking, you're
an actor. Have you had any real fights,

579
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,630
Clint?
Somebody of a fucking rear engine.

580
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,850
The drive through at Burger King
and you got out and you settled.

581
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:57,320
The score maybe has, I don't
know what, but you know,

582
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,720
I don't know.
I don't know fucking,

583
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,530
it just fucking annoyed me
and moving on from that,

584
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:08,280
somebody actually sent me an email
that kind of ties into this, right?

585
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,610
I'm not saying clean is in a tough guy.
The guy's fucking ridiculous.

586
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:15,120
He's 80 years old. He's still
lifting weights, you know,

587
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,080
the way his eyes are squinted.
He definitely seems like
a bad ass, but you know,

588
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,400
I want to see his fight card. I want
to see his arrest record. You know,

589
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:27,390
maybe he was a juvenile delinquent
before he came up. I Dunno.

590
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,580
I haven't Wiki PD them yet.

591
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,563
Collide.

592
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,750
Explain.

593
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,701
Hey,
what's going on?

594
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:20,480
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

595
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,190
May 31st, 2010. How the hell are you?

596
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,610
Happy Memorial Day. Let's start.
Let's, let's start with that.

597
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,380
Let's show a little bit of respect.
Okay. What are you doing right now?

598
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:36,050
Why don't you get off the
fucking Treadmill, Huh?

599
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,670
Stared at attention and
give a salute to the troops.

600
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:46,070
Seriously. Big shout out. Big shout out
half. What am I a hip hop Gj over here.

601
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,570
Big Guy. Big hello from America
to everybody over there and uh,

602
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:54,590
Iraq, Afghanistan. Where
else do we have troops?

603
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,690
Germany,
right.

604
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,380
Still got people over there just
in case they start acting up again.

605
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,480
You know them. That's what you get.
Germany starting a couple of world wars,

606
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,630
you know, I'm glad you did
it. I'm glad you did it.

607
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:12,770
It gave us a nice rain at the top
after you lost for the second time.

608
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,551
And then us and Russia,

609
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:17,700
we carved it up and stared at each other
for fucking 40 years going, oh yeah,

610
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,550
yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And
then we just like, all right,

611
00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:27,290
fuck it. Yeah. And Russia just said,
forget it. I think my mom's calling me,

612
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,910
I got to go, but you know, fuck you.

613
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:35,540
Anyway. All right. And then they walk
away and then we're standing there like,

614
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,710
Holy Shit. You mean this
is all ours? I mean,

615
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:43,140
technically it's not ours, but
there's nobody stopping us. Right.

616
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,940
It's like Bo Jackson when he comes around
and all of a sudden he just sees 80

617
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:52,440
yards of fucking green. Okay. You know,
Kenny Easley ain't gonna Catch Ya,

618
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,070
even though he's got the fucking
right angle. It ain't happening.

619
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,250
That's what our corporations did.
They will like,

620
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:03,660
we are going to put a fucking best buy
and every God damn corner of this fucking

621
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,321
planet.

622
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:08,070
And we're starting in Iraq because as
far as I can tell on my map that looks

623
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:12,530
about the middle. Everybody go at that.
Huh? Show of hands. All right then.

624
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,360
Oh right dead.
Let's fucking rally the troops

625
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,220
is the best one out of all the songs.
No disrespect to the air force.

626
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,054
Army and navy.

627
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,603
Okay

628
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,080
Udo show us off trip Boli.

629
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,640
I'm a stupid fucking man.
Red Cans.

630
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:43,460
So I don't know where triple Lee is.
What a fuck is Tripoli?

631
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,410
That's an a fucking awesome name.
They really picked the right fucking city,

632
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,310
town or country. When they said
tripling. I know it's not a country.

633
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:53,240
Go Fuck Yourself.

634
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,290
Are you European snobs or listen to this
shit who think you're better, right?

635
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,500
Cause you had, you know more about
geography and your jeans are tighter.

636
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,500
You think you're impressing
me? You're not. All right.

637
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,460
Bunch of fuck ups. Really. Amy Winehouse,

638
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,060
that fucking Pete Doherty Douche
bag who's never done anything.

639
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,430
His big claim to fame is he looks like
paste stumbling down the fucking street

640
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,300
and you guys can't get enough of them
and you have the fucking balls to look at

641
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:24,590
us like we're a bunch of fat fucks.
All right,

642
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:27,140
stand down Europe.
This is our day.

643
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,550
Ah Shit. So anyways, I was actually
supposed to go over to Japan. Right.

644
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:41,510
A little fucking sucky. Now I wouldn't
do that. I would not do that. Um,

645
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,030
I was going to go over there to go
entertain the troops and I don't know what

646
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:48,700
the fuck's going on with that Gig was
supposed to be a nice three base. Bang,

647
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:51,470
Bang, boom. Right. I was
going to come in in a chopper.

648
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,600
I was going to do it up
just like an apocalypse.

649
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:55,820
Now I have a couple of chicks coming out.

650
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,660
These boots are made for walking
right tassels on their titties.

651
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,530
America throw some place
stations out into the crowd,

652
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,770
play a drum solo with some fucking
chop sticks, you know, little America.

653
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,020
That's what I was going to do
and I don't know what happened.

654
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:16,520
All of a sudden now it's like I'm playing
a rec room on a fucking Navy reserve

655
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:18,950
base in Rhode Island.
I don't know what happened to the tour,

656
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:22,400
but I was supposed to be going over there
and I was going to go over there and I

657
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:25,790
was going to give it my all and I was
going to hang for next thing, you know,

658
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:29,300
four or five days eating Sushi,
hanging out in Tokyo. You know,

659
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:32,780
just looking at a city like what if
all of New York look like Times Square?

660
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:37,250
I want to see it go to what? Go
to a Japanese garden. You don't,

661
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:40,640
you probably don't call it
a Japanese garden. When you
go over to Japan, you know,

662
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:43,340
kind of like when you go to Philadelphia,
you don't go,

663
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:47,660
can I get a Philly cheese steak? It's
like, dude, you're in Philly. Just say,

664
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:52,250
can I get a cheese steak?
All right, everything is a
Philly here. See that yogurt?

665
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,820
That's Philly yogurt.
How could with 30 oh play.

666
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,390
I don't give a fuck what it says.
All right,

667
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:05,270
you're in Philly. So all
this food is ours. Um, yeah,

668
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:07,100
so I guess you say I
want to go see a garden.

669
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,250
So I go see a garden and then be
like thought tie dyed by downside,

670
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,840
speak English, and then I'd be an asshole
American. Like you don't speak English.

671
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,590
Learn the fucking language.
You know

672
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,833
how fucking,

673
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,750
how bad would that be if you just
walk down the streets of Tokyo?

674
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,190
Just sort of yelling out to nobody in
general and just sorta over everybody's

675
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,580
head English.
All right.

676
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:37,660
I think I've been ignorant
enough on this podcast.

677
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,540
I right now you're probably wondering,

678
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:44,541
you're probably wondering going bill
last week according to the MM podcast.com

All right, actually made a little
video there. Uh, let's see.

686
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,430
Like Archie bunker. Hey, I made a
little bit bit a little video there.

687
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:24,600
Edith eating bad. I made
a video for the uh, um,

688
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,660
it's a long story. You'll see I
got, we have an exclusive video.

689
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:32,250
It's not even up on youtube or maybe it
is. I Dunno. I don't handle that shit.

690
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,030
I just see the red light and I just
start talking to people cause I'm a

691
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:40,200
professional just like all of those band
members on fucking Lawrence Welk. Okay.

692
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,190
The light comes on.

693
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,210
I start doing whatever it is that
I do to pay the fucking rent.

694
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,680
I didn't know what I'm talking about.
But anyways,

695
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:50,250
I told you guys that I was going
to be interviewing the, uh,

696
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:53,310
the wonderfully talented
Nicholas Swartzman.

697
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,030
Is it Schwartzen or
swore Zin or Swartzman?

698
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,440
I think it's Swartzman with the Real
Nicholas Swartz. And please stand up.

699
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,910
Um,
Minnesota,

700
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:06,810
his own nick Swardson grandma's boy.

701
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:13,110
Don't mess with the Zohan Blades of glory.
All those fucking,

702
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,320
all those movies that fucking every
college kid and immature 41 year old,

703
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:23,160
soon to be 42 year old like
myself. Absolutely fucking
loves. I love those movies.

704
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,110
Okay. First of all, I didn't
even know. I didn't even,

705
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:30,450
somehow grandma's boy went under my radar.
I don't know what I was doing,

706
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,050
but I miss when that movie came out and
I started watching some clips on it.

707
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,520
It's fucking, it's funny as hell and I'm
going to rent it this week. So anyways,

708
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:41,670
I was supposed to, um, and
that's what I was doing.

709
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:45,690
I was ready for an inside the
actor's studio, you know, I was,

710
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:48,720
I was looking at his body of work and
all that Shit, getting ready, you know,

711
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:51,960
I wanted to have a good
interview. And then, uh, you know,

712
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:54,720
when you have everything all
planned out and then just, you know,

713
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:58,260
this is what happened. Okay.
I called Nicholas and uh,

714
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,300
and I said, you know, are we good for
today? He goes, yeah, no problem. Uh,

715
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,730
gimme and whatever. We're supposed
to meet in like an hour or something.

716
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:08,520
So I'm sitting there and my fucking,
you know,

717
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:12,540
my boxers play my guitar,
right. Doing what I do.

718
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:16,110
I'm trying to learn these fucking surf,
you know, that Surf Guitar, you know,

719
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,780
for those of you trying to learn guitar,
you know, try to learn to play by ear.

720
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,010
So then you're not like,
you know,

721
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:22,410
borderline retarded in an
instrumental kind of way.

722
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,730
Instrumental in an instrument
kind of way. So, uh, you know,

723
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,070
there's simple songs down
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron are

724
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,640
now now and I remember her married,

725
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,830
it's not one fucking string.
You can figure it out. You know,

726
00:47:34,831 --> 00:47:38,560
you'll learn some courts. I'm fucking
doing that shit and I'm a girl goes up.

727
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,500
Okay.
Oh good to take the dog out.

728
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,000
So she walks down the street and just
like in life when tragedy strikes,

729
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:49,570
you have no idea it's coming.
All right.

730
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,030
I'm sitting there trying
to learn how to play,

731
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:55,960
waiting on a friend went in in a bed,
bed and

732
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,290
beauty you, you know, and knowing my
neighbors, having the window open,

733
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:04,510
not giving a fuck,
right?

734
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,610
I'm trying to slowly kill the old man
who lives down below me on a holiday

735
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,760
weekend.
I might add fucking three minutes goes by.

736
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,590
My girl is taking the dog around
the block. What could happen, right?

737
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,550
All of a sudden she comes in

738
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:25,280
opposite dawn. She looks look at me
and she's like, I just got bit by a dog

739
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,430
freaking out, and I was like, I
couldn't even fucking, I couldn't,

740
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,260
I couldn't process it.
I was like,

741
00:48:31,261 --> 00:48:34,170
you just walked outside to go
take the dark for walking down.

742
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,110
You're bleeding on your leg. What?
What's, what's going on? She had a little,

743
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,300
was a nip.
Fortunately she didn't need stitches,

744
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,910
but now my whole day is in shambles.
It's like,

745
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:46,380
what the f what did you get bit by?
Was it a coyote? Was was, it was.

746
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:50,340
It was a dog. It was a dog. Okay.
Who's dog was it? I don't know. They,

747
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:53,910
they weren't around. There was some lady
there. She helped me. I all his shit.

748
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,620
The next thing you know,

749
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:59,220
I go from sitting in my underwear and
trying to learn some Bill Haley and the

750
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:01,260
comets next seen on walking up the street.

751
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,280
I fucking don't even have socks on him
walking up on my stupid old sneakers with

752
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:09,870
my feet squishing in my old new balance.
Right. Why am why you staring at me,

753
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:12,270
Neil and I talking about,

754
00:49:12,271 --> 00:49:15,120
I'm telling the story as to why Nick
Schwartzen isn't on this podcast.

755
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:20,040
Come over here. Huh? What did I do?

756
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:23,630
What? Come here. What did I say?
What? Why didn't you go? Oh God,

757
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,670
no, I wasn't. I was trying
to act like you crying.

758
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,910
That's good.
Whoo.

759
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,550
That's making fun of me.

760
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:39,320
I'm not making fun of you fucking
told Nick a god. The a movie star.

761
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:40,490
I couldn't do the podcast.

762
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:43,640
I have to take my girl to get her
to get her up a little booster shot.

763
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,860
Well, I mean, what the fuck is, you
don't realize I'm recording right now.

764
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:55,190
I'm sorry. Yes, yes. He's, why don't you
go over on your laptop and go on Youtube?

765
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:58,340
He's clearly and more movies
than I've ever been in,

766
00:49:58,341 --> 00:50:01,070
so I should probably shut up. All
right. This is ladies and gentlemen,

767
00:50:01,071 --> 00:50:05,810
if you ever wanted to look up back
pedaling and the dictionary. Oh, sorry.

768
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:12,980
Sorry. I'm just explaining
this. All right. I thought
you were mocking me. I wasn't.

769
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:16,580
I was mocking the situation where you
just sit there and like nothing's going on

770
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,270
and I'll, you know, you
walked up to fucking take the
dog out. What could happen?

771
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,460
Remember I was sitting in my
underwears oh my leg ripped out.

772
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,130
Well yeah, not that chomped it Tom. Tom,

773
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:33,040
what you did was you broke up a rape in
progress. Yes, that's right. That's right.

774
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,670
This dog was trying to, you know, take
advantage of my dog's neck. Say Rape.

775
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,350
She tried to rape her and she
wasn't having it. And you know,

776
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,670
dogs can't hold pepper spray because
they don't have index fingers. Thumbs.

777
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,510
That's right. And so they bare teeth
and they go at it and a fight and said,

778
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:52,990
I was proud of her.
She's not one of those dogs.

779
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,570
Just let other dogs come up and have their
way. She's a fucking dime, not a slut.

780
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,340
She's not a slut. She's a dominant
female. She's not taking it. Right.

781
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,560
Well that's what I was,
that was a story I was telling.

782
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,840
Well will you draw a parallel to,

783
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:09,620
and so what happens to me earlier in the
day at the farmer's market when you get

784
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:11,560
to, I know it's not about me. Oh,

785
00:51:11,561 --> 00:51:16,310
in the creepy homeless guy hit on you had
an awful day. I told him, you know, I,

786
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:18,500
you know this guy came up to me
and I was at the front, I'm sorry,

787
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:21,600
I'm going to see you're really just
taking this over. And he came out,

788
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,540
he was like, Yo, yeah I was, I was,

789
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:28,250
I was buying bread from the
farmer's market and this
guy comes up to me and he's

790
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,940
right in my ear, like all breathing on
my neck really close. And he's like, Yo,

791
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:35,380
can I get some bread or something.
Like

792
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,420
it was so awful. And I
was like, what is that?

793
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:46,160
Some new street slang for pussy. Yo,
let me get someone at brand sugar,

794
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,640
1972 slang salad. It was
terrible. And so I'm like, what?

795
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:54,310
And he got a mumbled something
and I'm like, all right,

796
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,800
you need to step off and whatever their
needs trades getting close to me again.

797
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,050
And I said,
if you don't get out of my face,

798
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:03,080
I'm going to punch you in the
fucking face. I was so pissed off.

799
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:05,540
Say face twice cause it
really kills your momentum.

800
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,400
If you don't get out of my face,

801
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:12,560
I'm going to punch you in
your face because you're in
my face with your face and

802
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:16,130
I'm not having that with your
face. No, I think I said,

803
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,860
if you don't get away from me,
I'm gonna Punch on your fucking face.

804
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,930
That's what I said.
If you don't get away from me,

805
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,760
I'm gonna Punch you in your fucking face.

806
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,580
And he was a Ho Ho you're not that pretty.

807
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:30,620
You're not that pretty in any
walkthrough. Hang on, hang on one second.

808
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:32,390
You just sounded like you
don't get out away from me.

809
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,310
I'm going to punch you
in the fucking face.

810
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,260
Do you remember the
cop and reservoir dogs?

811
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:39,710
One of the most underrated performances
ever in the bathroom with Tim Roth.

812
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:41,330
It's in there. I said, buddy,

813
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,520
I am going to shoot you in the face.
You know,

814
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:48,230
put your fucking hands in that dashboard,

815
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,190
that classic cop speak buddy.

816
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,510
That's what you just sounded like. All
right, so, so you almost got raped.

817
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,400
The dog almost got raped.

818
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,780
We both bared our teeth and fought off,
you know,

819
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:09,370
these fucking advances, you know what I'm
saying? So I write, go write the script.

820
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,140
It's going to be a nice lifetime movie.
Okay.

821
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,620
Taking over the podcast,
they want to hear about me.

822
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,830
That's what happened to Johnny Carson.
All of a sudden he led a couple of people,

823
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:23,630
guest host. Next thing you know, you're
playing golf. Wondering what happened.

824
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:29,760
Yeah. Beat it. All right. So
anyways, so that was the story.

825
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,430
Somebody tried to let some
person left the gate open, uh,

826
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,330
up to street. And uh, this
dog came out with another dog.

827
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,310
One was the lookout and the
other one fucking, you know,
came running up. You know,

828
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:48,000
probably there's a little pink dog.
He Dick and you know,

829
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:51,900
tried to mount my dog. You
know, I gotta tell you,

830
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:56,490
I got to respect the dog up to street
for its belief in itself that it could

831
00:53:56,491 --> 00:54:01,250
rape a pit bull.
You know,

832
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:06,440
you know, when they make those movies
about the fucking, you know, the, uh, the,

833
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:10,380
the white guy from the suburbs who's
wrongly convicted, you know, and he,

834
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:15,000
and he goes, uh, he, he goes to prison.
You know, I just realized in those movies,

835
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,180
when it's the black guy
who wrongly goes to prison,

836
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:19,980
who's wrongly convicted
and goes to prison,

837
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:23,220
there's never any issues about
him getting raped. You know,

838
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,260
it's [inaudible] he's a black
guy. He'll fucking, you know,

839
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,060
kick the shit out of everybody in there,
you know,

840
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:31,230
and then dunk on the fucking warden
when they have the annual fucking warden

841
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,400
prison, fucking whatever game. Right.
But the white guy goes to jail.

842
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:37,840
It's always worried about
getting raped. So anyways, if,

843
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,120
because they've made that
movie so many God damn times,

844
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:44,700
and you couldn't make it any
better than Shawshank redemption.

845
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:48,510
But Tom Selleck made that movie.
Somebody else made them.

846
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:49,980
I came up with who the
fuck else made them. We,

847
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:52,590
Tom Selleck went to jail and he fucking,
you know,

848
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:56,220
he ended up running shit
and they respected his
intelligence and all in all this

849
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,650
fucking stupid white guy.
Shit that they do, right.

850
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:03,060
So I'm saying if you want
to write that movie, okay,

851
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:04,770
if you want to bring that genre back,

852
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,860
if you're sick of seeing to a boyfriend
and a girlfriend who are actually

853
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:13,500
secretly hit, men are spies. Okay?

854
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:17,040
If you're not tired of that genre yet,
when the fuck did that start, by the way,

855
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:20,430
was it Mr and Mrs. Smith and
they've made like 52 of 'em.

856
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:23,370
Ashton Kutcher has one coming
out with some other broad,

857
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,870
and they're standing back
to back with guns in the,

858
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:30,450
in the titles written in
like pink lipstick. Okay,

859
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:32,360
I'm digressing here, but
anyways, this is how you,

860
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,230
this is how you take that
one to the next level.

861
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,690
This is a tip for all you
Hollywood screenwriters out there.

862
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:40,040
This is how you fucking do it. You, uh,

863
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,400
you have the white guy not only be
able to handle himself in the prison,

864
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,620
but he rapes the toughest guy

865
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,290
in the prison. Basically the pit bull
version of, of, of a fucking human being,

866
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:59,160
whatever, the big, the big
fucking just jacked, you know,

867
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,900
you ever see a dude just so big? It's
like you look at the, he, he's like a,

868
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:07,770
you know, had an aluminum baseball
bat anywhere on his body that I hit.

869
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,950
He wouldn't even feel it,
you know, even his head,

870
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,160
it would be like three times he'd be like
banging them on the head as he slowly

871
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:18,240
turned around doing that. That
cheesy Bruce Bruce Willis. Look,

872
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,680
you know, Bruce Willis has one. Look,

873
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:26,020
once something's going to happen,
he makes his eyes a little wide.

874
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,770
He makes his eyebrows tents. One of
them goes up a little high and then he,

875
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:34,250
he makes his mouth like a little
round. Oh. And he turns around.

876
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,310
That's what he does. That's what
he did all through pulp fiction.

877
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:40,030
He did it in die hard. And, uh,
why am I shitting on Bruce Willis?

878
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:44,880
I like his movies. What am I trying to
talk? I'm trying to explain why. Uh,

879
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:48,700
Nick Swardson's not on the
podcast right now. So yeah,

880
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:51,370
I was playing guitar and trying
to learn some fucking, you know,

881
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,440
whatever the firing or the names of the
bands. I'm so new to the shit. Next scene.

882
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,510
I'm going up the fucking street and uh,

883
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,520
with Nia who's still bleeding.
Okay. I did try to, you know,

884
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,250
clean it up a little bit, but we
also have to figure out, you know,

885
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:09,280
if she's slowly getting Raby.
So long story short,

886
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:13,720
we get in the vicinity now we have to
start knocking on fucking doors to try to

887
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,190
figure out,
uh,

888
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:20,580
whose dog it was and I'm opening the
gates and the gates of creek and easy to

889
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:23,260
walk into these people's house.
We live on like one of those streets.

890
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:26,350
Reveries House looks like the
monsters, you know, so we, you know,

891
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:30,370
to a much lesser degree rather than the
gates being like, you know, 10 feet high,

892
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,820
they like sort of waist, chest height
depending on your height, you know,

893
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,230
so I'm walking in there worrying that
this rape his dog is going to attack me.

894
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:43,090
So I have this fucking stick
that has a ball on the end of it.

895
00:57:43,091 --> 00:57:46,330
I look like a fucking wizard that
doesn't know how to walk with the cane.

896
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,370
You know,
I got it upside down.

897
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:53,371
I basically looked like some blue collared
guy who was wronged and he's about to

898
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,860
take the law in his own hands, but I'm
not going to get fucking bit right.

899
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,690
I got a weapon Memorial Day,
weekend, hand to hand combat.

900
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,710
I grabbed the shovel out of my pack,
so I'm walking up,

901
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,910
I ring the doorbell and I hear Oh, and
the other side, I'm like fucking great.

902
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:13,720
Right. And then this, you know, and then
I'm waiting for the sound of the feet.

903
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:18,070
Boom, boom, boom. Come walking up on the
hardwood floors. This lady ups door. Hi,

904
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:20,890
I'm Mike. Yeah, your uh, your girl.

905
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:24,460
Your dog just attacked my girlfriend
and then she does just, you know,

906
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,280
ah,
oh my God,

907
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:31,900
I'm 30 I thought thought
that fucking La Shit.

908
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,950
We get lazy by the end of the sentence
and you can't even finish the word.

909
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:41,170
Oh my God. That's my favorite.
You're what? My favorite.

910
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:46,630
Your your favorite?
Favorite. Favorite? Yeah.

911
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,130
Rit. Not Raw. That's my favorite. Anyways,

912
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,270
so she wasn't really like that. You know
what she was, it's, it's the way fucking,

913
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,670
I dunno,
I can't speak for other countries,

914
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:00,820
but the way this country is right now
where everybody is just so fucking sue

915
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:01,654
happy,

916
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:06,660
she can't even express concern or
like a sorrow or apology apologetic,

917
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:15,550
whatever that fucking word is and
whatever Tencent supposed to use that she

918
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:19,240
can't express it because
she's worried about a

919
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:24,210
fucking, you know, okay.
Incriminating herself.

920
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,060
Like we're just going to sue
the shit out of her because of,

921
00:59:27,061 --> 00:59:30,510
cause my girlfriends got bit,
you know,

922
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:32,910
and all I'm trying to do is
find out if it has rabies.

923
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,510
And my girlfriend told me that the dog
was either black and white or brown and

924
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:38,250
black turned out it was brown
and black that she said,

925
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:39,930
and I couldn't remember
what the fuck she said.

926
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,560
And I knew that she had two dogs
and now I can't say to her the

927
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,700
black and white one. And then
she'd be like, I don't have one.

928
00:59:47,701 --> 00:59:49,580
You have the wrong dog.
You just fucking,

929
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:53,470
a unencrypted hated me and that she
slams the fucking door. So anyway,

930
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:57,360
so I had to figure it out.
They had fucking rabies. Long
story short and you know,

931
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:58,950
and then I got to call nick
and say, Hey, you know,

932
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,500
remember how we were going
to do that three seconds ago.

933
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:06,600
Well since then my dog almost got raped
and my girlfriend got a chunk of her leg

934
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:11,240
taken out so she's got to go get
a tetanus shot. What happened?

935
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,440
Long story short was I cleaned up to
fucking cut, you know, little peroxide,

936
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:16,310
little bass to tracing.

937
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:18,680
I'd fucking covered the shit up and
then it went back up the street cause I

938
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,960
realized I didn't even get their names
and their phone numbers and crap.

939
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:22,670
And I know that the
doctor's going to be like,

940
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:24,310
well did you get proof that
it doesn't have rabies?

941
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,450
So I had to do that and the
next time I went up the street,

942
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:29,570
the husband was there and he was actually
cool as hell. He said, sorry about that.

943
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,190
Uh,
don't worry about it.

944
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,670
You know, I'll pay for the trip to the
hospital and that's all I wanted to hear.

945
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:39,730
You know, not trying to get a second
Prius out of a God damn nip on,

946
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:44,450
on the inside of a knee cap. I'm not
trying to do that, but I understand.

947
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:49,340
I understand why the fuck they did it.
But that's basically the reason why, um,

948
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,750
the reason why that uh, I Nicholas isn't
on it and this week I'm going to try,

949
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,510
I'm going to actually try to hook up and
do a very special version. You might,

950
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:57,171
you might get lucky.

951
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:59,570
It's either going to be next
Monday or maybe sometime this week.

952
01:00:59,571 --> 01:01:03,350
You might get lucky. I
might do an extra one. Uh,

953
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,600
and if I am going to do an extra one,
just keep checking in with the uh,

954
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:11,480
the m podcast.com the second I figured
out that we are going to do what I will

955
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:12,314
let,

956
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,340
I will let you know the powers that
be know over on that page and uh,

957
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,760
they will put it up and you'll
have the inside fucking scoops.

958
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,120
So maybe you'll get something on a
Thursday or a Friday this week. Huh?

959
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:27,580
How much you guys love in life?
It's a short work week.

960
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:32,140
Well you got to do is Olympia way
through fucking Tuesday through Friday.

961
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:35,920
You might get an extra podcasts
with sliding into June here.

962
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:42,010
Good Times, good fucking ties. But
I was really looking forward to, uh,

963
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:43,420
I was actually watching a ton.

964
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:46,510
If you get a few guys for some reason
are familiar with Nica Swartz and you

965
01:01:46,511 --> 01:01:49,360
really should just youtube some
of his stuff and then go out,

966
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:51,820
buy all his comedy DVDs
because like I said,

967
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:55,660
I'm not putting anybody on this podcast
that I don't think is a, you know,

968
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,700
is fucking hilarious.

969
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,180
And I was seriously watching his stuff

970
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,680
just fucking dying laughing by myself.
Even like the,

971
01:02:04,681 --> 01:02:07,600
the quick little videos that he
makes, he's just, he's hilarious.

972
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:10,990
And I'm written a, that's your homework
assignment this week. Rent Grandma's boy.

973
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,550
So you're up to speed and a or any
of the other ones that he's in,

974
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:19,800
but grandma's boy, it seems
like he has the most lines
in it. And uh, I don't know.

975
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:21,750
He's got a bunch of movies coming out.
God dammit.

976
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,200
I had a fucking movie star coming on
despite what my girlfriend, thanks.

977
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:30,060
And I was just me sitting here
under my goddamn ceiling fan again.

978
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:35,040
So anyways. Yeah. So what
are you guys disappointed?

979
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:38,670
It's just me again. I understand
that. I think I'm fucking thrilled.

980
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,880
Thought I'd get a God damn
week off somebody else talk.

981
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:46,770
Somebody else talk for a while,
do some shit jokes. Um, anyways.

982
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,560
Anyways, oh, I got an email this week. Um,

983
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,450
remember the old Douche bag of
the week award. Remember that?

984
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:58,220
I haven't given one of
those out in a while. Um,

985
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,900
I got this really bizarre email from
somebody the other day. He said, uh,

986
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,560
it said,
hey man,

987
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,790
I sent you an email about a year ago
and it was something to the effect of,

988
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,910
fuck you, you really turned
into a pussy, et cetera.

989
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,790
I think though that I was wrong for
saying that I will continue listening to

990
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:24,390
your podcasts and look and looking
forward to any new shit you come out with.

991
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,670
Um, I wasn't thrilled with your
California dog loving bullshit. I mean,

992
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:34,110
we all love dogs, but we really
don't, don't all talk about it.

993
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,050
You know,
this is like one of these guys.

994
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,050
This is what fucking annoying
me about those emails. You know,

995
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:42,420
those people where they realize they're
wrong and then they apologize to you and

996
01:03:42,421 --> 01:03:43,500
it starts off as,

997
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:48,270
as an apology and then you quickly
realize that it's really just an excuse to

998
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:52,950
start reiterating the shit that fucking
pissed you off to begin with. Hey, listen,

999
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:57,650
dude, uh, you know, can I talk to you
for a second? Yeah. Listen, man, I got,

1000
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:01,860
I got, I don't know, I was in, I was in
a bad mood yesterday. I was, you know,

1001
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:03,000
I've been dealing with flood of stuff,

1002
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,510
a lot of personal stuff and I
just figured, you know, I just,

1003
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,320
I just want to say sorry. You know, I, uh,

1004
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,580
got a little out of line
yesterday and, um, uh, you know,

1005
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:19,590
it was totally my fault and nothing
to do with you, you know, uh, just,

1006
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:23,110
you know, you're doing that
faggy shit that I can't stand,
you know, acting like a,

1007
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:25,980
it's like, wait a minute. Wait, wait,
wait. What? This is an appalling,

1008
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,940
just stop right there. Just say
you fucking sorry. Don't, don't,

1009
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:34,530
don't bring it around again
and start shitting on me.
So the guy's like, you know,

1010
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:38,370
but fuck it. Everyone's entitled to
their own opinions, speech, et Cetera.

1011
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:39,390
What the fuck ever.

1012
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,750
I was think it's cool you actually write
people back now he's being nice to me

1013
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:47,490
again. And you're also out
there. I actually liked
your material. Thanks again.

1014
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,320
You know,

1015
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,830
and you are really annoyed me about his
fucking email is that he wrote I'm back.

1016
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,400
That was the name of the title.
Like I'm actually like, I fucking

1017
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,990
like, he's the only guy
who shits on me and emails.

1018
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:03,420
Like I've been sitting around going,
gee, whatever happened to that guy.

1019
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,640
I don't even remember when
this fucking happened. Why not?

1020
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:09,600
Why couldn't you just fucking come back
and start a listening to the podcast?

1021
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:10,900
I don't give a shit what you're doing.
Any kid,

1022
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:14,910
he told me to go fuck myself
and called me a pussy, you know?

1023
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,010
Do you know how many of those I get?

1024
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,280
The only one I remember was with
somebody gave me shit for supporting.

1025
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:28,281
So take two for taking the side of
a celebrity you use like supporting

1026
01:05:28,551 --> 01:05:32,390
celebrities and what the fuck did he said?
Uh,

1027
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:33,980
yeah.

1028
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,490
Fuck you. Bye. Like he
was all done with me

1029
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:42,640
and I just wrote back.
All right. Take it easy.

1030
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:48,460
Okay.

1031
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,340
I don't know. It just cracks me up
that people are so like, you know,

1032
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,060
I'm the supposed to be the guy that
thinks the world is wrapped around them,

1033
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:59,860
not you. Right? I mean, I,

1034
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:04,370
these people make me feel better about
myself. It's fucking guys think like,

1035
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:07,640
you know, yeah. Listen, I know
you're still fucking, uh, you know,

1036
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:09,800
emotionally distraught about that time.
I told you,

1037
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:13,490
go fuck yourself in November of 2006.
I don't remember that.

1038
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,260
All right. Or if you've got
to apologize, just apologize.

1039
01:06:18,261 --> 01:06:21,850
Just sales guys kind of being a
cunt. Sorry about that. All right.

1040
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:25,010
And then, and then just
fucking start listening again.

1041
01:06:25,011 --> 01:06:27,320
I don't need an Elisa and you
listen to your fucking explanations.

1042
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,150
Douche bag of the week right
there. God bless you. Welcome
back, sir. Welcome back.

1043
01:06:32,151 --> 01:06:34,820
Okay. And you became part of the
podcast. Is that stroke your ego?

1044
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,540
Okay.

1045
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,360
Hope you get run over by that fire
truck at the end of the parade today.

1046
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,550
I never understood the firetruck.

1047
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,250
Is that because it's always during
the day and they don't have money for

1048
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:46,500
fireworks or you couldn't
really see the fireworks?

1049
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,960
So in the end they got to have those
poor fucking firemen in their raincoats

1050
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,310
sweating their asses off.
Huh?

1051
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:01,600
Sweating off that fucking hooker funk
that half of them have on their body,

1052
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,410
those heroes.

1053
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,960
That's one thing I've learned about
firemen and have to talking to the cops.

1054
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:13,170
Firemen love hookers.
They love him.

1055
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,230
You know,
I'm telling you right now,

1056
01:07:16,231 --> 01:07:19,620
half the time you see a fucking
fire truck going down the street.

1057
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:22,740
Half the time they're going to get
hookers. So what they're doing,

1058
01:07:22,741 --> 01:07:26,160
I think they have all those extra seats.
Why do you think they have that?

1059
01:07:26,161 --> 01:07:30,060
That that fucking intense
look on their face. The site,

1060
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,940
the site,
they're going to go get their dick sucked.

1061
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,170
You know what was the last
time you even saw fire?

1062
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,190
Every fucking three seconds. You see a
fire truck going down the Damn Street.

1063
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:46,470
There's no fire. They're getting hookers.
But everybody comes down on the cops.

1064
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,040
Happy Memorial Day everybody. I'm
winging this one. I'm winging this one.

1065
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:58,210
I thought I was going to ask somebody
else talk for the entire fucking time. Um,

1066
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,330
you know, in my, my youtube
research, everybody,

1067
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:02,800
when I was sitting there in my lab coat,

1068
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:07,770
my safety goggles doing
youtube research, um, you know,

1069
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:09,270
lately we've been talking about,
you know,

1070
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:12,930
bad covers and people actually started
sending me some covers that were bad,

1071
01:08:12,931 --> 01:08:14,220
but they actually thought were good.

1072
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:18,350
Like there's some Ukrainian group
that does like this sort of a,

1073
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:22,370
I don't know what it is, old school,
old school like European folk,

1074
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,160
um, version of highway to hell. So
just search Ukrainian highway to hell,

1075
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:29,923
you know,

1076
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:35,870
the Malcolm and Angus parts or running
an accordion and Phil Rudd's part is

1077
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:39,080
basically an empty suitcase
and somebody hitting a,

1078
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:43,370
an empty water bottle against it and
somehow it's actually pretty bad ass,

1079
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,130
pretty bad ass. Those
guys, like they really,

1080
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,200
they bring a great energy
to it and I got a mid,

1081
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:51,710
I kind of enjoyed it because you
would think it would be a train wreck.

1082
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:55,160
So that's your first video to
watch Ukrainian highway to hell.

1083
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,570
And um, anyway, so I was, I was
kind of looking up that, uh,

1084
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,560
that some of that surf
guitar stuff and uh,

1085
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,450
they all use those fender strats and
I got one of those this year and I was

1086
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,680
never really a fan. I always like the
Gibson sound with a Marshall amp cause I,

1087
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:13,030
you know, Zeplin ACDC, like that's
what I came up on. You know,

1088
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,160
Joe Perry always had that 59 Les Paul,
he used,

1089
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:20,780
you know the deal and um,
I dunno,

1090
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:23,630
I was into the beach boys for like two
seconds and then they just annoyed the

1091
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:28,550
shit out of me. Um, but I dunno just
trying to learn how to play guitar.

1092
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,380
I graduate, you know, he
listened to a little blues.

1093
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,670
It's funny when you go back and listen
to those old blues guys like Lightening

1094
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,310
Hopkins is concerned,
you know,

1095
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:39,530
called lightening cause he was so fast
and compared to how fast guys are today,

1096
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,480
he's not that fast.

1097
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:45,920
So you kind of go back to those guys
because you can at least figure out the

1098
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:46,754
rhythm.

1099
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:49,340
I've just explained if anybody out there
is trying to learn how to play guitar,

1100
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,020
I'm really trying to
learn how to play by ear.

1101
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:55,400
So I'm not like one of those Douche bags
you see on youtube where somebody shows

1102
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:59,030
you how to play the guitar,
but then they still want the tabs,

1103
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,460
you know what I mean? Um, so anyways,

1104
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:04,490
so then I graduated to two other
Surf Guitar and like I said,

1105
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,680
it's a lot of the thought of
the rips are all on one string.

1106
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,820
But what I noticed in it
was a,

1107
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:15,830
I came across this group called the
shadows and they got a song called Fbi and

1108
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:20,480
you just have to see the
synchronized dancing,

1109
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:24,980
the choreography that
they're doing. Um, you know,

1110
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:27,170
you guys can keep sending
me the bad covers.

1111
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:32,171
But a whole nother level of funny is
some of the bad choreography because

1112
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:37,270
nowadays when you look at the
choreography that people do, it's like a,

1113
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:40,220
I mean the, the, the dancers
nowadays are so good.

1114
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:45,221
They'll have 20 people on stage and you're
watching them and they're all moving.

1115
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,980
They're doing the exact same
move at the exact same time.

1116
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:53,360
And back then in the 60s,
it was basically,

1117
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:58,361
as long as you were doing
the same movement within
three seconds of the person

1118
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:03,320
to either side of you, it was
considered a, it's considered,

1119
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:07,790
I guess, decent. So
checkout, uh, search shadows,

1120
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,440
FBI, this is some of the worst
choreography I've seen. And a,

1121
01:11:12,441 --> 01:11:14,340
if you want some bad,
heavy metal,

1122
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:19,590
this is a whole nother genre and I
haven't even tip even even like tapped the

1123
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:20,424
surface of this.

1124
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:25,550
Look up Brittany Fox and Brittany's B R
I t and why Fox girls' school live and

1125
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:31,371
just watched the first 10 seconds of
this stupid and back and forth that I

1126
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:36,420
thought was fucking cool
as hell. I literally saw it
and I was like, oh my God,

1127
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:41,130
this is, this is, uh, I
was like, oh my God. No.

1128
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:43,050
I was like, I literally said, Oh my God,

1129
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:47,220
I know a fucking ditzy girls have ruined
saying, oh my God. But it used to exist,

1130
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:47,910
you know,

1131
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:52,910
like when you saw a Zepplin fucking
burning back to the goddamn earth with

1132
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,900
people on fire jumping out of it.
Oh, that was all the humanity. Um,

1133
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:00,600
and then the last one isn't
even synchronized dancing.

1134
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,380
But this is the main reason
why it took me so long.

1135
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:09,660
And I never really got into Dave
Matthews was that stupid dance,

1136
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:15,150
that White Guy, James Brown fucking
dance that Dave Matthews used to do.

1137
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,800
Just search Dave Matthews dance.
And it's,

1138
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:20,910
it's,
you know,

1139
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,920
you really just want John Belushi to come
back from the dead and do that animal

1140
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,260
house scene where he
smashes the guy's guitar,

1141
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,770
except you really want them just hit
Dave right over his fucking head.

1142
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:37,070
And the only reason why I ever got
in to listening to Dave Matthews was,

1143
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:41,700
uh, their drummer. And
then I really liked,

1144
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:45,810
there was a saxophone solo that I just
thought was the shit on one of their

1145
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:50,610
earlier, uh, earlier ones. Other
than that, I just, I don't know,

1146
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,030
I just haven't been into them. So, and you
know, if you, you know now, right there,

1147
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:57,900
that's a lot of work. That's a lot of
shit to go look up. What? You know what?

1148
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,080
Why don't you take the
express checkout line? Okay,

1149
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:04,710
the automated checkout line and just
go to the [inaudible] podcast.com we'll

1150
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:07,500
have all those fucking videos
right up there. You can watch them.

1151
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:12,210
We'll have them in order the highway
to hell, right to Dave Matthews,

1152
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,690
I mean very little times in life.

1153
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:20,280
Do what would I ever be on the side
of a bully? But I swear to God,

1154
01:13:20,281 --> 01:13:21,780
if right in the middle of his dance,

1155
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:26,580
if the stereotypical high school
football player walked up to him with his

1156
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:29,470
jersey,
still on with two of his other meat,

1157
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:33,430
had friends and they just stuffed him
into some locker that they brought on

1158
01:13:33,431 --> 01:13:35,370
stage and smashed his guitar.

1159
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,850
You could hear me laughing from the back
of the fucking stadium that they were

1160
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:43,620
playing. I would completely enjoy it and
I don't know what that says about me.

1161
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,570
Oh,
we're 34 minutes in.

1162
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:47,880
I want to give a shout out to
all the joggers on the treadmill.

1163
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:52,380
You only got another word.
Another fucking 13 minutes left.

1164
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,650
13 minutes left.
All right.

1165
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,640
How smelly is the person next to you?
You know,

1166
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,950
are you on a treadmill right now?
You know what I love is those,

1167
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:06,870
those fucking people who don't even need
to do cardio and yet they still get on

1168
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:10,170
the machines and they always get on
like that. That old school stair master,

1169
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,250
you know people who just cheat.

1170
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:15,580
They have like a magazine open and
they're reading and then they look,

1171
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:19,510
they're like hunched over looking like
a question mark and that just sort of

1172
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:23,410
moving their feet like flat,
flat, flat, flat, flat, flat,
flat. That it, it's like,

1173
01:14:23,411 --> 01:14:25,390
what are you,
what are you doing now?

1174
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:28,660
You're trying to burn fat off of your
ankles. Is that all you're doing?

1175
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,230
You're not doing anything you have
full makeup on. Maybe that's just La.

1176
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,470
Do you know what time I was at the gym?

1177
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:40,990
I'm actually going to go outside the
outside the bounds of this podcast.

1178
01:14:40,991 --> 01:14:45,130
I actually did. I'm going to, I'm
going to soar to name a name here.

1179
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:49,540
I was on a, I was on the fucking,
the elliptical, you know,

1180
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:52,810
cause I want to have a hip replacement
when I'm 55, I went to dual,

1181
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,110
the fucking Earl Campbell special.
That's what the fuck I want. Right?

1182
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:59,920
Actually I don't, I don't universe.
I don't. Okay. I've learned that.

1183
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:02,630
Be careful what you say
your word is your wand. Um,

1184
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:08,230
so I'm at the fucking
gym. All right. And uh,

1185
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,200
there's this girl in front of me,
this beautiful girl,

1186
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:13,630
but she's got tattoos all over
herself and I'm just calling.

1187
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:18,330
Why the fuck did this gorgeous girl get
all those God damn tattoos right there.

1188
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,830
Fucking sweatpants.
They're hanging down.

1189
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:25,930
They can see about a 16th of
an inch of fucking ass crack.

1190
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,750
And I'm just going like that
girl. I swear to God, if he,

1191
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:32,560
if he just erased all those tattoos.
Okay.

1192
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:36,640
And you put her in a address
that that showed off,

1193
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:41,530
you know, the beauty of a
woman, but it wasn't trashy.

1194
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,030
Like this girl is like a
classy, gorgeous woman. Right.

1195
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:49,270
But she didn't know. She
said, you met sweating,

1196
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:51,610
fucking sweat pants hanging
off her and everything,

1197
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,220
and then like four days later
she's in the exact same one.

1198
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:55,870
I'm fucking sitting there.
I'm doing the elliptical.

1199
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:59,650
There she is against sweat pants hanging
off and just so happened I was done

1200
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:02,290
before and I'm walking by or
cause I got to go, you know,

1201
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:05,800
get the little fucking bottle of whatever
and spray down the machine I just used.

1202
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:10,090
I looked at her and it was a, Oh,
this is such a Kathy Griffin moment.

1203
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,720
I can't, I have Jesus. I,
you know, I can't tell.

1204
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:16,110
I can't fucking name names that would,
that would ruin the podcast. All right,

1205
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,190
I can't do that.
I can't do that.

1206
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,240
I'll fucking annoying is
that I couldn't do it.

1207
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:27,240
Kathy Griffin has already ruined
the reputation of redheads.

1208
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,890
No one's ever going to trust
us with his secret again.

1209
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:33,760
She fucking hangs out with famous people,
right? And they're all going, oh wow.

1210
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:35,770
Isn't this cool?
I'm hanging out with a fucking comedian.

1211
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,900
And then she goes on TV
and rats out everything.

1212
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:41,290
Then she picked her nose and I was like,
Oh my God,

1213
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:44,860
Michael Landon just picked his
fucking nose. I know he's dead.

1214
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,610
What the fuck? Right. So what am I going
to do? I'm going to do that on my podcast.

1215
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:57,790
I can't do it. All right? I gave
you enough of a description.

1216
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:01,570
It was a beautiful girl with way
too many tattoos. Figure it out,

1217
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:03,791
you know?

1218
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:07,150
Do you know any movie stars who are
beautiful with way too many tattoos?

1219
01:17:07,151 --> 01:17:10,460
You don't. All right, so now we're
out here. We're out of the movies.

1220
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:16,520
Wasn't a musician. It's
a TV star. Beautiful.

1221
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,700
Too many tattoos. There you go. You figure

1222
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:26,390
what? Are you laughing at? Nia? Am I
totally giving it away? No, I'm not.

1223
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,530
I don't name names.

1224
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,760
She just said you're ridiculous.

1225
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:39,260
The amateur thrill I get because I have
no idea if I'm making people laugh.

1226
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:42,230
If you actually left knee,
I know that I'm not wasting my time here.

1227
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:48,470
Yeah, I see that. I just
got an awe. Um, all right.

1228
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:52,610
What am I reading here?
Uh, all right. He did.

1229
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:56,360
Anybody notice last week when you watch
that? That sabbath fan going crazy.

1230
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,660
How much he sounded like he
could do a dead on Sam Kinison.

1231
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,540
I really thought that
that guy was awesome.

1232
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:07,430
Somebody actually sent me a fucking
hilarious email going like, come on bill,

1233
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:10,700
you think that that cause I said that
that guy is actually probably a parent

1234
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:12,890
cause he's at that age and he was like,
dude,

1235
01:18:12,891 --> 01:18:17,150
you really think anybody's fucking
that guy. I mean look at him. And uh,

1236
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:21,860
I would say this, if there was an even
amount of men and women on this planet,

1237
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,790
I would say that he would be in trouble.
All right?

1238
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:29,930
There would be a pussy shortage in his
life that would rival what the fuck we

1239
01:18:29,931 --> 01:18:33,980
went through in the early seventies with
the gas, with the, with the gas crunch.

1240
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:38,780
All right. There was a long
fucking way to go. Um, but no,

1241
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,420
fortunately there's three
women to every one guy.

1242
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:44,450
So as a man,

1243
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:48,200
if you're dating a loser chick or
someone who's just a total country,

1244
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:51,950
you really have no excuse. But women, they
actually, they haven't excuse, you know,

1245
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,880
when they say a good man is
hard to find a there. Right.

1246
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:01,130
I would think a man would be hard to
find if this fucking, you know, you know,

1247
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:06,080
three who host every fucking a hang
down there paying down over there,

1248
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:09,440
you know. All right, let's read this
fucking question here on, you know what?

1249
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:11,930
I don't want to do that. I don't wanna do
that. I don't want to do that just yet.

1250
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:16,630
Beautiful woman,
not a movie star with a lot of tattoo.

1251
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,710
It's not a musician.

1252
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,420
She also does not own an ice cream
store. Okay. That's it. I'm done with it.

1253
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:26,330
I'm done with the hints. Um, anyways,

1254
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:31,720
and I'm not going to confirm or deny him
either, but I do know the answer. Huh?

1255
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,960
You like,
I just went political.

1256
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,210
That's one of the greatest
quotes I've ever heard.

1257
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,750
Some lawyer for some fucking guy or
worked in Congress or whatever the fuck it

1258
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:43,370
was, came walking out and
they go, they go, is it true
that blah, blah, blah, blah,

1259
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:45,530
blah, blah, blah. And this guy
just looked at the camera. He goes,

1260
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:50,360
I can neither confirm nor deny that I
can either. Oh, I fucked it up. He goes,

1261
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:54,980
I can neither confirm nor deny that,
but I do know the answer.

1262
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:58,490
And he walked away. All right,
put that one in your back pocket.

1263
01:19:58,491 --> 01:20:01,460
Next time you're in a fucking jam.
When the cops are asking you a question,

1264
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,230
when your girlfriend and La, you're,
oh, you're cheating on me. You know,

1265
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,730
give her that Bruce Willis.
Look from die hard.

1266
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:12,720
Just look over your shoulder and then just
do that. Alec Baldwin sort of whisper.

1267
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:16,560
I can neither confirm nor deny that,
but I do know the answer.

1268
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,570
And then just sort of look off right
over a shoulder staring at something and

1269
01:20:21,571 --> 01:20:24,420
don't break a gaze and just walk
right by the side of her face.

1270
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:27,710
And I'll tell you, you're, you're
completely mind fucked you.

1271
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,290
You know your mind fucked her.
Okay.

1272
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:35,310
And then run down to the corner and try
when the fucking fire trucks coming down

1273
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:37,800
the street grabbed the side and jump on.
Go down the street.

1274
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:42,120
Get yourself a blowjob. Celebrate
Memorial Day weekend. All right,

1275
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:44,370
let's get into the
questions for this week. Um,

1276
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:50,710
I want to remind me to talk
about the 1958 Oldsmobile 88.

1277
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:55,500
That's my new fucking car, you know,
fuck it. You know what, I'm going to,

1278
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:59,970
I'm going to put some pictures up there
and some of my favorite old cars and uh,

1279
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,860
the Malibu,
the fucking Chevy impalas,

1280
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:08,070
those early 60 Chevy and pile is
the Lincoln continental error.

1281
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,650
JFK getting his brains blown out.
That fucking Eric Carr. The uh,

1282
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:18,360
I have never been a big Oldsmobile guy.
Even like the muscle cars.

1283
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:21,930
For me it was either the Mustang and
there was certain years of the uh,

1284
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,470
certain years of the um,
the Camaro that I really liked.

1285
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,230
Like as much as I liked
the late sixties one,

1286
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:33,231
I think that 19 seventy's Camaro where
they got like death fucking sharp nose on

1287
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:37,410
it is the meanest looking God damn car
and has got the corvette round brake

1288
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:41,510
lights, the cars, the shit and
always seem like whenever, I don't,

1289
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,540
cause it was a little bigger.

1290
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:45,450
It always just seemed like the gear heads
always figure out how to put like some

1291
01:21:45,451 --> 01:21:50,400
fucking 700 cubic fucking whatever
the fuck. I don't know about engines.

1292
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,870
They put a Goddamn jet engine in the
thing. Oh, and here's another thing too.

1293
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,240
Jay Leno,

1294
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:02,790
I'm fucking obsessed with
his car collection and I'm
always going on his website.

1295
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,620
Jay Leno's garage or whatever.

1296
01:22:04,621 --> 01:22:08,130
We'll have the link on the
[inaudible] podcast.com. Um,

1297
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:14,040
he has a fucking look up Jay Leno.
Here's another youtube video.

1298
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:18,390
Look up Jay Leno tank car,
this fucking maniac.

1299
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,350
But uh, uh, an engine,
he took it out of a tank,

1300
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:26,220
never get dentally Chrysler or
dodge made it cause it's a Hemi,

1301
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:30,840
but it's like a fucking 58 cylinder and
he made a hot rod out of it and open

1302
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:34,800
wheel hot rod. The fucking car was like,
I swear to God, it's like 25 feet long.

1303
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:39,750
It's longer than the 58 continental
right near one of the longest production

1304
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:44,370
cars of all time. I was actually
talking to my dad about old cars.

1305
01:22:44,371 --> 01:22:47,460
He knows all about all cars.
You know he's do that.

1306
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:51,850
When we were kids all the time be driving
down the street and we see a co they

1307
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:52,451
care.
I'd be like,

1308
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:57,451
dad is a 1955 Buick
special at a three 50 God,

1309
01:22:58,881 --> 01:23:01,120
there was a beautiful car. That's
what we always ended with. God.

1310
01:23:01,121 --> 01:23:01,954
That was a beautiful car.

1311
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:06,130
Actually met him one time watching one
of those Dudley movies where he plays a

1312
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:07,570
drunk and you know,

1313
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:11,770
he drives his Rolls Royce and he comes
screeching in hammered and he rear ends

1314
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:15,130
another car and my dad loves cars so much.

1315
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,080
He's literally watching it and as,

1316
01:23:17,081 --> 01:23:21,070
as the dude is coming in
and the screeching in the
car and it's so clear he's

1317
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:25,060
going to hit a fire hydrant or
whatever with that, that $5,000 grill,

1318
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:30,040
remember that 16 candles, you can have
five grand and I've got five grand, right?

1319
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,300
He comes flying.

1320
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:36,810
My Dad is literally going making
that noise, you know, liquid.

1321
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:40,660
Something precious is going to break
and it fuck he rear ends the car.

1322
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:44,140
Then my dad's like, no. Why
did they have to do that?

1323
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,460
I'm just sitting there laughing going,
dad,

1324
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:53,260
it's probably a fake Royal
Rolls Royce, you know? And he
just goes, yes, but I know.

1325
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:57,940
But whenever the fuck that means my
dad's hilarious and he and I and I,

1326
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,530
whatever is in his DNA about
loving cars from the 50s,

1327
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:07,360
forties and, and uh, the 60s, I got that.

1328
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,910
I don't know what happened. I tapped
into that shit. But like I said,

1329
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:11,320
I've never been an Oldsmobile guy,

1330
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:16,710
but there is a fucking 1958 Oldsmobile
88 that this guy really did.

1331
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:18,750
That is,
um,

1332
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:24,310
it's gold and just those
front four headlights.

1333
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:27,850
It's amazing because the Chevys went from,
from two headlights to,

1334
01:24:27,851 --> 01:24:30,910
for between 57 and 58.
I always hated that.

1335
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:34,810
I hated how the Bel Air looked cause it
just ended up looking like a checker cab.

1336
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:38,890
I like the 55 to 57 Bel air when
it had the single headlight.

1337
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:43,510
And it wasn't just the classic, you know,
for Memorial Day American car designs.

1338
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,480
How the fuck we went to that. And
I was actually thinking, you know,

1339
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,850
I have a kid here,
you know,

1340
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:54,780
am I really going to drive down the street
going Deta fucking 1987 Chevy Lumina.

1341
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,380
God, that was a beautiful car. I'm not
even gonna know what the fuck it was.

1342
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:04,660
Ford Astro, I'm not going to know
what it was. They all look the same,

1343
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:07,540
but back then they had like,
it was like,

1344
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,520
you know what I liked
about the cars back then.

1345
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:13,960
I might be wrong here because this
is a, you know, like I said, I'm not,

1346
01:25:13,961 --> 01:25:18,610
I'm not a fucking mechanic obviously
and shit, but like back then,

1347
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:23,260
the way they had things broken
down was, you know, nowadays like,

1348
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,123
um,

1349
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:29,710
I like how can I put this like it,
like Toyota,

1350
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:34,390
we'll make everything from
uh, from a, uh, like a Prius,

1351
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:35,650
low end car.
Like what?

1352
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:40,651
I drive all the way up to a high
end car that'll still say Toyota.

1353
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:45,490
I know they have Alexis and all that, but
Toyota, we'll make like a, like a 50,000,

1354
01:25:45,491 --> 01:25:50,050
$60,000 car and they'll make like
an 18,000, $20,000 car. And in all,

1355
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:52,120
it's all under the brand name Toyota.
Well,

1356
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:55,790
back in the day as far as my
understanding of it was Catholic.

1357
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,520
They went Cadillac, Buick,
Oldsmobile, Plymouth,

1358
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:05,240
Chevrolet and Chevy's
were like bottom end cars,

1359
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:10,810
you know. And then if you drove up, it
was like the status was like, what? Uh,

1360
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:12,800
what make you a drive?
And I believe,

1361
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:16,010
at least that's the way I kind of
understand if you drove a Chevy,

1362
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,590
you'll kind of a young guy,
you know,

1363
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:23,120
I'm making your way up the ladder and
you go back to your high school reunion.

1364
01:26:23,121 --> 01:26:24,320
It'd be like, what? What's he driving?

1365
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:28,910
Driving a Plymouth ag fucking shitty
was driving a Chevy and high school.

1366
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:33,800
The fuck, how old is he? You know, but
if you, if you got up to, you know,

1367
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,070
Buick and Oldsmobile you're doing are
right, but if you driving a Cadillac,

1368
01:26:37,071 --> 01:26:38,570
he will fucking run and shit.

1369
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:43,410
And I think that work the same way with
like Chrysler where when Chrysler Desoto,

1370
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:48,410
Plymouth and then dodge, I dunno, I just
met when I was in, when I was sitting,

1371
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:52,670
I was in a bar in, uh, Colorado. And they
had this old school poster that said,

1372
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:56,950
buy your wife a Chevy, which
is funny. It's like, Hey,

1373
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,150
buy one of those low end cars
that'll shut her the fuck up.

1374
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:01,220
It probably doesn't even
mean that tissue sound.

1375
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:05,330
My chauvinistically mine took dead.
Anyways, let's, let's, uh, we'll, we'll,

1376
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:08,450
we'll have a picture of
like, I'll say like, uh,

1377
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:13,780
like three or four of my most favorite
American cars in celebration of a

1378
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:19,880
memorial day weekend and all the troops,
you know, uh, you know what I mean?

1379
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,980
I can barely handle being in Arizona.

1380
01:27:21,981 --> 01:27:25,310
I don't know how the fuck I
would ever survive. You know,

1381
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:26,420
if I was ever going to go to war,

1382
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:29,330
I should have gone to war back in
the day when we were, uh, well,

1383
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:32,870
I guess we used to fight in the tropics.
Jesus Christ. That would have been,

1384
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:35,750
you know, I probably could do they
let red heads into the fucking army.

1385
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,840
You probably, that's is that,

1386
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:43,940
can I get a deferment for having no
pigment? I've never seen an albino marine,

1387
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:46,910
you know what I mean? Can I get,
that's like having flat feet.

1388
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,970
I got a bad back. I'm a redhead. Where
are you going to stick me? All right.

1389
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:56,720
You want to fucking have hand to hand
combat and Greenland. I'm there baby.

1390
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,370
I'm fucking right there of a knife for
my teeth. I'll take out a polar bear.

1391
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,180
I swear to God I won't.
Oh cower in my little fucking Igloo.

1392
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:08,560
Crying someone else's going private Burke.

1393
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:13,100
Get your shit together.
I don't want to go out there.

1394
01:28:13,101 --> 01:28:17,160
It's scary.
Nia,

1395
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:19,370
I am killing with you this week.

1396
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:25,370
I'm fucking funny today. See how
women, they always got to clarify it.

1397
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:29,000
Why can't you just say your fucking
funny? I'm funny today. You know what?

1398
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:30,320
That's why God made you so beautiful.

1399
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:32,240
Lead coming in here with your
hair looking all glamorous.

1400
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:33,470
I was really mad at you too.

1401
01:28:33,471 --> 01:28:37,480
I saw you come walking in here like
some old school movie star. See that?

1402
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:38,240
See how I do that?

1403
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,660
I insult him and then I quickly
compliment him and then I get the uh,

1404
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:42,920
what do you have in your hand?

1405
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:48,170
I am so why you like me
and women like the assholes

1406
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:53,260
they do, right? Cause you know,
we know what the fuck. Wow.

1407
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:01,680
Anyways, AH, whatever. I'm shit talking.
It's the holidays and be rubbing my balls.

1408
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:04,830
Drinking a beer in a minute. Cause I'm
an American. You think I'm going to read,

1409
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,550
I'm not that extra day. Going to
get dumber. That's what I'm doing.

1410
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:13,080
And we'll be puking in a fucking BFI.
Been behind Dennis. All right, here we go.

1411
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:16,980
Here's a question for a week, a
bill. Let me start by saying this.

1412
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:21,360
This question stems from events
spanning over the last six years or so.

1413
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,850
About six years ago at the age of 20,

1414
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:28,910
I was about a year and a half into what
at the time seem to be a really great

1415
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:31,710
relationship.
Coincidentally,

1416
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:34,890
my job and money situation
was also doing really well.

1417
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:36,750
Um,

1418
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:42,060
so I decided instead of throwing my
money away on rent, I'd buy a house.

1419
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,180
There you go. This guy's making
the moves. He's doing well in life.

1420
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:50,430
It's buying a house. Everything's good.
So far, being that I always plan ahead.

1421
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:53,610
I purchased a rather nice
house for a first home,

1422
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:58,920
even though I thought, uh, he said,

1423
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:00,180
even thought I knew it,

1424
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:03,810
even though I knew it was a little too
much money and now I didn't decide I

1425
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:08,460
didn't buy this to start a family or
for her. I just wanted a fucking house,

1426
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:12,840
uh, in the year or so after the
relationship really went downhill,

1427
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:16,890
mainly because I was working more in
spending less time and money on her.

1428
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:21,030
Um, okay. Uh, long story short,

1429
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:25,680
we split about two years later. Since
then, I've had many encounters with girls.

1430
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:29,940
Okay. So let me, let me fix this
with my awful reading. All right.

1431
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,890
Basically, this guy's dating a
girl. He's making good money.

1432
01:30:32,891 --> 01:30:35,670
He doesn't want to throw his
money down the toilet paying rent.

1433
01:30:35,671 --> 01:30:40,140
So he goes and he buys a house and then
now he's got a nut to fucking crack.

1434
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,700
Every month he works a little bit more.

1435
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:45,360
He's not spending time with his woman
and it goes downhill. Plus he's younger.

1436
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,120
That's pretty normal except
the fact that he owns a house.

1437
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:50,130
So now he's in this situation,
he's single.

1438
01:30:50,131 --> 01:30:53,550
He has this really nice house and this is
what's been happening since. All right.

1439
01:30:53,551 --> 01:30:56,880
Since then,
I've had many encounters with girls.

1440
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:02,210
The one thing they have all had in common
is their hatred and animosity towards

1441
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:04,980
my ex girlfriend and my house.

1442
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:10,290
I've even heard them say things about
sleeping in a bed I bought with her or how

1443
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,890
they don't like it that I did all
this with uh, with the other girl.

1444
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:18,960
I've been dating a girl for about two
years now and she's the same way. Uh,

1445
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:23,760
she even has problems with my dogs
because she says they were her dogs,

1446
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:28,710
meaning the ex. My question is this,
why is it never good enough? Well,

1447
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:31,320
if you're a fan of this podcast,
you've already asked that question,

1448
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:34,890
but I think it's timeless. So I'm going
to, that's why I'm reading this again.

1449
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,210
Am I suppose to start my life over every
time I want to begin a new relationship

1450
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,660
or is it that girls really always
want to have what they can.

1451
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:47,750
They cannot have half the country nowadays
are just waiting for some guy to put

1452
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:51,660
them up in a house and take
care of everything. But when
you give him the chance,

1453
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:56,160
the they bitch because they didn't
get to pick the fucking drapes.

1454
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:03,110
Oh this guy's making some good points.
Knee, I'm going to need your help here.

1455
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,470
He said, uh, I don't, uh, I don't get it.

1456
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:08,710
I've done really well for myself
and I've done it on my own.

1457
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:11,980
None of that had anything to do
with who I was dating at the time.

1458
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:14,470
And I hate the feeling bad
because I'm trying to make,

1459
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:19,380
because I'm trying to better
myself. What's your take? All right,

1460
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:23,310
Nia, what did you say on
this? US? She summed it up
really well here. What do you,

1461
01:32:23,311 --> 01:32:25,980
what do you think about this guy? Just
to, just to reiterate, you know, the deal.

1462
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,870
What, what, what is,
uh, what is his problem?

1463
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:34,100
I think the problem is the kind of people
that he dates cause I don't think that

1464
01:32:34,101 --> 01:32:38,420
there mature enough.
So like let go of the past,

1465
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:41,930
you know what I mean? It's like, of
course he stayed at other women of course.

1466
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,560
You know what I mean? It's not,
yeah, but let me ask you this. If,

1467
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:49,590
if when I met you already had a house,
right. And uh, it was, you know,

1468
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,510
it had a little bit of the female touch
to it, you know what I mean? Yeah.

1469
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:54,121
You know what I mean?

1470
01:32:54,121 --> 01:32:56,970
It's not like you walked in and there was
just a coffee table and like fucking a

1471
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:00,630
play station, you know, popcorn in
the cushions or whatever. Right.

1472
01:33:00,631 --> 01:33:02,930
I'm not saying this house looks like
that, but you know. Right. Yeah. No.

1473
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:07,310
If it looked like, and I still had the
bed that I used to bang the other one.

1474
01:33:07,311 --> 01:33:10,600
I mean I'll say at least she can do,
dude, you can leave, switch out the bed.

1475
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:13,880
You know what I mean? Bad though.
I thought. I think that's a little,

1476
01:33:13,970 --> 01:33:17,960
I think that's a little much, honestly.
What did the little much to still have it.

1477
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:20,390
Yeah. He's going to buy it.
And you know how much better,

1478
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:24,420
cause you don't have him buy a whole new
bed just cause he's slept with somebody

1479
01:33:24,421 --> 01:33:29,400
else and it ladies, can you see why
this is my girl? You're the shit. Yeah,

1480
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:30,870
because I mean how many,

1481
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:34,470
when you're dating somebody and you
have sex with them in their house,

1482
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:38,160
chances are they've had sex with somebody
else in their bed before you anyway.

1483
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:42,030
So now all of a sudden it's
like a big deal because no, he,

1484
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,790
he needs to date some more mature girls.

1485
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:48,240
But he's been dating someone for two
years. I don't know what he's been doing.

1486
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:51,850
I thought you said he, I just
focus on saying the words, right.

1487
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:58,260
Yeah. He says, you know what?
You know what this, this
house could be like the lock,

1488
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:02,940
the lock, the door test in a Bronx
tale. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah.

1489
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:05,230
Like if they can't deal with it
and they start giving me shit,

1490
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,960
you give him the heave Ho.
Exactly.

1491
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:10,110
I think they should get the
heave Ho this is my house.

1492
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,610
This is where I fuck you want in.
Not Quite.

1493
01:34:14,611 --> 01:34:18,090
So absolutely. But if
anything, he could, you know,

1494
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:22,590
get some new sheets or something. You
know what? Oh obviously, yeah, bed,

1495
01:34:22,591 --> 01:34:25,080
bath and beyond. I'm thinking about some
new sheets. You want to help me pick out?

1496
01:34:25,081 --> 01:34:29,760
Some girl would love that. Love
it. Yeah. There you go. Yeah,

1497
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:32,640
there you go. Yeah. And at what point
in the relationship should he do that?

1498
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:36,580
You know, cause we don't like being tied
down. I want to send the wrong message.

1499
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:39,070
I don't want to say that I love you,
but I want you to still bang me.

1500
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:43,930
Like at what point?
I think when it's like official date,

1501
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,890
like monogamous type thing is when
you can say, Hey, let's, you know.

1502
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:52,810
Okay. All right. Really? You answered
the question, don't oversell it.

1503
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:57,700
You answered it. It gets really annoying
that these girls would be like, my God,

1504
01:34:57,701 --> 01:35:00,950
I can't believe that you know,

1505
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:05,960
this is already decorated and these are
her dogs and her house and I can tell

1506
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:07,820
that there.
That's stupid.

1507
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:12,110
That's really hard to say how la
girls say favorite athletic fabric.

1508
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,180
That's going to be the podcast
for this week. So I guess,

1509
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:21,800
so that's your answer right there on,
you know,

1510
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:26,100
I'm not going to always defer those to
Nia, but I just think sometimes you're,

1511
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:28,200
you're really asking me what
women are thinking and I,

1512
01:35:28,201 --> 01:35:32,600
I think I've done enough trashing
of women and, uh, shut up.

1513
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,830
Um, I've done enough trash
enough. Um, and you know,

1514
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,440
that's actually a serious
question here because still you,

1515
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:44,020
you don't want to get to
that in a situation where,
I mean, you have to, I mean,

1516
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:48,170
literally sell the house. What if it's a
bad fucking market just to appease her?

1517
01:35:48,171 --> 01:35:52,440
That's ridiculous. But, uh, I, I
would, I, you know something, yeah,

1518
01:35:52,441 --> 01:35:56,590
I would actually say that if they were
actually going to be getting married,

1519
01:35:57,790 --> 01:36:00,700
you know, if, if he take
it to that level and, uh,

1520
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:03,490
there'll be a weird thing because when
you do get married and you want to pick

1521
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:06,970
out a house, it's the house that for
both of you that you want to live in.

1522
01:36:06,971 --> 01:36:10,090
And you know, this houses out there
that I just don't get like that though.

1523
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:13,150
You know that gingerbread looking
house sits up to fucking street.

1524
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,760
Like you know if I met the girl of my
dreams and she lived in that house and

1525
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:19,480
every day driving, Ugh, I
hate this fucking house.

1526
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:23,650
You know all those ones that
look like the, the castles,

1527
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,520
that employee but they're, they're just
the house so it looks stupid. You know,

1528
01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:30,940
Rapunzel let down your hair or
just sorta hop out that window.

1529
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,520
No, I I do. I know, I respect
that but I'm saying I,

1530
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,300
this is what I was saying like you know,
come on in and live here. I get that.

1531
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:43,150
But then you know,

1532
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:45,940
I'm sure he didn't buy a house
that's big enough to have like a,

1533
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:50,090
like a big family. I don't
know if he does. I'm not know.

1534
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:53,020
I'm just trying to kind of balance it out.
Allow what the fuck am I trying to do?

1535
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:53,740

because I'm going to get hammered today.

1537
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:02,980
Why? I was designated
driver last time, last time,

1538
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:05,020
last time.
Last time,

1539
01:37:05,021 --> 01:37:08,590

were in Boston and you guys all got Hamad

1540
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:12,250

to somebody. We don't know these people.

1541
01:37:12,251 --> 01:37:16,010
We can't go get hammered.
I can, I'm going to,

1542
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:18,790

1548
01:37:38,801 --> 01:37:42,280

on a fucking transcontinental flight.

1549
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:45,520
All right. That's it. Happy
Memorial Day to everybody. Sorry.
