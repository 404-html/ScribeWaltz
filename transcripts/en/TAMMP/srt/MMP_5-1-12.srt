1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,880
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:06,540
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,060
April 30th. And I just slammed the
fucking mixer now. Everything's too quiet.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,500
Hello? Hello? Hello my
baby. Hello my honey.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,590
Where the fuck have you
Ben? You fucking whole. Ah,

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,500
it's fucking 2:00 AM. Um, what's up?

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,020
How are Ya? I'm back from, um,

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,010
I'm back from the east
coast back from east coast.

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:36,610
I did a wonderful Gig at the University
of conquered in Concord, New Hampshire.

10
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:39,670
I had an awesome time Warner.
Thank everybody who came
out. I had a great time.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,200
And um, um, I don't know what to tell you.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,440
It's been a while since I did a college
gig. It was actually cool because it was,

13
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:52,420
it was open to the public. Usually
when they have college gigs, they,

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,780
they're not open to the public in case
you were wondering case you didn't

15
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,620
understand when I said usually they're
not open to the public the first time or

16
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:03,370
whatever the fuck I said, I don't know
what I just said. But usually it's just,

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,850
it's just all going to be students,
students,

18
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:10,690
and then a couple of crabby
teachers hanging in the
background or maybe some rat

19
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:14,500
have a student who's going to sit there
and wait for you to say something,

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
you know,
and then write about it and blog about it.

21
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:20,680
And the next thing you know you're
on good Mary. Good Morning America,

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,440
Good Morning America, right?
Who pitched that fucking show?

23
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:31,030
I mean God knows it's a hit,
but Jesus Christ. How do you,

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,170
how did you pitch that name
of for a show without either,

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,840
without like either
snickering as you said,

26
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:40,660
the name of the show or having
your balls pull up inside of you.

27
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,020
I want to do is show
nationally syndicated edits.

28
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,690
It starts at six in the morning and it's
called Good Morning America Gun Marnie

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,780
in America. Why would you do that? And we,

30
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:04,340
I just want to sit there and
be pleasant for three hours.

31
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,550
Do you know who took them meeting
with somebody the other day? Yes.

32
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:09,260
I just said that.
That's how Hollywood I am.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,320
I took a meeting and by taking a meeting,

34
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:16,040
I mean I went out and I got a fucking
Omelet, sat across from somebody,

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,490
see it like fucking toast
between the teeth is and um,

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,870
I dunno. I, I don't, I don't
think, I don't think it's
ever going to happen for me.

37
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,630
People. I think I'm going
to be like Willie Nelson.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,910
I think I'm going to be on
the road my whole life, man.

39
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,920
I gotta tell you got tell you what
I got that freedom in my bones,

40
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,250
man. I fucked up. You know what I mean?

41
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:42,030
I fucked up in my career.
How did you fuck up bill?

42
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,120
I stayed out there too long.
You know,

43
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,970
like that 43 year old
guy still in the clubs,

44
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,300
shocking in his gut with the button down
shiny shirt, still hitting on the lady,

45
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,710
right. Teeth are already
starting to discolor, you know,

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,980
cause you so old,

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,840
no matter how much you brush him,
they still just,

48
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:05,620
after a while you just can't keep
up with the, the red wine tied.

49
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,880
It just keeps turning your
teeth just a little grayer.

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,110
And, uh, I stayed out on
the road too long. I did.

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,760
I was a standup comic for too
long. I fucked up. I fucked up.

52
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:23,570
And now I don't know how to work with
other people because for 20 years it's

53
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:27,620
been, hey, here's an idea. And then I go,
yeah, I agree with that. You know why?

54
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:31,190
Because it's my idea. I totally
agree with that shit. And now,

55
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,340
now all of a sudden I'm coming in from,
from the fucking Bush,

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,480
right after 20 goddamn tours and now I
got to sit here and try and work with

57
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:40,740
other people.
I don't know how to do it.

58
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,540
I really shouldn't be
saying this on my podcast.

59
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,770
I don't know how to fucking do it.

60
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,400
Okay.

61
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,910
You know, we saw your
tape. We really liked it.

62
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,870
We thought that you were, you have really
mainstream sort of comedy. Uh, yeah.

63
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,160
I really don't think it's mainstream. I
say con to every other word. Yeah, I know,

64
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:01,180
but, but there's a main
stream sensibility to it.

65
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,530
And I'm literally sitting there going,
all right,

66
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,570
this is an argument and fucking six weeks.

67
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,410
Right. Got It. I'm in
what I'm talking about.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,720
What the fuck was I going with that?

69
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,660
Oh, let, let, let's, let's, let's rewind.
We weren't, we weren't New Hampshire.

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,610
Beautiful Goddamn state by the way.

71
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,910
And the people aren't as simple as
they try to make them every year,

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,260
every four years.
You know,

73
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,940
when there's a presidential election
and he do that little quaint piece above

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,840
the primary,
Zoe started rolling.

75
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,600
Okay.

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,680
Stay called New Hampshire and then
down to earth, kind of flat to people.

77
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,230
Whenever they say salt of the
earth down to earth, that's there.

78
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:40,890
That's there a euphemism for calling
you retarded. You know what I mean?

79
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,090
There really is sort of a media bias
where if you don't live in New York or La,

80
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:46,830
you're just considered a fucking moron.

81
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,743
You know what I mean?

82
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,100
All those God damn shows you just,
you just a fucking moron.

83
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,130
All the God damn TV shows,
you know,

84
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:06,131
there's always the smart person who moved
from New York or some major city back

85
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:09,780
to their hometown and everybody
there is a fucking retard. Right?

86
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,550
But, um, I don't know. Maybe
there's some fucking truth to it.

87
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,360
Who the hell knows. So anyways, I'm up in
Concord, New Hampshire, beautiful state,

88
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,590
lush state, plenty of trees, plenty
of water, plenty of game and fish,

89
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,400
you know, plenty of fatties, right?

90
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,340
Their food source,
they're already Mabo Day.

91
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,760
If you think about that,
when you look,

92
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,890
when you think about yourself as
like what kind of shape you're in,

93
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,920
like if someone was to
throw you on a grill,

94
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,330
like what kind of steak would you be?

95
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,020
You know, would you be a lean cut
of meat? You know, make a Philemon,

96
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,990
Yana would you be a fucking
New York strip? A goddamn

97
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,580
buy,
one of those John Candy steaks.

98
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,650
I gotta tell you I've been on the
fucking road a little bit. Uh,

99
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,920
and you know what it is? I take my special
and then I was just like, well fuck it.

100
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,790
I can get fat again cause I don't got to
worry about being on TV for another two

101
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:09,400
years. So I started eating
Sundays. What else did he,

102
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,740
I just started having lunches like you
did when you were in the seventh grade.

103
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,120
You know, there's like a bag of
Fritos and a soda and some sort of a,

104
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,060
some sort of protein with somehow
in there. Right. So Braid, um,

105
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,910
and he was, I'm, I'm trying to dance
around this fucking subject, but, uh,

106
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,430
the Bruins lost Bruins lost.
There's nothing like,

107
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,320
there's nothing like, I don't
know, losing an overtime sucks,

108
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,270
but, uh, I don't know what it is about
hockey. Hockey's just so fucking,

109
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,250
it just, it killed you, right? So we lose,

110
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,710
but I gotta be honest with the capital's
would definitely be a better team.

111
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:51,290
I felt that there was a better team,
pretty much every game.

112
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,730
This Guy Kevin Dupont for the Boston
Globe wrote a great article or he just

113
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,420
basically summed up the series where
they just were always a little better,

114
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:03,980
a little quicker. It had a little better
defense, a little bit of fore checking,

115
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:08,780
just a little better everything.
So they deserve it. Fucking pricks.

116
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,560
Um, so then what happens, right?

117
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,570
The overtime golf people aren't,

118
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:18,800
hockey fans were scored by
a guy who was not white.

119
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,380
He was not Asian. I was a black guy,
scored the goal. Right. So then like,

120
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:27,650
you know, it's game seven, it's in Boston.

121
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,870
Boston loses. So right. Then
you know what's going to happen?

122
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,580
All the fucking racist
coming out of the woodwork,

123
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:38,480
they texts like Goddamn a
hundred of those things.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,150
Just calling the guy the n word,
like you're talking like,

125
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:44,810
like shit that they would cut out of
the script and like Mississippi burning

126
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,880
going like, all right, you know
what? That's too fucking harsh.

127
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,170
So I started getting all these emails
going through what's up with all the

128
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,740
racist Boston fans and Blahblahblah
trashing me and I'm like, oh,

129
00:07:55,741 --> 00:08:00,020
isn't this hilarious? You know,
this is hilarious. You have,

130
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,890
so basically you're not
supposed to judge all by a few,

131
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,540
but it's okay to do it in this direction.
So I'm on my fucking high horse, right?

132
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,430
So I go back to Boston, just so happens
this weekend and I'm hanging out.

133
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:17,060
One night I'd have off in Boston,
and I hate to admit it,

134
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,150
I heard the n word twice.
I heard it alluded to another time.

135
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,940
And I just finally had the, I
had to fucking go home. You know,

136
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,030
I'm not saying it's worse than Alabama,
but I don't think it's any better.

137
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,650
Just fucking brutal.
Granted,

138
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,480
I did go to a moron bar. It was
the gene pool I was in, but I,

139
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,500
I, you know, I can't defend
it. I can't defend it anymore.

140
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,750
It's fucking embarrassing. Um, I dunno.

141
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,270
Just fucking embarrassing.
Good Morning America.

142
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:55,030
How are you? All right, let's
get on with the fucking, uh,

143
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,050
and unbelievably ignorant too. You
know, I just fucking, I, I just, I,

144
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,300
for the life of me,
uh,

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
I don't get it. One of the guys had a
lazy eye too. That's what killed me.

146
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,460
Okay.

147
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,241
You know, it's like, dude,

148
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:16,570
have you looked in a two
mirrors simultaneously and
seeing what you're looking

149
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:21,130
at? How the fuck are you looking
down on anybody? No, no, no. What,

150
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,180
so now I've got to trash people,

151
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,300
Lazy eyes to get my point across that
I don't appreciate racist people.

152
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:28,450
I'm a fucking idiot myself. But
you know what? I'm going to,

153
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:31,150
I'm doing something about it.
Unlike those morons,

154
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:35,830
I ran two back in my fucking
embarrassing city over the weekend. Um,

155
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,100
I'm sick of not having a
good science background.

156
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:43,330
So I actually went to a bookstore and
one of the few remaining bookstores out

157
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:45,230
there and,
uh,

158
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,280
I bought a book on how to rebuild a
carburetor and I also bought a book on the

159
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:54,070
elements. It's hilarious.
It's this big giant book.

160
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,800
Um, I'm, I'm, my mind is already blown
cause this shit is like magic to me.

161
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,660
Telling me that my foot,
that'd be things made out of matter.

162
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,760
What the fuck did it say? The
Earth, this book, your foot,

163
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,200
everything is tangible.
Everything tangible is made of elements.

164
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,910
Your foot is made mostly of oxygen
with quite a bit of carbon. Joining it,

165
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,070
giving it structure to the organic
molecules that define you as an example of

166
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:27,250
carbon based life. I was like,
that just fucking blew my mind.

167
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,450
I didn't know it was carbon and me.
Carbon fiber.

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,940
I don't know what carbon fiber,
what do they do?

169
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,080
Isn't it like even in bulletproof
vests, this a dumb idea. I have no idea.

170
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,090
So then I'm sitting there going,

171
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,210
so does that mean you can kind of
shoot me in the foot? You know,

172
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:47,950
with some sort of low caliber gun and
it's going to ricochet off or if it goes

173
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,300
through,
does all the air come out?

174
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,010
I just don't get it. I don't
fucking get it. All right.

175
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,110
I've gone on these fucking websites.
I try and read about how a plane flies.

176
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:04,560
I swear to God, Wikipedia. It's
hilarious. Like you know when you,

177
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,500
when you're reading about trying to
figure out how to God damn plane flies,

178
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,350
they have a,

179
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,400
you know, they'll have whatever.
They'll have like, you know,

180
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,150
two pages on the shit basically explained
and how's it goes down in like every

181
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:21,080
paragraph has like two words highlighted
in case you don't know what that means.

182
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,030
And I would have to click on every word.

183
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,850
So I'll click on a word and
then they start to define that.

184
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,040
And then it's the same thing.
It's another page of shit.

185
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,650
Wherever you paragraph does
three more things highlighted.

186
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,380
And then I've got to click on that thing
and I had just keep getting further and

187
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:36,890
further away from how
the fucking plane flies.

188
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,010
And I get all the way down to
like page one of Wikipedia.

189
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,710
God Damn like you.

190
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:47,890
No scratch and sniff picture with some
lady with like a sock puppet. Tronics

191
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,740
let's just, let's just start
really, really slow, Bill.

192
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,140
I'm sick of it. All right.
Um, I think there's something,

193
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:01,960
I don't know what's going on with my
truck. It hesitates in first gear,

194
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,290
first gear. So I thought it
was a clutch. Someone else's,

195
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,430
it could be the clutch will or
we could be in yet cabaret rater.

196
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,200
So I start reading up on carburetors,
right? And the whole fucking,

197
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,010
the whole philosophy create a vacuum
and in, in whatever that word is,

198
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,470
when you turn a liquid
into a Goddamn mist.

199
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,380
And at the end of it,

200
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:26,350
I'm just looking at this angle and this
is just a bunch of fucking screws and

201
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:31,270
springs, you know, why don't
we just go to the junk yard,

202
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:31,930
get one,

203
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,740
take it apart and put it back together
and just keep reading these fucking books

204
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,750
and eventually at some
point it has to click right.

205
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,820
So that's what I'm doing.

206
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,410
I went on Ebay because I'm too fucking
lazy because I'm a fucking Hollywood

207
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,900
phony.
Rather than go down to a salvage Yad,

208
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,030
you know I'm going to fucking just go
on Ebay and bid on some old carburetor

209
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,370
that's going to be a fight.
When that thing shows up,

210
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,760
it's going to be a little box and he is
going to see it and think I bought her

211
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:07,500
something nice. Oh, it has a lot of way to
it. It's going to be expensive. I would.

212
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:10,000
Or if it's shiny and it's
just going to open it up,

213
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,210
there's going to be some old fucking

214
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,690
old ass carburetor, you know? I Dunno.

215
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,320
You guys at least give me points
for trying. Does that work?

216
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,670
How about Paul Versey last week,
everybody who became a father again today,

217
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:32,590
congratulation to New Jersey's own, Paul
Versey and a beautiful baby girl today.

218
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,040
Uh, how about how much did he
kill it last week? You know,

219
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,990
people eat be the most people,
90% of people love them.

220
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,230
And then there was people who weren't
into sports and they thought it was like

221
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:45,430
the worst podcast ever. I had some
fucking Douche bag from across the way.

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,080
Uh, I dunno where it was over in
Europe or something. And he goes,

223
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:54,640
why don't you just call your podcast
a sports podcast? Just see, no,

224
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,870
you're losing all of your
foreign listeners, right?

225
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,190
Like he speaks for all a fucking Swahili.
I hate when people do that shit.

226
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,340
And it was one fucking God damn podcast.

227
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,240
And I talked about sports
every fucking podcast.

228
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,250
Alright, you selfish cunt.
I'll fucking unfunny.

229
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,910
Are the people in your country that
you have to go all the way across the

230
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,400
Atlantic Ocean to find a podcast
to listen to you jackass.

231
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,220
Let me tell you something.

232
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,390
A person from another country
don't fucking threaten me.

233
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,590
The right you can't. I don't give a
fuck if you listen to this and not.

234
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,000
I really don't.
So send me fucking Twitter messages like,

235
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,180
like I'm sitting here shaking.
All right,

236
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,660
I don't need you to
continue to make no money.

237
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,090
You ever thought about that

238
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,540
fucking Sydney of buying used carburetors
can sit there and threaten me like

239
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:57,800
you're taking something away from me.
Go fuck yourself with your wooden shoes.

240
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,970
Huh?
What do you live in Greece or something?

241
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,730
You're mad at me cause you
fucking economy. What the
hell is going on over there?

242
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,830
I don't understand how that whole thing
collapsed. Everybody rioted and a,

243
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,270
but still the,
everybody is still fine.

244
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,490
You know people are eating and they're
not happy, but you know they're out there.

245
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:20,920
That you Kevin a, a Greek salad. Did
they call it a Greek salad over there?

246
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,790
Did he just say, let me get
a salad. You know? Oh like a,

247
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,530
like, let's like in a, in Philly,
they're going, let me get a cheese steak.

248
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:31,950
They don't go, let me get a Philly.
Let me get a Philadelphia cheese steak.

249
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,210
Let me get a steak.
Um,

250
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,450
I want to still been with
fucking cheese was Jesus Christ,

251
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:42,840
nor do people so fat and ugly
and that Goddamn city. Huh? Um,

252
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:47,400
they one the other day, right?
Philadelphia is a big wind. Danny Briere.

253
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:50,730
It's the only time I've ever seen a
guy scored two goals in one overtime.

254
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,210
Okay.

255
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,570
You did the impossible. First
time he did it, he was a cheetah.

256
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,950
You know,
there was a kicking motion.

257
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,230
I was in a bar actually
drinking when that happened.

258
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,150
Listening to people say racist things to
me, dawn is bad enough that they lost.

259
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:10,930
But then the guy who scored it
was like fucking insult to injury.

260
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:14,750
You know what I'm saying?
Kid? And I was like,

261
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,710
what are you one of those fucking racist
on Twitter? Oh, no, no, don't, don't.

262
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,790
I'm just, you know, I'm just
saying, I like when people do that.

263
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,530
They fucking backtrack the ignorance
of what people were saying to me.

264
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,260
Yeah, dude, you hear
about showing show? Yeah.

265
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:31,340
I got two fucking kids and
then his wife went gay.

266
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,090
Swear to God, direct
quote, his wife went gay.

267
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,440
She fucking abroad now fucking shocks kid

268
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,280
went gay. Um, you know, like, like you,

269
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:53,110
I went to the star, then I went to
the post office and then I went gay.

270
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,160
That's, that's what happens. There's
a little, there's a store down there,

271
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,670
a little homosexuality store
that you can go to. Um,

272
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,010
fuck jaw droppingly stupid.
Not saying everybody.

273
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,170
The irony is that Harvard is there. That's
the funny thing at MIT and all that.

274
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,340
You know, Boston has this weird
fucking sort of like, you know,

275
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,410
couple people who are really smart
and then the rest of us are a,

276
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:23,810
okay,

277
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,220
it's, it is goodwill hunting,
except we're not good at it.

278
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,093
Math.

279
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,110
Oh, that's stupid fucking
movie. Jesus Christ.

280
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:38,710
He is a genius at math. And he goes
around beating the shit out of people.

281
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:43,120
When was the last time a mathlete
went around bullying people,

282
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,193
you know?

283
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,510
Okay.

284
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,470
And then what an accountant who can do 30
pull ups? What, what else? What I mean,

285
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,950
how much of a fucking leap am I supposed
to make? And these God damn movies,

286
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,770
you know what line I hate
the most in goodwill hunting.

287
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:58,450
I know I brought this up
before is when fucking, uh,

288
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,780
they're in the therapy
session and uh, you know,

289
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:04,614
he's got the hammer,

290
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,700
the ranch and I said I took the fucking
wrench cause you know, fuck him, right.

291
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,450
Um, or whatever the fucking
line is. And then they ask,

292
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:13,940
okay,

293
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,510
he asked Robin Williams what
he's benching and he says to 60,

294
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,750
yeah,

295
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,090
there's no way that was
written in the script.

296
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,080
How much power does Robin Williams
have that the director won't be like,

297
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,730
Hey Robin,
can you drop that number down?

298
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:35,620
A little bits of this movie can stay
remotely believable to 60. What?

299
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:40,570
After you add up benching
70 pounds, 10 times. Wait,

300
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:44,520
70 pounds. 10. That's 700.
Uh, let's, let's go back to
the book elements here. Um,

301
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,120
anyways, plowing ahead. Um, this is
the Monday morning podcast by the way.

302
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,630
And a lot of you have a lot of you
have been given me shit by the way,

303
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,220
cause lately they haven't been coming out.

304
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,600
I have a phenomenal fucking excuse that
you're going to understand in about 10

305
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:01,940
months as to why I was
late. All right. You can't,

306
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,220
why do you call it the
Monday morning podcast?

307
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:08,460
Because I record them on Monday mornings
except when I'm busy and I love for the

308
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:12,200
most part, I get the fucking
thing out, you know? Right.

309
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,810
Right now it's 10 30 Monday morning,
my time when I'm doing this fucking thing.

310
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,600
So it is the Monday morning
podcast and my fucking world.

311
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,550
Can you stop making it about yourself?

312
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,193
Okay.

313
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,240
Then every once in a while,
once in a fucking Blue Moon,

314
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,410
I'm so busy I can't get it done until
the Tuesday and all these fucking cons

315
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:30,430
come out of the woodwork.

316
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,290
Yeah.
Why aren't you glad you're working with,

317
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,000
yeah.
Why don't you go fucking slap your mom?

318
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,690
Why don't you do that a couple of
times? Forehand, backhand, forehand,

319
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,000
and then just fucking give it one of
those little nose twisties for being dumb

320
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,470
enough to not be on birth control.
All right. Advertising advice. Uh,

321
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,221
hey bill.

322
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,280
Instead of telling people to go to your
podcast page and click on the Amazon

323
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:57,630
link, tell them to go to your podcast
page, clear the cookies on their browser,

324
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,830
then click the amazon.com link.
As soon as they get there,

325
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,870
add the page to their bookmarks.

326
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,160
Then every time they visit amazon.com
from the bookmarks, their bookmarks,

327
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,910
it's the same as clicking the link on
your page without actually having to go

328
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:16,230
there. It's the fucking future,
man. That's what he wrote.

329
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,620
Um, yeah. If my listeners are smart
enough to do that, I don't know how,

330
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,650
how do you clear the cookies? How do
you do that? I don't know how to do it.

331
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,840
I bought a new laptop,
by the way. Everybody,

332
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,990
and it's the most annoying thing ever
is now. I don't know how to do anything.

333
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,150
You know, I, I can't fucking
do anything anymore. I want to,

334
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,490
I can't even figure out how to fucking,

335
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,460
yeah,

336
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,750
put a photo up to make it my screen saver.

337
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,120
I don't know how to do it now because
now it's completely fucking different on

338
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,780
the new Mac book pro,
you know,

339
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,180
I don't understand these fucking
computers. It's like, you know,

340
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:55,030
I go out and I buy a car. Yeah, it's a
little faster. Technology's a little,

341
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:59,370
but I still know how to drive it. Gas
Brake, put it in drive. You know this.

342
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,300
Not these fucking cunts. Not all
fucking Nah, no belt Magoo there.

343
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:07,360
Whatever the fuck his name is. The guy
with the new balance who finally died.

344
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:11,920
Thank God that douchebag. Oh,
we switched and everything up.

345
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:16,360
Never having the chargers fit the old
phone. All his shit going into the ocean.

346
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,890
You know, I love that guy. Like used to
compare themselves to Gandhi. Did Gandhi,

347
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:24,850
did he have like a sweatshop of people
jumping to their deaths because they

348
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:28,750
would make an Gandy fucking iPads.
Like I had a lot of balls, man.

349
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,160
You know, he really did with this
turtleneck and his salt and pepper.

350
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,760
Pubes I really didn't like,
uh,

351
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,380
been a pothead for 10 years and we
go, here we go. 20 minutes in Ben,

352
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,220
a pothead for 10 years. Uh, hey bill,

353
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:45,940
I'm a comedy junkie among other things
and I really appreciate your show. Well,

354
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:50,130
thank you very much. Um, it helps me
get through my commute, but up to pathy,

355
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,430
uh,

356
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:56,380
and the awkwardness of working in a law
firm and I just want to say I appreciate

357
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,340
you to show it's really a release for me.
Um,

358
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,520
why is it awkward working in a
law firm has that word awkward.

359
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:10,030
Just kind of lost all meeting. Is that
like the default adjective everybody goes,

360
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,310
everybody goes to now, Hey,
I ran into your girlfriend
the other night in the bar.

361
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,770
Awkward.
Why was it awkward?

362
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,290
It's a bar was what, what happened
in there? That was awkward.

363
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,550
You work in a law firm. Why is that
awkward? That sounds like a very good job.

364
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,990
Why am I speaking like a
robot? Um, anyways, but anyway,

365
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,320
I've smoked weed on and off taking year
breaks here and there since about 2001

366
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,950
when I was in high school. However,
when I did smoke, I smoked every day,

367
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,240
multiple times a day.

368
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,760
It really didn't affect me much until
recently. About eight years of this.

369
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,220
After about eight years of this,

370
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,810
when I turned 25 I started to notice
some slowness, physically, mentally,

371
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,040
and just in everything I did.
I hated it,

372
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,990
but I didn't want to stop smoking.
I could very well stopped easily,

373
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:07,570
but I'd always feel like
I'd be happier high.

374
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,290
I remember you talking about some guy who
knew who freaked out when he found out

375
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,420
he couldn't smoke when you
took them on a road trip.

376
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,710
That is a little extreme to me and I am
nowhere near that type of personality.

377
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,740
I'm now 26 and I'm slowly slowing down
quite a bit to just once a night if at

378
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:26,860
all. We can also get
expensive the more you smoke.

379
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,570
I think smoking is okay,

380
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,110
but if you haven't then I wouldn't
because it's sort of like beer where it

381
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:38,890
starts off as nothing and
ends up as a crutch anyways.

382
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:41,110
I just feel like if you smoke,
that's fine,

383
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,200
but be organized about it and make sure
it's not affecting your personality or

384
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:47,960
other types of interaction or whatever.
Honestly,

385
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:51,100
I wish I never smoked in my life because
it's so hard to look at someone's

386
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:53,450
smoking it and not want to ask for a Toke.

387
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,740
If anyone who smokes weed wants some
advice, mine would be moved to California.

388
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:02,570
Get a card, smoke your heart, heart out,
and find out how positive slash. Negative.

389
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:07,520
It really is. At least this way you're
doing it legally. I know, because I,

390
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,890
I know this because I did it not for the
weed, more for girlfriend, but I digress.

391
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,210
And if anyone cares, girl scout cookies.
Cookies are the shit. By the way,

392
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,650
if you thought I was white, I'm
not, I'm Chinese. All right.

393
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,010
I think it was a little high when he
wrote to us that last paragraph use by the

394
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:30,270
end of it. He's just fucking, he's
eaten cookies getting paranoid.

395
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,850
They think I'm white man.
Um,

396
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,930
okay.

397
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,910
Yeah, I think, well, I think
we this, it's just like,

398
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,830
I think a lot of ways it's like booze in
that, uh, you know, you have a beer here,

399
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:45,130
you have a beer. That's not a big deal.
But yeah, it starts consuming your life.

400
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,140
I mean that's a major statement. Like,
you know, I could not smoke weed,

401
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:54,250
but I just feel I would
be happier if I did. Um,

402
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,670
for some reason with weed,
people don't really see that as,

403
00:24:57,671 --> 00:25:01,060
that's like a major red flag.
It's just not considered.

404
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,530
That's actually considered funny and like
logical. But like if I said, you know,

405
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:06,520
I don't have to drink,

406
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:10,210
but I just feel like my life is happier
when I do or I'd be happier if I was

407
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:12,250
drunk.
You know what I mean?

408
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,930
Or people will get like high before they
go in and go to work and they're kinda

409
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,570
like high for the first couple hours.

410
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:19,720
Like that would be like me shotgunning
a couple of beers in the parking lot.

411
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,650
I mean, just picture that, you know,
walking by and you see your boss,

412
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,390
you catch a mid, like, you know,
he's looking out of his peripheral.

413
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:31,480
Is he sucking on the side of a bud tall?
You know,

414
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,110
I dunno.
I think it's definitely like anything,

415
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,870
it can't be good to sit there and putting
all that fucking smoke in your lungs

416
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:38,920
the same way.
Uh,

417
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,940
okay.

418
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,450
I Dunno, I think he's a danger about
alcohol is when you fucking up your liver.

419
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,850
I don't think you really
notice until it's fucked up.

420
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,390
Whereas like I think if you smoke a lot
you kind of, Oh my God, I'm really winded.

421
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:53,040
This is really affected me.
I think like your liver is uh,

422
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,050
you only recently I started
learning about how bad,

423
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,370
okay,

424
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,270
booze man, you always hear that
cirrhosis of the liver. But I,

425
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,770
I mean I thought you literally had to
be walking around with a glass in your

426
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,580
hand all the time. And I know
a number of guys who are, uh,

427
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,000
you know,
dealing with that shit now and uh,

428
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,880
lemon put lemon in your water clears out
you fucking live. Uh, um, so what was,

429
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:20,490
what was actually your point here then?
A pothead for 10 years.

430
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:24,870
You just sharing your experience as
you rolled up another one and got super

431
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:25,704
paranoid.

432
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,193
MMM.

433
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,580
All right. Cheating whore
is a great story. Bill,

434
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:34,760
I want to thank you for helping me out
with a really hard time of my life.

435
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,680
MMM.
Um,

436
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,670
I'm 24 years old, a student at a
university and I had a girlfriend.

437
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:43,080
Could this font be any fucking,

438
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,480
uh, and I had a girlfriend
two years younger than me.

439
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,580
We were going out for seven months.

440
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,450
She's working at a local cafe
and about three weeks ago,

441
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:59,070
out of the fucking blue comes to me and
tells me that a regular at the cafe was

442
00:26:59,071 --> 00:26:59,904
hitting on her.

443
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,660
Okay.

444
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,980
She told me that she had a boy.

445
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,130
She told him that she had a boyfriend
and was reassuring to me that nothing was

446
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:06,880
going on,

447
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,940
but we had some problems
in our relationship that we
needed to fix because she

448
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:13,750
felt good with all the flirting
and she didn't want to cheat on me.

449
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,143
Wait a minute.

450
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,450
But we had some problems
in our relationship that we
needed to fix because she

451
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:23,410
felt good with all the flirting
and she didn't want to cheat on me.

452
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,340
I'll say she liked this guy hitting
on him. Oh, Jesus. Anyways, he says,

453
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,680
I took that shit hard and I
told her I would do anything,

454
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,940
do anything to make her happy, even
though she knew I loved her. So I did.

455
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,510
I gave her all my time and energy
to make her happy. Oh, there you go.

456
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,740
There's a fucking recipe for misery.
Fuck all my dreams.

457
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:45,190
Let me sit here and cater to
your emotions. You can't. Um,

458
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,130
that was the cliff notes.
Anyways, then one week ago,

459
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,350
she calls me and breaks up with me,

460
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,240
tells me that she fucked with that
guy because she was developing strong

461
00:27:55,241 --> 00:28:00,241
feelings for me and was
scared that I would hurt her.

462
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,140
Ah,
you got to give it up to them.

463
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,140
You gotta give it up. Women
are like, they're a guy has
to learn how to be a pimp.

464
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:14,020
Women just naturally know how to do it.
And I swear to God,

465
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:17,320
it all comes down to the fact that
they can't beat the shit out of us.

466
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,150
The fact that we could beat the living
shit out of a woman is what kills us in

467
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:22,984
an argument.

468
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,730
Because you're taking solace in
something that you're never going to do.

469
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,600
You know, it's this card you
never gonna play, hopefully,

470
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:34,030
unless you're a fucking animal.
Um,

471
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,960
meanwhile they are developing themselves
mentally and figuring out how you work

472
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:41,460
psychologically.
And they're just like,

473
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,050
I really think once you're in or where
I'm sharing a real like relationship. Um,

474
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,310
just to make it fair to help the guy,
I think like three days a week,

475
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,940
or at least during the arguments,
like the second the argument starts,

476
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,810
the woman should always have on like
tearaway clothes and she pulls him off and

477
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:00,870
then she's immediately dressed
like Hannibal Lecter. You know,

478
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:04,220
that ice cream man outfit that he had,
you know, has her hair slicked back seat.

479
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,580
Just really know what you're fucking with.
That is brilliant.

480
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,370
Can you imagine trying to say
that to your girl? Listen,

481
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,380
I fucked this hottie at work,

482
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:17,460
but it's only because I care about you
so much and I was worried that you were

483
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:22,200
going to hurt me because my
love for you is so deep. Jesus.

484
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,930
You know what?
I think I would high fiber.

485
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,840
I'd high five on knock a couple
of her fucking press on nails off.

486
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:32,130
That was a good one. So anyways, he
goes, I know it's fucking retarded.

487
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:35,760
I lost my mind. I went to the cafe
and I beat the shit out of that guy.

488
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,810
Wow.
Mainly because if I didn't,

489
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,550
I was going to beat her
and she didn't deserve

490
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,840
to find any excuse

491
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,373
what?

492
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,390
Mainly because if I didn't that was going
to beat her and she didn't deserve to

493
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,500
find any excuse.

494
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,610
And because he was wasn't a
hole for hitting on a girl
who was in a relationship.

495
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,910
Um, yeah dude, I don't know about
that. I don't know about that.

496
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:07,750
He's doing what a guy does. A guy goes
around and tries to fuck women. Okay.

497
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:10,780
He's not in a relationship with her and
he's certainly not in a relationship

498
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:14,270
with you. The person who was wrong
in that is the woman you know.

499
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,570
Now fat guy knows you or you came down to,
he gave him a warning,

500
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,200
you know, came down with you, Clint
Eastwood Eyes All squinting up.

501
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,520
Stay away from her. You know you
did one of those and then he didn't,

502
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:28,650
then that's on him,
but you just come out of nowhere.

503
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,710
Can you please elaborate on that?
Like what was he doing?

504
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,560
Yeah.

505
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,390
Was he down at the
restaurant? Like, you know,

506
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:38,280
making a fucking egg over easy and
all of a sudden you came back and

507
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,580
did you beat him down the street?
Like fucking a sunny and the Godfather?

508
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,210
Did he need you to throw in into some
like trashed bill trashcan lid or

509
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:52,100
something like that? Like one
of those fucking, the whole,

510
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,990
Oh God damn fucking neighborhood season.
Um,

511
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,940
I actually respected in a way,

512
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:02,600
but you shouldn't do it because then
you get sued and then she actually feels

513
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:05,720
like she's right. See,
I knew he was crazy. Um,

514
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,990
now the bitch is blaming me for
making a scene. Oh, there it is.

515
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,760
And because her boss, her boss is
look at her and think she is a whore.

516
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,920
If she,
if she didn't,

517
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,360
if she didn't thought about that, if
she didn't think about the consequences,

518
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:25,690
why should I was,
was I in the wrong?

519
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,440
I don't want to regret what I
did because she deserved it.

520
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,340
All I did was lover and she slept with
another guy at fucking hurts, man.

521
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:36,400
It really does. I can't move on. Thank
you for hearing me out. All right.

522
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,470
You know what,
um,

523
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,730
when I said you shouldn't have beat the
beat the guy up that that was for you,

524
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:43,900
that had nothing to do with her.

525
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:48,901
I just don't want you to get
sued or go to jail or uh,

526
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,790
you know, you know, you get
a fucking record. I mean,
dude, you're, you're, you're,

527
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,624
you're,

528
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,840
you made a move there that could
alter your future and believe me,

529
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:00,954
dude,

530
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,250
this is a great thing about horse
is when you really did this,

531
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,880
I mean,
this is going to hurt like hell,

532
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:10,640
but there's going to be a moment where
you're going to find this fucking

533
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:14,390
hilarious.
You really got to believe me on this one.

534
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:18,470
At some point you're going to be talking
about it out loud to your friends and

535
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:21,800
you're just going to say the
situation out loud that you were in

536
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,290
and

537
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:27,970
there'll be enough time has gone by that
your feelings for this girl have faded

538
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,840
and it's almost like it's somebody else
and you're going to laugh at yourself

539
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,240
and then you're going to laugh
at the whole fucking thing

540
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,753
and

541
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,930
it's probably going to hit that. It
was that, why did I risk going to jail?

542
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,350
Maybe you know,
I don't have,

543
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:48,130
I have like a felony or something
like that on your record.

544
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,130
Like this isn't the mother your kids.
All right,

545
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:54,700
you can't trust this girl as far as
you can fucking throw her. You know,

546
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,350
you can't as far as you could fucking
pick her up by the back of her fucking g

547
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:03,560
string and the scruff of that awful
tattoo on the back of her neck that she,

548
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,940
if she doesn't have it, she's going to
get at some point and you can't trust her.

549
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,381
You can't trust her.

550
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:13,220
So you just got to get to the
bullshit and you're going to be fine.

551
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:17,240
But in the future, dude, I would not
go. I mean you just basically, uh,

552
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,780
you like the transporter
for real. You just, you did,

553
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,220
you did like the movie version of what
everybody wants to do in that situation,

554
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:28,490
but you did it for real and you
somehow got away with it. Uh,

555
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,210
did you split your fucking slacks when
you threw that high kick to his fucking

556
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:37,210
cheap bone?
I just read that recently.

557
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:41,200
I read an article about that guy
is Jason stayed them. How uh,

558
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,120
he has to have special pants on because
he can kick his leg so fucking high.

559
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:50,320
You can't do that in a suit
without ripping. Now, if I
was directing the movie,

560
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,970
I would be like,
dude,

561
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,190
that's going to make this fucking movie
so much better that if you're standing

562
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,250
there and some Anderson little suit
and you're kicking so much ass,

563
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,270
your slacks a literally
disintegrating off your fucking legs.

564
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,860
How funny would that be? Then? He's
standing there in the end, his fucking,

565
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,090
his slacks are looking like, you
know, the hulks pants, right.

566
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:15,370
Bill Bixby his pants after
he turns into the hulk.

567
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:16,840
Okay.

568
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,510
There are, that's that, that would
be the funniest fucking thing ever.

569
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,780
I don't know, but it will be all
like the INSEAM and the crotch.

570
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,770
But like down by the bottom off, I would
totally have it. I'd be like, dude,

571
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:31,330
we got to do this with real slacks and
you have to wear knee high black socks

572
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:35,680
with fucking sock. Garters just like,
we'll just do one like this. Jason,

573
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:40,470
can we just do one like this? Um,
yeah, dude, you, you did that.

574
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:43,170
You went the real deal on this. So, uh,

575
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,610
luckily you got away with it.
Um,

576
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:52,670
and I think it's great that everybody
knows that she's a fucking whore and do it

577
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,130
just affected,
look it,

578
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,190
she fucked around and immediately
tried to put the guilt on you.

579
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,140
Then you went down there and beat the
shit out of that guy because she's a whore

580
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,200
and now she's coming back at you
once again, blaming you. So this,

581
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:09,070
this was would have been the, the, uh,

582
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,630
the cycle that you would, you would've
had if you, if you decided to, uh,

583
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,060
share your life with this person,
they would constantly be hurting you.

584
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:20,140
And then blaming you saying that you were
the reason and I swear to God and you

585
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:22,790
want to fucking awful says guys out
there and relationships like that.

586
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,420
Just allowing these women to
do shit like this. You know,

587
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,430
but it's never talked about on TV because
it's considered misogynistic because

588
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:34,560
it's not every woman doing it.
It's not every woman.

589
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,790
That's just the select few.
Yeah know.

590
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,320
So we're the guys who beat the shit
out of women. Those are a select few.

591
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,920
Doesn't stop you from talking
about it, nor should it. All right,

592
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,660
there are hypothetical talk show hosts
that I'm, I'm sitting across from.

593
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,090
Um, all right, let's do some
advertising. Everybody. Hey, you ready?

594
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,850
Are you ready for some advertising?
Sit on down.

595
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:03,840
Everybody get out of fucking pencil.
What the hell is it?

596
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,510
I'm the God damn worst.
I had this whole fucking thing set up.

597
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,270
There it is. All right.
Hey everybody, stamps.com.

598
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,330
I think you got this one memorized
at this point, but I got to tell you,

599
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:19,890
I have new listeners
every week. Um, you know,

600
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,580
last week I was in,
uh,

601
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,630
my podcast actually was
quoted in a set a fucking ant.

602
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,900
What the fuck is that? I never know if
I got to see, I just want, I want to do,

603
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,870
I want to learn more about insects.
Now do I kill this one?

604
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:39,780
And then that means I have more insects
because this thing is eating the other

605
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:44,010
ones.
It's like a miniature lady Bug lady.

606
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,870
Um,
you know,

607
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,580
last week my podcast was actually
quoted in featured in Star magazine.

608
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,720
So there you go. All right, so I
know I have some new listeners.

609
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,620

634
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,380

waiting for. I know they have a website.

635
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:33,630
I can't figure it out.
All right,

636
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:37,210
which once again shows you how awesome
stamps.com is because I could actually

637
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:40,570
figure it out and I'm a moron.
There you go. All right,

638
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,630
friends. Hoar problem cheating, whore
friends. A lot of horse stuff this week.

639
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,570
You know, if I was into
this stats, the lovely Nia,
everybody, where are you going?

640
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,160
Oh, you going to go work out? All right,
I'll see you later. Bringing the dog down.

641
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:01,180
What's up puppy? What's that puppy? Oh,

642
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,390
Bojangles.
You know what's great about a pit bulls?

643
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:07,930
You can really throw them
around, you know? That's right.

644
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,670
I was hanging out at a friend's house and
he had this little cute little dog and

645
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:15,160
I swear to God, this thing must
have weighed like two pounds.

646
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:20,080
I was like afraid to touch
it after messing with this
thing my dogs made out of

647
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:24,340
titanium. Dude, you
smell, you need a bath,

648
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,130
you know. Hey codependent, why
don't you go lay down over there?

649
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:34,770
All right and don't step on my
book about the elements. Clia.

650
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:35,604
Lay down,

651
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,793
lay down.

652
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,100
Why do they always get a walk around for
like 20 seconds in a circle before they

653
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:47,060
figure out how they're going to lie
down once the deal, uh, friends.

654
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,460
Hoar problem.
Mr. Brewer,

655
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:52,670
I love the podcast and would really
appreciate some advice regarding my best

656
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:56,180
friend in me. Uh, okay,

657
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,100
let's try and guess what this is going.

658
00:39:58,101 --> 00:40:01,310
Either your best friend is dating a
whore or your best friend is a whore.

659
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,160
If your best friend is a whore,
why wouldn't you want to fuck her?

660
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,920
Why don't I just read it?
All right.

661
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,080
Let me start with some
background information.

662
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:11,810
My best friend and I have known
each other since I can remember,

663
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,910
but recently I'm almost at the point of
losing contact with him because he acts

664
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:19,640
like a fucking idiot over some douchebag.
Girl.

665
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,890
He's never been a ladies man.
So He's been on and off with this one,

666
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,590
this one client for quite a while.
Oh yeah.

667
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:32,360
He's hanging onto it and he's hanging
onto it. That's what he's doing. Yup.

668
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,510
He's afraid of, no one's not going to
come along and he's clinging to that.

669
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,790
That one piece like dead, uh, like
Leonardo at the end of a titanic.

670
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,330
Um,
and he's going to have the same fate.

671
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,470
And this girl always used to have a
boyfriend, always has to have a boyfriend,

672
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,610
cheats on them all the time, not
exaggerating, high school dropout.

673
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,250
And she loves any drama she can get.
Jesus Christ,

674
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:00,880
she loves any drama she can get
her grimy, come covered. Hands on.

675
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,200
I hate this whore very much. Yeah. In
case we didn't understand that with Hulu.

676
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,940
First six sentences,
uh,

677
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:10,390
there are not enough adjectives in the
dictionary or synonyms in the fucking

678
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:14,020
thesaurus to describe this piece of shit.
So now to the story,

679
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,340
a couple of months ago,

680
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:20,230
she dumped her boyfriend and a day
later started dating my best friend.

681
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,920
Nobody in our group of friends liked
her and she always acted like she was

682
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:28,390
miserable while dating my friend,
weeks after them dating,

683
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,100
uh, the old cum dumpster is pregnant. Oh,

684
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,490
get a paternity test immediately
get one of them little Swaby swabs.

685
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,840
Uh, he came anyways, he came
inside. All right, dude. Jesus,

686
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:49,260
we get it.
All right.

687
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,340
He based, let me, let me
try and clean this up. Uh,

688
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,830
he had unprotected sex with
there are to completion

689
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,680
because she told him it's almost
impossible for her to get pregnant.

690
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,260
My friend is an idiot
for falling for that.

691
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:09,530
So instantly he jumped into marrying
this girl it at the age of 19 and dating

692
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:13,140
only three or four weeks.
What the fuck?

693
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,340
She went to the doctor and they told her
she had been pregnant almost two weeks

694
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:20,130
prior to him busting insider and how she

695
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,560
and how she acted. She knew this.
I don't know how she was acting.

696
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,540
She knew this the whole time.
Also,

697
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:30,700
the boyfriend before my friend posted
inside our many times don't if it

698
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,840
obviously,
so lo and behold,

699
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,830
this slot runs to her
ex because he's the dad.

700
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,880
So she got the drama. She want
it now. Well that's good then.

701
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,900
So this kid is not getting stuck with
the kid. Now, several months later,

702
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:49,320
my friend is back to talking to this
girl and this is where I'm pissed off

703
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:52,950
beyond belief. He still somehow
likes this girl that played him,

704
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,580
acted like a complete bitch while dating
him and cheated on him while dating.

705
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,780
He thinks the kid might be his
and also said if it is his,

706
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,860
he would get back together with her.
So the advice I'm asking is,

707
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,060
so the advice to you guys, come on
man, do a little a proofread here.

708
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,860
So the,

709
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,420
the advice I'm asking for is how do I
tell my friend to quit talking to this

710
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:20,870
pathetic human being and quit being and
Douche about thinking about that baby

711
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:22,460
might be his one.
Obviously it's not,

712
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:25,610
and move on with his life because that
girl will never be happy and never

713
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:26,510
stopped being a cunt.

714
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,720
I've tried to tell him to not talk to
her and if she wants a paternity test,

715
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,490
uh, when it's born to take care
of the whole thing. But Bob,

716
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:36,430
I don't even need to read the
rest of this. Thanks. Just to bar.

717
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:38,630
I really appreciate your vice and how
to get him to stop being a Douche.

718
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,830
You can't help him. You
can't help this kid. I mean,

719
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,770
these aren't little drama moments.

720
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:49,910
This is the biggest drama
you could possibly have at
19 when it comes to dating.

721
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,560
All right? And um, you would think that
after he went through the, Oh my God,

722
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:57,260
she's pregnant and then found
out it was somebody else's,

723
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,860
that he wouldn't keep coming back.
This dude has major fucking problems.

724
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,580
He needs to go see a therapist.
It's not on you. All right,

725
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,380
it's not on you.
What are you going to do?

726
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,900
You're going to jump in the car with them
and try and grab the wheel from him as

727
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:15,080
he pulls back and takes you over
the cliff with him. Fuck it.

728
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,770
It's not your problem. It's the good
fellas moment. He's content to be a jerk.

729
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,250
Let them be a jerk. It's
out of your hands. You know?

730
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,890
And if you don't want to look at it,
I would just stop hanging out with them.

731
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,940
What do you, what are you supposed
to do? What are you spot everybody,

732
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:32,880
you know something,
I hate to say this for the most part,

733
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,710
everybody has one guy
like that and their crew,

734
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:39,570
there's always one guy who going to marry
the whore and find out 15 years later

735
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:41,970
that it's not his kid.
And you know,

736
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,840
and there's going to be one person in
your crew that's going to try and tell

737
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:49,080
them that and the kid's going to
flip out and not talk to him at all.

738
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,280
And that 15 years later they'll run into
each other in a bar and be like, hey,

739
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:55,560
you will kinda, you kinda right. So

740
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,480
what do you got dope.

741
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,100
I mean, what the fuck more does
this kid need? He's an idiot.

742
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,560
That kid is an idiot, you know,
so he might as well Marian idiot.

743
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:13,120
Cause that cancels both of them out and
it saves a decent human being on both

744
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:15,040
sides,
you know?

745
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,583
Okay.

746
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,080
I,
I don't know what to tell you.

747
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,640
He's just psyched if anybody will
fuck him regardless of the situation.

748
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,110
And she's a horse so she knows she, you
know, she's fucking his brains out. So

749
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,310
yeah,

750
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,410
I really don't have anything funny
to say about that. That's just,

751
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,420
that's fucking awful.

752
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,450
It's got to suck for you because
that's your friend. But a,

753
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:41,250
you know,
you're going to lose some friends in life.

754
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,510
I got to tell you, there's, there's,

755
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,790
there's a number of different
ways you lose friends in life. Uh,

756
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,570
you know,
the awful ways they die or a,

757
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,360
you fuck around with their women or
they fuck around with your women.

758
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:03,510
Uh, there's the, you're dating someone
who's doing shit like this person.

759
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,420
And then there's the
other ones where you know,

760
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,270
you start doing well in
life and they're not,

761
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:11,490
and then they resent you
or the other way around.

762
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,800
Maybe you're the resentful concept,

763
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,190
but you're gonna lose some friends.

764
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,080
So you lost one cause you're not going
to be able to hang out with this kid

765
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:24,080
anymore. Um, I dunno.

766
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,720
Just, I don't know what to tell you, dude.

767
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,760
You fuck where the fuck is his dad?
Where's his mom?

768
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:36,710
Where are the people like
advising this kid? Jesus Christ.

769
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,850
I would fucking lock that kid up in the,
in the room room above the garage,

770
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,810
like a heroin addict and I just keep
giving them chicken noodle soup until he

771
00:46:44,811 --> 00:46:48,890
got over this fucking chick. Um, I dunno.

772
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,640
Jesus. I hope this one's
fucking upbeat. Shitty uncle.

773
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,580
I'm shitty uncle. Hey belt. I'm a lady
listener. And before I jump into it here,

774
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:02,350
I just want to say that
as a female listener,

775
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:05,170
I don't have a problem with any
of your women trashing. Hey,

776
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:07,750
nice to see someone has a sense of humor.
Uh,

777
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:10,780
I think the only women that get offended
or insulted by what you talk about are

778
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:14,890
the ones who can relate to or feel they
reflect in some way what you're talking

779
00:47:14,891 --> 00:47:18,820
about. Ah, sometimes. And then sometimes
I am a moron, but I appreciate you, uh,

780
00:47:18,821 --> 00:47:21,160
actually seeing that. Um, anyways,

781
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:25,450
maybe you're talking about
the gold digging whores or
just overall annoyance of

782
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:27,370
women.
Clearly that's not all women,

783
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,660
but ones who send you shitty feel like
you're speaking of them because they are

784
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:35,560
like that. Fuck them. Fuck them. I think
it's hilarious. Absolutely ridiculous.

785
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,380
When one listener out a thousand takes
one thing you talk about and tries to

786
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,050
make it personal. What a
bunch of cons. You know what,

787
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:46,030
this weekend when I did my
show and I closed with my
gold digging whores bit, uh,

788
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,800
I was selling DVDs afterwards,
you know, whoring myself out,

789
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:55,690
showing a little bit of leg as I
do. And um, this couple came up in,

790
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:59,820
the woman paid in, some other woman
yelled, yelled as she walked by. Yeah.

791
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:02,980
You saw who just pay,
you saw just paid.

792
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,000
And I used to take the bait
on that and I just laughed.

793
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,710
I just laughed and it warms my heart
knowing that I annoyed the shit out of her

794
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,990
with my closing. 10 minute gold digging
whore bit. Um, so anyways, here we go.

795
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,360
So here's the family problem.
I appreciate your perspective on,

796
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,100
I've got this absolute absolute asshole.
Have an uncle,

797
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,420
he's a recovered alcoholic who's
landed him self, a wife with money.

798
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,860
Jesus, the guy's been a con
man since I can remember.

799
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,620
It's just that now he's a sober con man.
Yeah,

800
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,370
I really don't like addicts generally
speaking, generally speaking,

801
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:43,090
that some of the most
selfish motherfuckers on the
planet and they do some of

802
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:47,380
the most inconsiderate shit
that you could possibly do.

803
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:49,470
And anytime you call them on it,
they always say science.

804
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,130
She's got a lot of shit
coming out now and they just,

805
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:55,740
a lot of stuff is coming up. Uh, I dunno,

806
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,160
I probably get some fucking
letters on that. Emails.

807
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,430
No one writes letters anymore. So anyways,
uh, he's always been a fucking annoying,

808
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,170
fucking annoying, an arrogant. But
recently he fucked my parents for money.

809
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,560
My parents felt heartbroken
and betrayed over this.

810
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:15,130
I've always hated him and hate him even
more now that he made my mother cry.

811
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:18,550
It made my father angry in order
to stay in my father's good graces.

812
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:23,551
He threw my mother and I under the bus
in an email to my dad one day saying

813
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:24,970
everything was our fault.

814
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,900
I was glad when my father finally told
them off and it said not to contact me or

815
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:31,060
my mother again. Well, here's my question.

816
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:33,940
How the fuck did you know that
he was a piece of shit con man,

817
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,170
before they did a few weeks ago,
I had to go to my grandfather's birthday.

818
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,620
My mom and dad couldn't make it,
so my boyfriend and I went alone.

819
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,280
I didn't acknowledge my uncle when I
said hi to everyone and kept my distance

820
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,091
throughout the day.

821
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:50,020
He kept interrupting any conversation I
was having with other relatives to make

822
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:54,580
an obnoxious joke about me or Philly.
I live in Philly and love it.

823
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,080
My uncle is from Philly, but lives in New
York and now is all about it. Yankees,

824
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,530
cheesecake and all, uh, he
trashes Philly all the time,

825
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:05,530
which pisses me off because
he knows I like it there.

826
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,160
He even went up to my boyfriend who
was wearing an eagle's hat and started

827
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:12,700
talking shit to him. Um, she goes, yeah,

828
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:14,800
I know that might be justified there.
Um,

829
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,050
everything he did was
rude and disrespectful.

830
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:20,800
He never said hello or asked
about my mom and dad when I left.

831
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:24,760
I was angry for days and he didn't
say anything to him or call him out.

832
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,100
So my question to you, bill it, should

833
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,240
I say something to my shitty uncle next
time he's always been a loud mouth son

834
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:36,020
of a bitch, but, uh, now it's a personal,

835
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,230
but now it's personal and fucking
rude that he continues to do it.

836
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,750
When he knows I know all this shit,

837
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,780
sometimes they think he still looks at
me as this little girl, Nice Blah, blah.

838
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,000
I don't need to read any more of this.

839
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:49,700
What do you think any words of
wisdom would help love the podcast?

840
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:51,350
Thanks in advance?
Well,

841
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:56,330
what you should have said was you should
have announced to the entire Party.

842
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:02,380
My uncle is being rude to me because
he fucked my parents out of money.

843
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,270
Just something, just throw his fucking
throw his dirty laundry right out there.

844
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,230
Just say,
why are you being rude to me?

845
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,970
Why you deliberately being rude to me
right now? I don't know. Just weird.

846
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:21,260
You can't like call him like a
piece of shit. Um, I don't know.

847
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:23,870
But he won because he made you
angry and he ruined your day.

848
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,110
Why don't you just be condescending to
them where every time he talks to me like,

849
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,510
aw, you're adorable. Hey, who'd
you fuck over today? You know,

850
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:36,050
I heard they have an old folks home down
the street. They like playing checkers.

851
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,370
Maybe you can play some checkers,

852
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:41,450
a tinny little tiddlywinks with them
and steal their money. You know,

853
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,400
just do shit like that.

854
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:49,100
A good joke from the alcoholic over here.
Everybody.

855
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:54,320
I would just do stuff like that. Just
throw his shit right in his face. No,

856
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:58,250
you know what you do is you say all his
shippy just be really nice. Oh my God,

857
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:02,660
my uncle,
my favorite relative who's an alcoholic.

858
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,300
I got to tell you people,

859
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,630
out of all the people who have
stolen money from my parents,

860
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:12,560
this guy here is my favorite.
Just do shit like that.

861
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,790
You just keep complimenting and as you're
calling them an absolute piece of shit

862
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,440
who can't handle their booze.
I still love you. Anyways,

863
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,820
I just started drinking a beer right
in front of them. Ah, God damn it.

864
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:31,710
Is that delicious? Hey, you want one?
C'Mon. You know you do. Oh, that's right.

865
00:52:31,711 --> 00:52:36,060
You can't handle it. Who's little
baby? Then you just pinch his fat.

866
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:40,440
Fucking booze cheeks. Just I,
I would do too. Shit like that.

867
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:41,670
Just annoy him back.

868
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:45,720
But don't sit there in silence and let
this guy fucking do that to you. You know,

869
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,910
fucking these levels too.
God Damn Low. Too Low.

870
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,730
Hello? Hello. You know I,

871
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,920
I rented that movie to kill a mockingbird.

872
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,910
I finally watched that movie and I gotta
be honest with you. I don't get it.

873
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,500
I don't get that movie.

874
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:10,990
Who's supposed to be the mockingbird
in that? Cause the way I look at it,

875
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:14,620
they killed the mockingbird,
you know,

876
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:20,350
but then in the end they act like a Robert
Duvall character is the mockingbird.

877
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:23,770
He might be another one, but wasn't
the guy who was on trial a mockingbird.

878
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:27,390
How come they didn't give a
fuck about and I don't buy that.

879
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:29,640
He just ran away and then they shot him.

880
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,750
I think that that was that racist shit
where they just decided that they were

881
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,720
going to kill him. So then they
just made up that he ran away.

882
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,650
So this is what I like to do,
people to close out the podcast.

883
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:45,030
I like to bring up a movie that came out,
oh 60 70 fucking years ago.

884
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,710
And uh,

885
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:52,980
talk about it like it came out like
fucking six months ago. Oh Jesus.

886
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,120
I'm sorry. Let's, let's, let's,
let's finish up here with,

That's it. That's a podcast for this
week. Everybody. How about those Celtics?

910
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,590
You know, I actually tried to
watch a red sox game yesterday.

911
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:33,000
I watched a, I don't even know
anybody on the team anymore. You know,

912
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:36,150
I finally saw what that Gonzales guy look
like. There'll be got from the Padres.

913
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:40,950
I haven't watched in, um, I

914
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,180
Whose June of something,
oh nine or 2010.

915
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,770

know what? Fuck this. I can't
watch this shit anymore,

916
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:51,420
Bob.
Bob.

917
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,790
I just root for them to lose cause
I want Bobby Valentine to get fired.

918
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,240
Although I do think it's funny that he
tipped his cap when everyone was born.

919
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:03,760
Them. I do think that that's
funny, but I hate when people, um,

920
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:09,140
just cause controversy and just make
shit about themselves when they haven't

921
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:13,520
accomplished anything. Then I
just described my podcast. Um,

922
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,450
all right. Maybe on the Bobby Valentine
of podcasting. I think you are.

923
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:22,860
I think you are that fucking annoying.
Uh, that's the podcast for this week.

924
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:23,950
Everybody.
Uh,

925
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,930
where am I going to be coming up?
Why don't,

926
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:30,040
why don't I go to bill bird.com and
we'll see what's, uh, what the deal is.

927
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,720
Hey, can anybody tell me why dog
sleeps so fucking much? They'll put it,

928
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,190
they won't,

929
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,490
they'll put in eight hours and then you
take them around the block and then they

930
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:43,480
sleep for like another four hours and
they get all antsy around noontime.

931
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:46,390
You take them out again and then they
just plopped down and then they have one

932
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:49,660
more burst of energy and then they're
ready to sleep for another eight hours.

933
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:51,461
Isn't that what,

934
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:54,220
like all wild animals do like
don't like lines for the most part.

935
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:55,690
Just laying around all day,

936
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,173
you know,

937
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,100
and I guess he got to go kill something
and they go and they kill something.

938
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,570
They fucking gorge themselves and they
just lay around in the sun for like the

939
00:57:05,571 --> 00:57:07,040
next three Aa sleeping.
Isn't that what they do?

940
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,620
You know somebody down the street.

941
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:13,100
I have to whisper because somebody
down the street, they, uh,

942
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:17,410
they bought two giant lions,
um,

943
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,560
to have outside the house.
You know, like the fake lions.

944
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,970
It basically, it just screams
new money. You know what I mean?

945
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:28,040
That's like one of the,
one of the first things you do,

946
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,870
like the avid shithead who hits the
lottery, you know what they're gonna do,

947
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:38,100
right? They're going to get a limo, go
boobs, and they're going to buy a car,

948
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:41,160
maybe pay off one bill.
Right?

949
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,160
And then the very next thing they're
gonna do is they're going to buy two giant

950
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:48,840
fucking lions to stand guard at the
end of the driveway of their fucking

951
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,880
apartment building.
I don't know why people do that,

952
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:54,930
but these ones were actually decent.
They were actually decent looking. Um,

953
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:59,160
all right, here's the
upcoming events. I have a,

954
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:03,750
my next row gig isn't until June
15th. He fucking serious. Juge Oh,

955
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,170
I guess I'll be in La,
building up my act, uh,

956
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:11,220
the San Jose Improv on
June 15th and June 16th.

957
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,370
And on the 17th, it says San Jose
Improv, but we got to fix that.

958
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:19,230
I'm actually going to be at the, uh,
Chicago theater with Steve Byrne,

959
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:21,510
Vince Vaughn and all these other guys.

960
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,770
I don't know who else
is going to be there,

961
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:27,000
but that's enough of a show right there,
isn't it? June 17th the Chicago theater.

962
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,570
Um,
oh and June 15th and 16th,

963
00:58:30,571 --> 00:58:35,130
I'll also be performing with a
Chelsea Peretti Sacramento zone.

964
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,750
Chelsea Peretti. So, you know,
she's psyched to get up there.

965
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:40,950
That's why she's doing the Gig.
You know,

966
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:44,580
she wants to drive and go see
family up in northern California.

967
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,690
Um, Ontario Improv. I played June 29th,

968
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:53,691
30th and July 1st Hampton beach
ballroom casino going white trash here,

969
00:58:55,261 --> 00:58:56,910
people July 14th.

970
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,080
Then I go to the new Newport yachting
center July 15th and I know what you're

971
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,830
thinking there. Oh, is that the
Illuminati comedy club? No, it is not.

972
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,100
It's a parking lot with a tent over it.
And I'll be performing.

973
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:10,260
There was some sort of
makeshift air conditioner,

974
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,230
pathetically trying to blow
cold air on my giant forehead.

975
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:18,150
And then my triumphant retort
returned to New York City, July 26th,

976
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:22,370
27th,
28th and 29th at on Broadway

977
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,200
in New York,
New York.

978
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,090
Then we're into September and football
season and I'm going to be doing cities

979
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:33,650
that I have never done before.
Like Orlando Eight, ninth,
seventh, eighth and ninth.

980
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:37,400
Look at that. Orlando,
Florida. Um, that's it.

981
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:40,720
That's the podcast for this
week. Go fuck yourselves. Um,

982
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,700
thank you to everybody who's been
listening. The podcast has been growing.

983
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,990
Thanks everybody has been going on to
amazon.com game, fly.com and stamps,

984
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,320
stamps.com uh,
appreciate it.

985
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,780
I don't know when I'll ever see
any money from any of these things.

986
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,880
It's amazing how this advertising works.

987
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:58,310
You know the advertise and then
like nine months later they,

988
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,250
they finally send you a check,
you know.

989
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:06,251
Thank you for your wonderful work
hyping the new palm pilot back in 2001.

990
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,260
Um, all right. That's it.
Is there anything that they,

991
01:00:10,261 --> 01:00:14,600
any shit I wanted to talk
about any sports? Um,

992
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:19,640
hey bill, who do you like for
the fucking Nba Championship?

993
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:23,720
Anybody but the Lakers?
Anybody but the Lakers,

994
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:29,450
uh, who do I like for the Stanley Cup? Um,

995
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,770
I like a lot of the teams. I like a lot
of teams that are playing each other.

996
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:39,530
Like I like, uh, I sort of like
the capital's, I liked the rangers.

997
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:41,990
I like the flyers.
I don't like the devils.

998
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,970
I'll never get over that boring style
of play that got them three Stanley cups

999
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:51,971
that left wing Loc trap defense during
the clutch and grab error made me almost

1000
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,240
abandoned the game.

1001
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:58,040
And for some reason I blame them when I
know people played that for years. Um,

1002
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,150
so I can't get into them. Um, although I
do think it's funny that they went, oh,

1003
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:04,790
Stanley cups right across the
river from fucking New York.

1004
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:08,090
That does make me laugh. So in a
pinch, if I had to vote, vote, vote,

1005
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,960
vote for either, uh, that was
vote or in route at the same time,

1006
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:15,740
if I had to vote for a
Jersey or the rangers,

1007
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:20,960
that's a tough one range.
Is it just such a legendary club,

1008
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:25,550
even though they haven't, they've won
won Stanley Cup and 72 fucking years. Uh,

1009
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,520
I still like him though.

1010
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,600
I like the fly is I'd like to see the St
Louis Blues and I would say I'd like to

1011
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:38,870
see the La Kings if they're fucking fans,
weren't also Laker fans.

1012
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,970
You know, I just, I don't
know. I'm so fucking sick, you
know, you know, depressing.

1013
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:45,800
It was to go back to
Boston and run into the,

1014
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,580
the fucking morons that I did for
the most part am I met nice people,

1015
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,750
but just a couple of those.

1016
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:53,810
It was just so fucking depressing because
I loved going back to Boston because

1017
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,550
as far as a sports fan,
I've been,

1018
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,640
I've been behind enemy lines since when
I left in 1995 I went to New York City

1019
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,180
and I live in La. So I haven't had
to deal with Yankee fans, jets, fans,

1020
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:09,150
and now Laker fans. And I just want
to go to a place where can I can,

1021
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:14,160
I can express affection for my teams and
not have to immediately get into some

1022
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:16,540
sort of fucking debate.
And then I go back there and then it's,

1023
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,080
it's just that Shit,
you know?

1024
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,330
And I know now that I admitted that
those things happened in Boston.

1025
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:26,310
Now I'm going to get a bunch of holier
than thou fucking emails from people,

1026
01:02:26,311 --> 01:02:29,700
but you have to understand that I've
traveled for 20 years as a comedian,

1027
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:33,390
and I've done the third
show Saturday night and a,

1028
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:36,330
and I've talked to those people.
So I bring it,

1029
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,100
do you want to fucking talk down to me?
Why am I defending box? I can't defend it.

1030
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,210
I can't defend it, but you know, I dunno.

1031
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,380
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.
All right, that's the podcasts.

1032
01:02:47,381 --> 01:02:49,320
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'll talk to you next week.
