1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,183
Hm.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,190
Hey,
what's going on as bill burn?

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,840
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,340
March 27th, 2000. And uh,

5
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:14,360
was it 17,
2070 fucking decades flying by,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,120
you know what? I'm the 2011, 1213.

7
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,750
Can somebody tell me that 14 was cool?

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,650
Vaguely remember 15 and
then 16. I, you know,

9
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,200
I want to thank everyone who
whined so much about it last year,

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,600
the worst year ever. I mean, that
one's pretty vivid. Lots of crying,

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,551
lots of crying.

12
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,760
And I don't mean for the right reasons
like David Bowie and prince passing,

13
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,880
but you know, you know Hillary losing in
that type of shit. A Lot, lot of crying,

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,700
a lot of whining. Um, anyways, I,

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,310
uh, I don't even know what the
fuck to tell you. I've been a,

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,240
there'd been fucking daddy daycare here.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,820
You know what I did for the first time
we finally went out, right? Me and me,

18
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:01,320
we're going fucking crazy because you
have a baby. You have a little baby. Yeah,

19
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:05,230
but little lady, this is the
thing, if it's your first kid,

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,430
you fucking scared to death. You're
like, I can't take this thing outside.

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,630
It's going to get a bowler.
You can all fucking nervous,

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,513
you know,

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,270
and that has got to get his fucking immune
is there's Asians at all of that type

24
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:21,240
of shit. And he just let go and you
go, who do I fucking believe here?

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,300
Jesus Christ. I'll tell you those
fucking shots. This is what I actually,

26
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,680
I just sat down.
I was like,

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,070
nobody who's ever been in the
medical field told me not to do it.

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,030
I've had comedians,
high school friends,

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,870
a fucking actresses are a bunch
of non doctors have advised to go,

30
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,650
what am I not going to get her
fucking vaccinated for polio? No,

31
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:51,600
it's not that what it is it fish. Shut
the fuck. Do you even own a lab coat?

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,060
All you're doing is scaring
the shit out of me. So anyways,

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,440
um, so we were, you know, you
fucking afraid. So finally
we're just like, all right,

34
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:05,010
fuck this. We got a Stroller, you know.

35
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,260
So we started taking
walks around the block,

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,270
but my block has like the shittiest
sidewalk. It's like, uh, you know,

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,320
the grounds all shifted out here.
There's tree roots pushing it up.

38
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:19,490
You have no idea when you just
walk down the street, you know,

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,160
you start pushing the stroller and you're
trying to keep the kid quiet. You know,

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,790
cause she finally fell asleep. It's
like a push on my daughter up to street.

41
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,790
It's like fucking like liquid nitrogen.
I'm just trying to keep her,

42
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,670
I don't want to say I'm gonna start
crying in the middle of the street,

43
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,660
just going down the street,
waking everybody up and I
guess you're already awake.

44
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,590
I don't know. So, um, we finally
ended up going to the mall.

45
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,600
I had that experience.

46
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,340
I went to the mall with
my wife and my kid.

47
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,260
We pulled in, had to take out his
stroller, take her out of the car seat,

48
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:56,340
put her in and start walking around
the mall. And I got to tell you,

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,210
it was fucking awesome. I, for the
first time in my life, I get the mall,

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,300
I get it. You know, it's fucked.

51
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,920
Teenage kids when they're trying to
get away from their parents, like, mom,

52
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,630
just leave me alone.
What everyone friends,

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,530
that era before you have a license
really and you can't really go anywhere.

54
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,450
You just need some sense
of fucking freedom.

55
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,090
And it's for after you become a parent,

56
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,360
you have to get out of the fucking
house and do some sort of controlled

57
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:25,630
environment where there's enough God
damn people that you don't have to worry

58
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,380
about anybody snatching your
God Damn Kid, you know? Um,

59
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,690
so we walked around and uh,
just had a great fucking time.

60
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,890
It was like the perfect day and uh,
you know,

61
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,790
neo was all excited to be out because uh,
you know,

62
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,550
women just have Jesus the shit they
go through being being the guy.

63
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,100
It's the best. I swear to
God, it's why they fucking,

64
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,840
I think it's why they make our lives so
god damn miserable is they see how easy

65
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,141
it is.

66
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,020
And the thing is is we don't realize how
easy it is because we've only been us,

67
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,340
you know what I mean?
How long it takes them to get ready.

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,100
Do you know how long it takes me to get
ready now I've got to fucking shaved

69
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,870
head. I mean, I don't
even have to do anything.

70
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,750
You can literally hose me off in the
backyard and I, I could, you know,

71
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,800
I'd be ready in like seven
minutes, easy, seven minutes.

72
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:19,650
Cause I always got to run around and
find my cell phone for like five of those

73
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:23,250
minutes. But you know, if I, if I actually
was organized and newer, all my shit was,

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,660
I could be, I could be writing
like three minutes. Um,

75
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,570
anyways. Yeah, they got through all
of that shit. You know what I mean?

76
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,860
You got to breastfeed, they gotta, they
gotta they gotta pump all of that crap.

77
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,630
I don't have to do any of that.
You know what I mean?

78
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:41,010
So she was going fucking
nuts dealing with, um,

79
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,440
everything that nature put on her.

80
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:46,260
And she finally had to get out of the
house and now it's the happiest I've seen

81
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:48,900
her. We walked around and
had a great time. You know
what they have at malls now?

82
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:52,170
This is second mall I've been
to that they have like a Tesla.

83
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,480
Yeah.

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,170
Um, store like you can go and like who
the fuck just goes to the mall and buys a

85
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,004
car?

86
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,300
Okay.

87
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,510
You know what I mean? You got eat, buy
sunglasses, right. A fucking Hula Hoop,

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,890
whatever, whatever it is. You buy it. Buy
a car. So I, you know, I can't resist.

89
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,950
I got to go in there, right. And I'm
like, what's the deal with this thing?

90
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:12,890
Zero to 62.5 the guys
like 2.3 that's amazing.

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,540
I was up in San Jose,

92
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:18,590
the guy told me 2.5 he shaved off in
another two hundredths of a second

93
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,990
and I'm like, all right. So I get
four adults in there and he goes,

94
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:28,991
you can get five and I go and I'm still
going to go zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds.

95
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:31,700
Does make any sense. All that,
wait, what am I up to there?

96
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,150
Okay,

97
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,960
well 2.93 and he goes probably to six.
It's like,

98
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,330
what are you basing that on other
than the fact that you want to make a

99
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,164
commission?

100
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,130
What am I basing mine on? I don't
fucking know. So he goes, all right,

101
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:49,770
let's take a look at to Sylvia. I go,
dude, I just bought a car. I love it.

102
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,330
I'm not going to buy a car.
I'm gonna tell you right now.

103
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:52,870
But I just wanted to see,
you know,

104
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:56,220
if I got the car that I want and what
this thing's going to cost me, right?

105
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,370
So I go, I go, give me the one with
the motor. The all wheel drive.

106
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,850
All right.
I went black.

107
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,060
I didn't want to get the black interior
cause it's hot as shit out here, right?

108
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,480
So the guy goes, do you want the fucking,
the full moon roof and everything? I go,

109
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:15,010
dude, look at me. I'm almost an albino
and I have a shaved head, Dee Dee fucking.

110
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,860
And it goes down all the tents.
Crazy on it. I said, all right,

111
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:21,130
put it on the fucking car. What do I
care? I'm not buying this thing right.

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,810
Give me the best you know, best tires.
Best Rems, best, best fucking everything.

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,170
Then they had this thing over you in for
five grand. When you get on the highway,

114
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:32,800
it kind of drives. It kind of
helps you. And I was like, dude,

115
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,830
why would I buy a car like this and have
something else dry? I want to drive it.

116
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:36,940
I don't need that shit.
Right.

117
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:40,990
So that I didn't get everything else I
got in in the end, I took a picture of it.

118
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,190
I forget how much it costs. Ah Fuck. I
don't need the exact number in the end.

119
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:48,790
You know where to cost $152,000

120
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:53,880
okay.

121
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,310
Oh fuck.
And what kills me.

122
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:59,400
Someone's going to go to the mall and
buy one of those hundred 52,000 fucking

123
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:03,180
dollars.
I just wish they looked cooler.

124
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,290
I love the fucking tires and
everything and there's, you know,

125
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,050
if you get the right tires and rims
and shit really helped that car and the

126
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:13,680
front end definitely looks
better. I Dunno man. You don't,

127
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:15,650
it looks like it looks like
that four door Porsche.

128
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,130
That's ugly as shit at Panamera whatever
that you know, you don't think of that.

129
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:23,850
We started to do that and like the uh,
the car commercials will,

130
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,710
they have a two door car.
They have the dad,

131
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,250
then he has a baby and then he grabs the
bumper and he turns it into a four door

132
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:33,900
car. Like, Oh wow, this is like a
sports car, but it's a four door sedan.

133
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,660
No it isn't.
It's a four door sedan and it won.

134
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,300
But that's trying to be a sports
car and then it becomes ugly.

135
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,110
That's why I liked the Mercedes to BMW
in the jet and the Jaguars because they

136
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,180
still look like cars, like
four door sedan. Then you
step on the gas. It's like,

137
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:53,030
Oh shit, look at this. Who Knew I
even aren't talking about here? Um,

138
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,140
anyway, so we ended up having a, a a
great time and uh, I walked by the, um,

139
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,050
the fucking, what store is that thing?
Whatever. Whoever the one that looks,

140
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:08,220
it looks like the letter h,
it's not Nike or Adidas,

141
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,010
it's the other one is the one
that fucking Steph curry has.

142
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,460
And in the window there these
ugly ass basketball shoes.

143
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,530
And I looked in and said curry threes

144
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,890
dude, gun to your head.
What do you like better?

145
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:27,870
That the Colby eleven's or the
curry threes? I don't know dude.

146
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,190
The curry threes,

147
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,320
you know with a fucking Chris
pair of jeans and a Hoodie

148
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,030
over which it chain on the outside

149
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,900
male fashion. Niesters do Jordan threes.

150
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,230
All right. Jordan trees. Okay.

151
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,820
With the pair of Joe's
jeans. All right. And,

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and a button down in a new Yankee doodle
new Yankee had two and a slice of pizza

153
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,430
that does it get any better

154
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,450
playing play station on the TV
at inside Dallas Cowboys Stadium.

155
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,670
Crazy ultimate bachelor party dude.

156
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,850
A pair of fucking Jordan nines
right genes cuffed creased with,

157
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,780
with an Abercrombie and
Fitch v Neck t shirt.

158
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,350
Extra soft.
Okay.

159
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,940
Play play station with a slice of
pizza and a fucking cowboy stadium.

160
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,300
Does it get any better than that?
Dude?

161
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm sorry.
I don't know what it is.

162
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,340
I like sneakers and I've
actually been buying something.

163
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,420
I just like the old ones.

164
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,780
Like I got a pair of shell toes and I
got a pair of early eighties fucking

165
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:57,030
Adidas like high tops.
Like I like that shit.

166
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,250
Like I don't know what the One fucking
Picasso started designing these Goddamn

167
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,500
things. It's like, it
makes no sense. Um, yeah,

168
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm going to get in trouble for this shit.

169
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,820
I'm going to say later on in this podcast,
I,

170
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,460
I didn't know what the fuck to tell you.
I get some shout outs to do.

171
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:14,610
I never give shout outs. Right. And um,

172
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,440
I just had a bunch that would
just piling up and I'm like,

173
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,930
I finally got to give out some
fucking shout outs and then,

174
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,730
but I just never get around to them.
It's extra work. I never give a fuck.

175
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:31,200
But then finally somebody
tipped me over the fucking edge.

176
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,520
Right Laura? I was like,
all right, I got it.

177
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,820
I got to give this person to shout
out. All right. So first of all, let's,

178
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,880
let's get the, let's get the opener
and the feature out of the way.

179
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,040
A shout out to Eric at Bose for
hooking me up with some of those Bose

180
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,480
headphones. I was bitching about, um,
people being loud and, uh, you know,

181
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,330
on the plane. It shouldn't, by the way,
this is not so I can get more free shit.

182
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,200
I don't want any more shit. I'm getting
rid of Shit. If you give me free shit,

183
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,860
I'm going to give it away or I'm going
to send it down to fucking goodwill and

184
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:01,370
it's going to end up in a truck that
sits in a warehouse and they're going to

185
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,210
dump it and then, Oh shit. So I don't
want any shit, you know, a nice email.

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,680
Hey Bill, like you stuff, that's just
fine. Okay. But if somebody did send me,

187
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,280
you got to say thank you. Right. All
right, shout out to Eric at Bose and then,

188
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,970
uh, James Shotwell. Um,

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,070
I did this thing this weekend,
um,

190
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,120
rock against ms where I got to give
an award to a Richard Pryor's widow,

191
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:31,530
Jennifer prior. And, uh, you know,
Richard suffer from that disease.

192
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,500
And of course he turned it into
comedy and set out the disease,

193
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:38,110
actually slowed him down so
he could live longer. Um,

194
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,170
which is really fascinating
that, that's probably true. Um,

195
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,690
and anyways, James Shotwell was
down there doing it, I don't know,

196
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,810
work in like the sound. I've got to
see all these fucking killer bands,

197
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,290
these amalgams like fucking Alison chains
with Nancy Wilson from heart coming

198
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:59,250
out, crushing it. And then she
brought her new a band out,

199
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,990
row case royal and they fucking killed
it too. She's a, she's still a beast.

200
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,350
I got to see Steven Adler
play with an all star band.

201
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,980
He played um, the hell did he
play? He played a, the Ramones.

202
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,630
I want to be sedated and then I got to
stand in like a 10 feet away from him.

203
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:19,620
I got to watch him play.

204
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:23,400
Welcome to the jungle and rocket
Queen and see all these subtle,

205
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:25,390
all these little subtle things that he's,
first of all,

206
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:29,160
I get to see all the genius drum parts
that fits so perfectly to that song.

207
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,900
And then just the different ways that
he played them. Um, you know that part,

208
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,300
you know, so Dona Ana, Ana Blah
Blah Blah, blah blah. It's really,

209
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,600
I always study was on both times.
He's just riding on the floor, Tom.

210
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,970
And on the second scenario
here comes over with the Flam.

211
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,820
That's that little shit when you
read drum nerd like me, I'm like,

212
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,450
that's how we fucking plays it. And I
got to, of course he was cool as shit,

213
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,460
you know, he's such a fucking
great guy. Man. Had, you know,

214
00:12:56,461 --> 00:13:00,540
a couple people were there that had ms
he let him fucking sit like right behind

215
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,790
him while he played.
When he finished playing,

216
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,190
he came out and he high fives to
everybody in the front row do.

217
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:08,980
We were at the La Theater in
downtown La and it was, um,

218
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,870
I guess it was a theater was
designed by Charlie Chaplin.

219
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,310
Okay.

220
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,040
Okay.
And when you walk in in the foyer,

221
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:22,900
there's a picture of Charlie Chaplin
walking in the night at first opened with

222
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,250
Albert Einstein.
And uh,

223
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,080
of course I missed that photo.
Somebody told me it was there,

224
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:33,790
but downstairs they have this kid's room
that's still has the original paint.

225
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,320
So they say don't touch the walls.

226
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,350
And of course it's all these
creepy fucking drawings.

227
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,760
Like being a kid was so fucking scary
back then. All these creepy drawings,

228
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:47,680
a clowns and horses and shit. And
um, someone was trying to claim,

229
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,910
and I refuse to believe that this is true,
that they,

230
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,800
that's where you brought your babies when
they cry. And if they got really loud,

231
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,310
they had these little like cabinets.

232
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:58,000
She just opened the door and you
put the baby in, you close the door.

233
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,930
It's like even downstairs
they could still hear it.

234
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,770
I refuse to believe that that's
true. But, um, I ended up co,

235
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,640
I call hosted it with Craig Gas,

236
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,750
who that Guy Impressions of fucking
unbelievable man is Sam Kinison is Gene

237
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,160
Simmons, Sebastian Bach. And he's
hung out with all of these guys.

238
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:21,940
So he has all these unreal stories
and he does dead on impressions of Jim

239
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,710
Florentine was there. Um, it was
an amazing fucking night. So,

240
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:30,910
um, thank you to a Nancy sale for putting
that whole thing on and I'll do it any

241
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,520
year that they want.
And then lastly,

242
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,600
but leastly um, got it. We got a,

243
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,630
actually I got a request from
somebody who says that she's a fan,

244
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:46,720
a lady fan of the podcast in my standup,
but a,

245
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:51,230
what she requested I
guess is already over. Uh,

246
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,170
she's trying to be,
uh,

247
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,500
in next year to sports
illustrated swimsuit,

248
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,230
Lisa Marie Jafta.

249
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,910
But the voting's already closed so I
dunno, I dunno if it was real or not.

250
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,120
I immediately didn't believe that it was
a real email and then she sent a video

251
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:10,930
gov. No, seriously. I know
you're a bald, middle aged cons,

252
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:12,400
but I actually like just stuff,

253
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,540
if you could send your listeners
over to vote for me, you know,

254
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,320
maybe I could get in the issue next year.
And uh,

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,330
I dunno, that's such a weird world. You
know what I mean? You don't need that.

256
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:29,080
Fuck me up about that world was one
time Nia had me watch this fucking thing

257
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:31,270
about it and they had this creep

258
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,480
that was like the Goto guy and
he called himself uncle Terry.

259
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,090
Anybody who's not your uncle ladies,
anybody who's not your uncle,

260
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,040
he just call me uncle so and so. Yeah,
he's trying to fuck you. He's a fucking,

261
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,220
this guy was one of the creepiest bucket
people I've ever seen in my God damn

262
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,610
life. Um, so anyways,

263
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,750
my apologies. The voting is
already fucking over, but
I don't even know if this,

264
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:04,450
I don't even know if it was real to
be honest with you. But you know what,

265
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,490
I'm a middle aged bald man and I
that's wanting to believe that.

266
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:12,970
That's true. Is it?
That's really all I have.

267
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,100
Okay.

268
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,870
Um, it, speaking of
swimsuit models, oh, lab,

269
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,070
Billy fat tits area has been fucking
doing great on the elliptical. Uh,

270
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,700
back in it, man. Oh, back at it. I fucked
up last night and had a glass of booze.

271
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,670
Oh the booze one last
night I just had a glass,

272
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:37,260
which is probably considered a triple
in any fucking hipster bar. But, um,

273
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,430
I was going to go to bed. I
wasn't going to have it, you know,

274
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:45,990
I've been doing good. I stopped
eating at five and 1130. You know,

275
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,100
Leah had come home, I was hanging out
with my daughter, the whole nightmare.

276
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:53,430
And she was a riot. She was
a right. Jesus Christ dude.

277
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,630
She had two apocalyptic fucking
diapers yesterday. That was just like,

278
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,790
it's just like really, I don't think,
I don't think I, I don't think I,

279
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,860
we bought enough provisions
to ever get this fixed.

280
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,273
Yes.

281
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,980
So, um, she came home late and uh,

282
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,300
and I was just going to go to bed
and I kept playing met mental tenant.

283
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,440
Should they have a glass?
Don't know glass,

284
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,680
try and lose weight should I have a glass,
don't have.

285
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,750
And finally the boots was just
looking like, come on, you don't, not.

286
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:29,810
The votes was like, it was
like Jimmy the gent, you know,

287
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,540
after they fucking did the lift,
one's a heist.

288
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,880
However you say bottle was just
over there and go, come here,

289
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,440
come here Yo. You know,
and Henry comes walking in.

290
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,300
So I had one, so I dunno. Um,

291
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,800
it like one 80, 1.2, and
I've just been in the 80s.

292
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,450
I hate being in the 80. [inaudible]
that's when, that's when I just,

293
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,230
and when I shift my weight around on the
couch just to go reach for the remote,

294
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,770
you just feel the roles going
hall on the side of you. You know,

295
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,940
I don't know how people do it.

296
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:02,250
I don't know how you just walk
around being a fucking fat body.

297
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:05,980
I don't know why you tolerate that.
You got one fucking life and you, you,

298
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,950
you know God damn well
in the back of your head.

299
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:12,710
You don't know where you go after that.
Okay. Let's say best case scenario,

300
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:17,060
you get reincarnated. All right?
Cause the whole heaven hell thing.

301
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,460
It's the same thing every
day. After a while, it's,

302
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,240
it's not even going to have any value
winning. You light me on fire again. Okay.

303
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,330
What does it, another perfect day. Oh boy.

304
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,790
You're going to be like those
teenagers at the mall. Oh God,

305
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:35,140
I'm so bored. Right? Um, best case
scenario, you get reincarnated.

306
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:38,470
The fucking odds that you're going to
come back again as a human being. I mean,

307
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:42,010
you know, if you can come
back as a fucking mouse or
some shit, like, you know,

308
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,720
fucking run around on was having a
heart attack is some reptile is slowly

309
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:51,280
tracking you getting eaten alive.
You know, this is the best she got.

310
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,760
So you can fucking sit here and
become a tub of shit. You know, you,

311
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,890
you all went to yourself.
This is what I've been doing.

312
00:18:56,891 --> 00:19:01,690
This has been the breakfast.
Have a freckled champion.
Um, every morning I wake up,

313
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:04,780
go do to do dude, and I go
out to the garage and, um,

314
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,970
what do I do? I go to, um,

315
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,090
I go in the fucking elliptical as my,
um,

316
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,830
my rotator cuff is slowly getting better.
Today I did some lady pushups.

317
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,690
I was going to do 20. I was like, don't
push it. Stopped at 12, stopped the 12.

318
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:26,140
Just trying to keep the fucking man
tits from sagging down into my navel.

319
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,990
Um,
I do like a half hour on the,

320
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:35,740
uh, on the elliptical and then
it coming in for breakfast.

321
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:40,030
I have one of those little oranges
and I have a, a, a poached egg

322
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,970
and that's it. And then I have bumped
banana between there and lunch.

323
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,770
And then for lunch I have some
sort of protein. Well, you know,

324
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:52,570
maybe with a little bit of bread,
some sort of pen.

325
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:57,340
I know breads the enemy go fuck yourself.
Um, it's the only bread I have. And then

326
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
I don't know what the fuck it is.

327
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:04,210
Then they have a protein with the salad
at four protein with the salad at six

328
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:07,900
and then I'm done. Then I
just drink waters for the
rest of the night in theory,

329
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,210
unless the fucking Jimmy, the gent
moment happens and I get fucked over. Um,

330
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,490
anyways, uh, so I have to do this shit.

331
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:22,120
I gotta get my ass back down. I can't,
my birthday's coming up in June,

332
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,060
I'm going to be 49 fucking years old,
which I'm actually pretty,

333
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,640
I'm all right with it.
Once you have a kid,

334
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,910
you kind of are right with being an
old, you know, like other than that,

335
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:34,220
you're like, man, I'm
47 and I was a kid. Um,

336
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,910
just going to die alone,
um,

337
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,760
going to be 49 and there's no fucking
way I'm going to be in the one eight s

338
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:44,280
it's just not going to happen.
I am, I'm telling you right now,

339
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:48,210
I am going to be one 72 my fighting
weight where the hell I want to be.

340
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,230
My shoulder's going to be healed and a,
I have a bet with Paul Versey.

341
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:55,230
Then when I'm 70 years old, I'm going
to be able to do 10 pull ups and uh,

342
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,560
if I don't get this rotator cuff fixed,
uh,

343
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm going to be fucked because all
I keep thinking about is Jordan,

344
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,040
when he came back on the wizards,
you know,

345
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,450
and that was the first time you really
saw a off in his playing level because

346
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,690
not only was he gone for three years,
he didn't really play.

347
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,280
And when you stop, that's when you're
fucked. That's what I've learned,

348
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,100
trying to get it back. It's, it's,
it's hard. It's really fucking hard.

349
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:24,000
Although,

350
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,300
although d del Rey who crushed it and
San Jose del Rey in San Jose told me he's

351
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:32,430
doing sets of 20 fucking pullups.

352
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,360
I've never done 20 pull ups in my life
straight. I think the most they have,

353
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,800
I was able to do is I just
can't get past like 16.

354
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,090
He's 51 years old. Could do 20 pull
ups, sets a 20. So there's hope.

355
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,360
There's always hope.
Is this like an inspirational podcasts?

356
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,710
Go use the shit on stuff. All right. I
will. Um, but I, and I can't, I can't,

357
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm having, if I'm having,
you know, I've gotten such,

358
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:59,460
it's so little material out of having
a daughter, I thought like, Oh fuck,

359
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:03,060
here we go. My whole act is
going to fucking change, man.

360
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,980
And it's been so awesome. You
know, what am I going to do?

361
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,730
Talk about how great it is and somehow
get you, what I do is I actually,

362
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,000
I pretty much in my act that just shit
on people that talk about how difficult

363
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,330
parenting is. You know what I mean?
I'm not saying, you know, it's not,

364
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,840
I'm not walking around sleepy a shit all
the time, but you know, come on, you know,

365
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,510
go watch that fucking movie.
I tell. Told you to watch.

366
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,060
Will they taught you that
kid that plays the violin?

367
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,520
That guy from peaky blinders is in it.

368
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,430
Anthropoid go watch that fucking thing.

369
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,980
Watch what those people went through and
tell me that being a parent is hard. Um,

370
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,130
anyways, sorry. Plowing
ahead. Oh, what happened?

371
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,380
Where do I start? Do I talk f
One? Do I talk about the Celtics?

372
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,790
Do I talk about the Bruins
playing for their playoff,

373
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,780
fighting for their playoff lives.

374
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,630
Let's talk Bruins then I'll
do a little advertising care.

375
00:22:56,631 --> 00:23:00,140
If the Bruins fucking 84 points.
We lost four fucking games in a row.

376
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,280
We just won one of those goddamn games.
We are now.

377
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,410
We will like all the way up to like,

378
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:11,240
I think a fourth seat at one point or a
fifth seat. We are now an eighth seat.

379
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,650
Toronto is ahead of us.
I heard the goaltender got hurt though.

380
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,663
MMM.

381
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,390
Where the fuck is it?
I had this God damn standing sweater.

382
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,060
I want to like deal with
it anyways. I Dunno. Well,

383
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:31,110
when we had a huge wing,

384
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,670
thank you to Riley Nash for those two
fucking huge goals against the island is

385
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:40,671
we got the prejudice on Tuesday and then
we played this status is a big fucking

386
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,130
Boston Teamweek dude. You're going
to watch bees versus the stats.

387
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,120
So I'm against the predators, dude. Um,

388
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,870
and I'm going to go out on a limb and
say we kind of have to win both of those

389
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:58,590
fucking games or hope everybody
beneath is just keeps losing.

390
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,200
Yeah,

391
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,230
unreal. Unreal. This is the
third year in a row. We're just,

392
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,030
the bottom's fallen out. But you know
what, I slowly see improvement though,

393
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,620
and I can see how this could
be a team that could, uh,

394
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,200
actually score a ton of goals
in the future. You know,

395
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,370
I saw on their website
today, the, you know, the,

396
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,110
the frozen four is happening and uh,
we got like,

397
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,680
we have four prospects in the frozen
four they share. So who knows.

398
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,560
I mean the frozen four versus get nhls
a big fucking leap. But who knows,

399
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,700
who knows? Maybe there's an, there's an
Austin, uh, what the fuck's his name?

400
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:36,460
Matthews in there. Who knows. Um, but
anyways, dude, speaking to that shit,

401
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:38,900
speaking to the frozen four,
what about the final four?

402
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,390
I barely paid attention Mack, cause
I've been running around, you know,

403
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,260
being a dad and everything, but I,
every time I would just like, you see,

404
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,740
you heard me go on Duke lost,

405
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,330
then my Kansas Lost Kentucky,
lost the final fours.

406
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,650
I remember [inaudible] telling me
was North Carolina understandable.

407
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,330
Okay.

408
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,950
South Carolina.

409
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,160
Okay,

410
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,840
good. Zagat and uh, I forget who the
other team is. Basically, there's no,

411
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:10,350
everybody's bracket is fucked at this
point. If you bracket isn't fucked,

412
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:14,700
if there's somebody out there
that actually picked this
year's final four in the

413
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:15,534
NCAA,

414
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,110
you either don't know shit about fucking
basketball and just guessed or your,

415
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,750
your dad's in the mob in something's
going down this year because just

416
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,440
everybody's out of it.
Um,

417
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,440
I dunno who I'm going to vote for.

418
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,730
Zagat South Carolina.

419
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,320
My teams would Duke or Kansas
and I was always like Ucla.

420
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,710
Yeah.

421
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,980
Um, and they all got, UCLA
got fucking knocked out.

422
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,080
You don't annoy me that day I was
walking down the street and you know,

423
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:52,250
cause all the bandwagon fucking Ucla fans
all of a sudden reads rabid out here.

424
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:53,931
You know what?

425
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:56,690
I was wearing a Bruins sweatshirt and
I'm walking down the street and this guy

426
00:25:56,691 --> 00:26:00,080
goes, hey goes, hey, it's Ucla
Bruins, not Boston Bruins.

427
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,980
And I just laughed. I am mad. You guys are
good this year. He's like, yeah, we are.

428
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,560
And walked away. I was
like, well wait a minute.

429
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,210
And that was at the car wash and
I fucking looked it up. Mike,

430
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:15,211
who was the Bruins first and it was like
Ucla basketball team was around before

431
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,570
the Boston Bruins, but their first
year in like 1918 or something,

432
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,870
they were the UCLA cubs and then the
next year they switched to the Grizzlies

433
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,990
and in like 1928 they join.

434
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,990
I don't know what's there was the pack
something pack 10 pack 12 I don't know

435
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:37,430
what the fuck it was back then.
PAC eight I have no idea,

436
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,240
but like there was some team from
Montana that was already the grizzlies.

437
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:45,210
In 1928 they switched to the UCLA Bruins.

438
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,160
However,
the Boston Bruins were in 1924 all right,

439
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,450
so all due respect to coach wooden,

440
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,590
all due respect to the UCLA program. I
actually liked the school and everything,

441
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:02,430
but when it comes to that Bruin
Shit, go fuck yourself. All right.

442
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,140
We were there first. Okay,
CIF, stand the fuck down.

443
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,040
It's a different sport. It's
a pro sport. So relaxed,

444
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,030
you know,
you know bad.

445
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,930
I've been replaying that in my head that
I wished that I had that information.

446
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,530
You know, I wish they were in the
final four and I would actually,

447
00:27:20,531 --> 00:27:21,940
I'm such an argumentative con.

448
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,950
I would actually fucking maybe drive
over to Westwood and gets some air quote

449
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:31,720
lunch and just walk around with that
shirt. It's like it'd be like, ah,

450
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,030
1924 you where the car then
you would be crazy. Hey,

451
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,380
know your history, know
your history. You know like,

452
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:41,650
like I'm the fucking the
sports guru like I did.

453
00:27:41,651 --> 00:27:45,870
Just didn't look that shit up cause some
guy was a container. The car wash. Um,

454
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,890

You don't talk like anyone else,

542
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,830
her sleep like anyone else.
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

543
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,140
Because a truly customized mattress
will cost you five to $10,000.

544
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,530
Until now with $10,000
for a fucking mattress.

545
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,360
I just refuse to believe that that's true.

546
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,333
Yeah.

547
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,750
That should come with a lady giving you
a fucking hand job right before sleep.

548
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:49,751
Then go to helix.com helix answer a few
simple questions and they'll run a three

549
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:54,881
d biomechanical model of your body to

Why don't you stretch a little twisted up.

553
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:09,470
Count the fact that they got to sit there
and act like you're in the star wars.

554
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,850
The result, the most comfortable
mattress you've ever slept on.

00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,820
You could also stretch everybody if

00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,990
mattresses. I think you're going to
be good. Go get a massage. You know,

557
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:22,370
drink some fucking water.

00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,630
10 grand for a mattress.

560
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,360
Just have some fucking Asian lady
walk on your back a little bit.

561
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,230
Save some money.

562
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,930
He likes customers report
at 30 30% improvement in
overall sleep quality and it

563
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:39,030
has to be an Asian lady.
Okay? Cause the dainty,

564
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:42,300
you can't get one of those American. We
can't get some white woman, you know,

565
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,450
you can't get any other race.
They're going to be two finless there.

566
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,320
Then that could be old enough to
be in there. You know what I mean?

567
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,060
Yeah.

568
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,000
They get you going to be to God Deb dense.

569
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,190
They can be full of fucking
growth hormones and that
they're going to break it

570
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:58,250
back.
You don't.

571
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:01,500
That is an exclusive de de Asian lady.

572
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,640
I just thought about that.
I've never seen it.

573
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:07,530
Any footage of a white lady
walking on somebody's back.

574
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,410
You just feel like I write
around. Get off. All right.

575
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,880
Your mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% free.

576
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,900
He looks, uh, and for couples that
customize each side of the mattress.

577
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,580
That's why everyone from GQ magazines to
Forbes or talking about he likes slash

578
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,940
headaches, sleep, customizing
both sides of your mattress.

579
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:29,250
I can't tell if that's going to make
your relationship happier or it's the

580
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:33,480
beginning of the end. Oh God, I
don't even like the way he sleeps.

581
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,120
It'll be great.
Then I just want to test out.

582
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:39,210
Would it be like to sleep a different bed
with them but still be in the same bed?

583
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,890
That's why everyone from Gq magazine to
Forbes are all talking about helix sleep.

584
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,020
Alex, uh, you have 100 nights to
try it out and if you don't love it,

585
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:53,160
they'll pick it up for free rouse
and it gave you 100% refund.

586
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:56,160
No questions asked. We don't even
want to know what that stain is.

587
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,200
We're not going to ask you go to hell.

588
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:01,380
He sleep.com/bar and
get $50 off your order.

589
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,020
That's helix sleep.com/bar Heloc,

590
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,860
sleep.com/ [inaudible] all right,
there you go. Just like that.

591
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,730
We're done with the advertising we've
done with the advertising and we're on the

592
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:15,450
other side of the half hours.
We're going to do traffic on the sixes.

593
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,640
Anybody out on the four oh five,

594
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,200
you might want to get yourself a hell
of capture. There's a lot of traffic.

595
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:26,130
Everybody slowing down and watching
somebody change a tire. Um,

596
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,280
anyways, let's talk some
F1 actually, did anybody,

597
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:34,281
did you watch the Australian grampy
grampy Grand Prix down in Melbourne,

598
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,590
Australia?
Uh,

599
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:42,000
it was a great fucking race and it
lived up to the hype that this year the

600
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:46,650
Ferrari's, we're going to be good. I've
only watched this sport for one season,

601
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:47,640
so I don't know shit about it.

602
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:51,960
All I know is last year it was all
about the Mercedes team, Lewis Hamilton,

603
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,220
Nico Rosberg, you know, they had
the whole days of thunder. You know,

604
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:58,470
I'm the guy who's been around
the block on the other fuck.

605
00:36:58,471 --> 00:36:59,990
I'm on the Tom Cruise Guide,

606
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:04,080
somebody fucking Robert
Duvall and everybody else,

607
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:08,580
which is watching last year. And if
those two guys didn't hate each other,

608
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,500
it would have been fucking boring as
shit because basically every race was a

609
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,060
race to the first corner.

610
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,990
Whoever got there first was just driving
through clean air and the cars were so

611
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:21,510
equally matched,
nobody could catch up with somebody.

612
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,800
You basically had to fuck
up or your car died. Um,

613
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,530
so all the exciting racing was for
like for, for you know, fourth, fifth,

614
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:33,430
sixth place or whatever. Three psychos
going after it for the last, you know,

615
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,710
championship point is they say, you know,
back in 10th place that was exciting.

616
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,190
But up front it was just Lewis Hamilton
or Nico Rosberg just doing laps was,

617
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,780
you know,
kind of got a little boring.

618
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,470
So this year they were
talking about how um,

619
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,060
Ferrari was very quiet,
eerily quiet during the off season,

620
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:55,380
working on their deer there,

621
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,130
suspension and the engine and all that
type of shit with the new regulations,

622
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:00,060
whatever the fuck they are,

623
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:03,930
I don't know what they are and that they
were going to make a serious challenge

624
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,580
for, uh, against Mercedes issue.

625
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,090
So the fucking race starts and uh,
the Australian Dude,

626
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:16,000
I already forget his name. Uh, Rico
Rican Berg, I have no fucking idea.

627
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:19,980
And like eventually I'll, I'll, I'll get
these people's names down. Rikki rocket.

628
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,730
I forget. Okay. Everybody wanted
him to win the poor bastard.

629
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,090
He's down there and they'd taken like the,
the,

630
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:30,360
the warmup lap or whatever.
And uh,

631
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,120
not even the warmup lap.
They just going around,

632
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:36,070
getting ready to get into position just
to do the warmup lap and his car gets

633
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:39,610
stuck in sixth gear. We've all been
there, right the side of the highway,

634
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,300
except he's got 100,000
people in a fucking zillion
millions of fans around the

635
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:44,290
world watching this shit.

636
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,640
So they got to push his car and they got
to take out the fucking transmission in

637
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,510
like five minutes,

638
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:52,810
throw a new one in there and try and get
it back in the fucking car before the

639
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,290
race starts. That alone, if they just
showed that, that would have been amazing.

640
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,660
They kind of kept cutting back to it.
I wish they showed more of it.

641
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,310
A long story short, he wasn't able to
get out there until, uh, the second lap.

642
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,420
He was already two laps down.

643
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:08,710
So that kind of sucked for
all the Australian fans and
uh, then his car, his shit,

644
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:13,060
the bed halfway through the race,
however, so the race fucking starts.

645
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,723
All right.

646
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,980
I think Lewis Hamilton had the
pole and then Sebastian fettle um,

647
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,160
for Ferrari was in second place and uh,

648
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,400
Louis had a great start and he was out
front and I go, well I guess that's it.

649
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,410
I guess the Mercedes are going
to win it this year, right.

650
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:34,500
So they get about 20 laps
in and Lewis Hamilton pits,

651
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,241
it's one of these races.

652
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:39,100
It was like 57 laps and the announcers
were saying that they were going to pit

653
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:42,430
one time and it's all when you pit
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

654
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:46,750
So all this shit is becoming fascinated
to me. So Lewis Hamilton goes into Pitt,

655
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,260
right? Sebastian Vettel was,
I don't know how far behind,

656
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,470
couple seconds behind he
decides to stay out there.

657
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,540
So the whole time when Louis
was out there in first place,

658
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:03,490
Sebastian's behind them. All right.
So Lewis has driving in the clean air.

659
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,480
It's like, you know, if you on a
fucking on a lake and you bring,

660
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,800
it's just still water.
You could,

661
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:12,100
you could go way faster and you boat as
opposed to if the water was all fucking

662
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,600
choppy, you got to go slower. That's
the same thing except the two it's with,

663
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,090
with the air.

664
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,360
I'm just saying this for everybody else
out there who's dumb like me and the

665
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:21,730
fact that air is invisible,
you don't understand it.

666
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,870
So no matter what this guy's doing,
Sebastian Vettel,

667
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,500
he can only get so close to,
uh,

668
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,500
to Lewis Hamilton because all
the air coming off of him,

669
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,200
and I guess the tire is a bigger this
year, which causes more turbulence.

670
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,460
It would actually,
it,

671
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:40,870
he's going to use more fuel and chew up
more of his tires if he gets too close

672
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,240
to them, which is really fucking, I dunno,

673
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,310
I don't know if that's
a good or a bad thing.

674
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,090
So Hamilton was having problems
with his tire. He pits early.

675
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,690
So the Ferrari team takes a
gamble and says, fuck this,

676
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:53,980
we're going to stay out there.

677
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,390
So Sebastian now is in first
place driving into clean air.

678
00:40:58,391 --> 00:40:59,620
He's got the nice smooth lake.

679
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:02,830
He's bringing the boat across except it's
a car and it's going to air you still

680
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:05,530
with me. And he stays out
there for one lap and they go,

681
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:09,550
he's definitely going to come in
for the second lap. Meanwhile, um,

682
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,370
Lewis Hamilton came right back out
of the pits and then was, you know,

683
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:15,910
technically in fourth
place, but he's, you know,

684
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,910
but he already pitted the other two
guys in front of them have to pit and so

685
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,860
does the other guest. So technically
it's like he's still in first place,

686
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:23,170
but now he's driving in
dirty air back there.

687
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,320
So Sebastian's flying around the track,

688
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:30,760
he goes around a second time and you know,
the tires are getting chewed up.

689
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,490
He's driving like a fucking maniac and
then the deed comes around a third time

690
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,860
and they're like, he's not going to fees,
not going to fucking stay out there.

691
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,890
He stayed out there again and now
basically it was like this was the most

692
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,870
exciting part of it cause
this is the fucking race.

693
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,400
So basically what he's trying to,

694
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:51,401
he's trying to get out so far ahead
that he has time to pit when he goes in,

695
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,760
get his tires and get back out on
the track in front of fucking, uh,

696
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,430
Lewis Hamilton.
It was like a fucking movie.

697
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,730
He pulls in his fourth time around,
comes in,

698
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,480
they fucking take the tires.
You got to go so fucking slow too.

699
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,040
Now he got to slow down to like,

700
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,810
like you're driving a
Prius when you're in there.

701
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,840
And as he's slowing down this show,
and Lewis has coming around,

702
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:14,780
he's coming around, he's coming
around, he gets the tires,

703
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,780
fucking Sebastian's coming out.
It's like a fucking action movie.

704
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,650
And it was literally, he just
Sebastian, uh, for Ferrari,

705
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,330
just get out in front of Lewis Hamilton.

706
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,020
And then that was the Raci
southern Mercedes guy slammed
his hand down on in the

707
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:32,030
guy in the pits. Right? The
head fucking guy. Right.

708
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,580
The guy who goes to the eyes wide shut
illuminati parties at the end of the

709
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:37,820
fucking race. Right. The department
on some yacht that's like invisible,

710
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,230
like the air that they drive through.
Right.

711
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,670
He fucking slammed his hand down like
medium and then fucking slammed it down a

712
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:46,490
second time. Right. Then I was like,
this guy knows this fucking race is over.

713
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,740
And that was it. Ferrari won
the first race, you know,

714
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:55,970
backing up their lack of shit talk. They
were real quiet in the off season. So, uh,

715
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,960
I was actually really, you know, I
like the way my, I'm one of those guys,

716
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:02,840
I like both, both team
proceedings and Ferrari. I mean,

717
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:05,330
I don't know how you'd get mad at either
one of them. The fucking beautiful,

718
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,420
amazing cars that they've built all
this fucking, uh, over the years.

719
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,830
So I'm just happy that this seems like
there's going to be competition and if it

720
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:17,820
can be as exciting as that,
um, for the whole season, uh,

721
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,230
I think, um, maybe some more you
guys can get into it. Like I did,

722
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,940
I believe the next races in China,
in Indo India,

723
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:31,370
in China. That's going to be the next one.
But I was, I was thrilled with the race.

724
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,090
Uh, I don't know how many Effient
fans listen to this shit. Uh,

725
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,380
I'd love to hear your thoughts
on it. Um, all right. What else?

726
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:43,700
What else the Celtics won. The Celtics
are technically in first place right now,

727
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,460
but we got two games at hands.
We've one more,

728
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:51,080
one more game and lost one more
game then, um, the Cavaliers.

729
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,510
But uh,
I mean I don't,

730
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,720
I don't see them not the capital is
not getting the number one seed less.

731
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:57,554
They get real.
Uh,

732
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,800
I don't know if somebody gets fucking
hurt or some shit like that. All right,

733
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,990
last announcement and then
I'm going to read the, uh,

734
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,770
your fucking emails for the week are and
my youtube channel that I'm slowly but

735
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:13,490
surely building up. All
right. I'm going to, um,

736
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,910
um, gradually just transitioning
to the fucking Internet here.

737
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,640
My whole career is just going to
be on the Internet, the Internet,

738
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:24,230
other than my live dates and f is for
family because everything else is drying

739
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:26,070
up. So my youtube channel, which I'm, I'm,

740
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,660
I'm serious about building
up with content. Um,

741
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,380
I actually hired a, uh,
an animator and, um,

742
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,090
hired a couple of people to start making
videos and putting content up there.

743
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,730
I'm going to be doing tours
of every city that I go to.

744
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,470
Now I'm bringing those things
back. Uh, I'm actually considering,

745
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:52,230
uh, bring it on. This guy that does
drum covers that looks like me,

746
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:57,030
but you know, isn't me, but
maybe it's me. Um, so anyways,

747
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,690
what do we got here on Tuesday?
The first video from Alan Pailin,

748
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,080
pronounce Pailin on the
official podcast channel.

749
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:06,030
Alan Pale and is the
guy who edited together.

750
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:11,130
Remember that one when I
commentated basketball? Um,
he's the guy who did that. So,

751
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,050
um, we're going to have new videos
from him every single week. Um,

752
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,670
my, uh, youtube pages,

753
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,130
youtube.com/user/ it's backslash,

754
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,150
you know,

755
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,870
the one that starts further away and then
comes in towards you like a flare chop.

756
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:33,840
Um, youtube.com backslash user
backslash Monday morning podcast.

757
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,370
Please subscribe to the
channel, check it out, and um,

758
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,270
I'm going to start making some
videos and that type of shit.

759
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,200
I don't know that I'll have a video
tape the podcast because it's just been

760
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,920
laying here right now. I'm wearing a
tee shirt, pajama bottoms and slippers.

761
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,200
How interesting is that going
to be? And I, every time I,

762
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:52,920
whenever I saw a radio shows videotaped,
they just,

763
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:56,910
something happened where it was boring.
I liked the fact that like podcasts,

764
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:59,550
it's just like radio and the fact that
you, you, you're doing shit right now.

765
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:03,210
You're driving home from work, you're
on the fucking elliptical. You know,

766
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:04,440
you're pouring yourself a drink,

767
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:07,980
you cleaning the house whenever you're
doing whatever the fuck it is you do and

768
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:10,120
you can do other shit, right?
All of a sudden it's videotaped.

769
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,870
You feel like you've got to watch
somebody's talking into a microphone.

770
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:17,250
I don't get it. All right, here we
go. Internet privacy. Everybody.

771
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,530
Uh,
hey Billy thought you might like this.

772
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:24,531
A private Internet access provider
took out a full page ad in the New York

773
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:28,740
Times, calling out 50
senators who voted to monitor,

774
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,760
monitor the public's internet
activity for financial gain.

775
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,690
What people care a lot
about their public image.

776
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:41,460
And I think this should be done more
to combat assholes. Let me call,

777
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,910
let me click on this saying I can't click
on it because I'm not on the Internet.

778
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,110
Hang on, let me try and find this here.
I got to see who the contacts are.

779
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,090
Who are the cons that
scientists onto this? All right.

780
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,730
We are the cons. We don't give
a shit. All right. Hello world.

781
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:02,430
These are the 50 senators who monitored,

782
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:06,600
who voted to monitor your internet
activity. Uh, Jesus Christ.

783
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,520
I can't read on the too fucking small.

784
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,150
Okay.

785
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,890
All right. Oh Jesus. Jesus.

786
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,720
What are they all Republicans,
dude,

787
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,900
the way they vote,
man.

788
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,510
Cause it was probably something
else that was pro conservative.

789
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,700
That's the only reason why
the fucking Democrats didn't

790
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,130
so fucking and McCoys.

791
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,750
It's basically there. It's
all republicans. Okay.

792
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,920
Representative from Tennessee,
Alexander Representative from Wyoming.

793
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,060
Brasso blunt from Missouri.

794
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,740
Boozman from Arkansas
burn from North Carolina.

795
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:49,510
You fucking piece of shit

796
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,200
ruining the name.
Kaputo from West Virginia.

797
00:47:55,201 --> 00:47:58,740
Cassie from Louisiana
Cochran from Mississippi.

798
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,300
Collins from Maine.

799
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,380
Corker from Tennessee. You
know what? I'm just going,

800
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:10,170
I'm going to just retweet this fucking
picture. Jesus Christ, Republicans,

801
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:12,450
all Republicans,

802
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:18,440
Cruz from Texas, Crappo from
Idaho, some hell of a names.

803
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,540
Dane's for Montana.

804
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,240
Okay.

805
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,480
Another one from Wyoming,
Nz from Wyoming,

806
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,110
Ernst from Iowa.
This is all of this shit.

807
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,430
All Rubio from Florida,
Perdue from Georgia,

808
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,470
Portman from Ohio. This is all like,
this is all the thing is fake news.

809
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:43,060
It's all fake news. Do you know
it's basically, um, you know,

810
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:47,770
whose kid new news. It's propaganda.
It's bullshit. It's bullshit.

811
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:51,790
But what they want is their bullshit
in your brain. That's what they want.

812
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,450
So what they want to do is gradually take
control of this shit and they're going

813
00:48:55,451 --> 00:49:00,280
to make fake news.
Basically your opinion of what's going on.

814
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:03,160
They're going to make that
like a legal to do. Um,

815
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,460
and they're probably looking over
at China going like, Hey China,

816
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,810
how the fuck did you do this? And China's
going like, Hey, this is how we did it.

817
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,070
So they gradually do that. Much like the
Nazis were looking at us going like, hey,

818
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:17,140
how did you do that shit
to the native Americans?

819
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:20,920
Because we want to do that to the Jews.
Now we're going to do that.

820
00:49:20,921 --> 00:49:25,870
Probably what looking, I bet. I
bet the fucking hire up 1% cons.

821
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,530
The people who make profit off
a war and everybody's misery.

822
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,980
I bet they are envious of the Internet in,

823
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:36,940
in Red China.

824
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,740
The way you know Uri is envious when
somebody drives down the street by in a

825
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:42,640
fucking Ferrari,

826
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,483
you know,

827
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,950
I dunno. All right, well I'm, I'm good
for that person that put that up there.

828
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,143
MMM.

829
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,930
That's fucking disgusting.
I wonder what was linked to it though.

830
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:56,501
You know what I mean?

831
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:59,470
Cause it's never just in defense
of all of those fucking people.

832
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,920
It's never just one thing,
which is another bullshit thing.

833
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,620
You know when they vote for something,

834
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,533
okay,

835
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,030
shouldn't it just be one thing?

836
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:14,400
Should we or show me not vote for
solar power and she just be about that.

837
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:19,050
But then they tag all this other shit
onto it, onto the bill, which is fucking,

838
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,350
that's how they get everything through.
And then it's always like, yeah, you know,

839
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:26,430
something completely fucked up. And then
when that person goes to run for office,

840
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:30,370
you know, they voted for the bill because
they're into solar power. But then the,

841
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:33,220
the, the, the thing that they, the
appendix that they put on to it,

842
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,670
they can be like, this guy
doesn't take kitchen advice. Wait,

843
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,490
he voted against that. It's like, no,

844
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:43,900
I voted for alternative sources
of energy to bankrupt the,

845
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:48,340
uh, the, the terrorists. Terrorists.
All right. Bullying manager,

846
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,490
dear bill,
about a month ago,

847
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:56,410
a lady dairy Queen Manager in Missouri
was charged for involuntary manslaughter.

848
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,560
What?
She gave the guy an ice cream headache.

849
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,550
They'll, she did keep eating
ice cream. Then I'll blow you.

850
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,680
The guy fell for it and he stuck his
hand under the fucking smoothie machine.

851
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,410
The soft serve there.
All right. Allegedly,

852
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:15,370
the dairy queen manager was a
dick to one of its employees,

853
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,950
uh, filled with name, calling
and belittling day after day.

854
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:25,630
Isn't it great to see women getting
like positions of power and just acting

855
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:29,080
exactly is fucking ridiculous
as men, you know, most,

856
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,470
most people cannot handle a
position of power. I mean,
look at me. Look at a power.

857
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:36,550
I have with this podcast.
I don't have the decency to put on pants.

858
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,630
I'm in pajamas and slippers.
I am part of the problem. Um,

859
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,880
one incident reportedly the
manager through a burger
on the floor after he made

860
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:49,690
it incorrectly and then made
the 17 year old clean it up.

861
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,830
The kid was also a victim of
bullying at school as well. Um,

862
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:59,450
none of this is going to justify this
kid harming this. This boss, you,

863
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,570
you quit the job,
uh,

864
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:06,590
but voiced most of the
bullying but foist most.

865
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,630
That doesn't make sense.
But most of the bullying happened,

866
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,970
happened at work.

867
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,870
What happened to this person
who wrote this sentence?

868
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,900
They wrote but voiced most of the
bullying happening at work and singling,

869
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:28,180
singling out his boss and his boss.
Okay,

870
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:31,870
well eventually the kid ended
up shooting himself in the head.

871
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,830
Oh boy. Did not see that
coming. Yes, I know.

872
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:39,670
It's a sad story that that
happens too often. Does it,

873
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,660
do a lot of people get bullied at dairy
queen and then blow their brains out?

874
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,620
I thought that was a happy place.
They got soft serve ice cream.

875
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:48,454
What could go wrong.

876
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,910
But the town wanted to hold
somebody responsible for suicide.

877
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,620
The authorities air quote,

878
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:58,180
investigated and interviewed people and
his stories of being teased and made fun

879
00:52:58,181 --> 00:53:02,710
of where retold the cops ultimately came
to the conclusion that is dairy queen

880
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:07,600
boss was the reason the kid is dead
now by Jesus Christ. Wait a minute.

881
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,900
Hey,
it's a little bit of an overreach.

882
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,010
And she was charged with
secondary involuntary manslaughter

883
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:22,820
after me hearing this story is that
proper English shouldn't be after.

884
00:53:24,031 --> 00:53:28,440
I heard this story after for me,
after hearing this story,

885
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,470
I'm waiting for somebody on TV to
state the obvious. This is bullshit.

886
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,890
How can you blame someone for
another person killing themselves?

887
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,460
It's not my fault.
How other people handled my insults.

888
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,900
You've been called belly fat
tits. How many times? Well,
first of all, I'm not 17.

889
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,540
All right.
Um,

890
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,990
I think enough bullying
can drive somebody to it.

891
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:56,910
It depends on how it is and how
fragile somebody is, but uh,

892
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,800
there's just so many fucking variables
involved. Like what ha the person,

893
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,320
let's say this person was a
bully at dairy Queen Lake.

894
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,270
What happened to them as a kid
that made them the way they are.

895
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,760
How old is this person?
Because, um, for me,

896
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:18,750
I just feel that, I honestly
believe that, you know,

897
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,060
people in their twenties for
the most part, it's just, it's

898
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:30,590
that is the most purest form of the
direct results of the parents that you had

899
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,400
is now you're out in the world. They're
not there to be like, hey, hey, hey, hey,

900
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,080
you know, knock it off. You know,

901
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,680
and you have to make decisions for
yourself and you go around. Like,

902
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:46,330
I know when I was in my twenties, I took,
without realizing it, I was taking my,

903
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,710
everybody takes the childhood out on
people in their twenties because you don't

904
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:52,620
know what the fuck you doing. Uh,
so hopefully you had a good one.

905
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:57,540
So you've taken it out on people. Is,
um, is you're actually a nice person.

906
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,380
Like Pete Holmes is character on crashing,

907
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,170
by the way. I fucking love that show. Um,

908
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,340
Tj Miller,
um,

909
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,610
Artie Lange and I believe the
guy's name is George Bazell. Uh,

910
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:18,180
I watched the first three fucking
episodes and they were killing me.

911
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:22,710
And their interaction with Pete's
character. He's great. And I can't wait.

912
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:23,550
I love Pete Holmes.

913
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:27,330
I cannot wait to break his balls about
his character on that show though.

914
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,240
I really going to break his balls like
Pete. Is that how you see yourself?

915
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,860
I'm just a nice guy who tries to
do nice things. It's like Pete,

916
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:38,130
you're a fucking lunatic.
Just like the rest of us.

917
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,960
Um, anyways, oh I can't wait to, I, they,

918
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:46,230
one of my favorite things in this business
is teasing him cause he can fucking

919
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:51,030
take it. But uh, you got check out
crashing a Judd Apatow, uh, Pete Holmes,

920
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,750
a Joey Rose's Joe to Rosa,

921
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,800
a road on the show to a Mike
Birbiglia I believe wrote on the show.

922
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,460
There's a bunch of people, uh, comics
and everything and the comics on it.

923
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,710
I saw agree of bonds, Dove David off
all these comics, a Marina Franklin.

924
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:09,990
It's just, it's fucking them.
It's just such an amazing show.

925
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:14,550
Cause I remember when he came to New York,
um,

926
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,550
as that wide eyed kid and I had
actually worked with him and, uh,

927
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,430
this comedy club in Peoria,
Illinois. That doesn't anymore.

928
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,130
I worked with him at Brewster's when
he was still married. I believe.

929
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,280
Maybe had just gotten divorced.
I can't fucking remember.

930
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:33,400
I've told this story before.
We went to go see the ring and we,

931
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,100
and we were the only two people in
the movie theater. And I hate that.

932
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:39,850
That's that. That is the
detail. Cause that sounds fake.

933
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,740
It's the only time it's ever happened.
We walked in,

934
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,710
it was a shitty movie theater.
We were two comedians.

935
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,060
It was the middle of the fucking,

936
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,210
it was like two in the afternoon and
we saw the ring on like a Thursday

937
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:51,220
afternoon and a shitty movie theater.
And I swear to God,

938
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:53,980
we are the only two fucking people there.
Um,

939
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,170
that movie stayed with me. Certain
certain one, Blair, which stayed with me.

940
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:03,430
That one stayed with me. Um,
some of them just to just,

941
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:06,390
they just fucking creep me
out and they stay with me. Um,

942
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,330
for whatever reason, Jordan peals movie
when that, that guy comes running, when,

943
00:57:12,331 --> 00:57:12,411
you know,

944
00:57:12,411 --> 00:57:16,800
when the kids smoking the cigarette and
then the guy comes fucking just running

945
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:19,060
up full speed. Adam, that fucked with me.

946
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:23,170
That's for whatever reason that
fucking stayed with me. Um, anyways,

947
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,950
did just like shit. I think about
when I go to my car at night,

948
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,030
even though I know it's not real,

949
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:30,400
I just think about what a fat fucking
dude just came from wanting to just like

950
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:34,900
that at the last second. Made a
right turn in front of me. Um,

951
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,063
anyways,

952
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,110
I had a fuck did I get on to all of that
shit talking about this poor kid who

953
00:57:41,111 --> 00:57:45,700
killed himself. Um, anyways, he
can send that throwing a, okay.

954
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:48,190
What does he say?
You've been called Billy fat tits.

955
00:57:48,191 --> 00:57:51,070
How many times and by how
many people you kill yourself,

956
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:55,510
over half of your listeners will
go to jail. How is this a law?

957
00:57:55,870 --> 00:58:00,250
How many times can you call somebody fat
before it's against the law and can we

958
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:04,990
stop saying bullying? It's just being
teased and made fun of. That's not true,

959
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:09,190
man. That isn't, that's
not true. That's not true.

960
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:13,620
It depends on the level and
it depends on the intent. Um,

961
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:18,120
in all of this shit will be really hard
to prove. But like, you know, there's,

962
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:22,090
what it is, sir, is you have to have
empathy here. And what I'm guessing is,

963
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,320
is that you are more the person
teasing then getting teased.

964
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,080
Um,

965
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,530
and maybe you are a little bit more of
a stronger person the same way somebody

966
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:37,420
else might've just been better at math
than you. Um, I know looking back,

967
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,110
you know, in my high school, I
know that there was a, you know,

968
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:44,440
there was kids that got
it really fucking bad,

969
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,630
really bad and uh, you know, one of whom,

970
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,590
you know, killed himself a few years
later. And I remember thinking back,

971
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,510
I don't know what it was based on,

972
00:58:55,511 --> 00:59:00,460
but certainly did not have
a good experience in high
school the last couple of

973
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,060
years.

974
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:05,830
And it's one of those things because
kids are kids and they don't,

975
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,500
they don't understand it.
Um,

976
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,140
it's a really complex thing.

977
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:13,930
But I would say at this kid
was also bullied at school.

978
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,060
And then if this person was a content
at dairy queen, I mean it's sorted of a,

979
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,600
an amalgam of all of that.

980
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:23,510
And then also the personalities people
they're born that just really sensitive,

981
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:27,740
shy people and, uh, they
don't know how to handle it.

982
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,790
And if you're prone to depression,
shit, I imagined that, you know,

983
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,110
that's sort of the perfect storm. So, um,

984
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:37,881
anyways, he goes, stay,

985
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:41,270
throw this bullying word around like
it's an epidemic sweeping all these

986
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:45,170
heartless millennials. Uh, we've
all been made fun of before.

987
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:48,790
We've all been called names ever
since we were little kids. Um,

988
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,410
you sound like an older person like
me and you're just doing the day.

989
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,990
These kids today, these
millennials, and they'll make God,

990
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:57,430
they're fragile little flowers and
they're not all like that. To this day.

991
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:01,210
He thinks it's still not the mean kid.
You still don't think there's, there's,

992
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,820
you know,
the big guy just fucking beaten on.

993
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:07,670
There's always going to be the bigger kid,
beaten on the younger kids,

994
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,840
the smaller kids or whatever.
Um, we need to let this continue.

995
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,530
It builds character.
If you were always given a trophy,

996
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,670
you're all over the map here.
Dude. It only told compliments you,

997
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:24,050
you wouldn't be a comedian. Um,
no. Now you speaking for me,

998
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:27,440
you would still be working in the carpeted
area discussing which I never worked

999
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:29,810
there. Your favorite route
to work in the morning.

1000
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:34,040
All I'm saying is that we're all becoming
weak pussies because of laws like this

1001
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,600
and nobody's addressing it.

1002
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:40,550
But you can't bill with your
soon to be Emmy winning podcast.

1003
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,640
You can champion this cause
for all our sake or whatever.

1004
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,290
Hope to see important suit. Thanks.
I have to be honest with you sir.

1005
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,410
All right. I think, uh,
the true sign of maturity,

1006
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,510
aside from on one side,

1007
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,800
being able to take a good ribbing and,

1008
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:06,130
and learning how to have more of a sense
of humor by yourself and also learning

1009
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,850
that whatever is happening today is
not the end of the fucking world.

1010
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,800
And that, you know, it's probably kids
listening right now that get bullied.

1011
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,980
This is the thing, all of that shit, it's,

1012
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,700
you're not going to see any
of those fucking people ever
again after high school.

1013
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,290
And your whole fucking life is going to
be determined by you and the decisions

1014
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:32,090
you make, and you have
100% control over that. So,

1015
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,350
um,
you know,

1016
01:01:33,351 --> 01:01:36,440
and I think a lot of times people get
bullied up aside from the fact that

1017
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:41,240
they're, that they're just
smaller, weaker. They just
seem like targets. I think,

1018
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:45,320
you know, sometimes when people
see somebody that's talented, um,

1019
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,510
they'll go after him and,
uh,

1020
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,090
so you got to make sure that you
kind of push all that shit away.

1021
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,110
But the other side I think that really
shows that you're a mature is, uh,

1022
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:58,970
is empathy. You know what
I mean? It certainly helps.

1023
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,560
Like, uh, I can think it's easy
to do that. The rant that you did,

1024
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:07,700
I understand there's a lot
of truth in some of the shit
that he's saying, but, um,

1025
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,720
you know, it's not all just like,
ah, learn how to fucking take it.

1026
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:15,110
You fucking pussy stop wearing a
helmet when you ride bicycles and shit.

1027
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:19,040
And I'm guilty of saying stuff like that.
I understand where you're coming from.

1028
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,590
Like, uh, you know, so
what, what is, what, what,

1029
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,210
why do you think this kid killed himself?
You know what I mean?

1030
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,090
Do you think if that shit
wasn't happening, the kids
still would have been made?

1031
01:02:31,091 --> 01:02:34,480
It's a possibility. I don't know if
that kid had clinical depression.

1032
01:02:34,481 --> 01:02:38,500
I have no idea. But I agree with
you to try from what you've written.

1033
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:40,160
Okay.

1034
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,250
For the sentences where the w
what was spelled correctly, uh, it

1035
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,900
seems like that kid was just having
a miserable experience. I mean,

1036
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:52,010
I can't imagine if you were getting
bullied all day at school and then you go,

1037
01:02:52,011 --> 01:02:53,810
okay,
well now I'm going to get a job.

1038
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:57,290
This might be a ray of light to
what the future's going to be,

1039
01:02:57,291 --> 01:03:01,400
where I'll be at work and maybe people
are nicer and then it just becomes

1040
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:05,690
somebody else screaming
at you. Um, you know,

1041
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:10,160
when you're 17 years old,
if it's substance school and
sucks at the dairy queen,

1042
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,520
you work at that is your world and uh,

1043
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:17,240
you don't have an ability to step out
of it and you can downward spiral.

1044
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,700
Like once again, I don't think that
they should put it all on this person,

1045
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:23,090
but that's a a, it's a
fucking terrible story. Um,

1046
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:28,890
but I, I don't think
there's backlash to the, to,

1047
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:33,980
to political correctness to then go the
other fucking deep go deep all the way

1048
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:38,420
back once again to what
caused political correctness.

1049
01:03:38,421 --> 01:03:41,810
All you fucking guys, hey, pull your
bootstraps up the top in a fucking pussy.

1050
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:43,250
You fucking millennial flour.

1051
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:48,380
It's guys like you that are fucking
ranting against fucking political

1052
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:51,920
correctness. It's constant. Like you
that created a political correctness,

1053
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,790
you know,
white guys that tell it like it is,

1054
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,860
is there anything worse than
the white guy that I know.

1055
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:02,230
I always say that I fucking, that's, that
is, to me that is the most boring. Yeah,

1056
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:03,710
yeah.

1057
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,620
Fucking mindset. You could
possibly have a, I'm a white guy.

1058
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:10,010
Everything's set up for me.
Let me tell you who, you know,

1059
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:14,870
just not have the advantages that I have.
Why you need to toughen up.

1060
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,740
You know,
as I slept in my bunk bed and my Culdesac,

1061
01:04:18,741 --> 01:04:23,720
those were the years that I really
became a tough guy. Um, anyways, so,

1062
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:26,510
yeah, I mean that's just
a terrible story. I, I, I,

1063
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,710
I hope that something good could come
out of it cause that's, you know,

1064
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,110
it's very rare that,
you know,

1065
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:35,390
you bring up an ice cream store
and some like that happens.

1066
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,460
That was all exciting. You know, I
love fucking dairy queen. You know,

1067
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:44,960
my wife loves dairy queen. We are dairy
queen people, uh, cleaning up. All right,

1068
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:49,220
dear bill, do your Billy red
face yet. Um, I'm 52 years old.

1069
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,031
Congratulations.

1070
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:53,810
Most people don't live that long or a
lot of people don't make it that far. Uh,

1071
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:58,970
I'm 52 years old, but a life of
drinking has made me look 62.

1072
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,650
I still drink and I smoke weed all day.
Jason Sky's going hard.

1073
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:08,630
You drink and you smoke weed all day.
I wasn't there for my kids growing up.

1074
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:13,940
They had to go through a lot because of
my mind and my wife's addiction problems.

1075
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:19,360
JC, I imagine they did. Uh, let's say
Jesus is too depressing ones in a row.

1076
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,860
What does this doctor, Phil, you
need to stop drinking, smoking,

1077
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:28,840
Wade and pay attention to your children.
Crowd goes crazy.

1078
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,010
Another episode in the can and he gets
more syndication money and then that

1079
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:37,690
fucking drunk walks out the door,
continues to do what the fuck he's doing.

1080
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:42,610
And Dr Phil Looks Great. Uh, let's
just say the fact that they turned out,

1081
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,430
let's just face say the fact that they,

1082
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,710
the way they turned out
has nothing to do with me.

1083
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,470
I take no credit for the
people they are today. Well,

1084
01:05:50,471 --> 01:05:55,120
nor should you with the exception
of any lingering anxiety. I May,

1085
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:56,020
I may have caused them.

1086
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,240
I mean if you're the kind of dad
that you're saying you are, yeah.

1087
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,930
You kind of owning up to it, which is good
I guess. Unless you're doing that like,

1088
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:05,860
so everybody goes, no, no.
You were actually a good dad.

1089
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,590
All depends on what your,
your reasoning is. Um,

1090
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,580
I don't live close to my daughters,
but I am starting to miss them.

1091
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:18,130
Um, I feel like they'd be better
without me at this point. Nah,

1092
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,630
I'm at a fork in the road.

1093
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:22,720
I can either clean up and
realized that my life isn't over.

1094
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:26,560
Sent my phone buzzing.
Oh,

1095
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:30,820
and he spills his first glass
of water or the day. All right,

1096
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:34,720
I got to fucking call this back in a
minute. Um, all right, where am I? Um,

1097
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,310
I can either clean up and realize that
my life isn't over and then I may have

1098
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:43,840
the grandchildren one day that I want to
have a relationship with or just enjoy

1099
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:48,400
my responsibility. Let's
life, uh, responsibility,

1100
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:49,840
less life until I die.

1101
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:53,980
That sounds morbid and the answer may
seem more obvious to someone else,

1102
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:57,160
but there was a good chance my kids
won't care either way at this point.

1103
01:06:57,161 --> 01:07:00,700
And I don't want to disrupt
them by being the annoying, hey,

1104
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:04,000
can I come back and do your life person
quitting won't be easy and I'm trying to

1105
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:06,940
weigh my options. What should I do? A,

1106
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:10,540
you should get clean and sober
and own up to everything.

1107
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:15,220
Apologize to your kids and then understand
that it's your kids' choice whether

1108
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:17,480
they want you back in their life or not.
And uh,

1109
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,240
that's what they decide that they don't.

1110
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:23,710
You have to be a man about it and I
wouldn't pout and go back to drinking and

1111
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:25,870
smoking.
Um,

1112
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:30,880
you can totally clean your life up and
you can put years back on the pedometer,

1113
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:35,070
you know? Or you can be dead in 10
years. I mean, it's up to you. I mean,

1114
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:37,750
it's pretty, uh, pretty easy, easy choice.

1115
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:42,280
But I would say the first thing you
should do is try to get help and, um,

1116
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,660
I dunno, I got to tell you, dude, not
drinking and all that type of stuff.

1117
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:50,050
You feel like he feel like
1 million bucks, you know,

1118
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:53,020
four days and not drinking alone.
When you wake up in the morning,

1119
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:57,580
you're going to feel 20 years younger,
you know? So, uh, I don't know.

1120
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:00,100
You want to keep feeling like shit.
It's going to,

1121
01:08:00,101 --> 01:08:01,720
that's going to be a
brutal death bed dude.

1122
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,240
To sit in there waiting
for someone to show up,

1123
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:08,140
hoping somebody is going to show up.
You don't want that man. You're only 52.

1124
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:12,940
You know, you got a lot of years left. You
got a quarter of a century left, if you,

1125
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:17,930
if you eat right in a exercise and all
of that type of stuff. So you know,

1126
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,530
it's up to you, man. You're an adult.
I hope you make a positive choice.

1127
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,780
Jesus Christ. All Right, yogurt.
Does anybody die in this one?

1128
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,600
Um,
maybe it's more than you want to bother,

1129
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:34,400
but it's really easy to make your own
yogurt. Uh, then you know what's in it.

1130
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,060
I'm not going to down going
to load you down with links,

1131
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:39,890
but this is a pretty decent start.
Yeah.

1132
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:43,880
And they send me this fucking
video of this woman immediately.

1133
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:46,910
I'm envious of her chin or kitchen
and the fact that she gets us,

1134
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:51,080
she can speak more than one language
cause I think that's cool as shit. But uh,

1135
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:54,370
she's making yogurt and one of the
things, one of the ingredients, she goes,

1136
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,840
it's very simple yogurt.
One of the ingredients she makes,

1137
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,780
one of the ingredients
to her yogurt is yogurt.

1138
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,480
I'm going to show you how to make
chicken. All right, get salt and pepper,

1139
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:08,750
put it in a ball and then go to
the store and buy some chicken.

1140
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:12,650
Some already made chicken. I don't
get it. I don't get that video. Um,

1141
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:16,460
I'm fine with just the Greek
yogurt, probiotic. It tastes
fucking weird as shit.

1142
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:20,690
The plain stuff. And after a while you get
addicted to and you'll love it. So, um,

1143
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:24,580
I appreciate it. I will post the
link. It's a great fucking steal.

1144
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:25,670
I love about that stove.

1145
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,390
It's got four burners and then it's got
the griddle in the middle. I love that.

1146
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:33,470
Oh, I want that stove so fucking
bad. All right. Fun Car to drive.

1147
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,290
Billy sports car.
Uh,

1148
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:40,080
you were talking about cars on Thursday
and the most fun car I ever drove was a

1149
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:45,020
1968 Alfa Romeo sedan,
not the spider. Google it.

1150
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,520
Short throw, manual shift. My favorite
fucking thing ever handles. Great.

1151
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,790
Um, yeah, I actually, um,

1152
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:55,880
I actually looked up the car there
wa there was only youtube videos,

1153
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:59,300
pictures of him. Nobody had the
sedan. I'll tell you, one of the best,

1154
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:04,220
most fun shifting cars I ever
drove was my older brother had a,

1155
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:09,280
had like a 1981 two door Toyota Tercel
for speed and that fucking thing,

1156
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:16,790
it was so tight. It was do you
had to move that fucking thing?

1157
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:17,810
Like I swear to God,

1158
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:22,070
like an inch and a half and you
were in another gear and uh,

1159
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,070
even though it was a four cylinder
by today's standards, you know,

1160
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,400
it was a pretty goofy looking car,
San high up off in shit.

1161
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:31,980
But it was fun as shit to drive.
We said these jobs with, you know,

1162
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,360
we had paper routes from the time we
were in third grade right up til ninth

1163
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:35,720
grade.

1164
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:40,720
And then when we got our licenses we
just delivered bigger roots and we drove

1165
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:42,290
around beating the shit out of our cars.

1166
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:45,680
And that was the most fun car to drive
cause you could stack it the back seat up

1167
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:49,100
with all the papers and um,
and dude,

1168
01:10:49,101 --> 01:10:52,340
it was a Toyota and that's when Toyota
was really competing with the American

1169
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:55,910
shit. And I'm the only way
that they were going to get it.

1170
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,100
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me too?

1171
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,640
This is how fucked up my houses.

1172
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:07,040
I just spilled water and I was just like,
you know what? On the hardwood floors,

1173
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:11,190
I'm going to finish the podcast.
I'm almost done. I got to take the,

1174
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:15,340
I can't believe this just happened and
I'm thinking that's a fucking water.

1175
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,110
It's going to be on the floor.
It's just going to be a pump.

1176
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:25,180
This is what just happened.
I just looked down at the floor.

1177
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:28,330
I felt I spilled a full glass of water.
It's all gone.

1178
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:32,110
It's not there anymore. Sorry.
I put the headphones back on

1179
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,390
the fuck out.
He hit the floor isn't even wet.

1180
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:39,770
Yeah.

1181
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,350
This is what happens and this
is only one part of my house.

1182
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,393
Okay.

1183
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:49,130
The house is settled so much.
My house is 94 years old this year.

1184
01:11:49,131 --> 01:11:51,350
It's settled so much that I swear to God,

1185
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,810
the water roll down the
hill and the base board.

1186
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:59,480
This is space between the floorboards in
the base board and it just rolled into

1187
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:03,830
the cracks. It disappeared.
This can't be fucking happen

1188
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,490
on a fucking believable.

1189
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:16,080
Oh, I've got it now. I'm
wondering where did that go?

1190
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:19,110
Is this ceiling below now going
to have all watermarks on it?

1191
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:23,800
I don't think that's enough water
to do it, dude. I'm telling you.

1192
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:26,500
I'm telling you right fucking now.
Okay.

1193
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,950
The next house I get
is going to be fucking,

1194
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,020
if it's an old house,
it's going to be,

1195
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,460
we looked at one this
weekend where it was,

1196
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:36,970
should we just look at what would
bullshit? You know what I mean? Um,

1197
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,550
but she's trying to see what's out there,
but the prices are,

1198
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:42,490
and that type of shit did. We
looked at one, it was the turn key.

1199
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,570
That's what I want. And for all
you people never bought a house.

1200
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,640
That means the whole fucking
thing has been redone.

1201
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,950
I don't give a fuck that
somebody is flipping it.

1202
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:54,700
I don't give a shit that they're trying
to make fucking 500 fucking thousand

1203
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:56,410
dollars in two months.
I don't care.

1204
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:00,730
The fact that they're going
to strip it all the way down,

1205
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:05,860
all the way down, all the
piping, the sewer line right
out to the fucking street.

1206
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,530
Everything's brand new.
That's the house I'm getting.

1207
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,590
That's the house I'm getting,
and that's the house I'm dying,

1208
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,910
and when I die,

1209
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:19,480
the fucking next person can deal
with whatever bullshit I did to it.

1210
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:24,510
I just go to a full glass of fucking
water and it disappeared like a magic

1211
01:13:24,611 --> 01:13:25,990
trick. All right, that's the podcast.

1212
01:13:25,991 --> 01:13:30,780
Go fuck yourselves up in on
you on a on Thursday. Go, Bro.

1213
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,070
It's.
