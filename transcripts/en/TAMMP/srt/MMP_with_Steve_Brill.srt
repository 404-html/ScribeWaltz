1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,710
Yep. Alright. Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:09,120
It's bill burr and uh, it's time
for not a Monday morning podcast,

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,860
a very special Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:13,710
Some of you who listen to this
show every week, you know,

5
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,210
every once in a while I'll have a good
friend come on and a will bullshit.

6
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:22,490
No commercials, no nothing. And uh,
this time I'm going good friend.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,800
You are the good friends. I like
that thick. They were where we came.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,090
We had a set relationship we did that was
supposed to then evolve into some sort

9
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,680
of dinner that we never had
hospitals we yet know yet.

10
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,860
I'm still holding out and I'm still
holding out hope staring out the window.

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,460
And Ladies and gentlemen, Steven
Brill, we have here a Steve Brill,

12
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,760
the director of a movie that I uh,

13
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:46,830
I was fortunate enough to have a very
small part in coming up this weekend.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,120
May 2nd walk of shame
starring Elizabeth Banks. Yes.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,690
And James Marsden,
who pizza probably saw an anchorman two.

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,170
Well good ma'am.
You don't have a small part in it though.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,020
There are no small parts.
There's only

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,520
insecure performance,
which you are not cut out of the movie.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,270
There are those, you know,
I cut my grandmother out,

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,760
I swear to God.
Well you weren't there,

21
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:18,900
but my wife's grandmother
who's 90 years old, uh,

22
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,250
I put her in at the very end.

23
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:24,330
It was a very cool touching thing to do
and she's a performer and she'd never

24
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:28,980
been in a movie. And so you acted like
her dream was going to come true? We did.

25
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,540
We flew her down and you know,

26
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:35,250
it was like queen for a day and she was
really into it and I haven't told her

27
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:39,990
she's cut out the, oh no. How
are you going to know it? Well,

28
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:44,060
she was nice, so I was
like, Eh, uh, but uh,

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
so we got to look me
up. No, absolutely not.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,810
But part of me was like,
this isn't the most pressing thing.

31
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:57,420
And then all of a sudden it's
coming out and she doesn't know. Oh,

32
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:00,510
because you have to go through the whole
all the promotion things and edit it

33
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,140
down and run it before. I just don't know.
It's been cut for a while. I have not,

34
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,720
I should have told her or I should.
And then I, my wife went up there,

35
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:10,330
she lives in Marine County and I told my
wife to tell her and my wife chickened

36
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,500
out, so she doesn't know. But I got
a call or shoot kind of chicken out.

37
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:18,340
You kind of ponder it off. I totally
pawn it off on her, but uh, it's, uh,

38
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:21,460
yeah, it's, it's something I gotta
deal with. Ah, that's my life.

39
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,323
What are you going to do?

40
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,830
You're just going to let the chips fall
where they may could because she sorta

41
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,940
lives in their own world up there.
She's a dance instructor on a hilltop.

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,630
Shit's not going to play up there.
But she might have a friend who go,

43
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:38,290
I saw the movie and, uh, where were
you? What, what if you just deny it?

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,860
I could do, I could do that. Oh my God.

45
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,450
Literally see the stress
on your face. Oh, you know,

46
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,550
it's happened a lot and often you
do movies and you cut parts, uh,

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,950
that people love, uh, and you,

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,870
you tell them and sometimes you
cut an entire performances and uh,

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,350
it's the director no one else should do
at the director should man up and it,

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,040
and I tend to do it, but in this case
I haven't done it. What's the worst?

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
And I have to, I'm sorry.
Thank you for having me. You,

52
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,640
you are cut from the movie bill.
You are completely cut

53
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,960
this guy here coming across the table.
What's the, uh, I don't want you,

54
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,110
if you don't want to name names,

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,940
but what's the worst situation that
you've had where you had to cut an entire

56
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:28,770
performance? The worst reaction though,
like maybe the first time he had to do it,

57
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:32,220
like how long did it take you to get
the balls up to just call them up and be

58
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:34,560
like, Hey, maybe that dream you had.

59
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,680
Remember how about how I told you,
oh,

60
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:41,700
well you were doing in the movie and
you're really making this and how it's

61
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:45,350
going to do stuff for your career.
Well, yeah. Oh my guys. See,

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,820
I'm trying to think of a very particular
incident. It happens all the time.

63
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,440
It's happened to me as an actor too.

64
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:52,560
I was an actor and many
actors he'll talk to,

65
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:56,820
we'll go through your experience of,
uh, showing up to the premier almost,

66
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,330
or sitting around the TV with their
family and going, okay, here I come.

67
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,320
Here I come.

68
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,710
And then they skip the part of the
narrative where they're supposed to be.

69
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,980
And it's like the worst experience
that I've been to a premiere.

70
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,750
I was cut out and the director didn't
tell me what it was a small part.

71
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,100
And I vowed never to do that. Of course,
now I'm doing it with my grandmother, but,

72
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,200
uh,
I can't remember she lives,

73
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,010
but I'm uh, uh, I have cut.

74
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,730
I have cut great scenes from people
that I thought that we just couldn't,

75
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,580
we couldn't keep it in the movie and
they were really bummed out about that.

76
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,170
It's a great scene. They've done a great
job. It's just that films too long.

77
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:36,040
The pacing, what, what is it? Yeah, it's,

78
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,300
it's emotional scenes
generally in a comedy.

79
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:41,840
Like I'll usually put a few emotional
scenes in that might not be,

80
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,640
not have enough jokes or even any jokes.

81
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:48,260
And there's a movie I did called late
last night, which is a movie I wrote. Um,

82
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,530
and it started to Emilio Estefan as in
Steven Weber and it was all about two

83
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:52,550
guys at night.

84
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:55,760
It wasn't dissimilar from this movie
of shame was two guys one night,

85
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,110
La losing their minds.

86
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,650
And they had this one critical scene
where they sat and they really talked it

87
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,140
out about three quarters of
the way through the movie.

88
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:07,760
And one guy talked about sort of, you
know, where all his problems come from.

89
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:10,560
And there was a mention of a girlfriend
dying of aids and there was a whole

90
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,030
monologue store,
but it was good.

91
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,040
It was really long tracking shot
through a sand in the bunker.

92
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,040
They were in a golf course at night
and it was sort of telling everything I

93
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,570
thought I wanted to write the movie about,

94
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:27,420
which is often a mistake is when
you have people talk about it.

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,210
And a well performed.

96
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:33,990
Emilio cried and we were all so
proud of ourselves afterwards.

97
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:37,260
And then we just started, I cut it into
the movie and it was just like, okay,

98
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:41,250
here comes that scene everybody.
Oh. And it shows the dragon.

99
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,320
The audience didn't like it.
Test audiences. Uh, anybody
who saw it was like, okay,

100
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:49,860
well played, but actually sticks out
as being a little, not pretentious,

101
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:54,300
but unnecessary and overstating
the themes of the movie obviously.

102
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:56,790
And it looks better without, did you
fight for the scene or you just know?

103
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,840
I the only one who, it was my movie. I
didn't have a lot of pressure on me. Uh,

104
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,110
so I, I, I cut up myself and then
told them and they were, it was a,

105
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,550
it was an actor's moment.
And certainly when you send the script,

106
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,910
a lot of actors get very attracted
to certain scenes in movies.

107
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,050
I don't know if you get
that and you're like,

108
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:16,230
that's why a lot of movies attracted
to the fact that I'm actually in one,

109
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,150
but there's a plane ticket for you. Just
happy to be the Kona New Orleans. Yeah,

110
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,770
I'll fly myself there. Absolutely.
Well as it moves along, you'll,

111
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:28,070
you'll read a script you and be like,
oh, that moment, uh, that's a good one.

112
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,100
And then often sometimes you don't even
shoot that moment or it gets co opted or

113
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:37,220
a director will go, oh, that line, uh,
uh, I think the other guy should say that.

114
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,020
And then you'll take that one.
That happens a lot,

115
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:40,880
like just certain moments
or beats get switched.

116
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:44,660
Sometimes you just have to roll with
it. Just like being cut. And I, I,

117
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:48,090
since I feel I've been cut and
I sort of live in the Rio, uh,

118
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,340
I've been at the business a long time,

119
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,830
so I'm pretty pragmatic
about Hollywood and that's,

120
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,390
I don't even tell my parents until
jobs are almost shooting, you know,

121
00:06:56,391 --> 00:07:01,220
because things fall apart so much out
here and I don't say shit. I exactly,

122
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,700
until I started promoting this movie
like two weeks in that I'm still thinking

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,940
like, well, I know, I'm trying to think.

124
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:11,540
I was trying to think of a way that
you could cut me out and I came up with

125
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,060
three different ways you could do it.
So it was just like going,

126
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:17,660
I don't want to be that guy cause you
know I already get trashed enough on

127
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:21,600
Twitter. Oh really? It's just me trying
to read out loud and stuff. I, I get,

128
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,350
I give them plenty of material on my own.

129
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:27,870
The last thing I needed to do was say
that I'm in a movie that I'm not in.

130
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,660
Oh my gosh. Because I've always wanted
this. If the actor gets cut out,

131
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,280
can, can he still get the footage
for is real. That often happens.

132
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,770
And I like to say yes and
then I'm never able to do it.

133
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,900
So it's a double whammy because I'm like,
well,

134
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,570
because generally I don't own the
footage in the studio. We'll be like,

135
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,220
why would you want a,

136
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:50,600
unless it's a pure outtake that often
we can put the outtakes on the DVD of a

137
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,350
scene, which happened that saved us on a
few and a few incidents where, you know,

138
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:59,270
we'd put the extra scenes, see, so the,
the, you'd always be able to put it on,

139
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,840
but often people would want their stuff
and I wasn't allowed to release it.

140
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,460
So dude,

141
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,460
I know a guy who he had like five
scenes with Al Pachino in a movie.

142
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,790
What movie?
I don't know the movie,

143
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,880
but I saw the pain in his eyes
that I know it was a real story.

144
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,570
He told everybody and they showed up.
Oh yeah.

145
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,960
It was one of those stories he's telling
me and I'm just like going, Oh God, bail,

146
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,490
bail, take, take, take an exit.

147
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:26,960
And he just rode the
wave to the beach and uh,

148
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,320
they cut the entire storyline.
Oh yeah. It just is.

149
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,100
When they went to go pick, put it
like, I don't know how you guys do.

150
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,060
Like I have such fucking add,
like that's why standup is perfect for me.

151
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,140
It's like, oh, I have an idea and I talk
about it for 90 seconds and I'm like, Ooh,

152
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:43,580
look at that light that just came on.

153
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,510
And then I go over there like I've tried
to write scripts and it goes well to

154
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:52,511
about page 30 and it starts spinning
out of control and I go into denial and

155
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,400
I'll get to about page 50 then
I'm just like, ah, this is just a,

156
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,300
it's like a giant pizza dough that just
out of control and it's a virtual wall.

157
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:04,470
You hit and you back back away from it
and Jesus shows up and he kills everybody

158
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:09,210
except for the hero and the end
page 60. Yeah. Not a script. Yeah,

159
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,050
it's so capricious. Is that the word,
the movie business things or you know,

160
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,930
I was going to say you are award shows
right on the tip of my tongue, but I like,

161
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,750
I like it reflects your pension.
Yes. It's so crucial. Uh,

162
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,560
the uh, yeah, the I stories.

163
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,840
I've been around a lot of actors
too and there was a story,

164
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,390
I'll tell this story because
no ones knows this story.

165
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,120
It's so crazy about what can
happen to you as an actor.

166
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,940
Is this the actors podcast,
by the way, believe me,

167
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,610
if your people are not into this,
right so far,

168
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,580
we're going to talk about the movie and
then we'll get on to sports because got

169
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,670
to go to sports. Yeah. I would say
out of all the directors in Hollywood,

170
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:48,210
you have the best throwing arm.
Oh, thank you, dude. It was insane.

171
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,190
Remember that day we was
throwing the football around,

172
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,610
we will doing something and had a
helicopter or CIA seed and you're like,

173
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:58,350
all right, I'm going to throw it, you
know, and you, you know, no offense,

174
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:01,230
but you know,
you sit there and share the puree on.

175
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,730
I can't throw a ball guys
throwing it all over.

176
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:10,050
He's Dhamaka Bill. All right. Yeah.
Thanks. [inaudible] Hollywood. Yeah,

177
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,220
of course. It was it a pink
one too, for breast cancer.

178
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,000
How many levels that I people,

179
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,590
I can't believe a Beretta bad
that I call it a little. No,

180
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,680
we, that's what it is. Yeah. It's,

181
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,720
I forget what I called MCI Yarmulke.
It's money if you're balding

182
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,590
places to clip it on to go. Yeah, they
do. I don't tape it. I don't know. I got,

183
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,140
I got nothing on yama cause I mean I,
all right,

184
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:44,130
well tell us about this movie comes
out. It comes out, uh, May 2nd,

185
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,670
which is this Friday. This Friday.
Okay. So this movie comes out,

186
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,800
uh,
on,

187
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,090
it's this new thing they do with movies
where you can actually buy it on iTunes

188
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:57,030
through the same day it comes out.
Did you know that? No, I didn't. Yeah.

189
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,950
Vod Dane date.

190
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,340
So I think that's really smart because
people basically have movie theaters in

191
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:05,100
their homes with the surround sound.
That is what's happened.

192
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,850
And there's certain movies have
caught the idea that it's going to,

193
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,110
cause you don't have to
deal with people talking.

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,470
If they are talking to the man of the
house, you tell him to shut the fuck up.

195
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,670
You don't have to worry about
getting a job broken. Right.

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,890
And if you watch it alone, you can. Yes.
Schizophrenia takes up, shut the fuck up.

197
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,260
Um, this, uh, is, yeah,

198
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:28,080
so it comes out that gives you the
option of seeing it in theaters.

199
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,930
If you like the theater experience,
and I love the theater.

200
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,840
He sticky floors, you can,
you can go and, but look,

201
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,340
I mean you got to ask yourself,

202
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,680
why are movies getting so big and crazy
and why is it all special effects and

203
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,490
three d it is because they have got to
get people away from their 60 inches.

204
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,300
Right? Which is really what it is now you
can buy a 60 inch TV for three grand or

205
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:51,541
something,

206
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:55,360
a great one and people are not going
to leave their house and go through the

207
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,570
whole thing unless it's, you know, they
don't think they can get that experience.

208
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,930
So to that end movies like
cars is not in three days.

209
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,020
It has cinematic touches that
you really want to, you know,

210
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:12,220
appreciate in the cinema. But seeing it
at home is not a bad way to do it either.

211
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,100
So, but you have the choice comes out
May 2nd in theaters and Vod and model.

212
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,930
I had a, I had such a great time
on that. I got to work with the,

213
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,970
I never met before. People might
know him from a, what was that?

214
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:28,360
American history JAKKS American history x.
The white man marches on.

215
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,870
He sang that song. Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,730
I used to sing that to my black friends
when they didn't pick up their phone in

217
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:38,350
the 90s. I would sing that to
their, their aunts for sheets.

218
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,720
So plea, uh, who is, uh, my
name is [inaudible]. Yeah,

219
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,950
my name is Earl. My name
and uh, well he was just in,

220
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,390
we'll will fall street. We saw him in
the Wall Street. He, man, he's the best,

221
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,690
I think he's like, he's not underrated.
People know who he is and stuff,

222
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,740
but I think he's the funniest.

223
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:59,820
I used them in this movie called
without a paddle like 10 years ago.

224
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,530
He went to New Zealand when I hung
out with them for months there.

225
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,850
And he was just the best and the funniest
part told that great scene where he,

226
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,720
he didn't want to point
the gun at somebody and you
guys had this epic screaming

227
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:13,400
match at each other and some of the
forest in the middle of Louisiana.

228
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,310
That's true. He's also very
peculiar, as accurate as can be,

229
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,860
even though he's very sort of straight
forward and easy to deal with.

230
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:23,290
He decided his character. That's
what I was, he decided to,

231
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,200
his character had changed.
Three is a bad guy.

232
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,500
He thought his character going through
an arc where you'd actually internally

233
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:33,520
changed his feelings towards the guy who
was chasing and had ambivalence about

234
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,910
shooting him. So he wouldn't
point the gun at him at the end.

235
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,950
I see me literally
wouldn't raise it going up.

236
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,970
He had a tip down sort of at
his crotch. And uh, I was like,

237
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,580
he thinks he had gone up,
gone up. I thought it was
just being lazy. And he goes,

238
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,070
I can't man. I go, what
are you talking about?

239
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:51,460
You gotta train your weapon on these guys.
And you're like in the bush,

240
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,010
in the middle of the woods in New
Zealand where you could only access to by

241
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:57,550
helicopter. Burt Reynolds is there.
It's, it's a crazy, surreal scene.

242
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,090
And he's decided that his character's
gone through some sort of character arc

243
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,930
where he's nonviolent to the point of
like, you know, we'll let them run away.

244
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:07,780
And that was not in the script
and that was not intended. And he,

245
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,560
but if you do see the movie,
he won because he just
would not tip his weapon up.

246
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,520
And I gave up on him. Yeah. He said, you
edited in a completely different gun.

247
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,020
That's true. Yeah. Which is
the directors. That's right.

248
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,680
I remember looking at it and I see it
as a game, so I was like, okay buddy,

249
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:24,514
you want to do that?

250
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,080
So I think I got like a commando or
some Schwartzenegger movie and found a

251
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:33,790
closeup of a gun that matched his gun
and he just did a close up my bed being

252
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,340
cocked and loaded and then
do close up of his face.

253
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,830
So it looked like he was
ready to kill these people.

254
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,010
What would I love about that story
is so fun. Guys argued so bad.

255
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,320
And then you guys were total
friends. Oh yeah. On the set.

256
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:48,100
So I looked at it like when Tom Brady
yells at his offensive coordinator and

257
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:50,560
then the end of the game you're like, ah,
you know, you're still friends and then,

258
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,980
yeah. Yeah. I think that's, I do
operate on an aggressive sort of,

259
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,310
let's work this year. I remember, uh,

260
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,610
when we were filming that the Superbowl
was yeah. And while we were shooting.

261
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,330
Yeah. You had some, uh, you know, you'll
throw a little money down. I will. Yeah.

262
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,150
I lost that super bowl. I know
that I had Baltimore, right. Oh,

263
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,700
at nine or no? Second
half. Oh, this the ravens.

264
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:17,380
I actually picked the ravens last year.
How'd you do this year? Uh, overall. Yeah,

265
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,460
a loser. I mean, anyone who says they win
is a liar. Honest gambler. I, yeah, yeah,

266
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:26,800
yeah. No, I was overall a loser and a
in football. A, what was the Superbowl?

267
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,820
Seattle. Uh, oh yeah. I had
Broncos fed against Peyton. Me.

268
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,010
I mean, I wouldn't know anyone. It's
like gambler of course. As a, as a, as a,

269
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,590
I don't know why. Did you
hate, you hate Peyton or no,

270
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:43,060
I just felt that Seattle had
that kind of defense. Yeah.

271
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,150
That pisses him off where
he gets frustrated, right.

272
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,140
Where they're really
physical with his receivers.

273
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,980
Basically the whole thing that caused
him and Jim or say to make that tape

274
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,980
against the Patriots. I know a bunch
of cold fans are rolling their eyes,

275
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,090
but that's what the fuck happened.

276
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,310
So I felt like if they stopped him
enough early on, he would get frustrated.

277
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,330
But none of that even happened. No,
just snap the ball over his head.

278
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,980
And I know the wheels fell off all over
the place, so I don't put like that loss,

279
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,890
you know, on him. It was just like,

280
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,330
I just think the first play went so
bad and then the pressure of the game,

281
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,750
because Seattle wasn't that
much better than the Broncos.

282
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,360
I definitely think that they were
the better team, but that was,

283
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,150
remember the member,

284
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:29,150
the 80s when there was just like three
Superbowls in a row where it was just an

285
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,290
absolute blowout.
Yeah.

286
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,620
It started as a game and then one
team got out, goes over San Diego.

287
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,230
I mean nine years over San
Diego. Yeah, that, that run.

288
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,970
And that's 99 I was talking more like a,
I would say Cincinnati,

289
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:47,240
no Raiders destroying the red skins.

290
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,270
49 is came back and stopped and said,
bears destroying the Patriots. Yeah.

291
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,470
Giants destroying the Broncos.

292
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,580
Redskins destroying the Broncos than
the 49 bangles was a good one. Right.

293
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,730
And then you went into the buffalo years.
It was just really like close, terrible.

294
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,120
And they got good. Yeah. It was
kind of like, yeah, it was wild.

295
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:08,060
It was really like globe trotters,
Washington generally,

296
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,770
but like almost like a decade. I remember
like, uh, players from other sports,

297
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,640
what somebody big and another sports was
like, like, why would you even watch it?

298
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:21,500
It's like a blow out every year. And it
was like literally eight of the 10 years.

299
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,400
It was like 44 to 10,
56 to three, you know,

300
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:29,401
we're still really bad at first one was
the Saint Louis where he tackled him on

301
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,810
the two Tennessee St Louis. That
makes fun. Started or run, sorry,

302
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,580
start us at the game. Uh, where they were.
London Fletcher got him on the two. Yup.

303
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,420
That was 99. And then, uh,

304
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,110
I started a run where all of a
sudden the Superbowl was awesome.

305
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,220
2000 Raven's dominated the giants and
then all the Patriots ones were close.

306
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,710
And then the fucking best was a,
was a Broncos.

307
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,730
Packers that, oh yeah, I was
at that one. That was great.

308
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,500
That was down in San Diego,
in San Diego.

309
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,140
I remember thinking about going to that
game and I was watching the game and

310
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:02,420
when La dove headfirst and helicopter
around, I said to my friend, I said,

311
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:07,370
if they win this game, right, that is in
every highlight reel, I'll Superbowls.

312
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,290
And when they did the John Elway,
that was the greatest.

313
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,680
I was right there for that.
I was literally right there,

314
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,500
second row from the top of the stadium.

315
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,190
It was literally like so far away
that shithole stating that stain.

316
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,530
But it's a dump, I guess. I mean,
you know. Yeah, it is. It is right.

317
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,770
I've seen all ice to work. Uh, I how,
make sure it always, you've been to,

318
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,680
let's go there.
I've only been at Psu.

319
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,700
I went to [inaudible] age
of AC for 80 fucking no,

320
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:39,950
and it bled so night in New Orleans.

321
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,440
That was what you just said was
exactly what I was going to say.

322
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,580
Fucking bled Saul loss.

323
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,920
Cause that fucking asshole pat
sells fucking sold his house.

324
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:55,240
That up baby. Yep. No, you
wouldn't be due to fucking dinner.

325
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,240
You'll cook the meal.
You got to let me buy the groceries.

326
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,990
Well that was one of the
most self centered fucking
things. It's like, all right,

327
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,950
you don't get along with the owner sees
so fuck the whole team. I know. Right.

328
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:05,430
And he was,

329
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,470
he was a good enough coach and had a good
enough team where we were in it until,

330
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,300
uh, it was a mid, oh, I
think it was the first half.

331
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,890
We were still in it despite that bullshit.

332
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:17,040
Then there was the return that Michigan
kid ran it back and that was at an end

333
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,130
zone seats and he was standing
right at us. And then the next one,

334
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,200
the next one that I went to was a, I went
to when, when? When we beat the rams.

335
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,110
Yeah. Yup. And when, uh, when
they kicked the field goal,

336
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,070
I was on the opposite and they kicked
it. Right. Right. The other way I baked,

337
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,990
you know, that's the kind of hookup I,
yeah. I have upper deck end zone seats,

338
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,610
but I, you know, I went to
them and I ended up, uh,

339
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,390
when we went played the
next super bowl after that,

340
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,590
which I the fuck did we play after that?
It was either the eagles, there was no,

341
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,240
it was the, uh, the pants, the Superbowl,

342
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,910
the panthers and I had
an opportunity to go,

343
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,310
but then I got called in
to do the Chappelle show,

344
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,440
world series at dice for fans of the
show that was taped like the day before

345
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:01,050
super bowl Sunday or the day
after. Like I, I couldn't make it.

346
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,470
And I remember being upset that
I wasn't able to go, but say,

347
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,930
cause I got acting work right.
And then the second that game was over,

348
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:10,350
even though we won the fact that I
still had like two grand in my pocket,

349
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,780
I didn't have to go to the airport.
So it's like, you know what,

350
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,100
that's kind of cool.

351
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,450
And it's never going to be better than
watching the patriots win their first one

352
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:23,160
ever be that big of an underdog. So
I haven't gone since. Plus, you know,

353
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,440
I do the road all the time. I'm always
going to the front of the airport,

354
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:29,220
so it takes a lot. Gosh, I'm an old man
man. I mean he takes a lot to gate two.

355
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:32,520
I used to work at the
orange bowl as a kid.

356
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,940
I grew up in Miami sorta.
And uh,

357
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,880
I worked as a hot dog salesman at
the orange ball during the dolphins.

358
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,000
I would go to the dolphins getting the
perfect season. I was there for that.

359
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,620
No women 80 hours, like eight years
old. Uh, but my, my mercury Morris.

360
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,910
Oh yeah.
Jim Kicked Larry.

361
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,000
Larry Little Whoa. Keep going.
But offensive guard there.

362
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,000
Jan is pretty good. Uh, Nick
Bond, a county of Connie. Connie.

363
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,800
Uh, who else? Oh, Paul Warfield.
Yes. Gary. All your premium.

364
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,060
Very impressive. Your area. Bob Greasy.

365
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:10,760
Of course bill Stanfield,
the eight four member that the,

366
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,210
you know the name but a stand
Philip on it. I know all of that.

367
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:14,200
Just from watching NFL,

368
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,360
like Willie Marlin Briscoe
and the thing people forget,

369
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,740
which I'm glad on some sort of forum I
get to bring up is that that I was there

370
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,280
at the injury. It was a San Diego
Grease when grease he got knocked out,

371
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:28,270
people forget.

372
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,940
Greasy got knocked out in the third game
of the season and Earl moral took down

373
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,450
all the way to the playoffs and then
greasy came in and closed the deal and he

374
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:40,430
always had Earl moral gets
remembered for Superbowl three yeah,

375
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,820
more than he does for us.
That Superbowl six.

376
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,150
That one's seven eight I don't
know what number it was. Yeah,

377
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,990
I could actually sit there and
rain man it and throw it out.

378
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,770
I know I could sit here and I remembered
a yeah, in Bay jets, chiefs, Colts,

379
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,190
cowboys, Miami, my boys, my
seven or eight. Wow. Very good.

380
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,370
That's all I did for 10 to seven dolphins
lost and 70 would have been 14 nothing

381
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,760
cause my past ran back. The Gary,
your Pram, me and day you go, Oh God,

382
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,520
that was so I grew up with that and then
I sold hot dogs there and then I sold

383
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,620
hot dogs at the Super Bowl and 78 there.

384
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:16,360
That was my first one and then
a 78 79 was cowboys. Yeah,

385
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:19,550
Steelers cowboys.
Of course I was selling hot dogs.

386
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,430
I was stored by the way ever. Oh
yeah, I was there. A cowboys fan,

387
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,930
but I still call fan and I was there
selling hot dogs and it was solely

388
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,340
unregulated. It, what's that
guy's name? Bless his heart.

389
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:33,840
He's got to be the sickest man in the
building. That guy's lawn, Jackie,

390
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:37,390
the guy drop the ball. Oh, I don't
know. He played for the cardinals.

391
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,870
He had to show his hands in the business
and then he was so fucking wide open.

392
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:44,770
He had time to think about it and threw
it at him and he ate. He just dropped it.

393
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,540
I was stoned suddenly. Hot Dog. We used
to get there. We used to get there.

394
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,870
It was so unregulated. There was
no, as in such a bad part of town.

395
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,730
And they would let everyone in and
you'd have to buy your hot dogs.

396
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,000
And I was 15 or something.
I was,

397
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,230
is supposed to be working there and we'd
get stoned and just walk around selling

398
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:05,290
hot dogs and uh,
and getting high.

399
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,440
And then I remember I sold on hot
talk to Edward Kennedy at that came,

400
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:11,260
I thought that was the coolest
thing. Teddy Kennedy, Ted Kennedy.

401
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,010
Ted Kennedy was there. I remember I saw
him a hot dog. You were at Superbowl 13.

402
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,030
Yeah, it was stone. Yeah.

403
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,650
You was selling hot dogs and you sold one
to one of the Kennedy, so that's right.

404
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,020
That's pretty cool.
Right.

405
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,500
You people aren't going to go see
walk of shame has Friday. I agree.

406
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,510
That's the best.
Yeah.

407
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,220
So how did you end up playing catch
with Dan Marino in New York City late at

408
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:37,310
night? Oh Gosh. Yeah,
I know some Marino. Uh,

409
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,750
I met through a golf tournament,
Bobby Kennedy,

410
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Bobby Kennedy charge and try
the Irish Riviera Shriver.

411
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,680
I remember that actor or that actor,
sorry.

412
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:55,100
That's a horrible way to start
because he's still around.
Still works. DB Sweeney.

413
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:59,270
Remember DV Sweeney, I remember the
name. Yeah. KTV Sweeney. I know athletes.

414
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm not good with Efram. Zimbalist Jr of
course. He was great. He was a kicker.

415
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,720
Yeah. Uh, anyway,

416
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:12,830
I got to meet Dan and Danny down in
Miami t through this tournament while he

417
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,050
played and uh,
we became friends.

418
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,680
I don't know why it made very little
sense to me that you became friends.

419
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,860
Oh good. There it is. And we
played golf, sold hot dogs.

420
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:26,090
It's super [inaudible] and I couldn't be
a bigger dolphins fan of Meta marina on.

421
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,140
It's definitely a fan boy.

422
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:31,130
But he let it go and we sort of became
friends and I would go down and play the

423
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:35,330
turning away became friends and then he,
oh yeah, he's in this movie. Little Nicky.

424
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:39,110
I did. Uh Huh. So we call them
in Sandler who loved him to,

425
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,630
uh, call that love. Dan Marino
isn't one. No, he's the best.

426
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,380
I kind of think he's the best. Yeah. You
love him. Yeah. I got to hook you guys up.

427
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,940
Nobody I know. I know. God bless.

428
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,130
Everybody had caught up to him
and he was, I just, you know,

429
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,710
the guy had no fucking running game.

430
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,970
You have a look at it as it's
running backs during the no,

431
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,230
I've said this either way. I have to
admit one horrible thing. Delvin Williams.

432
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:10,970
Tony, Nathan Abdul Jabbar was
one headache monster. Literally.

433
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,870
Yeah. Is that who it was? Yeah,
like basketball player names.

434
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,250
Oh my God.
Robert Parish.

435
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,810
Kevin Mchale, the uh,
it's so horrible to admit,

436
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:26,810
but I have to be honest, cause that's
what this is all about. Right? Oh,

437
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,950
I shouldn't lie. No. Hollywood.
I should be completely phony.

438
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,480
I had you on here for me.
Oh, girl thing to do. Right.

439
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,680
I just want you to say how great I
was in the movie. Yeah. You were at,

440
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:39,980
you were really good.
Uh, but, uh, the, uh,

441
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,850
this is terrible that I went to college
and I wore a bra metaphorically,

442
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:49,510
and maybe even real,
right in the middle of Merinos heyday.

443
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,900
I was in college and I wasn't a
total like sports or stupid guy,

444
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,970
but part of me, I don't know what
happened. Oh, it's a fee. Yeah.

445
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,850
And I was a film guy and I lived a
hundred yards from Fenway pack and I never

446
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,400
went.
I was into football.

447
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:08,420
I mean it was in a film and foreign
movies and Ah, I was such a,

448
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,470
what word can I say? Dude?
I was a douche where yet

449
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,770
I was young, but I was an athlete
growing up and something changed.

450
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,970
I smoke Shit Tan, I talk, I use
my hands when I talk. I was,

451
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,250
I cared about movies and I was in the
middle of Boston in 1984 and I didn't go

452
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,150
and then it was me.
I got out of college and I came back.

453
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:36,080
But they Marino I was aware of and I
watched him. I liked him in college too.

454
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:37,860
I was aware of him then
and that whole dry,

455
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,810
did you see that documentary on the draft?
Yeah. So good. I just watched it again.

456
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,140
You don't want to start today that
the one that drove me up the wall, uh,

457
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,850
they did a 30 for 30 on the Detroit
Pistons. Oh yeah, yeah. Bad Boys. Yeah,

458
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,900
it was,
it's so fucking funny watching that like,

459
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,650
I mean obviously take all this with a
grain of salt because I am a Celtics fan,

460
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,510
but like just, it's just a
bunch of old men talk and shit.

461
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,970
It's just,
I find,

462
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,990
I find like blame beer out who
actually did shit and those stories.

463
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,100
Stories of brain reserve like a Bobby,
your Larry Bird,

464
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,300
Boston guys. I'm sorry. I'm just
naming other like even like Jordan,

465
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:18,810
you don't hear,

466
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,780
even though he is a shit talking about
here and like these guys were just like,

467
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,520
the funniest thing was with filthy
players talk about like what they do,

468
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,940
how the way they frame it. They're like,
you know, I always tried to get like,

469
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,080
you know, I was going to win the
mental game. I was going to wait.

470
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,230
And then they like cut to land beer, like
throwing an elbow and somebody spaces.

471
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,550
They're in the air coming down
the way it is. It's just like,

472
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,410
and Laimbeer kept going. You know
somebody had the way that black cat yup.

473
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,930
So me of the way, it's like,
no, you really didn't get,

474
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,390
didn't you could've gone out there and
just play the game and see if you could

475
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:53,391
one when playing the game and of course
certain mentality and Isaiah was doing

476
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:56,280
like, you know when they were called
thugs, Isaiah was kind of going,

477
00:27:56,281 --> 00:28:00,600
you know when people, when we, he has
these long pauses, you know, you know,

478
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,600
use a stereotype against you.

479
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,280
You can choose to either fight it on it,
bracing.

480
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,190
It's like dude,
there's no stereotype stereotype there.

481
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,520
This is what you guys were doing.
You were beating the shit out of people.

482
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,470
You took basically the flyers, you
know broad street. Yeah. Basically.

483
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:22,080
Yeah we can't beat so we're just going
to beat the shit out of you and then

484
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:24,980
we're going to call it act like
we're playing chess sida. Dude,

485
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,260
you just broke my nose. I mean
your head man, I'm in your head.

486
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,460
I really think we're just,

487
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:31,980
somethings that fucker took him up and
I'm not talking about real horn because

488
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:34,890
that guy was seriously, I would not, I
mean obviously I wouldn't fuck with any,

489
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:37,950
what does that guy look was the real deal.
But the rest of them though,

490
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,900
when they want, when they find
out, when the Bulls beat him,

491
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,940
they didn't shake the hands. They just
came off like a bunch of punks. Oh yeah.

492
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:45,120
Yeah. They will punky.
That was terrible. And,

493
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:46,860
and people will talk about Vinnie Johnson.

494
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,310
We'll talk about Bella check walking
off at the end of the Superbowl, uh,

495
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,790
when we were undefeated and then we
weren't, but that was also the same thing.

496
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,560
That was embarrassing as a patriots fan
to watch that it will be a fucking man y

497
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,690
cross. They beat you. Yeah.
Hey, congratulations. You
about it. Then you won't go.

498
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,100
Yeah, yeah, that's switching. But I dunno,

499
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,560
it's just that reminded me of the
University of Miami one where the cow is

500
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,090
brutal, where they just go and like, you
know, the whole country afraid of us.

501
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,670
I was like, dude, I was in a professional
football city. I don't even remember.

502
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,080
I remember hearing you guys were doing
things, but I wasn't sitting by my phone.

503
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:25,290
Shivering. I know it's a
football team. Oh God. Yeah.

504
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,180
So I told him off on a rant. So
Dan Marino? No, that's funny.

505
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:34,340
The enforcers, how they'll say it's a
mental game, just trying to get a mental,

506
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:35,280
it's like,
Oh really?

507
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:39,450
So Bob Probers and McSorley had that
little mental edge where they were just

508
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:43,240
like, hit you with a stick over
that Colbert problem or was good.

509
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:47,000
That's not the right one. Yeah, he's
the wrong guy. Die By the way. Yeah.

510
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,750
So they all died one time.

511
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,590
I know we can tell sports stories and I
got to remember all the names I played

512
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,740
in this hockey tournament cause I, you
know, I wrote those mighty ducks movies.

513
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm like, yeah, well you know I
created that hockey team. Cut me out.

514
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:05,660
I'll get the mental edge
at all. Nice. I am dirty.

515
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:08,440
My favorite player is Kenny Lindeman.
So don't fuck with me though.

516
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,060
I'll fucking hook you in ways you didn't
even know. Could you could be hooked in.

517
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:17,460
Yeah, but that guy, I don't
consider it was like a dirty plan.

518
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,890
That's awesome. Do you think
that he was so dirty? Feet dirty?

519
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,100
Shippy dirty this Chinos Sorelli

520
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,810
but then there's blow your knee out and
your career that really like Matt Cook.

521
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,630
Oh as he calls it, finishing
his checks. Oh yeah.

522
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,230
Fucking hunter.
Uh Oh damn hundred Jesus Christ.

523
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,720
That guy should have gone
out on the ice with a sickle.

524
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,800
That guy who's like literally like
a sociopath when he would do shit.

525
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,680
What was the scariest thing about
him is when you looked at him,

526
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:54,220
when he was in the penalty box,
there wasn't an ounce of remorse.

527
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,260
The comfort that I take with
a lot of those guys, cause
they have that, you know,

528
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:02,230
look, I did what I had to do. That
Bill Romanowo ski kind of thing.

529
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,990
All you do is you're just like,

530
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,110
thank God they're not working in a
corporation that has some stuff that they

531
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:13,150
need to get rid of was
because those guys would,

532
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,260
with their helmet hockey helmet on, would
pour it into the drinking water course.

533
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,570
I'm going a little big here, but no,
it's, it's, yeah, it's like frightening.

534
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,120
Yeah. Anyway, she were in New
York City with Dan Marino.

535
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:26,830
It's about four o'clock in the morning.
Somehow.

536
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:30,730
You have a football after a Knicks game.
Got To toss it around in the street.

537
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:34,720
He had just retired in the, uh, you
wanted to chuck it. He's the best guy.

538
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,950
Cause he's like, I want to throw, I want
to chuck it. Or you just like throw it.

539
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:42,790
I love throwing to, there's no
better feeling. And uh, yeah,

540
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:47,750
after next outside the region, uh,
the, the hotel and uh, whatever.

541
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,540
I'm upper east side took us 60,

542
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,050
64th street or something like that and
there's nobody really on the streets.

543
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,430
And Dan Marino was out there.
Yeah,

544
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,840
just throwing balls that look like painted
like a punt and you're running under

545
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,950
pressure sneakers, sneakers. But uh, yeah,

546
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:06,910
there's nothing like a
pro athlete thrown ball.

547
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,850
It's just so different. I mean, I
can throw a spiral in something,

548
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:13,180
but it's like just that then
right in your hands. So great. Oh,

549
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,860
it's literally cutting through the
end. Oh yeah. Yeah. Have you, Oh,

550
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:18,280
you've been out on the sideline and stuff.
You see the difference?

551
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:22,810
It's like sat close enough to the game.
Look Dude,

552
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,490
I'll go to like of division three,

553
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:28,420
college football game and you can blow
me away with my athletic abilities.

554
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:32,200
But like I did something earlier this
year for inside the NFL at the pro bowl

555
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,950
talking about my imdv page here, but
I saw 'em I'm not go well, you know,

556
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,420
I know all the old guys. I don't all
the young guys who, who, who's he?

557
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:44,960
Amazing athlete from Dez
Bryant. Yeah, I saw him.

558
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,860
Um, they were just basically doing like
some walk through practice, you know,

559
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:49,940
it's the pro bowl,
so you know,

560
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:54,130
the kind of joking around and stuff and
he was playing catch with somebody and

561
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,710
do, first of all the guys
like physique was like,

562
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,920
I couldn't draw a guy in
better shape. Does Brian? Yeah,

563
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,680
he looked like a superhero, right? Yeah.

564
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,300
And they're throwing the
ball to him and he was,

565
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,290
he was kind of letting it almost go past
him and then he was just reaching down

566
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,360
and catching it.
Yeah.

567
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:15,350
The way I would like a balloon that was
floating through slowly is catching a,

568
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,660
yeah,
like three quarters speed football.

569
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,650
He would catch it and then he did this
thing that almost looked like a butterfly

570
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:25,820
knife. Right. He would flip it around
and it would be in the throwing position.

571
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,820
It would go around the back of his hand
that says front of the Senate and in the

572
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:33,560
same motion he was bringing it back and
we'd zip it back to this says could this

573
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:37,700
little bald white guy coach it would
you know you saw the pain every time you

574
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,500
caught. I know Dez is catch and I just
saw that these guys, they have big hands,

575
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:45,800
but that's one thing I must say. I
go, they're great athletes and stuff,

576
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:50,040
but when you have huge mitts and you've
shows Shite shuck in these guys' hands,

577
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,510
that helps. I don't have big hands.
I'm not saying I could have been a pro,

578
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,470
but I think it's the only
thing that stop gestures.

579
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:57,620
Like I read your scout raging bull,
raging bull.

580
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,540
I think this is what it
was because I had my hands.

581
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,720
He had hands like a little
girl or a baby or something.

582
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,320
That's why I could never be a heavyweight
fighter. But I, yeah, I, my hands have,

583
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,810
have, have totally kept me back
in many ways. They're not huge.

584
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,350
What age did they stop growing?
Things stop growing when
I stop growing, you know,

585
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,480
in about 20 but whatever, it makes
a difference. I mean hockey too.

586
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,360
You ever play like,
you know someone who has big hands,

587
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:22,270
they hold the sticky
keys and feel and put,

588
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,220
I don't have the leverage
that if only I had, I was,

589
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,860
I was a big kid the fullest right
up until about fourth grade. Right?

590
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,960
Like I was supposed to be born June 10th,

591
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,560
1968 I was born June 24 19 I was like,
no.

592
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,980
I came out through,
I was like a 10 pound baby.

593
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,200
There's not one cute picture of Moma.

594
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,020
Irish was the same size of giant white.

595
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,680
I look like I should have been walking
through a little city just knocking shit

596
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:49,400
down.

597
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,230
I wrote that baby fat till about fifth
grade plus I stayed back in first grade,

598
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:55,490
so I had an extra year on people.

599
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,090
Then around sixth grade there was always
that kid who caught puberty, you know,

600
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:01,340
a couple of times where you have all
of a sudden guys are getting like peach

601
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,210
fuzz in the eighth grade.

602
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:04,640
And like I was a late bloomer
and then after that I was like,

603
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:08,760
I better stop being more funny or
now so I was, I was never a, uh,

604
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,990
a force to be reckoned with
after fourth or fifth grade.

605
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,090
Once the NERF football
was out of the game. Um,

606
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,660
it's like when they
took away the red line,

607
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:19,370
I was just too slow for
the whole phone thing.

608
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,550
So did you start skating at a young
age? Was that your thing? No, no.

609
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:24,150
I actually didn't take the game up.
Uh,

610
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,980
like getting pads and actually really
trying to get good at it until I moved out

611
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:31,610
here. Oh really? Yeah, because
you know, you've got to come
up from a hockey family,

612
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,180
you're going to get up at four in
the morning, 4:30 AM last time.

613
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,250
Cutting up orange slices
and shit, whatever the fuck
it is they do. And uh, my,

614
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,080
my family was Midwest people that
moved. Oh. So they were more, uh,

615
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,740
you know, baseball, football,
yeah. Not even like basketball,
baseball, football. Yeah.

616
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,540
So, um, oh, so you play
hockey out here now? I, we,

617
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,080
we had a great group of guys like
comics that were playing. Oh yeah.

618
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,490
And um, and I was, I was the
guy who organized in the game.

619
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:04,980
I got a little busy on the road and
then somebody else took it over.

620
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,401
And you know,

621
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:08,580
what happened was a bunch of people heard
about it and at first it started off

622
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:11,430
was fucking like bad news bears,
right. I was out there, I had a helmet,

623
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:15,060
gloves and skates sets it. And
like, I was falling on the ice,

624
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,450
like getting bruised so bad. They
weren't showing up for like three days.

625
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,210
I'd be in the shower and I sudden look
like somebody came the back of my fucking

626
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:25,020
fight. And so then I, you
know, I started like, you know,

627
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:28,410
I bought all this stuff and then
everybody was all suited up.

628
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,220
And what happened was all of a sudden
these rink rat started showing up.

629
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,570
Oh that game's sped up.
And everybody who sucked,

630
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,740
stop coming. Right? Saying
it wasn't fun. That's,

631
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,860
I was the only guy I stuck it out
and I went from being apoe, apoe,

632
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,120
shitty to the word immediately,
like the worst.

633
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,410
Why are you even, I mean I look literally
like a fan that ran out on the ice.

634
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,850
Like that's how much slower I was.

635
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,050
But I did learn to change direction
pretty quickly because every time when I

636
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,480
would finally catch up with everybody,
we've been going the other way.

637
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:05,200
So I learned how to stop on both sides.
I burned a lot of calories first.

638
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:08,110
Well there is nothing more fun
that even if you're bad at hockey,

639
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:13,111
because I played it as a kid and then
moved out here in 86 or something.

640
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:20,380
And then the Gretzky got traded down here
and I became a hockey fan again cause

641
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:22,840
we would go to the games and hang out.
We had nothing else to do.

642
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,460
We go to the Games and then I remembered,

643
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:27,430
I used to skate as a kid and I loved it.

644
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:30,640
And I lived in Culver city and there was
a skating rink literally a mile away.

645
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,110
And I live with this. That's closing down,
you know, I know, I know. That sucks.

646
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,050
That was my place. I live
with this guy, Pete Berg,

647
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:42,190
this director acting now and I lived
together and we just got Wahlberg movie,

648
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:46,930
right? Yeah, yeah. Lone survivor. We
were amazing. Yeah. We were loser.

649
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,620
Nothing to do or we just go to the skating
rink and skate around in circles all

650
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:53,830
day because he was from New York and
we used to play pee wee and it was like

651
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:57,110
fucking, what's that movie
where they skated around and
walked around and serve a

652
00:37:57,111 --> 00:38:00,340
midnight express.
That's how we spent our days.

653
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,430
Like just go into the circle and going,
what are you doing in la?

654
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:08,140
And then kids like free air
conditioning too. That's also true.

655
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,380
It was a middle of the summer in Culver
City, California and no prospects,

656
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:17,340
nothing. And, uh, so we
started skating again and uh,

657
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,620
that inspired me to do
mighty ducks doing that.

658
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,330
Like seeing kids come in
like little fucking, uh,

659
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,650
rink rats would come in and I was like,
Ooh,

660
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,700
I want to know where to
move you about kids' hockey.

661
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:29,040
I used to play kid's hockey and
that's how that all started.

662
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,050
And so I got into hockey that way.

663
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:34,530
Then all those movies and I got to
fulfill every hockey dream in the world,

664
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:34,771
you know,

665
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:39,190
cause you might x became a franchise of
a hockey team that I named and then I

666
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,490
just took advantage of
everything I got to go.

667
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,300
And they went from ducks to mighty ducks?
No.

668
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,920
What do you mean it was the
other way around? Sorry.

669
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,420
Yeah, it was a little upset because
uh, yeah, no, I liked, I actually,

670
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:53,590
when they first made it mighty ducks,

671
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:56,650
I thought that was stupid
because I was a sports fan first.

672
00:38:56,651 --> 00:39:00,700
Even though it was my name, I was like,
I totally understood. I go, really?

673
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:02,500
That's so the mighty ducks.

674
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:06,580
I loved it as the franchise and the name
and I had to suit Disney for doing what

675
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:10,690
they did. But when as a
hockey purists and then, yeah.

676
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,550
And you suit Disney,

677
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,170
you at super bowl 13 high selling
hotdogs to Ted Kennedy. Yeah.

678
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,920
Yeah. Tempt me. Which never
happened a lot by the way.

679
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:26,550
I remember he gave me like $2 and
it was a dollar fraud or 75% tip.

680
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,800
Yeah, no, of course. Yeah, that was cool.
So, uh, what, what else? Your resume,

681
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,080
you played catch with Dan Marino
and played hockey with, you know,

682
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,810
everyone you can imagine
faced off against Gretzky.

683
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,190
Yeah, I did that. But listen to this,

684
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,810
I played in the last game in the Boston
Garden in a celebrity hockey match

685
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:47,830
before they tore it down.

686
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:50,980
It just happened to be like the last
thing they did in the Boston Garden was a

687
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:55,981
stupid celebrity hockey match with us
against no way against the old Bruins,

688
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:57,940
like the alumni Bruins,

689
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:01,510
which is a very active organization
to like the flyers that Bruins.

690
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,160
And so we sat in the Bruins locker room,
me and the stupid celebrities,

691
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:08,260
I'm barely a celebrity
because of the hockey thing.

692
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:10,060
I was able to suck up to it and become,

693
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,320
and I had Bobby or come in and give
us a speech, uh, in the locker room.

694
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:15,580
He was making fun of it,

695
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,610
but he started giving us a speech about
how he to go out there and fucking kick

696
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:21,250
ass and everything.
And he, he got into it.

697
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,570
Everyone was drunk as shit and we went
out and played against the Bruins alumni.

698
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,630
Oh, you told me that everyone was dying
laughing like, oh you always hilarious.

699
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:31,900
Same Week. We got to win this
period. Yeah. It was the best.

700
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,810
And I had a shootout against
Reggie Lanolin, et cetera.

701
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:38,770
Ice with the place was packed to lost
the garden and I scored and I swear he,

702
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,640
Reggie was trying, he stacked the
pads on. I went, okay. So that was it.

703
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:46,690
That was my favorite experience of all
my, yeah, put that on a resume. Jesus.

704
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:51,670
Craigo yeah, I could win an academy
award. Well, not likely, but if I did,

705
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:56,230
I liked the lovely Forrest Gump,
like slash make a wish life dude.

706
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,510
That's, yeah. It's fun to be able to do
those things. Yeah. That's the best part.

707
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,190
Yeah. Jesus. Steve. Yeah. And
I don't know. I don't know
where to go from here. Well,

708
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,190
we don't have to go anywhere.

709
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,490
I think it goes back or go
home and watch Wonka shame.

710
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,990
I think that's absolutely brilliant.
I hope more movies do that. They are,

711
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,440
although I still love going to the
movie theater, uh, and I, you know,

712
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,690
a sentimental jackass. It'll upset me
because eventually, you know, I mean,

713
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,580
I don't know whether,
yeah. Eventually, you know,

714
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:28,870
that's going to be the way it's going to
be done. What? I just saw movies, I think,

715
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:29,411
I know,

716
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:32,590
I think to know that that's like saying
that everybody thought like the LP,

717
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,510
the vinyl was going to go away.
Yeah.

718
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,630
There'll be people there
always be hipsters and people
like that and sentimental

719
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,810
fools like me that will still
want to go to the movies. Yes.

720
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,510
And then bitch about people
talking and all that stuff.

721
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,630
And movie theaters are evolving
and will evolve into a,

722
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,790
I think a cool cooler experience. They
just will the, the seats and everything.

723
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,730
Other people,
I mean,

724
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:57,380
it was a great place to take when you
didn't have a license to take a girl and

725
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,920
being alone with it. Oh yeah. Right.
It was fucking awesome. Never. Yeah.

726
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:04,540
Are the balconies they had, you
can't watch it now, you know,

727
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,020
at your parents' house.
No,

728
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,500
but am I basically saying it's very hard
to go to third base at your sister's

729
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:14,310
house? They Sisters House Jesus
Christ girlfriend's house. Yeah.

730
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,130
Yeah. It's hard to go to third base and
movie theaters too. We can't end on that.

731
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,110
No. Okay. That's somebody
complaining. All right.

732
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,300
Anyways, listen to it. I, uh, I had such
a good time, whether I'm in it or not,

733
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,140
you're totally in any out or not or
whether it's fucking hilarious whether you

734
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:36,380
were metaphorically saying, you know,
you're talking about your grandmother,

735
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:38,960
but actually talking about
me that I was cut out.

736
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:42,770
I still had an awesome time and I got to,
got to meet some great people.

737
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,170
I just still, every once in a while
reach out to, uh, Ethan play. God,

738
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,670
he's fucking hilarious. So, uh, all your
stuff's in there. I hope so. Yeah. Well,

739
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:55,250
whatever you yelling at the kid, nothing
funnier than bill burr yelling at a kid.

740
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:58,610
Shut the fuck up. Yeah. Right there.

741
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,770
That's probably the biggest
selling point to my lists of stone.

742
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,430
So great to see you again. Let's
take the women out here and we'll go.

743
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,910
We will at some point. All right.
All right. That is the, uh, the,

744
00:43:07,911 --> 00:43:11,420
the bonus episode of the Monday morning
podcast. Thank you so much for listening.
