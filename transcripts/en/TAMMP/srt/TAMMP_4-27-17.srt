1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,440
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:07,120
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast Dan. Huh?

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,640
Just checking in on you. I'm just
checking in on you. How are Ya?

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,740
How's it going? I'm actually doing great
despite the, uh, that cough I just did.

5
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,230
There wasn't a real cough. I
just, you know, I've, I've,

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,440
I've run out of unique ways to
say I'm just checking in on you.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,680
I tried to do it a little bit
differently and I, I got nothing left.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,140
I don't know what you want from
me. Um, anyway, so let's get on.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,530
Let's get on with the podcast here.
You know, this is just a quick one.

10
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,270
This isn't even an official podcast,

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,460
despite the fact that I have
fucking advertising on it.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,580
It's not an official one.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is me just poking my head into a
little office into your little cubicle and

14
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:56,130
your living room. If you're unemployed or
maybe a, you're living off a trust. Yeah,

15
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:00,570
it's a great big shout out to anybody
just sitting around living off a trust.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,250
You know,
what are you going to do today?

17
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:05,920
And I go down to the art store
and get yourself an Easel,
you know, little canvas,

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,770
Duck Payton. That's what people do. You
know, when you're like super fucking rich,

19
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:15,280
there's no reason for you to go outside.
There's no, there's no fucking reason. I,

20
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:19,970
I really can't stand when people judge,
you know,

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,890
trust fund babies.
I feel that's like one of the,

22
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,830
one of the biggest issues that this
country is dealing with right now.

23
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:30,630
We see harsh judgment of
trust fund babies, you know,

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,180
I mean,
anybody can be fucking broke.

25
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:35,760
It'd be like Lou that rich can't just
sitting over there doing nothing.

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,350
What a waste. What a waste of
a fucking life, you know? Well,

27
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,560
let me tell you this. She was subway
sandwich sheet and judgmental. Fuck.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,640
Let me ask you this. If you were in
that situation, what would you be doing?

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,151
Because I can tell you what,

30
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:53,610
I will be doing the exact same fucking
thing and all you fucking people on your

31
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,444
high horse.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,170
No. Do what I could do it. You know,
I one of those people, you know,

33
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,700
people know this.
People know me.

34
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,700
I have to wake up with a purpose.
If I don't have a purpose in life,

35
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,340
shut the fuck up your bills.
All right?

36
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,250
That's what you're doing and you're
walking out the door and you chasing the

37
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:13,600
fucking Keratin. Some someday you're
dreaming. You dream that that care,

38
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:18,350
it's not going to be there. You want
to be that diesel guy. You know?

39
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,230
Look at George Bush,
man.

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,630
Do you ever see a guy enjoying not
being president more than that guy?

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,750
He's actually good at what he does. He's
not a trust fund baby either, by the way.

42
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm just saying,
you know he's actually good at it.

43
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,440
Just sits there.
I wonder what he thinks about it.

44
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,870
There's no way to be present
when you leave as president.

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,110
You have dead bodies on your conscience.

46
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,310
Whether you made the right
decision or the wrong decision.

47
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:49,250
At some point you had to shoot off
some missiles because who's kidding?

48
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:52,910
Who America is the world's babysitter.

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,680
Okay?
We know what we know what's best for you,

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,633
okay?

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,580
And what is best for you is to do what
we say and give us your natural resources

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,050
as we pretend to care about your people.

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,790
Okay?
It's like a lifetime movie.

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,540
Everybody's acting like
something special's happening
at the end of the day was

55
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,860
wasn't that really just a bunch of
shit so he could fucking make money?

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,500
Isn't that what it was?
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

57
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,220
I'm talking about trust fund babies
and I'm sick of the judgment of him.

58
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,500
Who judges a baby, first of
all, kind of a fucking person.

59
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:37,320
You maybe that's why God didn't give
you money. You have to think about that.

60
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's called Karma.

61
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,910
Isn't that the most
overused talking expression?

62
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,610
Karma isn't. My theory on Karma.
Karma gets you. Unless you,

63
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,090
unless you don't give a fuck.
If you don't give a fuck in Utero,

64
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,890
if you truly don't give a shit,

65
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,910
you got to have like a level of guilt
for common to come back and bite you in

66
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:03,630
the ass. But if you just some fucking
entitled Con Yeah, those people,

67
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:08,570
they'd skate through life.
You know? You ever see him?

68
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,300
You ever seen entitled can
just walk across the room.

69
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,210
It's like he has those little kids shoes
on. Then they had the wheels on them.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,240
You know, they take two steps.
They just glide across the room.

71
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,950
They don't care about breaking hearts.
They don't care about evicting people.

72
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,280
Right.
They don't give a shit who fucking,

73
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:28,940
so their shirt together that out.

74
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,160
What does that endangered species
throw it on the grill. They don't care.

75
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,530
You know there's a genius to that. Just
not giving a shit. You know what I mean?

76
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,940
I'd love to see one of those people,

77
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,570
you know in the afterlife
if you have to get,

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,160
if you actually get judged just to
see the fucking look in the face,

79
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:46,820
you know what I mean?

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,300
And then God at some point would have
to feel some sort of shame being like,

81
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:53,990
well you know, at the end of the day I
assembled that. You know what I mean?

82
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,740
That's what I've never understood about
the judgment. It's just like, you know,

83
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:02,741
especially with these fucking sociopath's
as opposed to the levelheaded saint

84
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:07,370
that I am, these fucking, these
fucking sociopath's out there.

85
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,450
Like, where does, you
know, shouldn't, you know,

86
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,340
shouldn't you be judging God on that one?
Gingy be looking up like really,

87
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,370
you know,
what were you doing blow last night

88
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,180
if forgot to put the a I give a shit
about other people assembly into this one.

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,470
It just fucking Senate it out
there. I Dunno. The more I,

90
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,960
I vaguely pay attention to
all that space shit. You know,

91
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,900
I hate people who are in this space
by the way. There was talking about,

92
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:43,800
do you understand just
Neutrogena? It's like, yeah,

93
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,810
I get it. I get it in ourselves.
Understand as we fucking, we've, we've,

94
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:50,170
we've seen how gigantic it is
yet we haven't found anything.

95
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,300
So I still think this
place is pretty amazing.

96
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,920
It's fascinating is Mars
is this does nothing to do.

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,770
Yeah.

98
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,830
I don't understand these fucking people
that want to go to Mars and live there

99
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:03,180
and it's like,
and do what?

100
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,653
Huh?

101
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,450
Living some fucking strip mall
for the rest of your life.

102
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,490
Some star trek looking strip mall,

103
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,530
fucking drinking Tang. Just,
you can say, Oh yeah, you know,

104
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,380
that's your big fucking move that you
know, people want to live on Mars.

105
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,640
That means they suck at everything else in
life. Right. They got nothing. You know,

106
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,610
you know what it is. You graduate high
school, you want to come back someday,

107
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,350
right. And smoking a big
cigar going, hey, you know,

108
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,060
yeah, I was that guy used to push around
the playground, but you know what I did,

109
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,830
right? I went to, I did things,

110
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,720
I did digs and now I smoke this and
I drive dad and see that over there.

111
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:48,230
That's fucking me. Admitted it. I met her.

112
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,930
So usually in this day and age, that means
you're going to try to create an APP,

113
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,310
right? You got no Fuckin, I
don't know, get some sort of,

114
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:06,311
you start a website where you
curate videos and fucking news.

115
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,560
I don't know what these fucking
millennials do, but I think if you,

116
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,360
if you suck at that,
right?

117
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,420
If you can't play an instrument
and you ego could not just handle,

118
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,270
just being happy with what you have.

119
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,940
I think at that point it's like I can't
just go back to my high school reunion.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,610
Okay.

121
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,280
Just being at some regular Joe.

122
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:30,670
Okay.

123
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,520
Waking up in the morning,
putting my coffee and my thermos.

124
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,750
Okay.

125
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,750
Going into the shower and quietly crying
was the water cascades over my face and

126
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,790
my wife comes walking in and going
and you are right. Just be like, yeah,

127
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,590
he just was, I just sneezed.
I'm fine. Squashing my phone,

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,070
my phone.
I think at some point,

129
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,520
either you just fucking give in
and just say, hey man, you know,

130
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,830
being a regular guy, he's kind
of fucking cool, you know,

131
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,330
or you can't handle it right there.
Remind me.

132
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:07,040
I've never seen a few good men.
You get the truth. You know,

133
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,520
there's too many, too much gritten a teeth
in that movie. That's right. Ice Man.

134
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,590
I am dangerous. Right. Too much of
that shit. So I never watched it.

135
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,560
You know which people walking
around dressed in fucking then

136
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,780
little navy suit. Um, anyways,

137
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,640
if you can't fucking handle it and
you gotta go back to high school,

138
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,500
you and you've got to do something.
And I think at that point,

139
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,280
that's when you just say, listen,
I, I, I got to live on Mars.

140
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,900
I mean, I can't go back with nothing.
I got to have something to say.

141
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:39,020
That's like Lance Bass,
he couldn't handle that.

142
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,910
Justin Timberlake walked away from,
from in sync.

143
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,890
Right. Ah, dad way or
whatever the fuck they saying.

144
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,290
That's not where they all all
acted like puppets. Right.

145
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,880
He just fucking walked away, you
know. And you've got the one guy,

146
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,420
the goatee guy,
he's got a sense of humor about himself.

147
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:02,330
He makes all these funny
commercials. They'll do a
thing. He doesn't give a fuck.

148
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,000
Right.
You've got the dreadlock guy.

149
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,070
Did he used to bang Jennifer Aniston or
was that the other guy who's some white

150
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:13,340
guy with dreadlocks? She used to go
out with Jennifer Aniston, you know,

151
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,420
every one of those beautiful
celebrities always dates a guy.

152
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,300
And he always have that, that, that
really, you got that moment like, wow,

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,860
why didn't I learn how to write fucking
play the Ukulele and wear flip flops?

154
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:29,320
That's what I had to do. Fucking walking
around with your guardian. Mantage um,

155
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,740
anyways, sorry. And I think lance couldn't
handle it. He's just like, what the fuck?

156
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,200
You know? So then our
next thing, you know,

157
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,050
he's signing up to go out and
space to somehow try and outdo. Oh,

158
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,840
what'd you put you put out in
future sexy songs? Huh? Wait,

159
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,600
wait, wait. Right, wait,
wait. Where man man,

160
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,940
I'm going to outer space.
What?

161
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,960
Oh, what is it about wearing your pajamas
in the middle of the day? That just,

162
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:07,460
it just fucking opens your mind up.
You know what I mean? I swear to God,

163
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,720
there is no free of feeling there'd be
an a white male heterosexual still in

164
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:17,520
your pajamas at 11 o'clock in the
morning on a weekday, on a weekday.

165
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,070
And you know what, because I'm a liberal
con, I want everyone to experience that,

166
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,560
you know, all the people
in the Phillip Pace. Um,

167
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,430
anyways, uh, I'm actually,

168
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:34,060
I'm in a giddy mood cause I did something
yesterday that scared the living shit

169
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:37,840
out of me and I didn't die, which
is all, you know, obviously,

170
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:42,760
because I'm doing this podcast. So,
you know, I hadn't flown a helicopter,

171
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,400
uh,
since like October until this month.

172
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:48,790
And I flew for the first time and I could
not believe how fucking rusty I was.

173
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,240
How much? Just Shit. You forget.
You're like, what? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

174
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,910
Oh yeah, that's right. You know,

175
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,090
turn a bass tournament final.
I didn't even slow down.

176
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,410
Yeah,

177
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,880
I was so busy trying to keep the fucking
pad between the compass, you know,

178
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,490
and the Dashboard Day,
I can't remember what the fuck he call it,

179
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,440
the control panel that I forgot.

180
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:14,640
I was still doing like 65 knots
and I fucking went right by it.

181
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,490
I had to slam on the brakes.
Right. So, but you know,

182
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,430
I flew around, she'll kick off to Russia,
he's coming around, it's coming around,

183
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,300
you know,
so I went,

184
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,530
I went again yesterday and uh,

185
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,530
went up with my instructor and he was
like, so what do you want to do? I said,

186
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,050
all right, let's do the pattern.
Let's fly the traffic pattern.

187
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:38,130
Let's do some auto sets where they
simulate a main rotor failure.

188
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,080
That's the big fan above your head.
Like,

189
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,470
what if all of a sudden the
engine cuts up, you know, um,

190
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,100
and then those kicks left. What do you
do? You slammed the collective down,

191
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:51,780
you add right pedal, right trim, air
speed, rpm. Here come the rpms coming up,

192
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:54,710
you pull the collective up, he catch the
fucking things, you pick out your spot.

193
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,720
So we were doing those and at some point
I was just like, all right, fuck this.

194
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,750
Okay. Um, I,

195
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:05,420
I have to fly this thing by myself
or solo is they saying the business,

196
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:09,110
but I'm just a novice. So I said,
all right. He goes, well, okay,

197
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,210
we did a couple of those. He goes,
what do you want to do now? And I said,

198
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:12,200
all right, can, uh,

199
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,910
can you just step out and let me just
fly this thing around one time by myself

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,500
just to do it again? And he goes,
yeah, absolutely. So he steps out it.

201
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,600
Up until that point, it'd
been a great day. You know,

202
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,230
not a lot of traffic over there.
Everything's fucking fine. So he gets out,

203
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,010
roll it back up. You know, lights are out.

204
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:35,010
Our PM's are in the green gauges.
Roe, green carburetor heats up.

205
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,890
I fucking lift up light on the skids,
bring it up,

206
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,960
holding our heart right here we go. Here
we go. Cycling, wait for it. Wait for it.

207
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,600
Less weight in the flux. Thank
you. No fucking palms are sweating.

208
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
You know there's always that.
Dot.

209
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:54,670
I can't believe I actually fucking know
how to do this thing right. Immediately.

210
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:58,500
There's a fucking crosswind. So
I'm looking at the wind sock. La,

211
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,990
you fucking content. Fight
it. Left pedal. Now I'm, I'm,

212
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,770
I'm facing once everything's fine.
And next thing you know,

213
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:09,710
like fucking like three jet blue's I taken
off at southwest is landing. You know,

214
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,780
I made my call and the guy's like, you
know, whatever. Fucking six Victor Hotel.

215
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,860
Standby.
Standby means shut the fuck up.

216
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:20,220
I always forget that cause then I always
go six strict to hotel standing by.

217
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,320
So I'm fucking sitting there. I'm, I felt
like I was in a Harvard for 20 minutes.

218
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,420
Yeah.
What I really wanted to have happen.

219
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,240
It was just like one of those things
where it's like, all right, fuck this.

220
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm feeling this rolled out, have
him step out. I fucking roll back up,

221
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,230
lifted off.
As for clarity,

222
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,630
gives it to me and I just take
it for a lap around the airport.

223
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:46,800
That's all I wanted to do. So now I'm
fucking sitting in this harbor just going,

224
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,090
Jesus Christ.
Now I'm thinking,

225
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,760
what the fuck am I doing?
Okay.

226
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,320
So finally he called. Good guy.

227
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:03,940
Fuck goes six Richter hotel la left
closed traffic of clear for takeoff.

228
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:07,980
Clever take off six Victor Hotel.
And then I uh, I fucking, you know,

229
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,740
took off, brought it around and when
I was turning across, when, you know,

230
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:13,690
I'm looking for traffic
to join the downwind,

231
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,190
make sure I don't have any problems. How
was actually thinking like, you know,

232
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,930
last night I did stand up dressed as
Steven Adler at the goddamn comedy jam.

233
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,330
I tried out a new fucking bit about
blow up dolls that was killing so hard.

234
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,560
I looked over and Josh,

235
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:33,590
Adam Meyers was fucking dying laughing
on the side of the stage. It's so,

236
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:35,540
as much as you make people laugh,
when you look over,

237
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,440
when you see a fellow comedian die and
laugh and you know you're on to something.

238
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,460
So then I went back and I got to play
Rhino sore dressed as Steven Adler sound,

239
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,710
the sound guy. Now I would have dressed up
as Matt camera, but he's just, you know,

240
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,080
he doesn't have any unique facial hair.
He's got that sort, that Luke haircut.

241
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,400
I just would've looked like me with
this stupid way gone, you know. Um,

242
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,930
and then I got to play the encore
paradise city and I was thinking,

243
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:04,230
I fucking did that. I did stand
up and play drums live last night.

244
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,920
It right now I am flying
a helicopter by myself

245
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,300
and I flunked so much shit in high school,
terrible at math,

246
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,020
fucking flood French,
all of that shit

247
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,760
was a great feeling. And I was
like, Oh yeah, that's right.

248
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,340
I'm flying a helicopter so I
get to the downwind, you know,

249
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,110
where'd you go across three zero. He
brings you fucking carburetor. Heat up.

250
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,660
See if you're fucking carburetor.
Does it freeze over in the engine?

251
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:38,010
Doesn't cut out as you slowing down.
Came around and still pulling power.

252
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:41,490
Kept my 60 knots is I turned
the fucking base in the file.

253
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,170
K Ryden landed,
shut the thing down nicely.

254
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,070
And uh, they're, my instructor
came back in and he gets, you know,

255
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:54,450
plugs his headphones in. He goes,
he goes, uh, how did that feel?

256
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,620
I said, I, you know, I said it was like
riding a bike except you could kill you.

257
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,633
Selfless.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,833
I started laughing.

259
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,410
And what I've found with instructors
is they're all bad ass guys.

260
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,980
Every one of them chicks, they're all
fucking bad ass. This is, you know,

261
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,670
but the second you admit that you're
actually scared. They always laugh.

262
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,530
And then they usually tell you a story
how fucking nervous that they were.

263
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:19,000
But if you have some fucking cocky cunt,
um,

264
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,560
you don't want to do that.

265
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:23,120
Cause then what they're
gonna do is they're going to
chop throttle on you as you

266
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,000
fucking doing some say, hey,
yeah, I don't, I don't need that.

267
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,080
Even though it's good training. I've
never had anybody do that to me. Um,

268
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,240
but anyway,
so I did it and it made me feel

269
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,180
fucking amazing math. She's
like the sickest goddamn
feeling and I swear to God,

270
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,330
all I need to do is make
like another $40 million.

271
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:43,660
And I think I could actually afford
to truly engage in that hobby.

272
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,900
I in La,
it's just super expensive.

273
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,550
I think if you live more
in the middle of nowhere,

274
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,650
the big fucking thing is like just
storing the goddamn whatever you get the

275
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,720
plane or the helicopter.
Um,

276
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,570
I don't know if anybody knows like a
cheap way to do it. I would absolutely,

277
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,210
uh, at an absolutely
do it. But until then,

278
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm just treating it like the way I
treat cars. Like I just go on the road,

279
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,440
you know, I go to budget
and then that's it. I just,

280
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:19,720
whatever fucking car they give me, I get
it. And I gotta be honest with you. I,

281
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,280
that's the one thing that bugs
me about renting helicopters.

282
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:25,460
And every time you fucking go in there,
eh, something's a little different.

283
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,990
You know, just be nice to
know you're fucking tail
number and not have to fucking

284
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:34,370
constantly be looking on the control
panel. Nowhere everything is no hour.

285
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,070
Everything works. Every radio
seems to be a little bit different.

286
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:41,140
It's just like a fucking, it's just an
extra thing. You got to like deal with it.

287
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:46,010
I wish I didn't then I'd love to just
buy one of those fucking art 20 twos,

288
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,410
you know, if they're funny as hell, they
just a little two seater, right? Any,

289
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:52,430
you're really flying.

290
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,880
It's like if you had a car that just
had drum brakes and no power steering,

291
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:59,380
like you really fucking,
you know, our holding up,

292
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,060
this is just what I've heard from other
pilots because I've never flown anything

293
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,610
fancy, nothing fancy. Like, um,

294
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,690
okay.

295
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,570
But I really fucking enjoyed it.
And uh, just even doing that,

296
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:11,050
I mean that how long it
takes to fly the pattern.

297
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,653
MMM.

298
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,620
I mean that couldn't
have been more than like,

299
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,700
okay.

300
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,690
Felt like 90 seconds. So probably, maybe
it was a little bit longer. I don't know.

301
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,550
But,
uh,

302
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,910
I dunno. It's just fucking definitely
left the place yesterday. You know,

303
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,970
that's one of those things where you'd
get did something great and you're

304
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,900
driving away and you got the window down.
Just drive when I go on.

305
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,920
So anyways, you guys been
watching the playoffs? Yeah,

306
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,990
I would say for first round playoffs.

307
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,410
I'll tell you the series I'm
watching obviously, and I'll say,

308
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,750
I'll tell you again, I'm just going
to keep saying, I'll tell you,

309
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,610
I'll tell you I'm watching those Celtics
in the Bulls Celtics are now up three

310
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:56,250
games to two after being down. Oh, too.

311
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,990
After looking like we had
no fucking answers. Right.

312
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,551
And uh,

313
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:07,551
which is why my nod for MVP of the
series is Rondo without a doubt.

314
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,550
Because the second he went down
the series just completely changed.

315
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,283
MMM.

316
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,510
And I thought all of the
Bulls had this figured out,

317
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,630
but evidently it was rando he
knew what the fuck was going on.

318
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:23,860
I'm giving him full fucking
credit because it's just,

319
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,440
it's been a tale of two cities.

320
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,620
You know,

321
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,680
it looked like they were going to sweep
us and now it looks like we're going to

322
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:36,910
run the table on them. However,
how I think Rhonda is coming back,

323
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,040
he took his cast off,
his suits,

324
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,490
have long sleeves again and um,

325
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,520
I can't wait to watch games.

326
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:49,300
Six I want to see like is this
guy is good is it appears in this,

327
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
in this series and a last night,

328
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:56,110
admittedly the officiating was a little
subpar and it definitely went in the

329
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:00,560
Celtics favor and I loved when Lopez
was applauding the fucking rough.

330
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:04,510
Sometimes it's worth getting a fucking
technical. I love that guy, man.

331
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,010
That guy comes out every night, wants
to play. He's a little fucking weird.

332
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,390
He's on his own vibe. He just, I, I
really liked that guy. I love what he,

333
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,620
it started clapping.

334
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,330
It's like my favorite thing.
And then they go to,

335
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:22,270
I think it actually worked
because then we went down,

336
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,560
they called the ticky tack fall on the
other end and you saw Dwayne Wade was

337
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:30,190
whatever the Celtics said to him. I
think it might've been, uh, Isaiah,

338
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,760
he just started smiling and
laughing. I swear to God, man,

339
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,450
I just think the NBA is
so fucking controlled.

340
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,310
Okay.

341
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,650
I really do. Just for the
simple fact that you can do it.

342
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:43,880
I've said this a zillion times,

343
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,030
there is no easier game to control or
fix than basketball cause it's the only

344
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:53,440
fucking game where you
can sit down as a ref.

345
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,310
You can take people out of
the game, you know? I mean,

346
00:20:57,311 --> 00:21:00,940
I guess all the Games you can eject
somebody, but they, you know, in baseball,

347
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:03,340
football, hockey, you
really have to do something.

348
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,340
You just can't point it a guy and be
like, hey, go sit on the fucking bench,

349
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,190
but gets you can and hockey.
Right.

350
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,620
I Dunno.
You know what?

351
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,520
That's one of those things where you
think you have a good theory and then you

352
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:21,080
fucking explore all the options.
You're like, well, maybe
it doesn't work, whatever.

353
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,860
No, but you only sit him down for like
fucking two minutes and they come back out

354
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:25,790
and it's not like,
well,

355
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,390
fucking Wayne Gretzky's
got three penalties to more
and he's out of the game.

356
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,350
Right? Hey, you got back on track
with my theory. There you go.

357
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,660
He can't sit Tom Brady down.
All you've got to like,

358
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,210
this is what kills me about basketball.

359
00:21:38,211 --> 00:21:42,780
I don't give a fuck how many points
you're up. You're up like 20 points.

360
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:47,390
He just like, Hey, this game's a Rep.
There's one quarter to go. You know,

361
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,980
most teams are lucky if they
score like 27 and a quarter,

362
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,540
that's like a fucking great quarter.

363
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,410
We're up by 20 all we really need to do
is score eight points and we're fine and

364
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:55,841
the next day.

365
00:21:55,841 --> 00:22:00,841
Now it's just like the fucking jerk offs
are on a 27 to run every fucking time.

366
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,680
That whole thing. It's a game
of runs. I don't think it is.

367
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:12,120
I think it's a game of fucking ratings
and if a team gets up too high,

368
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,730
they just start fucking cow colon
files together. Ah, that's stupid.

369
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,930
That's a stupid fucking theory. But
it does, it just appears that way.

370
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:23,070
Maybe it is the nature of the game
that nobody can just blow somebody out.

371
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,050
Okay.

372
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,910
They always come back,
like I would say like 85% of the time.

373
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,290
Of course I didn't do any research,

374
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,500
but you seem to 85% of the time he
fucking belt you go up by 30 points in the

375
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:38,910
first half, you know, somehow by the end
of the game, what? Oh, Hey, what else?

376
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:43,290
Sex. One of the most
unbelievable, improbable come back

377
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,550
since last night's fucking slew of NBA
Games into the exact same thing. Um,

378
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,670
anyways,
I don't want to talk about it.

379
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,630
All I'm saying is that I
think a Bronto really showed,

380
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,670
I mean, just, I mean it's
fucking unbelievable. Like
how much the series changed.

381
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:05,030
One guy is gone and the
whole thing turns around. Um,

382
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:08,920
so I'm excited to watch games
six, even if they win, that'd be,

383
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,240
I like seeing greatness. I don't give
a shit. I mean I hope it's on my team,

384
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,730
but if it isn't that I can't and I'm like,

385
00:23:14,731 --> 00:23:16,660
I can't just sit back and appreciate it.
Right.

386
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:17,890
Okay.

387
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,590
I tried to be a good guy, but for right
now, I don't know why I have this fucking,

388
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:25,030
this pillow that wraps around you,
this little half circle pillow,

389
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,780
you know when you have a baby abuse,
it's perfect. You set them down,

390
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,660
you give them that bottle of Jack, you
know, and then that's it. You know?

391
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,770
But if you try to do it with
regular pills, it doesn't work.

392
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:39,400
But for some reason I have it
around me right now. I don't know.

393
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,960
It feels right.

394
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,600
Like I don't wait to have a kid that
buy one of these fucking semi circle

395
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:47,510
pillows. Um, right. What else
did I want to talk about?
I've been watching, you know,

396
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,870
I've been watching the hockey.
Okay.

397
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,000
Gotten over the fact that my Bruins had
been knocked out by the quietest fan

398
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,060
based team in the league.
Right.

399
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,490
The team that sharing forgot until April.

400
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:08,060
Then all of a sudden they all show
up like they give a shit. Oh man,

401
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:12,650
that was fucking hard watching
that. Anyways, um, the
prejudice are looking great,

402
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,690
but I still think a, I don't even
if I already talked about this,

403
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:18,170
I started this podcast twice. I forget
if I brought this shit up. I still,

404
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:22,540
I'm still going with the penguins.
I think the penguins repeat. Uh,

405
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,250
and I Miss Anaheim Edmonton.
I bet that's a great fucking series too.

406
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,980
It's so crazy. They're already down
to just two series in each conference.

407
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,660
So I have to make sure that I'm watching,
um,

408
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,150
for those people last week you're like,
hey,

409
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:38,630
how come you didn't talk about Moto
GP, the race in Austin? You know what?

410
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:40,970
I didn't see it.
And uh,

411
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:44,290
then I realized I recorded it
and this is what you learn.

412
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:49,010
If you're new to moto GP and you go to
record the race and you got to fucking do

413
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,780
it.
It might,

414
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,040
it might be better than Formula One
just because of the sheer amount of like

415
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,820
passing in lead changes and all that.
It's fucking insane.

416
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,080
And then the fact he just watched
these guys falling off motorcycles.

417
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,190
I brought one of the races. Um,
well let me explain it first.

418
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,140
You're going to go to record it.
If you novice like me,

419
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:13,430
you go to record it and you'll be watching
like the first race and it will say

420
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:16,430
Modo too when they're on these little
skinny bicycle tires and you're like,

421
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,240
those don't look like the fucking,
you know,

422
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,450
those Badass bikes that I saw.
What's going on here?

423
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,850
Then there's Modo three and you're like,
where does the real one,

424
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,590
who is that Rossi, Valentino Rossi
Guy, whatever the fuck his name is.

425
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,700
Uh, Mike and the mechanics,
whatever that other guy's name is.

426
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:38,750
I don't know any of the fucking name shed.
So there's three different classes.

427
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:40,850
This is what I learnt.
All right.

428
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,030
On Moto GP as they say.

429
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,370
And this model to,

430
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,490
there's modal three and there's moto GP
and that's basically like being in Aa

431
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,960
Aaa and then being in the majors.
Now for whatever reason,

432
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:58,850
modal three is the lowest level. So
I guess they go in three, two, one.

433
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,210
I guess that's how they do it. And
they don't say one, they just say GP,

434
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,370
which I believe stands for Grand Prix.
I don't fucking know.

435
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:08,330
So motor three is 250
cc according to this,

436
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:12,740
this thing on reddit air to 250 cc bike,
you know,

437
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,760
so that's basically a cubic centimeters.
So it's a smaller engine.

438
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,440
It's not as fast. You know, it's still
fast as shit the way they're doing it.

439
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,130
But you know, that's the one like, okay,
all right there grasshopper, we'll, we'll,

440
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,840
you know, we'll see how he'd do at
this level. And then if you, uh,

441
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,120
succeed at that level,
then they move you up to moto two,

442
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:36,740
which is 600 cc's evidently for strokes.
And all the engines are made by Honda,

443
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,420
which I find interesting. Um, so a haunt,

444
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:42,350
they're all Honda base.

445
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:47,351
Everybody's working the exact same shit
as probably so they can truly get an

446
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:51,510
idea of who, um, who is the best writer,

447
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:55,740
who's going to get called up to the show
moto GP. And according to this person,

448
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,540
a lot of times in Moto Moto to the race
is better because they all just have

449
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:04,370
basically the exact same engine.
So this guy was saying you could throw,

450
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,300
you can usually can throw a blanket over
the top three people in that race. Um,

451
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,460
and then the big show is moto
GP, which is a thousand CC's. Um,

452
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,890
and those things are just fucking rockets.

453
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,570
And I watched this whole
thing on how they build them.

454
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:22,560
The handbuilt gets how much
those motorcycles cost a
piece. Take a wild guess.

455
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,500
Like if for some reason you
went down, they said, hey,

456
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:28,080
you want to take it for a lap,
but if you fucking trash this thing,

457
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:32,310
you got to pay for it. Okay. And they give
you that fucking suit with the airbag.

458
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,630
And fortunately you don't,

459
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:37,580
high side of the slide off the bike and
you get up and be like a shit or second

460
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,030
it costs me. I would've thought
anywhere between 102 hundred 50 grant,

461
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,600
you know, and I understand that it's
a fucking racing bike and all that,

462
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,850
but you know,
they're a little less things.

463
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,860
Okay.

464
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,700
You know what I mean?
You go to to do a build on a car.

465
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,190
This is like fucking people
working on it on the other side.

466
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:59,420
He can't even see him a motorcycle.
I mean it's, it's right there.

467
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,860
Everything is right fucking there.

468
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,940
You want another guy can lift up
the engine and the shit is small.

469
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,590
If there was like a hundred, a hundred to
250 grand is what I would have guessed,

470
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,970
three 75 tops, right. This is like,

471
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:14,060
I'm at the showcase showdown
on the prices, right.

472
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,040
Ed I horrifically
underbid is what happens.

473
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,190
Those bikes cost $2 million each,

474
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,360
$2 million each. They're handmade. Um,

475
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,400
all this space age stuff. I watched
this whole thing on how they build them.

476
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:33,650
The gas tank is actually
underneath the seat.

477
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,670
What's where the gas tank usually is,
is the fuel injector.

478
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,240
There's an airport right in front of that,
right with the fucking front light.

479
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,031
Usually.
I just want to,

480
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:46,040
I watched the whole God damn thing
was absolutely fascinating and a,

481
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,280
I'm totally in on that sport watching
that sport and I'm watching the F one.

482
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,690
I don't know when the next races,
but uh, if you want to watch WWE,

483
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,790
I think it was a moto to race.
The last one,

484
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:59,840
this fucking guy came out of a turn is
backend started fishtailing and he went

485
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:04,730
like right up and over the handlebars
doing, I don't know how fast, I don't,

486
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:06,200
I don't get how they get up.

487
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,210
Okay.

488
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,040
Cause he,
he landed on like his foot,

489
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:13,760
he limped for a second and then he just
kinda just shakes it off. They're like,

490
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:17,360
Yay. You said foot problems
said foot problems in the past.

491
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:21,560
I'd imagine he'd had everything problems.
You fall off a bike.

492
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,680
You know, it's funny when I was thinking
about getting a motorcycle out here,

493
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:28,910
the stupidest thing you
could ever do, um, you know,

494
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:31,160
riding a fucking motorcycle and
how a lot of guys say, well,

495
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:34,790
you just fucking flew a helicopter.
It's, it's way safer wait state.

496
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,250
But there's nobody up there. I was
actually driving back. I was did, um,

497
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,960
mark Merrin's podcast promoting
season two of is for family.

498
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,580
I don't know when that's coming out.
Um,

499
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,050
and thank you to mark Marin for getting
me on his podcast. Had a great time.

500
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:52,520
We talked about anger, meditation, we
talk music and we help promote any,

501
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:56,570
help me promote the show.
And um, I was on my way back.

502
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,570
It was the middle of the day and all of
a sudden it was just all this horrific

503
00:29:59,571 --> 00:30:03,060
traffic and uh, this big
fucking accident, this,

504
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:06,800
this truck had jumped at medium strip.
I don't know if the guy at meetings strip,

505
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:10,220
I don't know if the guy fucking
fell asleep or whatever,

506
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:13,580
but 10 people went to the hospital,
one person died and a dog died,

507
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,570
you know, so I don't know.
I just think the highway is
way, way, way more dangerous.

508
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,450
I said it before,
you flying in formation,

509
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,660
it's like you're in the fucking
blue angels. Everybody's
doing 80 miles an hour.

510
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,570
There's no radio contact. Nobody
knows where anybody is fucking going.

511
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,380
There's people texting these
people on meds. You have no
idea. And then forget it.

512
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,440
And then right on the other side
is another group of fucking people.

513
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,460
You know,

514
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,260
this never ending parade of fucking
people flying on the other side.

515
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,040
You don't know what they're going to dope.

516
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,950
Okay.

517
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,100
That fucking guy was driving a truck,
fell asleep, had a heart attack,

518
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:51,100
whatever the fuck he
did jump the meetings.

519
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,250
Strip went right up and over into
oncoming fucking traffic at like,

520
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,000
it was like 12 in the afternoon. Do you
look it up? It's on was on the five right?

521
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:00,050
In your Colorado Boulevard.

522
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,793
MMM.

523
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,860
So anyways, so I was thinking about
getting a motorcycle when I was,

524
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:08,400
I was looking up those moto GP suits,

525
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,140
which are like 2,500 bucks a whack,

526
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,050
but they got a little air
bag in him and I'm like,

527
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:18,050
well that's what the fuck I would want.
Yeah.

528
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,020
It'd be hilarious to buy one of those and
then by like a fucking Harley Davidson

529
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:26,750
and just look like the biggest fucking
asshole ever. You just ride that thing.

530
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,780
If somebody cuts in front of you, you just
let it. But there's another thing too,

531
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,730
is on those,
when they're racing,

532
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,120
you can lay it down and slide and
fucking all that stuff and you're fine.

533
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,620
You're fine.

534
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,980
It's not like you can slide into oncoming
traffic and there's a good God damn

535
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,210
garbage truck coming at you.
Yeah.

536
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,853
MMM.

537
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,950
I Dunno. But I miss ride
motorcycles, so I'm taking a,

538
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,933
okay.

539
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,080
There's just nothing safe about
them. I was thinking, all right,

540
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:54,830
well I'll just get it right. Dark bike.
I won't go over jumps or anything.

541
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,710
I'll just ride some trails. But then
every year ever every like fucking, yeah,

542
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,350
I dunno.

543
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,790
It seems like every six weeks you hear
a story about somebody riding on a trail

544
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:03,870
choosing a mountain bike though.

545
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:07,980
But if you're riding like a dirt bike
at some mountain line ends up like

546
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:11,550
pouncing on your back. Just got
the helmet on. I don't know.

547
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,330
I don't, I, you know, at
this podcast is going great.

548
00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:17,760
It's just went off the rails somewhere.
I don't really know where. Let's,

549
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,900
let's do a little bit of, uh,
advertising. Indochino Jido

550
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:23,900
yeah,

551
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,710
the sting wreath.

552
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,710
The Gordon's Sumner read it Dope Chai
to talk about how every man looks better

553
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:35,900
in a suit. You know, when
I'm checking out guys at the,

554
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:39,770
at the outdoor mall, I'm like, you
know, I'm really attracted that guy,

555
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:42,380
but he's just wearing an Izod,
you know,

556
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,230
with some quarter Roy's, that's not my,
now look at that fellow wearing this suit.

557
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,160
Now there's something I could take home
to my parents that said, everybody,

558
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,720
if you're sick of gay men United giving
you the fucking once over or maybe

559
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:00,650
rolling their eyes, you ever think that
maybe it's not you fucking love handles.

560
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,320
Maybe it's the fact that
you don't have on a shirt,

561
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:07,400
a tie and a sport coat to cover up
all the mistakes you've made with you

562
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,590
nutrition over the last 40 years.

563
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,830
Thank God there's Indochino is making
it easy to get a perfectly tailored suit

564
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:16,940
and an incredible price.

565
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,130
You can choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

566
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,910
just the way you want, whether
it's for work, a wedding,

567
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,230
or another special occasion.
Here is how it fucking works.

568
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:35,231
Visit a showroom or shop online at
[inaudible] dot com pick your fabric.

569
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,000
Choose your customizations from lapels
to pleats to jacket linings in more.

570
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,530
Submit your measurements,

571
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,130
place your order and wait for it
to arrive in just a few weeks.

572
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,250
Then they'll sell all this,
your measurements and all that.

573
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:53,720
She'll sell all of that shit to these
fucking nerds making robots and next thing

574
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:53,991
you know,

575
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,570
there's going to be a knock at the door
and all of a sudden you're going to be

576
00:33:56,571 --> 00:33:58,490
looking right at yourself.
The robot version,

577
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:00,920
you wearing the suit you wanted
and that thing's going to get,

578
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,150
you're going to give up your back.

579
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:04,670
It's going to fucking choke out
in no matter how much you tap out,

580
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:05,810
those robots don't care.

581
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:11,050
But this week my listeners can get
any premium Indochino suit for $389.

582
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:16,580
That's right@indochino.com
when entering burr at checkout,

583
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:21,581
that's 50% off the regular price for
made to fucking measure premium suit.

584
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,640
Three 89 bucks is not a premium
suits and nice suit. Uh,

585
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:30,840
that Indochina Doc,

586
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,860
that's indochino.com promo code Burra

587
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:40,280

that will fit you better than anything off

588
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:40,671
the rack.

589
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:45,671
Evercoat yet 389 bucks actually for a
fucking fitted suit is going to be great.

590
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,710
You can walk into an apple
bees and every chicken,

591
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,650
there's going to think you're a banker.
You got to do it. Next thing you know,

592
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,390
right? You fucking, you know,

593
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,770
you're ramming away trying to block up
the smell of that bloomin' onion that

594
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,150
she's been carrying around all day.

595
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,890
All right, lift everybody.
You know about Lyft Rye.

596
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,040
It's the APP that gets you a ride in
minutes on demand 24 seven for less than

597
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,730
the cost of a cab.

598
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,810
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through their 10 point safety standard,

599
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,510
including criminal and
DMV background checks.

600
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,570
Unlike those other people with that
other thing that rhymes with mover,

601
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,730
right, you don't know what
you're going to get, right?

602
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:31,370
You could walk in there with a bloody ax.
Those fucking cunts would hire,

603
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,340
you know, you'll get around
quickly and safety with, with Lyft,

604
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,410
Lyft drivers are rated after every ride,

605
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:39,900
so only the best around you don't have
to worry about getting into a filthy car

606
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:40,920
was some creepy dude.

607
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:45,000
Everybody doesn't get a ribbon at Lyft
the way they do over it and mover with

608
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:48,750
Lyft, you can tip in the APP, which
obviously leads to happier drivers.

609
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,160
I mean I not a dead lift.

610
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,400
Writers get a perfect five
star rating from the passenger.

611
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,400
It's just a better way. All
better. All around experience.

612
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,330
Bigger isn't always better.
Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

613
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,360
but it is the fastest
growing and I inserted one.

614
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,110
I'm talking quality over quantity.
Thanks to lift you can get,

615
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,900
it's an easy way to avoid drunk driving.
You never have to bum a ride. Well,

616
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,734
what if you're on heroin?

617
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,020
It's another way to to avoid nodding off
in public and then I go to school, Oh,

618
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,820
you're in the cab. Nobody
knows. And you know what?

619
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,540
A lot of people are actually getting
rid of their cars and relying on Lyft to

620
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,940
get around and evidently
I don't blame them.

621
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,750
What do you do when the
apocalypse from the zombies come?

622
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,360
You think you can fucking call Lyft that
Lyft drivers getting the fuck out of

623
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:33,780

R, no space. All caps.

630
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,990
All right. How many more of these fucking
things. Oh Jesus. All but he's a quick,

something like dollar shave,

632
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,440
club upside and simply safe.

633
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,140
They respect the fact that I'm
not good at reading out loud.

634
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,750
So these are three quick paragraphs.
Here we go.

635
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,920
Run on the table just like the Celtics
on the bowls. Second Rondo sat down. Bam,

636
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,700
Bam, Bam. Three to two Celtic, sorry.

637
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,780

You do a,

640
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,280
you no longer have to Schlep to the store
to buy a cheap disposable razors razor

641
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:39,471
that gives you a cheap shave or spend a
fortune on raises with gimmicky shaving

642
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:40,590
tech you don't need.

643
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,890
And when you use dollar shave club's
the executive razor with the executive

644
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:50,130
razor, it comes with the date
rape drug in the fucking handle.

645
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,030
Some creepy banker walking around in
his gold toed socks. Shaven is nuts.

646
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,610
Now that's not what you do and
that's a different read. Sorry.

647
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,500
Did Dollar Shave Club's executive
razor with their Dr Covey's easy shape?

648
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:06,510
The blade just gently glides,
giving you a smooth shave.

649
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,460
Dr Carver's shave butter is
transparent for a more precise shave,

650
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,680
helps prevent ingrown hairs and fights.

651

Upside just sounds like a date movie,

660
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:46,420
right?
He wanted to go see upside.

661
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,470
The downside of the upside.
Do you want to go see that

662
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,340
stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

663
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,240
Hugh fucking let me get a hooker
or whatever the fuck his name was.

664
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:02,290
Who was an English guy
used to go out with Elizabeth Berkley.

665
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,540
It's nine Hugh Jackman.

666
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,940
He's the guy who was seed a whole
chicken every day to become wolverine.

667
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,930
I don't remember Hugh
Grant to grant you ready?

668
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,220
You Bet.
You may get in the fucking hooker.

669
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,090
Hey, I never judged that guy. He
got a hawker. Why wouldn't you?

670
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,100
Why wouldn't you? What else are you going
to do? What else are you going to do?

671
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:30,130
What? Go home and make some fucking
Jiffy pop. You fucking Hugh Grant.

672

You're crushing it. You're a fucking
movie star in your own country.

673
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,880
You go across the pond, you
know? Oh, who's kidding?

674
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:41,881
Who England is like Modot modot
three fucking America is moto GP.

675
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,490
That's where you want to have you hit
movie. She guys all know it's true.

676
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:49,000
Chrysler, all steel in our blue jeans.
You all, you are, you're, you hate us,

677
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,440
but you love our culture.

678
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,490
Isn't it safe to say that I'm fucking
with you and actually emotions [inaudible]

679
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,970
alright. Upside. There's a better
way for you to buy business travel.

680
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,800
It's called upside.com.
Every time you buy a trip it upside.

681
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:10,150
You'll save your company a ton of money
and they gave you an Amazon card worth

682
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,920
hundreds of dollars.
Upsides,

683
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:16,921
able to do this because they bundle your
flights and hotels together for one low

684
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,370
price.
That's what they do.

685
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:22,240
They rip this seats out of a commercial
airliner and they just stuff you in

686
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:24,970
there. You know, you might think flying,

687
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:29,050
standing up like you're at a mosh pit
for six hours from New York to La.

688
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:33,130
Mike Suck. He talks to me when
you that only costs you 40 bucks.

689
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,020
Now that's not what they do. Um, bundled
pricing saves money. This is what they do.

690
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,820
If you're a frequent business traveler,

691
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,270
you're company saves a ton of money and
you could get thousands a year in gift

692
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,310
cards just for buying your air
and hotel together and upside.

693
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,570
You just fucking said this.
Plus you still get your miles

694
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,540
to what the f I feel like in the end
of that she can be missing a kid.

695
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:59,260
Neath it seems like to be too good a
deal and I get a gift card and I get to

696
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,750
keep my miles and I saved
them a bunch of money.

697
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,790
If you're shopping for business travel,

698
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:07,840
and you'd be crazy not to checkout
upside.com you're Outta your mind.

699
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,800
It just takes three minutes to see how
much you can say by buying your flights

700
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,550
and hotels together for
one low price. Oh, I see.

701
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:18,250
They both cut side deals with each other.
Somebody's gotta be doing, you know,

702
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:22,690
at some point somebody got sold
into fucking sex slavery here.

703
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:28,210

about everything, right? Yeah.

754
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,390
I believe I hit everything that
I want to talk about. You know,

755
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:22,630
I was just checking in on you some

756
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,460
fucking music. Excuse me. That
you guys can listen to a man.

757
00:44:27,461 --> 00:44:32,310
We got another like half hour of stuff
from classic podcasts from a or a Monday

758
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:37,050
and a year. A day a week gone by.
That's it. Go fuck yourselves.

759
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:41,300
I believe there's another f one race
this Sunday. Check it out if he can. Uh,

760
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,110
let's go sell dicks. I'm hoping
for a classic. I hope we win,

761
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:48,930
but I also want to see Rhonda
would come on and do his thing too.

762
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:51,480
You know what I mean? Because I still
love that guy. He's still a Celtic to me.

763
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,440
All right. That's it. Have a great
weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday.

764
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,903
Wow.

765
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,733
Dammit.

766
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,100
Hey,
what the fuck I'm talking about?

767
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,280
We decided to have a fucking
party for our new place.

768
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,500
You don't you think that was my idea?

769
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,620
Do you think it was my idea to have a
bunch of strangers coming into the fucking

770
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:27,590
house? I'll have people
over. That's what I do. Hey,

771
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:32,050
you want to come over and watch the
game? Nine people that I know, right?

772
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,100
Have all your fucking phone numbers.
You don't. Nia is a more open person.

773
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:41,770
So she's like, let's tell their party.
All right, so we still, she goes,

774
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,860
invite your friends. So I'm
alright. So you know I got,
you know, I'm a, I'm a guy.

775
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,160
I don't have a bunch of friends.
Okay.

776
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,220
I got six good friends for that I could
really trust, you know, it's about it,

777
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,370
at least out here.
Then over here,

778
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,590
Nia talking to her mom about all excited
about the party and she's like, yeah,

779
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:07,130
I sent it out on Facebook and
I was just like, oh my God,

780
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:11,840
did I just invite 110 people and
my heart literally sank going,

781
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:16,820
please tell me you didn't just invite
110 fucking people. She's like,

782
00:47:16,821 --> 00:47:19,400
don't worry, they're not all
going to show up. It's like, yeah,

783
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:22,670
but like a third wheel and then they're
going to bring people that you don't

784
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:26,990
even fucking know. And that's exactly what
happened. It was a fucking great party.

785
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,360
I'm not going to lie to you, but I got
to like, I got to learn how to um, be,

786
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,760
I thought I was going to be a
good host. I wasn't, I wasn't.

787
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,560
I was all right with the people I
knew. But the people I didn't know, uh,

788
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,270
actually most of them were all right,

789
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:41,830
but there were a couple
of them that just fine.

790
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,650
It just sends you something fucking
annoying about somebody you don't know,

791
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,310
sitting on your God damn couch,
you know,

792
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,800
eating your food, drinking your
booze. He like, who the fuck are you?

793
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,440
It's somebody else was
laying down on the floor.

794
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:01,000
I fell like the kid's dad when we can't
even get a fucking job, right? It's over.

795
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,110
You're 26 she fucking pump. So
anyways, to the party is going great.

796
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:10,450
And uh, I'm basically the whole time,
you know, not drink it too much,

797
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:14,740
but I'm standing by the front tour cause
that's the only way out. All right?

798
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:17,650
And nobody's walking out
with any of my shit, right?

799
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,880
I'm acting basically like psycho
in fucking stripes. It's how I am.

800
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,560
It's how I'm wired.
All right?

801
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,050
So a fucking three quarters away through
the party, everything's going great.

802
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,450
And I'm like, wow, this is the I,
you know what? I forgot. I forgot.

803
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm not 21 anymore.
I'm fucking 43.

804
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:37,960
All my friends are adults and everybody's
drinking responsibly and no one's

805
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:40,870
really hammered. Nothing got
broken. Everything's cool.

806
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:44,780
So start just as I was starting to relax,
some kid comes up to me, he's like, Guy,

807
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,850
yeah, you own a house. And I'm
like, well the bank owns it.

808
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,980
I'm fucking paying it off.
What can I do for you?

809
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,720
And he's like a yes,
kind of embarrassing,

810
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:59,650
but I use the bathroom downstairs and uh,
it's clogged now.

811
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:03,640
And I was wondering if he had a plunger.
And I was like,

812
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,280
yeah, I do have a plunger. I got a
plunger right here, the upstairs bathroom.

813
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,790
So I give it to the guy and I, and I say,
man, I appreciate your honesty. He goes,

814
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:16,720
no problem. He goes downstairs, he takes
care of it, comes back, he wants again.

815
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,370
He goes, he goes, sorry about that.
I said, not at all. Not at all.

816
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:24,490
What the fuck? It's a toilet, you
know, clogs up every once in a while.

817
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:27,250
But I appreciate it. I appreciate
your honesty. You know,

818
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:31,780
cause I would have been nasty.
Good for you. Right. So, uh,

819
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:36,880
now the couple hours goes by, the party
ends and there's like one straggler left.

820
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:39,370
And I tell this story to Nia. I'm like,
you know what, to go, what a good guy.

821
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:43,810
What a good shit. No Pun intended. You
know, he could've left it in there.

822
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:46,430
And then the other party,
I'd come walking in my fucking bathroom.

823
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,570
Looks like a Goddamn Port Authority
bus station, toilet, you know,

824
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,610
so I was psyched. So, so
one of the stragglers at the
party goes, yeah, he goes,

825
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:57,490
I saw that whole thing go down.
That's not exactly how it went down.

826
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,190
Like what he talking
about. He goes, he goes,

827
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:04,570
it wasn't him that was in the bathroom.
And I go, who was it? He goes,

828
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:05,830
it was his girlfriend.

829
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,000
Some lady

830
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,670
took a dump of a magnitude that
it wouldn't go down the toilet.

831
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,350
So now she's in there panicking and this
is when today's technology kicks in.

832
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,690
She can,
back in the day,

833
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,360
she would had to crawl out the fucking
window and hope nobody saw her and just

834
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:33,530
left the door locked. Everybody would
have panicked. Holy Fuck who's in there?

835
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,600
Did somebody pass out as somebody, if
somebody committed suicide? Some what?

836
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,740
It kicked in the door.
Alright.

837
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,950
Knocked it off the fucking goddamn
hinges and you go in there,

838
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:44,180
there'd be nobody in there.

839
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,870
You'd feel the air from outside and
then look down and everyone would see a

840
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:50,960
giant shit and be like
as a party would be over.

841
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,360
Okay.

842
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,450
And the owner of the house would
be walking around going, okay,

843
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,320
you bet a drive away.
Right. That's how it would,

844
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:08,240
it ended up because of today's technology.
Not saying she didn't panic,

845
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:09,380
you know,

846
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,680
it's even worse as a lady cause they're
not even supposed to do stuff like that.

847
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,420
Right.
And uh,

848
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:19,250
she was able to text her boyfriend and I
would fucking pay at least $400 to read

849
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:22,100
those texts,
the panic in those texts.

850
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,670
And to his credit, he
fucking, he stepped it up.

851
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,500
He took the hit, he
came up to me, VH ones.

852
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,520
I love the eighties own Belper and said,

853
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:41,090
I took a dump in your toilet to
a magnitude it didn't go down.

854
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,840
And I need the tools required
to alleviate this situation.

855
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:53,180
So Anti Douche bag of the week,
that guy right there.

856
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:56,000
So taking a fucking
bullet for the team that,

857
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,620
that right there is the
reverse Peyton manning award,

858
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:05,510
EDD and fucking go. We had protection
issue right now. He took one,

859
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,400
he took one for the fucking tape,

860
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,620
went upstairs like a Goddamn gentlemen
asked for a plunger, gave it to him.

861
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,910
And it was all fine and I went
down there at the end of the party.

862
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,330
You never would've known anything,
anything happened, you know what I mean?

863
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,230
Okay.

864
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,550
Like, uh, you know, three hours after
the Kennedy assassination. I bet it was.

865
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:27,830
It was all I'm saying it,
you know,

866
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,510
marked it all up and everything
was all figured out it,

867
00:52:30,511 --> 00:52:31,620
but it was a nice road again.

868
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,693
Okay.

869
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,980
Mopped up the brains.
What am I talking about?

870
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:41,070
[inaudible] what's going going

871
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,030
on? It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

872
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:06,280
April 20 something 2009.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

873
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,510
You know, I really don't.
I really don't. All right.

874
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,500
I feel like shit.
Uh,

875
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,810
I had a really rough weekend in Columbus,
Ohio,

876
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,760
but before I get into the details,

877
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:23,260
I want to thank everyone who came
out on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

878
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:26,010
I had a great time.
I had

879
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,740
too good of a time. Let's
put it that way. Um,

880
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,493
yeah.

881
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,790
Too good a time to go to fucking
time and I'm paying for it right now.

882
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,470
You know, I don't know why I keep
doing this. I don't know why.

883
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:45,010
I just can't learn. You know?
You know I always do overrated.

884
00:53:45,011 --> 00:53:48,550
Underrated on this shit. Yeah. You
know what's fucking underrated?

885
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,050
Eight hours sleep, you
know? You know what's,

886
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:55,690
you know what's fucking underrated going.
Hey,

887
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,800
you want to know the shout of
Jamison? You know what? No,

888
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,500
I think I've had enough.
You know what I would like?

889
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:06,000
I would like a water that's underrated.
You know?

890
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,320
Not going to fucking steak and shake.
It's three in the morning.

891
00:54:11,321 --> 00:54:15,540
That's underrated. Yeah. One of
those fucking double burgers.

892
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,160
I never even made it that place before.

893
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,900
It didn't even look like meat like a patty
in order I've had. He looks like, sure.

894
00:54:21,901 --> 00:54:26,310
We all do. We've all had a fucking burger.
Even you little Veggie cons out there,

895
00:54:26,311 --> 00:54:27,660
you know what it looks like

896
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,430
is a little burned up wig
and there was two of them.

897
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:34,611
You know what?

898
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:38,830
I was kind of a 40 year old fucking guy
going to be 41 and fucking June goes to

899
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:43,831
steak and shake at three in the fucking
morning when he's got a God damn fucking

900
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:47,650
eight 40 in the morning flight.
Why would you do that?

901
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:52,000
Schererville you suck at math. We
all know that, but you can tell time.

902
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,570
I know there's numbers
involved of Jesus Christ.

903
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:00,610
What a fucking idiot. This
whole fucking day it's, yeah.

904
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:03,610
I just started thinking about that
boogie nights. I'm a fucking idiot.

905
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:08,380
I'm a fucking Eddie Eddie and I'm a
fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot.

906
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,780
Twice Friday night ended up at steak
and shake it three in the morning,

907
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,150
you know, fucking Sunday night.
It was as far as I didn't walk in.

908
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:23,870
They weren't like norm, like on
chairs areas again, all shit faced.

909
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,690
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking motley crew.

910
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,290
You want to see a motley crew go to a
fucking steak and shake at three in the

911
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:34,090
fucking morning.
Good God Almighty.

912
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,290
Now I'll tell you I was part of
the problem. I was, you know what?

913
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,041
I bet I was doing it.

914
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,840
Everybody else was doing the oil sitting
in their shit face looking around

915
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,310
everybody else going, Jesus
Christ. Okay. Oh, that fucking guy.

916
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:49,420
Oh my God. Look at her. She's
she, she wanted slippers.

917
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:51,940
Jesus Christ.

918
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:57,220
You know you don't even realize that
doing a tier two and a have fucking guy.

919
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,540
Huh? Look at that. Look at
his fucking eyes. What does,

920
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,400
it's almost like he's been
drinking Jameson all night.

921
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,600
Why wouldn't you get a water after
awhile? You're a fucking idiot. Yeah.

922
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:12,650
Let me have one year burnt
up wig fucking burgers. Ah,

923
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,760
why is shit food so good when you,
when you shit faced, you know?

924
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,370
Is that what it is? Shit. Face
shit food. It's just all shit shit.

925
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,790
Fucking decisions. I didn't want
to do that man. I was doing well.

926
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,640
You know I went to trader Joe's,
you know,

927
00:56:29,641 --> 00:56:33,090
dodged a bunch of fucking Bergen
stock. Hippies and I, you know,

928
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:37,200
I went in there and I, Oh I,
I got the fridge, put my room.

929
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,910
Fuck global warming. I want to be in
shape. I had a fridge put in my room. I,

930
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,220
I had got all this healthy food.
And what do I do?

931
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,500
What do I do?
I go out,

932
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:54,180
I go drinking to water four
nights like a fucking moron.

933
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,850
Oh my God. I went to this
one. You know what I had,

934
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,630
I had a slice of pizza last night too.
That's how fucked up I was.

935
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:04,260
This is like all coming. It's
like a slide show. You know,

936
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,050
you can't remember the shit that
happened in between but you just,

937
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:08,100
you just have pictures.

938
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,340
Good God Almighty was
at a bad look in pizza.

939
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,630
Is there anything fucking worse than
that? Just a bad look at it. It just,

940
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,900
you know, lets you know when
someone makes a pizza right in,

941
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:21,220
it even sucks when it's hot,

942
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,460
but then it just sits there for
a while and it just gets that,

943
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:28,060
that a cold case file look to it.
You know what I mean?

944
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,370
Like it should have a fucking toe
tag hanging off the crust. They,

945
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,790
they brought over a whole pie
to look like that, you know,

946
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:38,050
it looked like some five year old made
it in like an easy bake oven, you know,

947
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,760
and you're their parents and now you
have to eat it and say, oh Susie, yeah,

948
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:47,660
it's delicious. You know, just begin.

949
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,130
Begin her little life of people lying to
her and not being fucking honest saying,

950
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:56,840
no, don't wear that. You look fat in that
now. You just go, oh Susie, you beautiful.

951
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:01,760
That's an excellent pizza you made.
You know what, Susie? It fucking sucks.

952
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,020
All right. I'm not saying to give
up your dream about being a cook,

953
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,500
but you definitely don't fucking have
any talent at this point in your life.

954
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:13,400
You know, maybe we can send you to
some sort of, uh, of Jesus Christ.

955
00:58:13,401 --> 00:58:17,600
What are those chefs schools called?
Huh? What does that art called?

956
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:23,030
You know, come on. You know what it is
because with a c, it's not custodial.

957
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:29,690
It's not common. Serac he plays for
fucking the Canadians. Canadians,

958
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,310
I want to say a bone, Julia to all my
friends up there in Montreal. You know,

959
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,020
I was just breaking your balls. I've
been blogging for the Bruins and, uh,

960
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,370
is basically, I went down, I was blogging
for the Bruins during the playoffs,

961
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,500
which I'm going to continue to do because
they swept the Montreal Canadians.

962
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:48,230
Um, and basically, uh, you know,

963
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,870
I have to blog for the Bruins and playing
the Canadians. I mean, what do you,

964
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:55,370
what am I going to say? The Canadian
one 24 cups. We've only won five.

965
00:58:55,970 --> 00:59:00,800
We haven't won since 1972.
All I can do is just try to piss you off.

966
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:05,180
That's all I was doing. That's a Montreal
fans get really, really fucking mad.

967
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,050
You know, I made fun of their
coach. I just did what I get. Oh,

968
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:13,250
I just made fun how they looked,
how they blew their fucking players.

969
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,941
I don't even more,

970
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,850
I said it was just trying to be a jerk
and as people got all [inaudible] noise,

971
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:21,770
you were hooky. You
know, this guy himself,

972
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:25,940
a comedian.
I don't think this is very funny.

973
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,860
Whatever, you know, it's fucking funny.

974
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:34,550
I heard Celine Dion is thinking
about buying the Montreal Canadiens.

975
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:38,390
He's probably gonna move him to Vegas.
That'd be a fucking mascot on ice.

976
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:41,420
That would be, that would be a crime.
That would be a goddamn crime. All right.

977
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,890
This is the Monday morning podcast.

978
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,250
This is the hangover episode
of the Monday morning podcast.

979
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:51,050
I'm sitting in a hotel in Manhattan,
New York. Why are you doing that, bill?

980
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,590
Huh?
You lay in low after a weekend of Busan.

981
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:59,480
Now I've got a week at Caroline's
and I'm working with Joe to Rosa.

982
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,930
Once again,
my partner in crime too.

983
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,170
Codependent fucking
alcoholics. Dino. One time,

984
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:09,770
I don't think I might have told this
story or an ONA opie and Anthony Show for

985
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:14,750
you. Uh, people who live in, I don't
know, fucking North Dakota. Um,

986
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,681
I don't know when that,

987
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:19,220
I was in Caroline's Caroline's comedy
club on Broadway where I will be Thursday,

988
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:22,610
Friday, Saturday and Sunday
for a fucking 22 shows,

989
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:26,930
22 fucking shows. I couldn't even do one
show at this point. I'm laying low, man.

990
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:30,350
I'm laying low. Um, but
anyways, one night I was,

991
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:32,900
I was standing there at
the bar and I decided,

992
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:36,290
I didn't know if I decided I wasn't going
to drink, but I just wasn't drinking,

993
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:41,510
you know, and all of a sudden who comes
walking down the stairs, you know,

994
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:45,580
like some starlet in the 1950s
making a big fucking debut,

995
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,580
Joe de Rosa. Do you think it was missing?
Was the fucking the evening gown.

996
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:54,520
He comes fucking Walson down the
stairs, you know, all dainty, like,

997
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:59,210
and the second I saw him, I was
like, fuck, now I got a drink. Right.

998
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,660
And you know what, he was
thinking the exact same thing.
That was the funny thing.

999
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:07,610
Neither one of us wanted to drink. You
got any friends like that? You just,

1000
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:13,070
you just been fuck ups for so long that
neither one of you can just pull you out

1001
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:17,810
of the tailspin. I'm sure.
Anybody who's been in Aa good.

1002
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:21,560
Tell me what exactly that that's called,
what kind of friendship that is?

1003
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:26,720
Um, I don't fucking
know. I really, I really,

1004
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:30,740
really feel like shit right now. And,
uh, so I'm setting the room and, uh,

1005
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,050
if you notice the quality
might be a little bit better.

1006
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:36,950
I actually got a microphone now and
I have a little mixer and I have my

1007
01:01:36,951 --> 01:01:41,570
headphones on and I'm sitting here
in the fucking dark. That's not true.

1008
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:44,800
I got the one little desk light on,
uh,

1009
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:49,100
basically talking to myself. You know,
technically once you start listening,

1010
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:52,730
this whole thing makes sense.
But Right now before I upload this thing,

1011
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,280
this is really, uh, you know,

1012
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,710
this is why they don't give
everybody handguns. Because
if one was laying around,

1013
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,880
I'm fucking with you.
You know what I would do?

1014
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:07,150
I'd probably pointed out the window.
I wouldn't shoot anybody.

1015
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,210
Just trying to scare someone,

1016
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,290
maybe make me laugh and I could get a
little oxygen or something into my fucking

1017
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:15,260
head. What do you guys do? What do
you guys use for hangovers? Huh?

1018
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,790
Other than the smart thing,
not drink anymore. Goddamn.

1019
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,120
It's just so much fun though. You know,
I was having a great time, you know,

1020
01:02:23,121 --> 01:02:26,810
there was broads, you know,
just having a good fucking time.

1021
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:31,520
Just a good time. You know, it's other
fucking people who like to drink.

1022
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,530
I met a couple of hunters. I am at
a couple of dancers. I, you know,

1023
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:41,390
I met a, you know, a nice mix of people
that I'm a fucking weird dude man.

1024
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:44,420
I don't like people before I get on stage,
like I don't want to see them.

1025
01:02:44,421 --> 01:02:47,570
I don't see anybody in the fucking crowd.
But the second the show's over,

1026
01:02:47,571 --> 01:02:48,530
if somebody is cool,

1027
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,260
I that's the part of the show I I enjoy
and I become like this fucking a Charlie

1028
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:58,550
rose and I just started
interviewing people, you know,

1029
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:02,900
what's it like to shoot a pheasant in the
face? Hmm. What's that like? You know,

1030
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:07,730
do you got a little fucking couple of
pieces of wood that you're rub together

1031
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:12,560
and somehow it sounds like a pheasant
going a Eddie come on over here, you know,

1032
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:15,830
or whatever. The fucking pheasants
names or if you had a pet pheasant,

1033
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:20,300
what would you name it? Huh? Larry? That'd
be a great name for a pheasant as it be.

1034
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:24,110
Funny if you had it right.
And people looking at it.
Oh my God, is it a pheasant?

1035
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:28,310
Like Larry, get the fuck off of that
thing. Actually got off of it, you know,

1036
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:31,790
and then he got on a late night talk
show and then you went out there and then

1037
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:32,600
it didn't work.

1038
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,410
And then the host sorta mugged about how
it didn't work and then maybe it takes

1039
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:40,970
a turd on his fucking wing tip shoe and
50 years later it's part of the greatest

1040
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:43,640
hits DVD,
you know.

1041
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:46,850
And little did you know that that was
the pinnacle of your life is a fucking

1042
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:47,660
zookeeper.

1043
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,170
That one moment you thought it was going
to keep happening and no one episode

1044
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:56,330
one episode and you never asked back
because your animal shit on the fucking

1045
01:03:56,331 --> 01:04:00,560
host shoe wasn't supposed to
do that. It didn't. It do.

1046
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,700
They didn't do it in the rehearsals.
All right,

1047
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:06,980
how the fuck am I going
to maneuver this year?

1048
01:04:06,981 --> 01:04:09,710
All the rattling in the background,
I couldn't move my mixer or you know,

1049
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:13,100
I feel right now I feel like
the fucking Unabomber, all this.

1050
01:04:13,101 --> 01:04:15,620
God Damn was he anti technology though.

1051
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,930
I don't know if he was anti or pro at all.

1052
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:22,400
I know he was definitely fucking alone
and it was a paranoid son of a bitch.

1053
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,493
Yeah,

1054
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,620
my back. There we go. Did you guys
get nervous there for a second?

1055
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,000
What the fuck?
There's too many fucking courts here.

1056
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,160
I'm going to go back to this cell phone.

1057
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:44,120
I'm not on holding my fucking laptop
like a God damn, you know, you know,

1058
01:04:44,121 --> 01:04:46,210
like servants used to hand shit to kings.

1059
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:49,210
Would they put something on a pillow
and then they had the little hands

1060
01:04:49,211 --> 01:04:51,430
underneath it? That's the way I'm
holding it. I'll tell you what,

1061
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:54,760
can I paint a fucking picture? Can
I paint a goddamn picture? Let me,

1062
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:57,700
let me adjust the microphone. I want to
tell you about my microphone. By the way,

1063
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:03,220
do you remember back in the
1970s, you know, nowadays,
whenever somebody has a mic,

1064
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:06,520
uh, and they have like a little
filter on not a filter, whatever,

1065
01:05:06,521 --> 01:05:07,480
I don't know the technical,
you know,

1066
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:11,200
little spongy thing that you stick on
there so it doesn't pop or if there's some

1067
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:15,460
sort of wind, you know, nowadays that
just black and it just looks like a,

1068
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:18,250
you know, fucking giant
just sitting there, right.

1069
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,170
Something that they can put it on TV, you
know. But back in the day, man, the 70s,

1070
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,240
you know,

1071
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,980
when people buy and we'd buy the
fucking garbage bag full and uh,

1072
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:35,530
you know, the 70s were colorful man,
you fucking day just start it off.

1073
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:36,364
You know,

1074
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,870
he had that crazy cereal that they used
to have somebody brought up bu barrier

1075
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:45,580
count. Chocula and Franken Berry and I
was in the cereal aisle. Uh, you know,

1076
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:47,650
the other day when I went,
when I went to trader Joe's,

1077
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:52,000
when I was going to have a healthy week
before I down five bottles of whiskey on

1078
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,440
the worst drunk too.
I'm one of those guys,

1079
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:56,260
I fucking call up people and start
telling them I love him, you know,

1080
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,580
and one of those guys, you know, I,

1081
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,040
I do everything but end up in the drunk
tank on the fucking Andy Griffith show.

1082
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:06,370
I'm such an old school drunk,
but I'm not an angry guy when I get drunk.

1083
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,750
I'm really not. I'm actually
pleasant and I'm able to emote.

1084
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,320
Is that why you do it,
Bill? I don't fucking know.

1085
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:19,060
All I know is it makes me feel like shit
the fuck was I just talking about? Oh,

1086
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:21,190
how coke colorful the
seventies where yeah,

1087
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:26,191
you'd start off with that fucking
cereal that they had and uh,

1088
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,020
it was one of the worst sentences ever.
Yeah.

1089
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:36,220
He started off with that cereal
that they had. Oh, they had go bell.

1090
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:38,590
It's a great way to, to fucking
start it off. Right. If you,

1091
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:42,490
Patty yourself on the back about how many,
how you could paint a visual, you know,

1092
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:43,840
it's funny,
I have headphones on right now.

1093
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:47,680
I have no idea how a lot I'm talking and
I'm sure that there is somebody on the

1094
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:52,600
other side of this wall that is
contemplating calling the front desk,

1095
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:54,850
but what they're listening
to is so fucking bizarre.

1096
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,740
They haven't been able to tap out yet.
Well that's arrogant pill.

1097
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,210
Maybe they're listening and your sound
fucking annoying. All right. Whatever.

1098
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,680
Stop Heckling yourself. Get to
the point. Yeah, you start off,

1099
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:10,290
we'd eat tricks that you need. Booberry
the shit literally changed the color.

1100
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:10,751
Your milk,

1101
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:13,960
which is some really hacky comedy from
fucking the 80s but I'm telling you,

1102
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,230
you had that shit going on honeycomb,

1103
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,840
you know the co the fucking
people were wearing polyester.

1104
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:26,160
I mean Shit was loud in the 70s
you know those plaid slacks,

1105
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:30,940
people had slacks, he had boots had set
up the side. They were all fucking shiny.

1106
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:35,590
Women had like those, those plastic
looking purses. It was fucking freaky.

1107
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,990
It was weird.
Everything was like done.

1108
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:40,780
Suddenly I think the
advertisers just like, look,

1109
01:07:40,781 --> 01:07:45,580
everybody's on drugs so we really
need to enhance their trip.

1110
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:50,700
So much shit in the 70s was like really
done to like even like the fucking

1111
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:53,720
monkeys,
which I guess you know was that this?

1112
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:57,060
That was the late sixties I think it went
to the early seventies we were wanting,

1113
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:59,920
when they used to fucking,
you know, pretend to sing in,

1114
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:02,950
pretend to play instruments at the
end of the show there and they would,

1115
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:07,330
they would cut to that little musical
montage has and they'd always do like half

1116
01:08:07,331 --> 01:08:11,050
the time they would do like those,
they'd put it in like a kaleidoscope.

1117
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,920
So you had them actually in the middle
and then like six of them like going

1118
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:19,910
around like a fucking, like a fucking
revolver aside. I don't know what it was.

1119
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,190
And you're eating that cereal. He
just watching the shit. Anyways,

1120
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,290
this all comes around to my microphone.

1121
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:31,060
Back then you couldn't even watch like
a sports show without sort of tripping,

1122
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:31,581
you know what I mean?

1123
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:35,870
Like they had ABC's wide world of sport
and they had these fucking bright yellow

1124
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,890
sport coats on and they used to have
these microphones and when they stood

1125
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:44,060
outside, the little spongy thing
that they stuck on top wasn't black.

1126
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:47,300
It didn't blend in with the microphone.
There were these crazy colors.

1127
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:50,840
And one that I always remember was
there was always like bright orange.

1128
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:54,860
It made no fucking sense.
But as a kid I liked it.

1129
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,520
So whatever.
I bought a microphone and the guy goes,

1130
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:03,110
what kind of wind screen do you want?
You know you want the standard black one?

1131
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,750
I said, fuck that. I want that one.

1132
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:10,751
Keith Jackson used to use when he do
Monday night football way back in the day

1133
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:15,140
or Redo the college games. You remember
Keith Jackson? Huh? Hello? Again.

1134
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:19,340
Everybody that says kicked Jackson.
Remember that guy? Alabama,

1135
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:22,760
Crimson tide and I'm fucking
wolverines and Michigan.

1136
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:27,410
They're going to be swapping paint. Um,
anyways. Yeah, so that's what I got here.

1137
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,380
That was a really long fucking
way to go to explain that.

1138
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:33,970
I put an orange spongy thing and the
end of my fucking mic, and I'm a Jew.

1139
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,770
I know I'm cursing a lot right now and
I'm cursing. I'm not cursing at you guys,

1140
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:40,130
okay? Sometimes people get
confused. It's not cursing at me.

1141
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,460
I'm not cursing at you and cursing at
my hangover because I described shit to

1142
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:47,690
you. All right? Jesus Christ. Look at
this fucking fake wood in this desk.

1143
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,730
This is the kind of desk that you sit,

1144
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,260
you know that you sit at when
you're like confessing to a murder.

1145
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,230
You know what I mean? He just sitting
in and trying to wear you down.

1146
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:02,630
They bring in some food and I can like,
they're your friends.

1147
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:08,150
I was just watching those fucking cold
case files, man. God damn loose things.

1148
01:10:08,151 --> 01:10:10,910
A creepy just fucking creepy.

1149
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:15,200
Just watching the people when they
come in and they, and they, and they,

1150
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:18,530
they getting questioned for the murder
and they just sound like, you know,

1151
01:10:18,531 --> 01:10:22,910
regular, regular guys. Where
were you that night? Oh, you
know, it was home. You know,

1152
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:26,330
watching a basketball game,
you know, just chilling out

1153
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:32,330
at a pizza out.
He fucking hacks up 23 people.

1154
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,720
Then when the, when they, when they admit
it, they're like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

1155
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:38,480
he did it. You know, they, they
found this one guy that, uh,

1156
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:42,430
who's that fucking guy that
the green river, I don't know.

1157
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,700
They always got to give them nicknames,

1158
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,370
the fucking news so they
can sell more papers.

1159
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:48,800
They give them nicknames like they're
going to the rose bowl or some shit,

1160
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:53,180
you know, crazy legs. Johnson,
he's killed 48 fucking people.

1161
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,930
They call them the ice
man. Um, anyways, so there,

1162
01:10:59,931 --> 01:11:02,420
there's one guy up in Seattle,
right? He killed all these,

1163
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,960
all these women who was brutal and uh,
they picked the guy up.

1164
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,090
He never been arrested
before and they, they, they,

1165
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,960
they meet him outside of his job
cause they put together a case. Okay.

1166
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:14,100
He has no idea that they're
onto them. And they got, they,

1167
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:19,130
the cops come up to the guy and they
say, listen buddy, uh, where, you know,

1168
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,140
fucking whatever the police officer's,
I choose to try and get a headache.

1169
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:24,120
I don't know what the fuck they
say. You know, they say hi,

1170
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:27,780
we're cops and we're here to arrest
you for the murder of four women. Now,

1171
01:11:27,781 --> 01:11:31,410
if you've never been arrested before, when
your heart drop, the guy just is like,

1172
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:35,580
I guess evidently he just went, oh,
okay. Then they brought him down there,

1173
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:39,450
he confessed to that and he confessed to
like fucking 60 other women that he had

1174
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:42,970
killed. So they bring this guy into, uh,

1175
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:47,640
another run to talk to what?
To a psychologist, you know,

1176
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,480
cause he wants to try to break them down
so you can figure out so you can stop

1177
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:55,890
these maniacs. Right. And He, they asked
the guy this question, they said, uh,

1178
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,870
you know, if you could, um,

1179
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:04,050
you could pick out one thing about your
personality that you feel is different

1180
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:09,120
from the average person walking
down the street, what would that be?

1181
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:14,550
And without missing a beat. The Guy said,
ah, that whole, that whole caring thing.

1182
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,490
Wow. You know when you think you
don't give a fuck Jesus Christ.

1183
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,330
Just regular. Yeah, the whole Karen,
that whole caring thing. Yeah.

1184
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:31,530
I just don't seem to give a
fuck. It's weird. You know?

1185
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,940
I don't know. I hate watching that. I
don't know why I watch that show it show.

1186
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:37,470
It literally gives me nightmares.
You know what I mean?

1187
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:40,020
You start thinking about what?
This is not funny.

1188
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,420
What the fuck am I talking
about? See, this is what happens.

1189
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:44,100
This is what happens when
you go out boozing. I,

1190
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:46,530
you know what the sad thing
is is I know at some point,

1191
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,130
at some point this weekend I'm
probably going to do this again,

1192
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,660
but fortunately I'm in New York City,
so I want to end up at a steak and shake.

1193
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:58,380
I have never eaten there. I think
I've made fun of that fucking place

1194
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,700
on these podcast. How would you rate,
how would you guys out there? Huh?

1195
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:09,660
All my listeners out there, please tell
me you listen and please tell me I'm not.

1196
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,201
I'm done.

1197
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:15,201
Just sitting here baking under this
fucking hotel lamp for nothing.

1198
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,020
How would you rate the worst?
Your worst?

1199
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:24,660
Like a fast food, you know
what I mean? Everybody, you
know, no one wants to eat it,

1200
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:27,420
but we all need it. Cause you know,
it tastes good. Fucking tastes good.

1201
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:29,400
But then there's this certain ones,
either you had,

1202
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:34,470
either you had a bad experience or
you, uh, just the look of it. You know,

1203
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,460
I got, let's say for me like Taco
Bell, I just can't go in there.

1204
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:44,070
There's just something about the colors
on the sign that it just makes my

1205
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:48,510
stomach hurt. You know, you just get that
awful feeling in your stomach. You know,

1206
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,670
I fell the same way about like Arby's.

1207
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:57,150
He's never fucked with Arby's and
Mcdonald's guy. I'm old school,

1208
01:13:57,151 --> 01:14:01,170
like Mcdonald's
in and out as the shit.

1209
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,140
But you know, I got a lot of
memories as a kid at Mcdonald's.

1210
01:14:04,141 --> 01:14:06,720
So I think that one's still wins even
though in and out is even better.

1211
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:10,290
But there's just certain ones I won't
even go into, you know? All right guys,

1212
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:14,340
I'm fucking and fast. Jesus Christ.
I need a fucking water or something.

1213
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,730
The hell did I do with that water?
Didn't I have water around here?

1214
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:21,930
Hang on a second.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1215
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,240
Fucking water I should had
last night. All right, let's,

1216
01:14:24,241 --> 01:14:27,150
let's get on with the questions here.
Um, it's, you're new to my page.

1217
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:29,940
You probably think I'm out of my
fucking mind and you would be right.

1218
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:34,170
I am out of my mind. But you
know what? You know what?

1219
01:14:34,171 --> 01:14:36,750
I don't have anything to say to that.
I have guilty as charged.

1220
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:41,520
What are you fucking perfect. Why don't
you go to, it's a tough fucking www.

1221
01:14:41,521 --> 01:14:44,160
I'm fucking perfect.com and
go listen to that podcast.

1222
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:49,260
I bet there's a lot of fucking laughs on
that one. You know? Did they got a mixer?

1223
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:53,070
I got fucking mixer.
Bitch, you liked that shit.

1224
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:57,860
I'm learning a lot of computer stuff.
You know what?

1225
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:01,310
How about you guys make me computer
literate? Can you do that for me?

1226
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,320
I'll start off with something really easy.

1227
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:07,520
Something that really fucking annoys
me on my computer. And you know what?

1228
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:09,650
Maybe someone else does this
and maybe this is a noise.

1229
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:13,910
Someone else who has a computer who
also has a drinking problem. Okay.

1230
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,610
And then, uh, you know, I'll read how
to do it. Maybe I can help something,

1231
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:21,200
another drunk out there. All right.
This is one of my problems that I have

1232
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:25,760
when I go to you when I go
into to apple works, right?

1233
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:30,650
The text is so fucking small. I
don't understand it. It's set.

1234
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,520
I know how to change it, but I got
to change it every time. All right.

1235
01:15:34,521 --> 01:15:38,360
Right now it's stuck on 12th okay.

1236
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:43,810
Which is basically squint size and you
don't want to copy and paste your guys'

1237
01:15:44,151 --> 01:15:48,440
emails into my fucking thing.
It's it, it, it makes it smaller.

1238
01:15:48,441 --> 01:15:49,190
I don't know what it's doing.

1239
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:54,190
I wanted at 18 I want the default
set at 18 how the fuck do I do that?

1240
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:58,340
And apple works. I got a
brand new MAC book. I want to
learn how to do that. Okay.

1241
01:15:58,341 --> 01:16:02,330
I want to learn some shit. You
know, I know how to upload.

1242
01:16:02,331 --> 01:16:05,990
I know how to do this now. Look at
me. I don't want to upload shit.

1243
01:16:05,991 --> 01:16:08,780
I'll turn it into a fucking MP.
Three I'll send it right to you.

1244
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,610
I know how to do that now.
I feel great.

1245
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,480
It's my new opening line when
I hit on checks on the road.

1246
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,060
You know what's up, sweetie? How
you doing? You'd like to show,

1247
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:23,170
do you know I can also upload audio
files and turn them into an MP three.

1248
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,880
Huh? Put it on a desktop. A
fucking drag it right over there.

1249
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:33,050
Same Way. I'm going to drag you
across the fucking carpet in my hotel.

1250
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,940
What the fuck is that? All right. Can
somebody teach me how to do that, please?

1251
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:42,150
Okay, and let's get on with the podcast
it. You know what the problem is?

1252
01:16:42,151 --> 01:16:44,330
Is this not enough fucking
room here? Oh, I got it.

1253
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,660
Why don't I just move this dude,

1254
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:48,410
I even have a little stand
here from my microphone.

1255
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:53,030
I have a little fucking stand.
This is like a, I don't know.

1256
01:16:53,031 --> 01:16:57,110
This is one of these like really nerdy
things that if you start when you're 18

1257
01:16:57,350 --> 01:17:01,610
by the time you're 30 you're famous
and you're not a nerd anymore.

1258
01:17:01,611 --> 01:17:05,930
Like chicks wanna fuck yet. So it's
unreal, but when you start this at 40,

1259
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:09,910
it's just pathetic and
sad. Okay, here we go.

1260
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,820
We're going to go to a, I already did
the underrated. So why don't I do over?

1261
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,420
Um, I know this is really, this is
really coming off grumpy. I understand,

1262
01:17:19,421 --> 01:17:22,440
but whatever, you know,
last week I was pissed.

1263
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:27,180
This week I'm grumpy. You know what? I'm
due for a happy one. How about next week?

1264
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,220
Next week I'll be all bubbly.

1265
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,780
I won't be cause I'll be flying across
this country. Oh man, that's gonna suck.

1266
01:17:34,781 --> 01:17:36,100
Let's not think about that.

1267
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,280
Do you know like I literally
fall asleep on the plane.

1268
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:43,180
I've flown across this country so many
fucking times that I can literally look

1269
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:47,710
down and pretty much guess
what state I'm over. You know,

1270
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:53,020
as a passenger I can do that. Why these
levels so low but the fuck is going on.

1271
01:17:53,021 --> 01:17:57,220
There we go. Might not talking into
this thing. Hello, test. There we go.

1272
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:01,990
You know what I mean? I can
look out, I can tell, you know,

1273
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,870
pretty good. I mean, Rick,

1274
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,170
yeah,

1275
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:08,470
I dunno. Wait a minute. What the
fuck am I bragging about? What?

1276
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:13,010
Southwest is a desert. You get into
Colorado, you've got the mountains,

1277
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,850
starts getting flat. You're like,
all right, this is Nebraska, Kansas.

1278
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:21,560
Maybe we're in Iowa. You start seeing
more lights. You moving towards fucking

1279
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:27,920
into Illinois, right? And that
all works. I don't fucking know.

1280
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:32,000
Like I actually like I
recognize like lakes now.

1281
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,860
You know, I can look down at my watch.
Oh, you know what? It's taken this long.

1282
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:40,910
We're right about here. Eh, we should be
seeing Cleveland coming by. There it is.

1283
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:45,770
There it is. I look down sometimes
and look at fucking stadiums. Okay,

1284
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,410
so all my fucking life is now.

1285
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:53,580
If I could be outside the plane and look
at my stupid roundhead looking at that

1286
01:18:53,581 --> 01:18:56,880
little oval fucking window.
This is what I signed up for.

1287
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:02,130
This is how fucking hung over I am.
I'm actually bitching that I'm a comedian.

1288
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:05,030
Something that I wanted to do, wanted
to do something that I decided to do.

1289
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,520
All right,
Jesus Christ.

1290
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,380
There was a way for you guys
to email me a fucking tampon.

1291
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,390
I think I get like 9 million this
week. All right. Uh, here we go.

1292
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:17,330
Let's read the a overrated. All
right, let's get into your thoughts.

1293
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:20,480
I think you've heard enough from me for
one week. All right. Overrated bill.

1294
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,340
All right. Build a, I
think this is overrated.

1295
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,250
A lot of people don't talk about this.
This is coming from a woman. She says,

1296
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:28,550
male strippers are overrated.
She said,

1297
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:32,690
especially when they are hired
a for a Bachelorette party.

1298
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:36,350
Is it me or does, uh, uh, Jesus Christ,

1299
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:38,840
I can't read when I'm fucking
not hung over. She goes,

1300
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:43,010
is it me or does anyone else think this
is the stupidest waste of 125 bucks

1301
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:46,910
they've ever seen? You guys get
stretched. 125 bucks. Jesus.

1302
01:19:46,911 --> 01:19:50,570
Is there anything that sucks about being
a woman? Yeah. Given birth periods.

1303
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:53,850
All right. You're right. You're
right. Sorry. Um, yeah. Okay.

1304
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:56,480
Well let me get back to
this. Yeah, the guys are all,

1305
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,870
the guys were all muscled up and
everything, but to be honest,

1306
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:04,520
when you see women looking
at male strippers and they
are hooting and hollering

1307
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:07,300
and laughing and laughing it
up with their girlfriends,

1308
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:10,630
they're actually laughing at the stripper.
Yes,

1309
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:15,660
it is true that they are likely some
women who enjoy it and thinking this guy

1310
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,410
would probably be awesome in bed,

1311
01:20:17,411 --> 01:20:22,411
but 95% of women are hysterically laughing
at the Ridiculous Man All oiled up

1312
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:28,020
and his g string with his stupid little
boombox playing NXS what you need,

1313
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,450
Jesus Christ. Yeah. She just, hey, it
go. She's painting a picture there.

1314
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:38,740
That's what you need and a good story
and you need a narrator who's not fucking

1315
01:20:38,741 --> 01:20:41,710
grumpy and hung over anyways,
playing what you need.

1316
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:45,670
Gyrating around the living room
and dry humping. Dad's lazy boy.

1317
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:51,920
You know what? Jesus Christ, uh,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1318
01:20:51,921 --> 01:20:54,770
This is really fucking long. Let me
get to the point here. She says, women,

1319
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:59,090
what women want is women
want a man who was a man,

1320
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,910
kills spiders, drink beer, et cetera.

1321
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:06,970
None of us would picture our man acting
like a sex machine with a wax chest

1322
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:09,530
dancing in front of a group of housewives.

1323
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:12,980
A man will offer my girl a man will offer.

1324
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:15,590
My girlfriend is a stripper
and he knows his buddies.

1325
01:21:15,591 --> 01:21:18,830
We'll congratulate him like God, Dude, you
go friends and stripper. That's awesome.

1326
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:22,370
A woman would never offer
the same information. Why?

1327
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:27,080
Because she knows the response from other
woman would be a snicker and a yikes.

1328
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,140
Gee, I'm so sorry. Look, is that true?

1329
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:33,440
The women really not like
don't just like cougars,

1330
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,700
don't they like male strippers?
You know?

1331
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:40,980
If you want to know what it's like
to be a guy, be a woman in your,

1332
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:44,410
as far as like our sex drive,
you know,

1333
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:47,770
I think maybe a woman once you're
in your forties at that time.

1334
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:49,600
I don't even what the fuck
point I'm trying to make there.

1335
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:55,110
I just know that like older women
act like the same level of retarded.

1336
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:59,860
That guys act like
our entire fucking wise.

1337
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:02,320
When they start to get older. I don't
know what it is. I guess it's safe.

1338
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,640
They finally don't give a shit.

1339
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,540
And they could admit that they like
cock or they like sex, you know,

1340
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:09,760
cause before they have to be like,
well you know,

1341
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:13,700
it's just for procreation or I
just like my boyfriend's cock.

1342
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:17,200
I don't have any other fucking fantasies,
you know?

1343
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:20,140
Whereas guys we just get,
we just get to be pigs.

1344
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:24,340
We just get to be the God damn pigs
that we are. But you know what?

1345
01:22:24,341 --> 01:22:27,040
You get to cry at movies and get
that shit out. I get to hold it in.

1346
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,950
You know what? There was a rough
one was that Harvey milk movie.

1347
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:34,120
The amount of Shit I had to think about
so I wouldn't tear up during that movie

1348
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:38,500
just so I wouldn't be feeling, you
know, as a guy you can't fucking cry.

1349
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:41,080
So I got to sit there and be like, you
know, he's, he's going through some shit.

1350
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:47,230
I know everyone was getting all sad when
a, you know, when he gets whacked there,

1351
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:51,940
you know. So in order not to get emotional
myself, I just thought, you know what,

1352
01:22:51,941 --> 01:22:53,890
if someone just came over and
just kicked him right in the balls

1353
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:01,240
and I just started laughing,
you know, that's what it is.

1354
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,590
That's what comedy is. It's to
stop from crying. All right.

1355
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:11,510
Um, number two. Oh, this
is, oh my God, this,

1356
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:13,340
some New Yorkers aren't
going to like this one.

1357
01:23:13,341 --> 01:23:17,720
This is another thing that she
says is overrated is underrated.

1358
01:23:17,721 --> 01:23:21,650
Actually, a two run homer
in the bottom of the ninth,

1359
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,470
ninth after Mary off of Marianna Rivera.

1360
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:29,860
And I could've fucking read that better.
Yeah. The red sox swept the Yankees fans.

1361
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,750
Fucking unbelievable. There'll be
back. This shit always happens.

1362
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:35,390
One team always jumps out in
front of the other team, right?

1363
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:39,920
Do we fucking all you guys?
We fucked the all new goes

1364
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:42,370
and then they literally
almost like it's fixed now.

1365
01:23:42,371 --> 01:23:47,230
The Yankees will sweep us down there and
we'll play each other like 12 times or

1366
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:50,740
13 times and someone will win
when it fucking seven to six.

1367
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:54,750
It's a God damn business people. Okay,
there's no fucking Santa Claus, honey.

1368
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:59,060
I don't buy it. Um, and we
stole home plate and you know,

1369
01:23:59,061 --> 01:24:01,690
how the fuck does that happen? $200
million team. You know something.

1370
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,040
You realize the red sox sale,

1371
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:06,970
they only there number four this
year as far as money spent. Oh yeah.

1372
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:08,290
A lot of you fuckers didn't know that.

1373
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:13,090
Dead you Yankee spent 200
million then it's the maths.

1374
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:17,440
Then I believe the cubs and then us.
We're 122 million. Isn't that great?

1375
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:20,700
Now we're going to act like we're some
little fucking starving panty little

1376
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:25,180
Pansy fucking team.
Yankee did ruin in baseball.

1377
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,390
Um, who gives a fuck? I'll tell
you what's funny is of the, the,

1378
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:34,440
the fuck did I just do there? I
sit on my computer. All right,

1379
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:37,120
let's let you know what
I'm really starting to feel
like I'm losing the momentum

1380
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:40,930
of this 31 minutes. 31 hung over minutes.
Dude. I'm going to tell you right now,

1381
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:42,340
this is feeling like four hours.

1382
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:44,140
I feel like I'm doing a
fucking telethon right now.

1383
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,490
Let's get to the questions for
the week. I got a, I got one here.

1384
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:53,800
Am I the only one who thinks Terry
Francona is glasses make him look like a

1385
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:58,210
cancer stricken Mrs Claus,
he's the, he's the, uh,

1386
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:03,020
he's the manager of the red sox.
I did see him. Yeah. Those, they,

1387
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:07,330
they're definitely a, yeah, he looks
like he should be at the very least, uh,

1388
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:12,460
you know, going out Carolyn or something
reading the night before Christmas.

1389
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:15,280
I don't fucking know.
I don't know. You know,

1390
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:18,820
I talked a lot about sports last week
and a couple of people really got pissed

1391
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:21,820
just talking about how dumb they are.
Some guys since this,

1392
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,870
this huge fucking rant about saying how,
you know,

1393
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:28,990
being into a sports team is
almost as dumb as patriotism.

1394
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,110
I know the point you're trying to make.
You know what I mean?

1395
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:37,150
I get it. You know, I know what you're
saying, but you know what the fuck dude.

1396
01:25:37,151 --> 01:25:40,090
I mean, I've done like almost
two years of these things.

1397
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:45,100
Eventually sports was going to come up
that we always have to talk about what

1398
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:48,580
you want to talk about. This
guy was really, I dunno,

1399
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:51,190
sometimes I don't know if people are
going for Douche bag of the week.

1400
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,440
I don't know what do I
have anything else here?

1401
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:57,760
I don't think I have anything else. Oh,
Bill, I need some advice. All right,

1402
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:00,400
here's another guy. Obviously he had
some Jamison. Listen to this shit.

1403
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,520
This is his question. Hey
Bill, big fan bombed right now.

1404
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,460
I didn't get that for a second.
I thought like he said,

1405
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:09,440
big fan and he meant like that line bomb.

1406
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:13,580
But evidently he means he shit faced or
he's the worst speller anywhere in the

1407
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:16,880
world. Here we go. It starts
off. It says, anyways,

1408
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:20,390
I need some objective viewpoint.

1409
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,960
Me and this hot chick,
I'm a big old,

1410
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:28,550
ugly rugby player recently
started hanging out.

1411
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:32,000
He misspelled that and we like, no, he,

1412
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:37,490
he put the e at the beginning of each.
We like each a lot.

1413
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:43,150
Jesus Christ. Dude recently started
hanging out. We'd like each other a lot.

1414
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:46,000
My problem.
She used to date a black guy.

1415
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:51,610
I have black friends. My buddies
will tear me apart. Thoughts,

1416
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:56,620
advice. Thanks John. Well,

1417
01:26:56,621 --> 01:26:58,180
John,
um,

1418
01:26:58,181 --> 01:27:01,720
my thoughts are you're pretty
fucking shit faced when you a,

1419
01:27:01,721 --> 01:27:06,721
when you sent that email that that's my
thoughts cause the rest of it makes no

1420
01:27:07,151 --> 01:27:10,630
sense. She used to date a black
guy. Okay. You have black friends.

1421
01:27:10,631 --> 01:27:12,940
Is that supposed to establish
that you're not racist?

1422
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:17,850
My buddies will tear me apart
like what?

1423
01:27:17,851 --> 01:27:21,990
They're going to in a good natured way
revue that your deck isn't going to be as

1424
01:27:21,991 --> 01:27:25,320
big. I don't know what you're
trying to say here. Tell you what,

1425
01:27:25,321 --> 01:27:26,550
why don't you fucking,
you know,

1426
01:27:26,551 --> 01:27:29,820
don't email me now cause I know you're
feeling the way I'm feeling. But you know,

1427
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:34,440
sober up trying to clean that
up. You know, I think maybe
you got something there.

1428
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:38,790
Send me a second draft. I
Dunno. What the fuck that means.

1429
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:43,020
She used to date a black guy.
How to fuck would they know

1430
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,410
you have black friends? My buddy will
tell you where your black friends.

1431
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:51,980
Do they know this guy?
Did she used to date one of the,

1432
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:55,640
one of your friends who was black?
That's just a weird statement.

1433
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:59,690
I have black friends. Do you have
black friends? Sure. We all do.

1434
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:03,440
Like you're trying to load yourself
some sort of credit credibility.

1435
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:09,560
The fuck does that made anyways? You
know, how many friends do I have?

1436
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:15,170
Joe To Rocio, he's half of Gypson.
So that takes care of the, uh,

1437
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,030
does that take care of Arabs?

1438
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:20,120
Are Egyptians considered era and what
the fuck Arabs are? I don't even know.

1439
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:24,230
I don't fucking know. I
can't, I, you know, I dunno.

1440
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,210
I don't [inaudible] be an innocent,

1441
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:30,980
one question I've always is being Jewish
is that, I know it's a religion. Is it a,

1442
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:34,040
is it a race? It's not a race. Right?

1443
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:37,900
I would want to take a
long time ago, I, I, I,

1444
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:41,640
I was in high school and one of
my friends was Jewish, right?

1445
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:47,850
And uh, I said to him, I said,
what are you, what are you Italian?

1446
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,870
He goes, no, I'm Jewish. And
I, I could tell I offended him.

1447
01:28:51,871 --> 01:28:54,900
So I didn't do a follow up question,
but in my head I'm going, okay,

1448
01:28:54,901 --> 01:28:58,500
Italian is a race. I thought Jewish was
a religion. I know Jewish is a religion.

1449
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,420
You know that doesn't make any fucking
sense. I don't fucking know. Let's,

1450
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:04,560
let's read a revenge story.

1451
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:09,480
Let's read or event story and
let's fucking wrap up this podcast.

1452
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:13,590
This is going to be a shorter one.
This is the hung over version. Oh,

1453
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:17,420
here's something else I came up with is I,
I'm actually contributing underrated.

1454
01:29:17,421 --> 01:29:21,360
You know, it's underrated. Free Internet
in the hotels. God Damn. And I liked that.

1455
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:25,870
I wrote all that other shit in anger, so
let's not read that. All right, here's a,

1456
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,750
here's a big long revenge story to end
the podcast this week and let me know

1457
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:31,980
what you guys think about the sound.

1458
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:35,270
I know kind of a in my head a little
bit and I got this mic like stationaries

1459
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,760
that affecting the sound because God
knows I'm not going to go back and listen

1460
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:43,470
to all this shit. I usually
listen to them, but not this
week, man. Not this week.

1461
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:45,400
I've done it for a fucking week. I
don't want to tell you, you know,

1462
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:48,210
this is one of these times, so it's
great. I don't have a kid, you know,

1463
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:51,650
because I would have no patients for,
you know,

1464
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:55,250
it's a new bit I've been working on in my
act, talking about how much I like, uh,

1465
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,430
I like kids when they're, I like kids
the same way. Like, I like dogs. I like,

1466
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,520
I like them when they're puppies
and they're full of life, you know?

1467
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,370
And once they get a little bit older
and stubborn, they think they know shit.

1468
01:30:05,371 --> 01:30:09,680
It's just, it's fucking, they're
annoying. You know? I like kids like, uh,

1469
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,900
your fucking cracks me up.
I saw this kid the other day,

1470
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:16,260
this kid was like two years
old, right. You know, it's
funny about toddlers, right?

1471
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:20,940
How they did, I talked about this already,
how they got their little fucking,

1472
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:24,660
they got, they already have a beer belly
and they never even drank. They look,

1473
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,520
you know, look, these
little fucking truckers,

1474
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:34,400
it always is just fucking makes me
toddlers fucking beer bellies just fucking

1475
01:30:34,621 --> 01:30:37,280
make me laugh every time
I say, oh, you know,

1476
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:40,020
it's because they're not self
conscious about their bodies.

1477
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,430
They don't give a fuck.

1478
01:30:41,431 --> 01:30:45,690
So they just got it hanging out there
like some fucking drunken slob at a

1479
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:49,190
barbecue. You know, they just,

1480
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,800
it's just funny to me.
They look like they've already fell.

1481
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:57,390
They fucked up in life. You
know, like they're gambling,

1482
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:02,010
they're eating the wrong food. I don't
know. Why do they have those fat bellies?

1483
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:07,170
Jesus Christ. You're eating mush
in milk. You'd, you're the first

1484
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,930
one. I just admit, I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about sometimes.

1485
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:17,880
I'm literally sweating right now because
of a lamp. That's how fucking hung over.

1486
01:31:17,881 --> 01:31:22,530
I am. Okay. Here we go. You
know something else I hate.

1487
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:24,930
I mean, this is something I've been
doing. I've been, I've been trying to eat,

1488
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:27,900
you know, one just veggie
meal a day, you know,

1489
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,150
to then I can make up
for the fucking oxen.

1490
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,960
Then I'm going to eat later on that
night or evidently the fucking steak and

1491
01:31:33,961 --> 01:31:36,150
shake. Then I'm going
to eat and uh, you know,

1492
01:31:36,151 --> 01:31:39,360
I can't stand about those fucking veggie
meals. I ordered this Veggie meal, right?

1493
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:41,310
I ordered a, uh, uh,

1494
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:45,560
some sort of fucking horrific veggie wrap,

1495
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,660
which really sucked because they
grilled the vegetables. You know,

1496
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:54,300
like when you go beyond where
they start becoming mushy,

1497
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:58,830
it just, uh, I can't even say what it
sounds like. What it, what it tasted like.

1498
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,920
It's gonna make me fucking gag here, but
you know, it just, I'm going to do it.

1499
01:32:02,921 --> 01:32:06,610
You know what? If you're squeamish,
cover your fucking ears right now.

1500
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,270
You know what it tastes
like when when you,

1501
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:12,800
they over steam vegetables
or they fucking uh,

1502
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:15,880
over grill. I don't know what
it gets all squishy and mushy.

1503
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:20,320
It tastes like it's pre chewed.
Just pausing right now,

1504
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:24,280
waiting for the grounds.
People thrown their headphones off.

1505
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,130
All you people want to lift the cold side.
Did you just grown?

1506
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,950
Do they had the fat
Harry Fuck next to you?

1507
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:37,600
Start looking at you wondering
what you're listening to. Um,

1508
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:43,030
this is what I hate your yard or a Veggie
wrap. Orion. They go one veggie wrap.

1509
01:32:43,031 --> 01:32:47,230
I ordered some soup like an old
fucking Jewish man in Manhattan. Right.

1510
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:49,120
And then,
then what happens?

1511
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:55,360
They bring it to me and as they got
French fries on the side, it's like,

1512
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:58,750
can't you see? I'm trying,
I'm trying to get in shape.

1513
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:03,550
I understand it's a French
fry. It's a potato. It's a,
it's a vegetable. I get it.

1514
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:07,380
What the fuck? It's like when
you go to the cheesecake factory,

1515
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:11,680
order a salad and then they go,
would you like to third? It's like,

1516
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:15,200
do you not get the fucking
theme here lady? Do you not
see what I'm trying to do?

1517
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:20,330
Do you see my bloated
alcohol infused face?

1518
01:33:20,331 --> 01:33:22,930
Do you understand what I'm trying
to do here? I actually, you know,

1519
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:26,540
it's not even fair cause I actually
talked to one of those, uh, Gsk,

1520
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:31,030
I think I was making fun of the
cheesecake factory and now my act and um,

1521
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,440
there actually was, there was a
waitress in the crowd as always.

1522
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:38,950
I always end up shitting on something
and then someone from the crowd is like,

1523
01:33:38,951 --> 01:33:40,630
Hey, I do that. What the fuck?

1524
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,130
So it was this cheesecake factory waitress
and she came up to me and she said,

1525
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:49,710
uh, she goes, actually, they
make us do that. We have to
do that. If we don't do it,

1526
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,510
we get fired.
Really?

1527
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,060
Is that what it's come down to?

1528
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:59,260
That that's where the
decisions in your life led you?

1529
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:02,620
That you have a job that if
you don't ask people for cake,

1530
01:34:02,621 --> 01:34:07,600
which is usually a nice fucking thing to
do. If you don't do it, you get fired.

1531
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:12,610
They have a gun to your fucking
head to basically have your job,

1532
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:17,260
to try to make people become diabetics.
Is that what's going on?

1533
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:20,500
Is that what happened in your life
because you sucked at something in school?

1534
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:25,660
You know? I don't fucking know. All right,
let's get on with the revenge story.

1535
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:29,050
I am fucking,
I know why I shut off the air.

1536
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,090
Is anybody else just
hate air conditioning?

1537
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:35,440
I don't mind air conditioning when it's
9,000 degrees out, but when it's fucking,

1538
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:41,260
you know, it's like, I don't know
what it is. It's like 65 degrees out,

1539
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:45,010
70 72 and they got the air
conditioning on. It's like,

1540
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,370
are you trying to give me pneumonia?
Huh?

1541
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:51,520
Is that what the fuck you're trying to
do? Jesus Christ. Am I in a mood? Hey,

1542
01:34:51,521 --> 01:34:55,360
what do you guys think about
that? Swine flu? You know,

1543
01:34:55,361 --> 01:34:59,340
this might be a little comfortable,
controversial, but I'm kind of all for it.

1544
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,900
I think this is another time where we're,

1545
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:08,320
we're getting in the way of nature running
it's course nature is trying to kill

1546
01:35:12,411 --> 01:35:14,240
off us.
Not all of us,

1547
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:17,510
but some of us so that you know,

1548
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:23,410
there's no traffic. You
know what I mean? It's,

1549
01:35:23,411 --> 01:35:27,220
it's like the forest fire. It's a
rebirth. You know, you burn it down.

1550
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:30,550
Some animals die, some trees die.
You get rid of all the brush.

1551
01:35:30,551 --> 01:35:34,930
It's like a spring cleaning. That's all
a plague is. It's just that we, you know,

1552
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,790
you don't want any loved ones to die.

1553
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:38,690
Okay?

1554
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:41,510
Plagues and I'll tell you, man
plagues that there are really, uh,

1555
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,230
they're fascinating. They're putting
out all these stats. You know what?

1556
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:48,740
Fuck this revenge story. Let me go on
the Internet here. Let me, let me, uh,

1557
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:53,750
let me restart Firefox. Now. What is
your fucking problem? I never stopped it.

1558
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:59,940
I'm in the middle of a podcast.
Got Damn these fucking computers.

1559
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:04,440
What do they do? This shit to me. Come
on, let's go. Anyways. Yeah, they would,

1560
01:36:04,441 --> 01:36:06,030
they'd given up all, all these, uh,

1561
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:14,390
all these statistics on a plagues
and that type of stuff. Every dental,

1562
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:15,110
he didn't know it was like,

1563
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:20,110
like 675,000 people died in the United
States in 1918 because of like an eye

1564
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,280
influenza, whatever the fuck that is.
I didn't know what the fuck that is,

1565
01:36:28,281 --> 01:36:30,800
but everybody got it.
And a whole bunch of people died.

1566
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:33,740
And you know what's fucking,

1567
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:37,190
you know what's fucked up about
that was thank God they did.

1568
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:41,150
You know, cause if they didn't
they all would have fucked.

1569
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:42,680
Yeah.

1570
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,050
And they would have made more fucking pee.

1571
01:36:44,051 --> 01:36:45,740
We might've been where we're at right now.

1572
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:50,720
We might have been there 15 years
earlier. I love, I just throw numbers out.

1573
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,870
I'm, I like, I'm a fucking scientist
here. I don't want, I'm talking about,

1574
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:58,130
hang on a second.
Let's look up plagues.

1575
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,090
It's going to get me on
some sort of FBI list.

1576
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:06,890
You know I need to do now is Google
fucking anthrax and it'll be a knock at my

1577
01:37:06,891 --> 01:37:10,250
door and I really will be confessing
at this fucking table here.

1578
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:13,460
Great plagues

1579
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:19,550
and history. Okay, that
should be a great game show.

1580
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:23,680
That's every a fucking great
game show. Okay. Is you tried it.

1581
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:28,040
You start googling shit and whoever
gets the FBI to come to your place first

1582
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:32,420
wins and you can't do like
easy shit like uh, like yeah,

1583
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:35,450
obviously any sort of creepy pedophile
stuff cause that's just fucking horrific

1584
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:39,770
and it's, it's never funny is it? Even
though I joke about it on stage sometime.

1585
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:45,200
All right. List of historical
plagues. Let's go to Wikipedia.

1586
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:48,890
God knows they're always number one.
All right.

1587
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:51,930
In human history,

1588
01:37:51,931 --> 01:37:56,370
the term plague refers to an epidemic
disease causing a rate of mortality,

1589
01:37:57,180 --> 01:38:01,860
a pestilence and academic. Daesh. Shut
the fuck up. I want to, I want stats.

1590
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:07,200
Okay. What? I've got to go
to MLB, I've got to go to CBS
sports.com so I got to go.

1591
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:12,120
Ongoing danger.
Great plagues of Athens.

1592
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:17,730
Let's get to some recent ones here.
You know, what do we got here?

1593
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,280
Great plague of Iceland.
See what I'm saying?

1594
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:23,970
Everywhere everybody had a plague in it.
Then the herd,

1595
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:28,800
great plague of Portugal, great plague
of Russia, great plague of Ireland,

1596
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,780
Scotland,
London plague.

1597
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,690
Just attack the fucking
city for two years.

1598
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:40,860
1592 to 1594 the Italian plague.

1599
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:45,660
Everybody's fucking had one. It was
last time we had a plague. You know,

1600
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:50,940
we just say that you just can nip it
in the butt with, with, with fucking,

1601
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:55,410
with the media. They just, they get it
out there before it gets a chance to, to,

1602
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,680
to help with the traffic.
You know?

1603
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:01,470
So I'm in New York City right
now and they have a number of,

1604
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:06,450
a number of cases out in Queens. And, uh,

1605
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:08,910
you know, they're telling people
how, you know, what's funny as hell.

1606
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:10,620
They tell people,
did you use common sense?

1607
01:39:10,621 --> 01:39:13,270
If you feel like you're getting the
flu, go to the hospital. Right? So they,

1608
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:17,580
they say, you know, if you
sneeze or if you cough,

1609
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:22,320
just covering your mouth. Right? So half
hour later I'm walking down the street,

1610
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:24,870
walking down whatever fucking
avenue here in New York,

1611
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,730
and I see this kid on a bicycle and he
proceeds to sneeze and he just turns his

1612
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:33,330
head and it looked like a fucking spit
take. And I just burst out laughing,

1613
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:37,180
bursting out, laughing, you
know, rather than being who?

1614
01:39:37,190 --> 01:39:42,090
I'm like the exact opposite of a,
uh, I was going to say a hemophiliac.

1615
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:44,490
That's not what I'm trying to say.
What are those fucking people?

1616
01:39:44,491 --> 01:39:47,970
They're always nervous that they got
something, a hysterectomy. What does it,

1617
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:50,190
I know it begins with an h.
This always happens to me.

1618
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:53,630
It's what happens to my fucking
brain as I knew the word and I,

1619
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:58,230
my brain panics and all I'm
left with is a letter, uh,

1620
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:01,020
fucking hemophilia.
I can't get that word out of my head.

1621
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:04,560
You know what?
I got to talk about something else.

1622
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:06,680
Let's talk about the Jonas
brothers comedy show. Huh?

1623
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:11,850
I think I speak for the group when
I say it's about time, you know,

1624
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:17,850
because their music is fucking
hilarious. And, uh, I, I just,

1625
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:22,500
you know, fucking cons. It's fucking
business. You know what I mean?

1626
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,240
Rarely is is that, is that what I
should, that's not what I should've done.

1627
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:31,760
I should've gotten this
business with fucking three,

1628
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:35,760
three of my other brothers.
You know, I'll play the drums.

1629
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:39,120
You get a Ukulele and then you do this
and then you'll get your own fucking

1630
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:43,980
sketch show
sons of bitches.

1631
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,790
Oh yeah, I'm better. I'm better
about the fucking Jonas brothers.

1632
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:51,840
I want some goddamn stats here on dead
people. All right. I don't feel good.

1633
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:56,820
So I want to read about dead people. All
the black death. Here we go. Here we go.

1634
01:40:58,370 --> 01:41:01,230
So black death was one of
the deadliest pandemics.

1635
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,250
The fuck is a pandemic is
an epidemic and a pandemic.

1636
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:10,580
A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious
disease that spreads through pop

1637
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:16,170
populations across their large region.
For instance,

1638
01:41:16,171 --> 01:41:20,010
a continent or even worldwide.
Thank you. Wikipedia.

1639
01:41:20,011 --> 01:41:21,540
So what the fuck is an epidemic?

1640
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:26,020
This is what happens and you just start
fucking search and everything and then

1641
01:41:26,021 --> 01:41:26,854
you figure out what the hell is.

1642
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:32,980
An epidemic occurs when new cases of a
certain disease occur in a given human

1643
01:41:32,981 --> 01:41:37,570
population. During a given period,
isn't it the same fucking thing?

1644
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:42,550
Is that not the same fucking
thing? A close enough. All right.

1645
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:45,400
You guys want to hear
about the black death, Huh?

1646
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:48,100
When you sit in there and your
cubicle at work? Well God damn it.

1647
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:50,290
I'm going to read you some shit.
God knows you could do this yourself.

1648
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:51,400
It's right there.
And Wikipedia.

1649
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:56,790
The black death was according
to chronicles characterized
by boobos a swelling

1650
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:00,310
and the lymph nodes. I don't even
know where the lymph nodes are.

1651
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:04,780
I think there are they in your neck
a hypochondriac. Bam. I got it.

1652
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:07,840
All right. See that's what I gotta do.
Just start talking about all this shit.

1653
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:12,130
Then I didn't know where I yell out the
word and now I can't remember what I was

1654
01:42:12,131 --> 01:42:15,280
talking about. Oh, I know. I'm the
exact opposite of a hypochondriac.

1655
01:42:15,281 --> 01:42:19,570
Where a [inaudible]. No,
it doesn't make sense.

1656
01:42:19,571 --> 01:42:22,000
Hypochondriac cause nervous.
I had to keep my IUD. Apples.

1657
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:26,200
Scientists and historians at the beginning
of the 20th century assumed that the

1658
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:30,640
black death was an outbreak of the
same disease caused by the bacterium.

1659
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,880
Who gives a fuck and spread by fleas with
the help of of animals like the black

1660
01:42:38,651 --> 01:42:41,110
rat.
However,

1661
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:46,630
this view has recently been giving
me some stats for Christ's sake.

1662
01:42:46,631 --> 01:42:51,530
How many fucking people died?
What?

1663
01:42:51,531 --> 01:42:56,260
Wait, wait a minute. The origins of the
plagues, does that, did that to Deb.

1664
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,320
Deeper depth at do.

1665
01:42:57,500 --> 01:43:02,500
The total number of deaths worldwide
is estimated at 75 million people,

1666
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:08,900
approximately 25 to 50 million
of which occurred in Europe.

1667
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:15,100
The black death is estimated to have
killed 30% to 60% of Europe's population.

1668
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:19,460
Just stick about that people.

1669
01:43:19,461 --> 01:43:23,960
Six out of 10 automobiles that you'll see
in front of you tonight as you try and

1670
01:43:23,961 --> 01:43:26,660
drive home would not fucking be there.

1671
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:29,540
And we already built the highways

1672
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:36,400
to hold ya know a ton of fucking car.
You know what I'm saying?

1673
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,510
You know it's America, man.
You want to fucking drive,

1674
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:46,250
put the top down and I'm making Pontiac's
anymore. How fucking sad is that?

1675
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:50,660
Let's think about some great Pontiac's.
That's where we're going to close out.

1676
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:54,190
After we talked about the epidemic,
we talked about death.

1677
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,520
Let's talk about how sad it is that
there's no more Pontiac's anymore.

1678
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:01,880
There's just no more of
the Pontiac Trans Am, Huh?

1679
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:05,660
Kinda drops off after that,
but you know,

1680
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,080
yeah.

1681
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:07,930
The Sun Bird,

1682
01:44:09,730 --> 01:44:13,810
the t 1000 you guys remember the Pontiac
t 1000 that was when you were really

1683
01:44:13,811 --> 01:44:15,850
fucked up when you bought
a bootleg Chevette.

1684
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,750
That's when you really were saying that
you were an extra level of white trash.

1685
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:23,560
Okay. You ate macaroni and
cheese five times a fucking week,

1686
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:29,900
you know? You know, I can't imagine
what the Fuck I've even said today.

1687
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:32,150
Did I,
was I riffing about Sharon?

1688
01:44:32,151 --> 01:44:35,840
A tray of macaroni cheese with
another man looking into his eyes.

1689
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:41,410
Was that this podcast? Was that another
podcast? Was that at some point?

1690
01:44:41,411 --> 01:44:44,160
His show last night?
I don't know what,

1691
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:48,970
but this has been the Monday morning
podcast for a April fucking 20 something.

1692
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:54,280
I don't know what it is.
Oh know this is what we're into.

1693
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:57,980
Garbage time. They still have their as
well. They were official site is still up.

1694
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:03,380
What I would have Pontiacs or they
have the Bonneville. You know what?

1695
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:06,920
They were a one trick pony.
Anybody drive a Pontiac?

1696
01:45:08,830 --> 01:45:10,630
I don't. Well, let's talk
about that next week. Okay.

1697
01:45:10,631 --> 01:45:11,890
This is the Monday morning podcast.

1698
01:45:11,891 --> 01:45:16,660
I'm be at Caroline's this week and then
I'm taking a break here for May and June.

1699
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:21,790
Going to recharge my fucking batteries
and coming out, swinging in July.

1700
01:45:21,791 --> 01:45:23,680
I started the comedy works in Denver,

1701
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:29,310
and then I go to a Eddie's
fist fuck in a fucking a Uma.

1702
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:36,700
I'm just gonna make up shit now.
And then I'm going to be at a wallpaper.

1703
01:45:36,701 --> 01:45:39,910
Freddy's at the limelight.

1704
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,020
Beautiful Theater.
We're raw.

1705
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,950
Cirque de Solei performed just
reading the awful brochures here.

1706
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:50,250
What is Cirque du Solei?
I really impressed with it.

1707
01:45:50,251 --> 01:45:55,090
The strength that those guys have. Not
so much on the costumes. All right,

1708
01:45:55,091 --> 01:45:56,800
you guys,
that's the podcast for this week.

1709
01:45:56,801 --> 01:45:58,870
I hope you guys all
have a tremendous week.

1710
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:03,400
And I apologize if I was a little bit
grumpy this week, but, uh, you know,

1711
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:06,670
I'm sorry. All right, that's on me.
I'm just gonna Pause. I'm sorry.

1712
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:58,180
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1713
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,060
