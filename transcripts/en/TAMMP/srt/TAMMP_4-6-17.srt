1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,310
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:08,200
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,230
ah,

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm just checking in on you. I'm
just checking in on you. Sorry,

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,310
I'm just checking in on you to
see now your week's going. Well,

6
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,680
a half hour checking in. How are
you doing? How are you doing? Okay.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,920
Fed fucking tastic. You know, it's funny,

8
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:28,990
I'm always a day late and
a dollar short to shit,

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,140
so I fucking got a youtube page now.
Um, we're doing all this animation,

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,860
a fucking hiring people to do stuff.

11
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,920
Try to get this fucking
thing going to someday.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,460
I won't even have to leave my house.

13
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:44,390
All I gotta do is just sit here and
ramble on about crazy shit as I slip into

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,070
fucking senility and I'll still
be able to eat my apple sauce.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,810
I'll still be able to pay for some
fucking apple sauce. All right?

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,770
That is what that is what the
old age is all about. Okay.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,560
You don't leave your house, but
checks is still coming in. Okay?

18
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:02,200
You got a cupboard full of fucking
apple sauce. Once you open them,

19
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:06,220
you put them in the fridge, you know,
even though it hurts your teeth. Oh right.

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,400
Cause you got to look at fucking nerve
involvement and all your fucking,

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,500
all your teeth. Right? You go back to
eating the same shit. You Steve as a baby.

22
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:18,730
It's just, it's like apple sauce is
Gerber food for fucking old people. Right?

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,400
So you got that. What else do you have?
You mixed a little Manet's in there.

24
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,770
Anything you don't have to fucking shoe.
Um,

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,860
so I'm getting a youtube page going
and then you know what these fucking

26
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:30,250
constant youtube do. Now,
if I can't even tell you,

27
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:34,360
they got this thing where they decide if
what the fuck happened on your thing is,

28
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,980
is a little too offensive.

29
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:39,790
Like they fucking decide and then
you don't get any of the ad money.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,580
And I'm like, but the ads still
there. Who gets the money?

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,880
Youtube keeps it fucking unbelievable.

32
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:49,860
I'll tell you right fucking now the
number one commandment broken it.

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,580
I'm telling you, it's stealing.
There's more stealing that goes on,

34
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,020
on the legal side of business
for everybody's always
make. I'm fucking Scorsese.

35
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:00,100
He's always doing it.
You know,

36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,660
if I fuck him forever or
whatever that fucking song is,

37
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:07,120
so I could go from rags to riches.
That's what the hell it is. Right?

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,530
All that good fellas. Shit, fuck you
pay me. Fuck you pay me all of that.

39
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,850
Like that doesn't exist
in the legal world. It's,

40
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,770
it's even fucking worst
and it's more overt.

41
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,800
That is just straight up fucking stealing.

42
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,230
So I don't know what I'm going
to do with the youtube page.

43
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:24,240
I'm actually thinking of what am I,

44
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,100
why don't we just move it to
my fucking website, right.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,290
I'll reach out to fucking Miller Miller
high life. You want to fucking, uh,

46
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,740
if you want to fucking just be on all
my videos and I'll just do it on my page

47
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:39,520
and I could do say whatever the fuck I
want and not worry about somebody taking

48
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,260
my fucking retirement.
Apple sauce money.

49
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,700
It's not like I'm making
any fucking money anyways.

50
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,440
You've got to have like a billion hits,
I think to make $7. Well, you know,

51
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,160
you got to cure rate.
You'd be as they're talking to you here,

52
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,280
like a cash machine going off in
the fucking background, whatever.

53
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:58,840
Who gives a shit? All
right. You know what?

54
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,760
I am actually in a great mood
here I am in a great mood. And um,

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,280
despite that highway robbery,
youtube,

56
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,310
she call it your tube to
your fucking bullshit.

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,260
You're keeping all the
fucking money, your cons, um,

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,210
who gives a shit right at the end of the
fucking day? Well, obviously you do bill,

59
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:19,130
he wouldn't have brought it
up. I don't fucking mind. Just,

60
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,020
just fuck me over.
Why can't you just fuck me over?

61
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:26,590
Why can't you just come out and just say,
listen, we're going to fuck you over.

62
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,670
Why do you gotta to lie?

63
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,100
Why do you to sit there and
act like you're not going
to do it and then you turn

64
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,010
around and you do it. That's what upsets
me. It's not that you're doing it,

65
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,920
is it? You said you weren't going
to do it. All right. Anyways, uh,

66
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,291
bread.

67
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:45,291
Marshawn suspended for two games for
stab and Jake Dodgson in the balls.

68
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,930
So he got one game for each bulb, each
ball that he fucking stabbed them. And,

69
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,810
and uh, it makes sense. I
know a lot of people like,
well why didn't Sidney Crosby?

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Cause what Sydney did don't you see is
he turned his fucking stick sideways and

71
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:03,810
he gave him a little tap, little tap
of the ball bag, like the same level,

72
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,000
that one, you know, the doctor
you go to get a physical,

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,380
he as you cross your legs and you know,
he hit you and you need goes up. Right.

74
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,170
Just like that.
He was just testing the guy's reflexes.

75
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,200
So he gets no suspension or a penalty,
you know,

76
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,840
plus he has those big pouty lips
and everybody feels bad for him.

77
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,430
That's the genius. Sidney Crosby, Sidney
Crosby has a look on his face, you know,

78
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,940
like right before you make your girlfriend
cry and then you're like, oh my God,

79
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:29,040
she's going to cry.
So you just abandon your argument.

80
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,870
Like that's what his face looks like.
So I think that's why he's able to,

81
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,020
that's why he's able to get away with
what he gets away with. Plus, you know,

82
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:40,260
he's a superstar and he makes everybody
a ton of money. So Brad Marshawn,

83
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:44,070
you know, you live by the sword, you die
by the sword. I remember branded press,

84
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:47,370
fucking stabbed him in the nuts,
uh,

85
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,950
when we will play in Vancouver
a couple of years ago.

86
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,220
And then what's funny is to listen to
Jack Edwards when he sees Marshawn,

87
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:56,280
he's such a fucking homer.
He's just sitting. They go, oh,

88
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,410
look at all that is Blake
Lee out of the rules.

89
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:01,340
That is a delicious video
for the boys in New York.

90
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,480
Hope you enjoy your day off.

91
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,020
You're talking about
definitely a suspension and uh,

92
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,650
and then march tion way, you
know, fucking just, I mean,

93
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:14,610
he uppercutted this dude's nuts.
His stick was not on the flat side.

94
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,350
Like he was giving it a backhander,
you know,

95
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,300
he did an upper cut with the stick
to the guys Taynton Ball area. And,

96
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,740
um, like, you know,

97
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,000
when your wife tells you to shovel the
driveway and you're already pissed at you,

98
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,960
you know how hard you throw those first
two fucking scoops of snow over your

99
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,900
shoulder. That's how hard he hit
this guy in the fucking nuts.

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,540
And I got to tell you, as a Bruins
fan, I thought I was like, oh my God,

101
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,540
he just fucked us over cause he
just got kicked out of the game.

102
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:46,650
I think it was still zero to zero
against the Tampa Bay lightning.

103
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,270
And we were waiting to, um, you know,
see if we were gonna make the playoffs.

104
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:54,090
I'm like, oh my God, he just got to give
right at the end of the first period.

105
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:57,470
I'm like, he's going to get kicked
out. That's gonna fucking, you know,

106
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,590
give Tampa of little jumping,
nailed their, their game.

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,060
They're going to win this fucking game.

108
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,670
He's going to be out for the rest of the
season. And, um, and then we're going to,

109
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:09,470
you know, I catastrophize in my
head, what if we fucking, you know,

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,800
don't make the playoffs
because of that play off.

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,610
But fortunately we ended up winning I
think four to one or four to nothing. And,

112
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:21,230
um, if we beat Ottawa
tonight, we can actually,

113
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:26,090
uh, you know, we at the
very least are going to be a
wildcard. But I mean I don't,

114
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,350
obviously I don't feel like playing
fucking the capital's right now.

115
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,920
They are looking like world beaters. But
um, eventually you will have to play in,

116
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,560
but it'd be nice to maybe have a
chance to win a playoff series.

117
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,830
We'll see how we do though. You
never know. Golf tenders can get,

118
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,810
they get hot at the right time of year.

119
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,950
There's no telling how far you could
go in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

120
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,240
Um,
I feel like for me,

121
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,940
I just feel that um,

122
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,610
that's actually become
part of my vocabulary now.

123
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:59,210
Cause every time Nia watches
those fucking reality shows,

124
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:03,620
people who just go for me or Tiki, I
just feel, and now I've done it so much,

125
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:07,310
now I'm doing it. So I am officially
bill Kardashians right now. All right.

126
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,950
I'm not thinking about transitioning.
I'm not going to die.

127
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,460
What's left of my fucking, I got him.
I got my head shape now, but my beard,

128
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:17,420
I'm not going to dry diet.
Fucking jet black, you know,

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
but like the Kardashians,
I did marry an African American,

130
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
so I feel like I'm halfway there.

131
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:28,370
I think I could actually say that I'm
one of their cousins. I don't know. Oh,

132
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:30,170
I see a Photoshop coming anyways

133
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,400
to get back to uh, to the hockey. Um, uh,

134
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,220
so yeah, so we're in the playoffs for
the first time in a three fucking years.

135
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:42,740
So it's great to be in there and hopefully
we'll be thought of what tonight.

136
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,520
And uh, I bet my Sean cost
himself a little bit of
fucking money there. You know,

137
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:50,690
I would think in his contract that he
gets a bonus if he gets 40 goals and the

138
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:54,590
man was sitting on 39,
we're going to play Ottawa tonight.

139
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,920
Forget about the rest of the game that
he could have played in Tampa playing

140
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,783
auto tonight.

141
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,600
And according to the puck off podcast
hosted by Joe Part Nick on the all things

142
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:06,710
comedy network, he said that a auto has
got a lot of injuries in their defense.

143
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,330
Who knows?
Who knows?

144
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,830
So I guess what you take away from all
of that is that if you're in the NHL,

145
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,470
if you're going to fucking
hit somebody ball bag,

146
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:19,620
you do it with the flat side of the stick.
All right? You get yourself, you know,

147
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,690
some college and injections. India
lips like a Kardashians. I don't know.

148
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:27,740
Maybe they did it then.
I Dunno. Um, you know,

149
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,040
so you look like you're about ready to
cry like Cindy Crosby and you will not

150
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,410
get suspended.
All right?

151
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,160
But I guess she heard Crosby other night
fucking slash somebody and almost took

152
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,890
the end of his fucking like the guys
into the guy's finger was hanging off.

153
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,500
You know, I'm going to go out
on a limb and say that guy,
he's going to have a, uh,

154
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,650
there's not really like any of the
goons anymore. These to have like that.

155
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:52,610
That's like players like Crosby.
Students just have like security,

156
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,600
like back in the day in
like the 80s, like the, the,

157
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,410
the fucking tough guys
back in the 80s where like

158
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,900
they did everything but just have like
blue blazers on an earpiece is standing

159
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:07,260
next to the goal scores. If
you went anywhere near them,
they fucking murder you.

160
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,170
And I'm,
I'm trying to think of who,

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
who the penguins have penguins
never really had a goon.

162
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,480
They had a bunch of fucking knee breakers.
They were really into like, well,

163
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,850
we're not going to fight you.
We're just going to end your career.

164
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,870
Blow out your fucking knee board.
You and that type of ship filthy,

165
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:25,310
filthy fucking franchise. But you know,
the penguin isn't dirty bird, isn't it?

166
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,970
Sort of the pigeon of the Antarctic,
isn't it?

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,060
Did you guys hear their buildings
on luxury condos down there?

168
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,820
Luxury condos in Antarctica, you
know, the people in Silicone Valley,

169
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,440
they don't know where
else to spend their money.

170
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:41,910
They already bought up San Francisco.

171
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:46,400
That's starting to come down here to
la and a for a summer place because San

172
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,120
Francisco is so fucking cold. Um, that
the next thing that they're going to do,

173
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,020
it can be down in Antarctica.
You can look it up.

174
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:57,021
It's true luxury condos in
Antarctica and a la to Antarctica.

175
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,770
They're going to have the first direct
flight in July. All of that is true.

176
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:06,270
I'm not making this up at all because
I have a half hour to a to fill up here

177
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,420
and I'm only 10 minutes in. I would
never do that to you guys. Um, all right,

178
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:12,360
let's talk about, oh, Billy
beefcake care. All right.

179
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,050
Fucking Dad Bod Magoo who,
uh,

180
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:20,430
after his European run last summer,
whereas up to a fucking 190 pounds.

181
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
And then I kind of started working out,
getting ready for my special.

182
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:27,990
I got down to like a buck
78 finished the special.

183
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,110
And are they really specials anymore now
that there's one coming out every week?

184
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:33,270
It was just sort of
bill talks for an hour.

185
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,060
I think the sense my
special came out in January.

186
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,640
There's been 97 other hour long specials.

187
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,380
I think there's been out one out
every day. Um, anyways, so I,

188
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:50,790
uh, I got down to a buck 78, 79 ish and,

189
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:55,500
uh, and then I was just like, all right,
now I'm waiting to become a dad. You know,

190
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:58,440
my wife was in the third trimester,
so I'm going to try meth,

191
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,510
so I'm going to fucking
blame her a little bit,

192
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,970
even though I don't always just
drink it too much of everything.

193
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,940
So I got up to like a backup
to like a buck 85 buck 86.

194
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:09,450
So now last week I got
myself down to 180 pounds.

195
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:13,620
This week I wanted to lose at least two
pounds. All right. The way in is tomorrow,

196
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,680
but uh, I'll just start
doing them on Thursday. So I
wanted to get down to one 78,

197
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,050
maybe one 77.
Got on the scale today.

198
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,380
One 77.6.

199
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,270
All right. So I am, um,

200
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,640
I got one day on a film coming up.
Oh, aren't you fancy, Bill? Yes, I am.

201
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,360
I got one day at a film. So
ultimately, you know, I need to be,

202
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,510
to not get too much shit on Twitter about
being a big booze headed fucking bald

203
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:45,480
headed red cunt. You know,
which always fucking happens.

204
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,540
All these fucking actress fucking bitch
Moan and complaining like the Internet

205
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:53,220
is only mean to them. I swear to God,
fucking self involves of lunatics,

206
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,250
right?
Um,

207
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,870
I got to get down to like my fight and
win choosy about a buck 72 on camera.

208
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,020
If I walk around a buck 75, you know, um,

209
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,560
if you just see me coming down the
street, I mean I look radiant. Okay.

210
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:08,770
You're going to look at me like Jesus.
Bill, are you expecting book at that?

211
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:13,630
Look on your face. I'm fucking with
you. But I got to get on camera.

212
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,640
I got to be down to a buck 72.
All right.

213
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:19,810
And every fucking actor knows what
fucking wait you gotta be at. So you know,

214
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:20,750
and you'll all get,
oh,

215
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:25,300
you just gauge it on social media feedback
cause you're just going to get a ton

216
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:27,520
of shit.
The second you go a little power dude,

217
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:31,960
you look like Vince Vaughn in the end of
the fucking, uh, the breakup. You know,

218
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,870
that was my favorite part of that
fucking move. I love that fucking movie.

219
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:38,230
I loved how Vince did the
fucking, he had the, uh,

220
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,070
not in a relationship fucking,
you know, out there crushing ass.

221
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,690
And then when he was in the relationship,
he had that extra 10 to 15, you know,

222
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,910
the Netflix, wait, let's
sit here and you know,

223
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,330
make some Mac and cheese and play footsie.
Um,

224
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,750
I don't want to ruin the end of the movie,
but, uh, that, that's one of the best,

225
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:59,500
you know, and that was a chick flick
to cause it was about a relationship.

226
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:03,010
And that's one of my favorite things
about it was it played out in a real way

227
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:07,990
right down to the, you know, when he's
not in a relationship, he's fucking,

228
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,050
you know, he said his
fighting weight, you know,

229
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,910
I'm trying to attract somebody to
fuck me again. Okay. You were a layup,

230
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,290
so I had my layup extra 15 on, right.
That's what I'm trying to lose right now.

231
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,400
Oh Billy, lay up. Wait, so I'm
down to one 77.6 so next week.

232
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,300
The official way in is on Friday, but
I'll do them on Thursday just to give a,

233
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,510
just add a little excitement in your
life because I'm so self involved and I

234
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,890
feel like you guys actually give a shit.

235
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,580
So do a with me lose two pounds
this week at least if not three.

236
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,510
So I want to be down to about a buck 74,
uh,

237
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,150
by Friday next week and then we shoot
the following week so I can actually be

238
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:47,680
down to one 73. You know, if I
puked behind a dumpster, you know,

239
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,060
take the old fucking, you know, you know
what route? I guess she can't even see.

240
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,820
You can't even say bulemia without
people freaking out unless you're like,

241
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:59,050
it's one of the worst of the others. You
can't even use it as a comedy reference.

242
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,040
Are you allowed to, are you
allowed to say, you know, use
that as a reference. Like,

243
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,130
I'll go, I'll go if I
have to, if I have to,

244
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:11,131
I will make myself fucking Yak for
fucking a day to get down to the buck.

245
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:14,890
72 to till liver,
my line and a half on this movie,

246
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,380
Bill Burr,
King of the line and a half.

247
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,530
If you've got a line and a half that
you need to fucking be delivered by a

248
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,890
tertiary character. Did I use that
word correctly? I am your fucking man.

249
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,400
I will show up on time in shape,
ready to fucking work.

250
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:34,360
I'll show up at my fighting weight
of one 72 I will deliver that line.

251
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,870
I'll even give you a look.
All right to give me like a,

252
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:42,730
a special and special appearance
by Bill Burr, the opening credits,

253
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,850
whatever the fuck that's called, I
will actually throw in. I'll give you,

254
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,170
I'll give you the rock,
you know,

255
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,070
with one of my invisible eyebrows
that you can't really see. Um, yeah.

256
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,150
So I'm going to get down to
that. I'm going to get down
to hopefully like a book,

257
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,350
whatever, 72 whatever. Look at me.

258
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,340
Sound like the fucking rain man.
But that's the only way to do it.

259
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:04,240
And then eventually I'd like to
get down to one, a buck 68. Okay.

260
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,040
And then not do what I always do
to be like, oh, I'm a buck 68,

261
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,740
you know,
who wants some fucking cookies?

262
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,070
Let's get a fucking 12 pack,
you know?

263
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:19,440
And then I slowly but surely
go right back up and, uh, I,

264
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,170
I have to make a lifestyle change.
I just feel like for me,

265
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,330
I'm going to be a lot happier if I cut
out gluten and I still don't know what

266
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:29,164
gluten is.

267
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,540
It's some sort of chemical
that's in wheat, I believe in.

268
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,990
Evidently it's not good for you, even
though wheat is, is from the earth,

269
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,281
but you know,

270
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:42,670
there are poisonous plants or is gluten
like some shit that's some fucking nerds

271
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:47,671
made for psychopaths that have food
companies that adds to the density or some

272
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:50,050
shit and somehow they make more money?
Is that what it is?

273
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,920
They're always looking to do that shit.
You know what I mean?

274
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,090
You can't fucking satisfying these
fucking lunatic, these fucking guys,

275
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,670
the men at the top of these corporations.
You know what they're like,

276
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:03,490
they're like a bunch of fucking Brunch,
you know what I mean?

277
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:05,680
Like don't matter what they
have then Emma fucking happy.

278
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,950
You know you got straight hair now you
want curly hair and now you want short

279
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:09,784
hair.

280
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,440
You know they ain't want to wear a crop
top that you want to fucking, you know,

281
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,290
have clam digger zone. I don't, I don't
know what the fuck are they should do it.

282
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,580
Could you just put on a fucking pair of
sweatpants and just sit down for five

283
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,414
fucking minutes?

284
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,640
Do you know how hard my wife would
be laughing at this shit right now?

285
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,250
Cause I'm the one who I fucking

286
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,900
but don't look like this is supposed to
be my relaxed energy right now and I'm

287
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:35,320
still talking too fast. Whenever I
listened back to my podcast and like, why?

288
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,030
Why do I talk so fast? I thought it
would, I thought I talked a lot slower.

289
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,640
I need to have like
cocktail party energy now.

290
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:48,060
Even a cocktail party. You got to yell,
you gotta Yell over people. Right?

291
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,380
Okay.

292
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,020
I Dunno. Cocktail party,
just call it what it is.

293
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,790
We're getting away from our kids to get
shit faced for a few hours. All right?

294
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,030
And somebody's going to try
to dominate the conversation.

295
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,810
Somebody is going to fucking bring up
politics. Someone's gonna get too drunk.

296
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:06,320
Then there's going to
be a fucking argument.

297
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:08,260
Then this got to be apologies afterwards.

298
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,540
Why doesn't everybody just pick a
fucking corner of the room? Okay.

299
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay. Stare at the carpet and just,
just start drinking. Okay. That's it.

300
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,770
Why else are we here? Is it some swingers
party? We going to trade off here?

301
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:24,700
Like what? What is going
on? I don't, Maggie.

302
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,960
I don't give a shit about your worldview.
You don't hold public office.

303
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:32,230
You do not have access to top
secret documents in the Pentagon.

304
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,180
So at the end of the day,
what am I doing here on?

305
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,190
I really listening to like a nurse
trying to tell me how to fix a car.

306
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,570
Isn't that kind of the same thing?

307
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,690
Would you like to hear what I think
about fucking the Middle East course?

308
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,790
You wouldn't lot,
right then finish your fucking drink.

309
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,600
Um, anyways. Uh, what else is going on
this weekend? Oh, I'm going to be in,

310
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,470
I'm going to be in San Antonio,

311
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,640
but not one show too.

312
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,230
Two shows at the majestic theater.
Oh my God, it's so majestic.

313
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,800
They added a second show. I want to be
doing some morning radio tomorrow to hype.

314
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:14,150
That second show.
I'm doing that one show.

315
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,640
I'm doing two shows like Brad Marshawn.
Oh,

316
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm not going to fucking
stab you in one ball.

317
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,950
I'm stabbing it to not going
to get suspended for one game.

318
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,370
You're suspended for it.
I'm going to do one show for every game.

319
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,940
Brad Marshawn was suspended.
Okay.

320
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,210
Was unfairly targeted cause he in in a,

321
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,990
in a moment of emotion,
he used the shoveling,

322
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:40,991
the snow fucking technique and he did
not have the Sidney Crosby pouty lips for

323
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:45,890
when he went to the board in New York.
I think that's what's Crosby does.

324
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,050
You know, he just, he doesn't
even have to go to New York.

325
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:52,430
They just fucking put him on Skype
and he just sits there like, hi guys.

326
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,770
I'm Shari. You know, it's
just having a bad period.

327
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,020
Oh, isn't it amazing how much I could
talk without even knowing what the fuck I

328
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,160
ain't know what I'm talking
about here. Um, Hey,

329
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,870
do you guys want to know how to
change a shitty diaper properly?

330
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,560
Are there any parents out there? Here's
one to grow on. Here's one of my,

331
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,710
here's a tip for you. All
right. What happens is,

332
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,020
is when you have a little base,
yeah.

333
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,700
Say the word saint a Goddamn fucking
hard. You're going to be okay. Uh,

334
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,100
if you have a baby,
um,

335
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,130
and you're breastfeeding it as
opposed to giving it formula,

336
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm staying away from that shit.
I just,

337
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,590
I don't like that fucking name
formula at that fucking name alone.

338
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:47,830
I'm not giving my baby formula.
You know,

339
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,920
I was just picture like when those
Frankenstein movies with the graduated

340
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:54,310
cylinder cylinder and the dry out dry
ice smoke coming out of the top of it.

341
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,600
So anyway, so they bay, yeah, they got a
liquid diet going on. So when you know,

342
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,910
when the fucking backdoor comes off
the hinges, as they say, uh, you know,

343
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,560
this is the deal. The second
you hear the fucking, you know,

344
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,720
the rumblings and the grumblings,

345
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:14,770
what you gotta do is you got to get your
kid not horizontal if you got to have

346
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:17,680
them upright, all right?
Now this is the problem.

347
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:22,090
When you take them down to the changing
table, when you lay him back down again,

348
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,380
okay? And you're taken off the one Z,
you got to elevate them a little bit.

349
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:30,100
You know, as they say, shit runs downhill,

350
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,200
okay? So what you want to do is you
want to use gravity as a favor. This,

351
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,690
it's a two person job. If you're
going to save that fucking onesy,

352
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,520
all right?

353
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,350
Which you got to do is you have to have
the baby fucking standing up on the

354
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,860
changing table,
all right?

355
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,750
The other person on does the onesy lifts
the ones z up over the fucking diaper,

356
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,430
and then you take the diaper off,

357
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:57,300
like you taking the transmission out of
a car that's up on a lift, all right?

358
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,820
Then he use gravity.
Everything drops down.

359
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,460
I'm trying to be as not graphic
as humanly possible, okay? Then,

360
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,670
you know, then you begin the fucking, uh,

361
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,590
the restoration

362
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,610
because I'm telling you right now,
if you're home alone, all right,

363
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,620
and you lay that kid down den,
what? Shit runs downhill now?

364
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:24,840
What's on the ones?
You got to take it off.

365
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:28,770
You've got to go over the kids fucking
head and now you got shit on the fucking,

366
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm sorry. And this is what it is. I
don't want to put shit on the kid's head.

367
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:33,960
Yeah,

368
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,290
I tell you, it's a rough one. You know,

369
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,060
so fortunately that fucking happens is
somebody else around. Uh, I'm sorry,

370
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,980
I didn't mean to get that graphic,
but you know,

371
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,070
people who are parents are telling you,
just one person holds it up.

372
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,760
The undo the ones that you dropped the
diaper out, like a fucking trans mission,

373
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,780
you know, do a little cleanup.
Then you fucking set the kid down.

374
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,840
Then you finish the fucking clean
up. Bam. A new diaper. Actually,

375
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:57,010
you don't even do that.
You usually,

376
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,580
we just bring her into the fucking shower
and start all over again with a brand

377
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:04,390
new squeaky clean fucking kid.
And there you go.

378
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,860
There's a little parenthesis, my first
per unsolicited parental advice. Okay.

379
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,670
I just felt like for me,
I just felt like it needed to be sad.

380
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,830
Is anybody watching that
reality show? Black ink? Uh,

381
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,420
my wife watches it all the time.

382
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,190
There is a woman on there that makes
my temper look like a fucking summer

383
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:27,650
breeze.
Good Lord.

384
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:31,190
Does she lose her fucking shit?

385
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,630
It's like she's possessed.
Um,

386
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,910
I actually just literally
have to walk out the door,

387
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,810
but I know I keep forgetting this show.
I started the watch.

388
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:44,290
I watched the first three episodes and
I absolutely fucking loved it and I

389
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:49,030
tweeted about it. It was a cartoon from
Japan, I guess they're called anime,

390
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,320
which I did know that,

391
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,640
but I didn't realize it was
such a divisive thing to
say that you liked to show

392
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,800
that was anime. I feel like it is
animate like the emo of fucking cartoons.

393
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,630
Like I tweeted that,
I liked this show called one punch man.

394
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,290
Okay.

395
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,720
All right. And the fucking
responses that I got, I got, dude,

396
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:13,900
are you fucking drunk? Oh my
God. You're in the animate.

397
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,460
And then other people just like this.

398
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,580
I just like to show I've watched enough
for the same type of shit and I was

399
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:27,310
scrolling through and I was like,
what the fuck is this show?

400
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:30,370
And I looked and it had five
stars, four and a half, five stars,

401
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,790
which is why I really hope Netflix
doesn't go to thumbs up, thumbs down,

402
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,310
like I said,
because it's so fucking

403
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,190
okay.

404
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,820
You know, stubbing your toe, thumbs
down, Adolf Hitler, thumbs down.

405
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:45,280
I mean the thumbs down is this,
there's a big gap between Hitler and you,

406
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,550
you know, sub when you're
fucking tope. Um, anyway,

407
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:52,190
so I put this thing on and
what I loved about the show,

408
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,783
mmm.

409
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,180
Aside from the fact that I really saw it,

410
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:00,350
it was funny that you actually kind of
got like a sense of what young people,

411
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,650
okay.

412
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,090
Feel like in Japan as far as their view
of going into the corporate world was

413
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,550
very similar to the empty feeling.

414
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,940
Unless you're a fucking
sociopath over here,

415
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:16,410
I find like a very like common thread to
that and to basically give the overall

416
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:20,250
thing the superhero in it. He's not a
soup. He doesn't want to be a superhero.

417
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,720
All right?

418
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,600
Any fucking trained really hard cause
he wanted to be the strongest guy in the

419
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:28,320
world. And in his training, he lost
all his hair, which is hilarious.

420
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:29,970
And he's really self conscious about it.

421
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
But he ended up developing
like this punch.

422
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,490
And no matter what monster he runs into,

423
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,170
he doesn't give a shit
whether they kill him.

424
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:42,000
He's just completely devoid of
any like passion or emotion.

425
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,010
Like what happens to you when you get
shoved into a fucking cubicle and a,

426
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:51,060
and he's got this one punch and he just
fucking kid punched so hard that no

427
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:54,330
matter how fucking bad ass the monster is,
he gives him one,

428
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:56,580
somebody said they should've called
the show, the right they have Fred.

429
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,750
He gives him the fucking
fire in the fucking and,

430
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:04,340
and end the face is Eddie
Murphy says it the face, um,

431
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,450
and their fucking head explodes.
And the monsters that he fights,

432
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,260
you also get more of an insight
into where people's heads are at.

433
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,500
Okay.

434
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,390
Uh, in Japan and it was like, you know,
one of the monsters you fought with,

435
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:21,300
some giant virus sent here by
the Earth to get rid of the war,

436
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,440
all the humans because of
what we'd done to the planet.

437
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:24,760
So there was environmental thing.

438
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,840
Then my favorite one was
this guy who was crab mad.

439
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:32,760
He was half like up top and it was all
a crab. And then the bottom he was,

440
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,770
he was half a guide and
he was in the bottom half.

441
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,170
He's in his bare feet and tidy whities

442
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,680
okay.

443
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,310
And the guy's like, oh, I ate so much
crab me that I became a fucking crab.

444
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:49,100
And to me he represented the
upper 1% corporate guys, you know,

445
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,940
on some power lunch, just eating all the
fucking Sushi and just take, take, take,

446
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:56,690
take, take, nothing spiritual about them.
So he gave him the old right there, Fred.

447
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,670
And then he fought this fucking lie and
she had command of all the mosquitoes

448
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,060
and she'd sit the mosquitoes
on everybody's suck all
the blood out of you and

449
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,460
all your fucking energy.
And then it would make her stronger.

450
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,900
And to me it's like all this is a gold
digging, blood sucking whore. Right.

451
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,990
And then once she got it to do it to
all the animals and everybody there,

452
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,630
she didn't need the mosquitoes anymore.

453
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,710
She told all the mosquitoes
to go fuck themselves.

454
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:23,300
And I'm like slash this is also somebody
who becomes successful and forgets

455
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:26,210
where they come from and they look
at everybody where they used to be.

456
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,570
It's like a bunch of fucking pee on a
bunch of little insignificant little

457
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:32,510
mosquitoes. Right? It's
a lot of levels to it.

458
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:36,050
Or you can just get fucking high and
watch this bald headed dude fucking punch

459
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:39,950
half a crab in the head and want
you to explode. I enjoyed it.

460
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,470
Okay.

461
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,671
Right.

462
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:46,080
Let's do a little fucking advertising
here before I wrap up and I talk about

463
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:50,910

reading a different language.

483
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,570
I have no idea what any of this
shit is other than stranger things.

things I got to read? All right,

491
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:34,140
lift everybody.
L Y l to the motherfucking YFT.

492
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,470
You know about Lyft, right? Well,

493
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,880
it's the APP that gets you
a ride in minutes on demand.

494
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:45,090
24 seven for less than the cost of a cab.

495
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,790
Please include all of the falling
points during your read. Well,

496
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,300
if it takes too long, I'm not. If
you tried Lyft, you know what I mean?

497
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,020
With Lyft, you got, you just
download the APP, ProQuest to driver,

498
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:58,230
and they show up in three and a half
minutes on average. That's really fast.

499
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,341
You know,

500
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:02,340
unless there's a fucking guy chasing
you with an ax and that's probably takes

501
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,174
forever.

502
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,050
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through their 10 point safety standard,

503
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:09,840
including criminal and DMV
background checks. You know,

504
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:14,060
you'll get around quickly and safely
other than that other one. Ah,

505
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,740
that rhymes with mover Lyft drive
driver's are rated after every ride,

506
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,940
so the only the best stick around.

507
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:23,880
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude.

508
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,990
With Lyft, you can tip in the APP, which
obviously leads to happier drivers.

509
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,460
I mean nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a
perfect five star rating from the passage

510
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:36,390
yet it's just a better all around
experience. Bigger isn't always better.

511
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,450
Lift isn't the biggest
riding ride sharing app,

512
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:43,750
but it's the fastest growing and the
rated one I'm talking about quality over

513
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:47,350
quantity. Thanks to lift. You got
an easy way to avoid drunk driving.

514
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,660
You never have to bum a ride and you
never have to worry about parking.

515
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:52,240
A lot of people are actually getting
rid of their cars and relying on Lyft to

516
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,190
get around and you know what?
I don't blame them.

517
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,310
Evidently right now Lyft is offering
our listeners a special offer deal.

518
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,500
Get three rides up to $10 each.

punch. A fucking reference. Sorry.

523
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,100

You're a special little snowflake.

524

Take a bath and reconnect with yourself.
You don't walk like anyone else.

525
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,350
Talk block anyone out or
sleep like anyone else.

526
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,230
So why is your mattress one size fits all?
I Dunno.

527
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,030
Cause there's an average height of a
human being because it truly customized

528
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:47,440
mattress will cost you five to 10,000
bucks. Who? I didn't know that until now.

529
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,640
Go to hell.

530
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,480
Helix sleep.com answer a few simple
questions and they'll run a three d

531
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:56,530
biomechanical model of your body through
their proprietary algorithms they've

532
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:59,560
developed with the help of the world's
leading arrogant omics and biomechanics

533
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,940
experts.
The results,

534
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,660
there's a fucking robot that looks like
you walking around blowing Donald Trump

535
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,390
and eventually they get rid of you.
But in the meantime,

536
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,120
you're sleeping on the most comfortable
mattress you've ever slept on.

537
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,380
He likes sleep.

538
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,520
Helix customers report a 30%
improvement in overall sleep quality.

539
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,700
How do you tell honey tea?
I guess when you wake up in the morning,

540
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:22,010
how much better you feel and for cups,
customers, you know what happens is,

541
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:24,340
is when you're sleeping, right?
Are you going to do the survey?

542
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,870
That robot that they made,

543
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:28,690
a you comes in and fucking churchy off
while you sleep and you wake up like,

544
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:32,260
oh my God, I'm so fucking relaxed. And
then once you give the approval rating,

545
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,870
that robot leaves. That's it. That's
how they do it. And for couples,

546
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,680
they customize each side of the mattress.

547
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,560
Your mattress arrives at your door
in about a week and shipping is free,

554
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,230
All right. Lastly, but not leastly. All
this is great. I'm trying to lose weight.

555
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,600
I have to do this. Blue Apron, everybody.

556
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,370
Not all ingredients are created equal,
fresh, high quality ingredients.

557
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,670
Make a real difference. So it's important
to know where your food comes from.

558
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,240
Talk about your personal, personally. I
went to listen to the corporate boardroom.

559
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,980
[inaudible] portrait,
personal experience with Demille.

560
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,800
You'll cocktail grade your 12,

561
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,050
all how our treasured heartfelt
or cooking or [inaudible].

562
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,540
Um, this is my experience. Every
time I read it, I want to try it.

563
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,390
I've never done it. They sent me a
gift card. I'd use the gift card,

564
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,630
but I don't like going on the
Internet trying to figure out shit.

565
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,040
I put it on my wife's desk.

566
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm hoping at some point she's going to
come across it and that she will get it.

567
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:47,100
And at some point some keenwah will
show up wrapped in a blue apron.

568
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,510
That's my experience.

569
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,540
Additional points featured as
desired feature as design. Oh,

570
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,540
I like this. I get it. I get it.

571
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,780
I get choices here for less
than $10 per person per meal.

572
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,490

That's why they had the comedy. You have
to pause. That's old school advertising.

596
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,050
You can't say blue apron. A better way
to cook. You gotta be like Blue Apron.

597
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,170
A better way to cook. Okay,
bill on this take on this tape.

598
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:24,950
Did you discover the word
Blue Apron as boy? Like, Ooh,

599
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:27,380
I didn't know that was
there. Yeah, I can do that.

Can I give you three different
reads? Yeah, that would be
great. Okay, here we go.

Okay.

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,590
Okay,

606
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:50,370
a better way to cook. How was that?
That was great, Bill. We got it.

607
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:54,570
Okay. We'll see you next week. All
right. Thank you. Yeah, hang on a second.

608
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:59,310
[inaudible] this is Susan
[inaudible]. Quali um, anyways,

609
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,600
let me get back to,
sorry,

610
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,450
I was just giving you guys a little
behind the scenes on voiceovers.

611
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,880
Did you like that? Did you feel
like you were there? All right,

612
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:06,770
let me wrap this up.
Uh,

613
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,680
this weekend I'm for the first time I
think I'm going to watch an entire moto GP

614
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:14,970
race. I believe it's in Argentina.
It's somewhere down south. Oh, who?

615
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,940
Yay.
No further south than that.

616
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,890
[inaudible] action. Who the fuck
I'm getting texts from right now?

617
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,400
Oh my God, I don't remember that
person a minute. All right. Anyways,

618
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,300
Moto GP and then the Chinese Grand Prix.
Um,

619
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,800
this is,
this is a very great weekend before the,

620
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,470
the NFL and NBA playoffs start.

621
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,530
If you would like to watch
some alternative sports
sports that are not as big as

622
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:45,540
the big four here in the United States
of American. Who, who's kidding,

623
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:48,750
who are country matters the most?

624
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,710
Therefore our sports matter the most.

625
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,770
All right. People know our
star athletes around the world.

626
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,330
Nobody knows people in the premier league.
You know,

627
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,080
the only reason why we knew that one
fled Beckam guys cause they made a movie

628
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,200
about it and he was fucking one
of the spice girls. All right?

629
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,550
If he wasn't fucking some chicken, a
girl band, nobody knew who that guy was.

630
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,060
Okay. We mattered the
most. All right, let's,

631
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:20,310
let's try to have a little
more empathy as Americans here.

632
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,640
Let's watch some fucking great sports
from around the world. Moto GP,

633
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,760
if you want to watch a bunch of lunatics
driving about 180 miles an hour right

634
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:32,130
next to each other,
taking turns fucking maniacs.

635
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,190
And he also the technology and that
sport, do you know like those suits? Now?

636
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,270
I don't know how they figure it out,

637
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:39,750
but they figure out that the riders
fallen off the bike and before he hits the

638
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:43,380
pavement, pavement ideally
like the, the, the,

639
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,830
the suit that they wear has like an
airbag that just fucking immediately

640
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:51,720
inflates and protects all the vitals
in theory. You know, obviously,

641
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:55,950
I dunno if you fucking slam into a wall.
I don't know what happens then. But, um,

642
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,880
and then the Chinese Grand Prix,
the second race,

643
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,300
the second of 20 races,
there's only 20 racists.

644
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,970
It's very easy to watch this and continue
to watch all the other sports that you

645
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:10,610
love. You can tape it, you
can just fucking watch it.
And uh, the Ferrari's one,

646
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,130
the first one was Sebastian Vettel I
believe. And uh, you know, I'm sorry.

647
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,870
I'm sure fucking
the fuck's his name.

648
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,610
Lewis Hamilton is not
happy about that shit. Um,

649
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,840
and I was actually going to go to that
tt race this year and the Isle of Man and

650
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:28,680
ended up fucking falling apart.
So, um, I got to go next year.

651
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,380
I got to go next year before they
make it fucking safe. I have to go.

652
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,880
And if you've never seen that race,

653
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,070
more people have died than
years that they've had it. Um,

654
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,460
the balls these people have,

655
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,220
it's like fucking real
life mad max type shit,

656
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,910
except it's still running water and
all that stuff. Um, anyways. All right,

657
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:48,260
let me talk about my glutes. Give me a,

658
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,360
this is something I realized
as I'm rehabbing all these
injuries and my body is

659
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:57,720
that through years of sitting
on planes and sitting on cars,

660
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:01,980
like I fucking,
I have like no glute muscles whatsoever.

661
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:04,890
Like beyond the usual fucking white guy,
no ass type of shit.

662
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:08,010
It's just like my fucking thighs
do all the work. So I've been,

663
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,300
I've been doing these squats where kind
of push them from your heels and when

664
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:15,860
I'm coming down and I'm trying to have
most of my weight on my squat on my squad,

665
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,960
so my heels with my torso
like straight up and down,

666
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:22,290
not leaning forward to counterbalance
the lack of glute muscle that I have,

667
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,990
I start to come down
into a seating position.

668
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:28,740
I have to do it like over
my workout bench. Cause if I
just tried to go, you know,

669
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,330
mainly depending on my glutes,

670
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,740
I will literally fall down like
the first 30 degrees I'm okay.

671
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,010
And then I just fall down to the bench.

672
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,070
So I got to get that going.
Um, just what I've been doing,

673
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,120
I just went on and I looked
up the top 10 glued things.

674
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,750
So I'll do an alternative leg lunges.

675
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,200
I got an exercise ball up against the
wall that I put on my back and I go all

676
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:55,760
the way down to a deep squat pushing
up through my heels. Then I do the one,

677
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,370
um,
well you lay on your back,

678
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,930
your feet are planted on the ground and
then you, you lift your hips up, you know,

679
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,050
with the glutes sat way. It's
almost like you're, you're,

680
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,650
you're sort of thrusting up as
if you were fucking somebody,

681
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,880
you know what I mean?
But way up,

682
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,720
like they were lighter than air and
you could actually possibly do that.

683
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:17,420
So I do those and then I do the
alternative fucking leg lunches.

684
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,840
That's what I'm doing so far.
So, um, hopefully, I dunno,

685
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,900
I had no idea my body was so god
damn fucked up. But evidently it is.

686
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:28,820
But I am one 77.6. I'm very excited
about that. And, uh, do what we,

687
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:31,940
everybody come on the summer's coming up,
lose a couple pounds a week with me.

688
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:34,850
Cut out the chips, the cookies,
just fucking drink waters.

689
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,000
Sign up for that blue apron shit.
You know,

690
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,720
have a robot come and delivered it to
your house. Be done eating by five,

691
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,970
six o'clock at night.
And even if you get home later,

692
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:47,930
just I always try to go like fucking at
least 12 hours without eating when I'm

693
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,460
trying to lose weight
for like the last day.

694
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:51,050
Like if I finish eating around seven,

695
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:53,900
I'm not going to have breakfast
to like fucking nine. Um,

696
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:55,800
if you do have a day job,
just have like, I don't know,

697
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,460
have like a lighter breakfast
or something like that.

698
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,950
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

699
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,030
All I can tell you is what works for
me. All right, that's the podcast. Uh,

out some of the outline. You know,

701
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,570
what else was on this weekend?
The fucking man,

702
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,750
I'm the one golf tournament that
I really try to watch every year.

703
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:15,710
It starts today. So just, um, you know,

704
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:20,270
if you don't want to watch the last couple
of fucking games of hockey, you know,

705
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:22,820
I know baseball's going in that type
of stuff, but, uh, I don't know.

706
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,190
This racing stuff's pretty fucking
God. Damn cool. All right. That's it.

707
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:26,510
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll see on Monday.

708
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,293
Nice.

709
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,420
Marcy is completely addicted to skating
now and he wants to get better at it.

710
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,980
And, um, so we're fucking
then, uh, Edmonton,

711
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:29,790
the next morning we got to drive
down to Calgary and Florence.

712
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,650
He's going like this gotta be a place here
to skate. So we find out they have, uh,

713
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:33,980
they have a

714
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,130
skating rink at the mall
and I only use it a mall.

715
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:40,850
It's one of the most giant
malls in North America. America,

716
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,770
West Edmonton Mall rivaling. Uh, what's
that one in Minnesota? Mall of America.

717
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,400
All of America. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, which I've been to that one too,

718
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:50,660
so we go to that one,

719
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,500
but walking through there with a fucking
skates to middle aged guys walking

720
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:57,620
through this thing with
fucking skates and we walk in,

721
00:41:57,621 --> 00:42:01,390
there's like this giant pirate
ship. I mean like, yeah,

722
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,890
you could say all the fucking ocean
with this fucking thing. Yeah.

723
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,950
It was a flicker of official
and I look on the other side,

724
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:10,490
it was really deep water and they took
all this time to make it look like there

725
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,230
was a ship or like Jesus Christ.

726
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:15,020
I mean like you could fucking
yell was monstrous man.

727
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:17,960
Like Shaq could drown in this water if he
didn't. That's how fucking deep it was.

728
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:21,140
Huge. And then we look on the other
side and I'm like, Paul, I'm like,

729
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:22,520
is that a fucking sea lion?

730
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,640
They had sea lines at this thing and
they're like thrown at fishing shit.

731
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,240
Fishing.
It was catching or was,

732
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,120
it wasn't like people just walking
by throwing shit from the food court.

733
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:34,790
It was a trainer thrown it.
And um,

734
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,900
so we're just walking through the mall,
walking through the mall. Endless fucking,

735
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:42,830
well, they had a water park there. It
was insane. I didn't look at any stores.

736
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:44,720
I was too distracted by
the shit in the middle.

737
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,480
And then we finally get all
the way to the ice palace.

738
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,490
They called the Ice Palace and we got all
excited and we're the only people were

739
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:51,920
skates just walking through,

740
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:55,970
holding a fucking dumb skates and we
get all the way to the other side versus

741
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,310
all excited. Like, dude, I'm telling you,
I'm gonna get better at this. You wait,

742
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,190
I was getting, I was ready this
summer. He's already talking shit.

743
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,160
They were calling it right now.
I'm going to be fucking skate backwards.

744
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,860
You're going to be like, what
the fuck happened? Versie right.

745
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:09,200
And then we show up and uh,

746
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,650
there's a big judo tournament where the
ice rink is and they'd fucking put all

747
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:16,460
this floor flooring all over.
And maybe this isn't the rink.

748
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,030
Maybe this, this dude, it says
ice palace fall. This is it.

749
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,500
They covered it up. This is it.
I got upset though at the moment.

750
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,960
I remember that girl, man,
that really bothered me.

751
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:30,260
We were walking through the food
court and you know, we had a gyro.

752
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,450
Great Gyro and yeah, yeah. At Great Gyro
at this place called Jimmy the Greek,

753
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:38,660
the one complaint. And you agreed a little
too much white sauce in it was pasty.

754
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,600
Yeah. Cause it wasn't. It wasn't,
yeah, it was a little pace.

755
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:43,460
He's just got one scoop.
He went to one scoop lesson,

756
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:45,860
a little hot sauce in it would
have been hide it. You got excited?

757
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,650
It would have been epic. Yeah, we got
excited. So then I said to bill, you know,

758
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:51,470
I like a little dessert after I eat.
You know, I like a little candy bar.

759
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,970
I like a little, you know,
so I love sugar, new tank.

760
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,900
So I go bill Mann, it was the frozen
yogurt place. I go, yeah, pink barriers.

761
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,590

767
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,850
I guess you're right. I guess,
you know, I always just,

768
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:27,290
when I thought of it as a kid, I always
felt, you know, it was now, I don't know,

769
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,220
I just remember, dude, I, it's, I

776
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,950
So we too, we see two young
women walk by and we figure, Hey,

783
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:20,670
Like she did a double take, so fucking
rude. Right? And she just was like, what?

784
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,550
And then I looked at the other one
and I go, yeah, like a pink berry.

00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,730
And she kinda just like gives us

786
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:29,220
Like why are you and she fucking did.
This is what she did.

787
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:30,750
She did the classic pretty girl,

788
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,470
you're clearly just asking me this
because you want to talk to me thing.

789
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,490
And I'm like, no bitch, I want some
fucking yogurt. Okay, I want fucking,

790
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:42,450

had lunch and, and it really bothered me,

791
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:45,410

wanted to find her. I wanted to find,

792
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,330
walk past this again. They did the
loop on the fight. I didn't know that,

793
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,730
but I said to bill and we got to
the car, I go, I wanted to find her,

794
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:52,170
cause I would have just went up to and go,
you know something,

795
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:55,050
I found it and you're a mean jerk. And
then you go, why would you do that?

796
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:59,100
You're a mean jerk. That's terrible.
What am I going to call her a cunt? Well,

797
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,340
don't call her anything if you're
going to go with me and jerk. I mean,

798
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,990
you know I hate that you're a
girl mentality. That pretty good.

799
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,810
Say you're mean or you're a jerk if
you want to stay clean. But if you go,

800
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:13,020
you're a mean jerk. No, you're not.
You're not. You're not pretty inside.

801
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,680
You're not pretty inside. It doesn't give
a fuck. She's the hot girl at the mall.

802
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:18,860
Paul put yourself in her fucking pumps.
All right?

803
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,350
With two fucking locker.

804
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,230
Jackass is standing there with ice skates
when there's a judo tournament down

805
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:30,240
the way, asking if they know
where the ice cream store is.

806
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,130
Big looked at us the way they were
suppose to I, you know what, dude?

807
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:37,110
I like a sweetheart.
I don't care how you,

808
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:40,830
I would love to hear them tell the story
and then they come and then it's just

809
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:45,810
creepy. Guy Comes up like, yeah, but
that's the way they're going to hear it.

810
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:49,200
Paul. Paul, you ever watch those
fucking prison shows? What he wants?

811
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:51,420
Like the scared straight? No,
not those ones where they,

812
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,930
they talk about the worst prisons in the
country and that type of ship. Oh yeah.

813
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:57,650
I've seen a couple of,
and you just sit there watching it going,

814
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,150
how the fuck would I go in there and
not get raped? What would my game plan?

815
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,420
He gets scared watching
it in your bedroom, right?

816
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,040
Women have to walk out of
the house worried about that.

817
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,740
That somebody is going to, you
know, do just imagine if, if, uh,

818
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,330
did I had a winter hat on with a puffy
ball on top of it, holding ice skates,

819
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,200
asking for yogurt. If anything, she
probably thought I was fucking gay.

820
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,180
You don't look gay, Paul. I
know, but you're not, you're not,

821
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,860
you're beards to terrorist that you need
to get a little more metro and not to

822
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:32,740
do that. We was, we had
sweatpants on. Do we want a mess?

823
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,280
Everybody in the fucking girl?
Yeah. That's what you look my beard.

824
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,390
My beard actually fucking says everybody
on the fucking ground. No, but dude,

825
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:45,220
I don't like the pretty girl who can't
be approached with a question because Oh,

826
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,560
this guy's hitting on
me. It's, it's awful.

827
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:51,130
And you know something that especially
the blonde one who went like shook her

828
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:53,530
head like what?
She's going to be a nightmare.

829
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,400
She's a fucking nightmare for some future
guy. I'm telling you, she's a nightmare.

830
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,170
She's already selfish.
It's over.

831
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,200
What if she just knows what
she wants and we're not at,

832
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,150
Oh this is the thing dude.

833
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,840
You actually aloud like how
old do you think they were?

834
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:15,790
I would probably 2122 yeah.
You let a 2122 year old.

835
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,860
I met a girl at my age, not even a
one way. She shake it all that way.

836
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,470
Let her ruin like to do with
driving down to Calgary.

837
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,040
She ruined like got the rocky mountains
on the right hand side of the car and

838
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:29,380
you're just still calling. You're
calling her a cunt the whole way down.

839
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:34,300
It bothered the shit out of me. It was
like, why are you, why would you ask me?

840
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:38,800
How would I know? Dude? You realize how
funny that is that they did that to us?

841
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:43,330
Like what? Like yeah, they really made us
feel like shit. That's fucking hilarious.

842
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:46,390
If you look at it and father and the
whole time is cause you wanted to get

843
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,360
frozen yogurt dude.

844
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:50,920
How funny would it be if we chased him
down and I want to go frozen yogurt with

845
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:55,390
sugar free gummy bears on it. It was
still all natural, no organic gummy.

846
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,940
Because how great would it be if we chased
him down and I just walked up to her

847
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:00,760
and I go, you know something,
you hurt my feelings.

848
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,470
I just fucking broke down.
You hurt my feelings.

849
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,400
I just want a yogurt. Oh by
the way, people listen in here.

850
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:12,640
This is last week. You know,
you know, just trying to kill,

851
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,280
just trying to make jokes
to not go out of your mind.

852
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:18,570
Being on tour this fucking long is we
were doing the Dangerfield. Everything.

853
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,680
I'll tell you, I've got a friend
of mine loves yogurt, you know,

854
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,450
so we were doing that and once
that went away, that got old.

855
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,030
Somewhere along the line
you started doing it.

856
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,300
You started saying really sentimental
shit to me and then pretending like you

857
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:35,740
were crying and then that just became
like the running joke and then you started

858
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:37,930
laughing and then you were just like,
you got to do that on stage,

859
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,310
do that crime things. So now we'll just
go up and like if we'll be like, hey man,

860
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,160
I'm tired, but dude, you
know what? Hang on, hang on.

861
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,390
What you on the road has been great.

862
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,280
You're the only one I
could have done it with.

863
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,010
And then bill would come and tag it.
That's the best thing.

864
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:56,110
Bill would come and tag and
I would just be like, oh,

865
00:49:56,111 --> 00:50:00,790
I was hoping you were going to say that.
It's been,

866
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,830
it's been fucking wonderful for my anger.

867
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,340
I'm going to try to do that when I get
home and telic 10 like I'm crying, man.

868
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:08,590
It's fucking hilarious.
So two stories.

869
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:12,310
We go in to eat and we have this
Filipino waiter, right? By the way,

870
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,280
I like to play the Games where I sort of
hell. Where were you? Was that Edmonton?

871
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,920
Was that Calgary? That was
Edmonton. Yeah, it was Edmonson.

872
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,160
So I like to do this thing where
sometimes I like to fuck with people,

873
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:22,810
so I'll just get on a phone
and I'll be like, Bill,

874
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,410
go along with it and we'll be in
an elevator and I'll go, what? No,

875
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:28,790
that's horse shit. Like bill, just
look what happens. So like I said,

876
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,890
like he had a parole officer called
and he said, and bill goes, oh,

877
00:50:31,891 --> 00:50:35,560
they worked it up. And then
instantly Burgos yeah, but
what about that videotape?

878
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,670
I go, Nah, Nah. They said it's
insubmissible and like, am I the Guy?

879
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,390
If there's just a stranger, they're
right. Sometimes I break out laughing.

880
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,130
So bill calls it, he gets a
little emotional guy. So we,

881
00:50:45,131 --> 00:50:49,510
we turned this crying thing, we do it
like this has been great, right? We turn,

882
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,900
we turn that into doing it in public.
So we have this Filipino waiter, right?

883
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:57,500
And the old guy guy was great. He was
talking to us and at the end I just go,

884
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,640
he goes, here's your bill. And
I go, I just want to say so.

885
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,200
And I kept the dead straight face. And
again, you've been a great way to her man.

886
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,960
And I put my hand on his
fucking arm and I, you know,

887
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,140
you bring him a waters and bill just
looks at and goes, he gets a little,

888
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,510
he gets a little emotional, you know
what I mean? I know, but it's big.

889
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,030
It means a lot. I didn't
know what the guy had. No,

890
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:20,480
cause he was so fucking polite and
he was actually from the Philippines.

891
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,440
So he's jumped right in.
Perfectly good friend.

892
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:28,220
He gets a little emotional
like no, but bill, he'd bring
the waters. I'll do, well,

893
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,740
he was freaked out though.
Oh that's the new game on the road.

894
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:33,620
You have the best one. I've got to say,
the best one was at the airport yesterday.

895
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,550
We got to the airport yesterday and
bill starts busting my balls about my

896
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:41,600
laundry and he goes, Versie fucking
16 days and you're carrying, you know,

897
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:45,830
dirty socks and underwear. And I go,
dude, I go, I bought new ones. You know,

898
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:49,760
the dirty ones are tied up tight in a,
in a plastic bag and bill just goes,

899
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,500
just took your emotions. And
Dude, I fucking could not walk.

900
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:59,320
I couldn't walk and I had to
stop pulling my fucking bag.

901
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:03,150
I'd checked cause we were laughing so
hard. And it works though. It makes it,

902
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:06,590
it makes, it's fucking great. It's
driving a tour manager nuts. Oh yeah.

903
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:07,424
That's the one thing.

904
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,550
Well because women don't want to see
a guy getting emotional like that.

905
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:13,940
It's just, well no, cause once
somebody cries it's over. Yeah.

906
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:16,940
Like when I go out afterwards and I'm
taking pictures with people and stuff,

907
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:19,000
I always come back. I was just
saying, I got to tell you, you know,

908
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,010
I've seen a lot of people do that,
you know, doing the picture thing,

909
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:23,210
but you gotta be one of the best

910
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,670
wives. She's going, would
you stop doing that?

911
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,750
Our wives are going to go nuts cause
you know the first thing I want,

912
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:36,860
I see stays and you see your wife, we're
just going to go. It's been so long. I'm,

913
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,200
it's just so much. No, you got it.
You got to set it up with talking.

914
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,910
Like you just got to
start off normal white.

915
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,130
You're going to say something
really sentimental to them,

916
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,520
so they're almost crying and then you cry,
which ruins their crying.

917
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,250
And I swear to God, you get slugged in the
shoulder, which is all you really want.

918
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,010
Oh Shit. 20 minutes. Then
I'll tell you Paul, you know,

919
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,220
time really flies with you on the porch.
It's been so fun.

920
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,800
This is probably only funny to us,
but I don't give a shit.

921
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,670
Try it with your friends stuff. Fuck
that. If people, the game is called,

922
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,280
he gets emotional and
just walk into a bar.

923
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,330
Just have one of your friends started
hitting on a woman and then the other

924
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:12,650
friends got to go along.
Yep.

925
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,440
And then just starts welling up and
then the other guy goes on. Sorry.

926
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:18,130
He just gets emotional and you just got
to let the other person to deal with it.

927
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,130
Dude, you want it to fucking airport where
you walked up to that lady at the con

928
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:26,300
though? The little fucking I sell gum,
whatever the hell it is. Excuse me.

929
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:29,070
Do you have the, you have the, what are
the biggest night I broke out? Yeah.

930
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,790
I'll go. Hey ma'am, I need to, what
are the biggest condoms you got there?

931
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,230
What's the biggest size condoms you have?

932
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:35,660
I turned around and walked away and you
turned around and walked away and I'm

933
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:39,200
just staring at her and I'm biting my
tongue as hard as I can to not laugh.

934
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,690
And then I just burst out laughing at her.
She said what?

935
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:45,560
And then when you went to repeat it,
you to try to point to it and I lost it.

936
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:49,490
You lost it and had to walk away. Paul,
we're punch drunk out here. You don't.

937
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:53,690
One of my favorite things in this business
was opie from the opiate Anthony show

938
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,530
was he had this thing that he would do
when guys would start crying when they

939
00:53:57,531 --> 00:54:01,190
would play audio. Yeah. Oh my God. It
was fucking, his timing was perfect.

940
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:04,250
Every time someone would be
talking like retiring from a sport,

941
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,920
like when Mike Schmidt
retired, which is, you know,

942
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,380
it's very difficult to watch
these guys, you know, you know,

943
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,520
he just was ending is like 38 years ago
a little boy began a journey to play the

944
00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:20,570
wonderful game of baseball. And the
pope, he would always go, oh boy,

945
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,650
what am I favorite? And it always,
oh boy. It always meant, oh,

946
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,630
nobody wants to see a man just
completely do you know what it is?

947
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,630
I can watch a guy cry if
something terrible is happening.

948
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,740
Just don't try to talk while you're
crying. Yeah. That's the thing.

949
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:46,700
The talking and then bursting out into
Christ. Let your shoulders go. Yeah,

950
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,130
let me shut fucking crying.
But don't fall for the love of God a man.

951
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,880
He's a man. Needs to cry in private.
Yeah, you do that in the shower it,

952
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,530
he's doing it in the shower. Like
when my son was born, everyone's like,

953
00:54:57,531 --> 00:54:59,450
did you cry yet? And I'm like,
no, what are you talking about?

954
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:00,650
And then when my son was born,

955
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,220
it all hit me later and I went home to
go get stuff for my wife in the hospital

956
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:06,470
and I sat on the couch
and I didn't like weep.

957
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,833
Gotcha.

958
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,630
I didn't weep when I got emotional.
But like just fixing you,

959
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:14,670
sitting on the couch by yourself and just,
you just go,

960
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,873
that's stupid.

961
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,420
It's just completely unexpected. You
use your thankful for your podcast. Oh,

962
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,100
that's unexplored.
The effective,

963
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,810
unacceptable dude on a completely
the talk into it, right? Yeah.

964
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:36,790
The talk into it. That's, that's what the
funny thing about crying is, you know,

965
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,000
it's like, you know, you
always do this to me. You know,

966
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:40,720
you always do this to me
and I'm trying my best

967
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,930
fucking over whenever my friends die,
I've had so many of fuck it died.

968
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:50,100
I just cry in the shower. Yes. What I do,
I asked the girl, we asked a girl, right,

969
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,440
cause you don't feel like
you crying because there's
all that water on your face

970
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:57,170
anyway. No. We asked the girl, we go,

971
00:55:57,171 --> 00:55:59,240
what would you do if you're a dude
started crying. Like if it wasn't,

972
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:00,074
if nobody died,

973
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,830
if a dude and you were just [inaudible]
he just had a bad day and he just had a

974
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,740
bad day and you got into it and he broke
down and cried. She goes, yeah, no. Over,

975
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,210
over, over. Get the fuck away from me.
You know what's funny? There's some women,

976
00:56:11,211 --> 00:56:13,130
they think that they want
to see that part of you.

977
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,940
They don't get what that is to them
is that's their total conquest.

978
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:19,730
Like you know when you bang a
girl in the ass and you just like,

979
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:21,970
yeah I got this shit.
I'm fucking with you.

980
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,840
Their version. I was just like
Jesus pill. No fuck we do.

981
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,400
Their version of that is is if they can
get you to be so vulnerable around them

982
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,590
that you cry and then
it's one of those things,

983
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,020
it's almost like when the crowd screams
out of joke, they already heard,

984
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:40,890
they think they want to hear it again
and then you tell it's like ah yeah it

985
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,270
wasn't as good. Now it's the same thing.
Is that, yeah. You said something,

986
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,870
you said something about
like if a burglar comes in,

987
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:49,450
if you cry in front of a woman,
all her mind is like,

988
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:52,210
what if the burglar comes down at
this fucking guy? Yeah, no it's over.

989
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,380
You can't cry. You Strip a
woman a security if you cry
in front of her. I think,

990
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,850
I don't think I've cried if I think my
wife saw me. That's what it is. Yeah.

991
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,100
You Strip her of her security. Cause now
she's like, well I got this fucking, yeah,

992
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:07,300
this foreign crisis, this baby sleeping
next to you every night, you know? Yeah,

993
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:09,850
it's, it's over. You know
what I mean? I know you just,

994
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,640
you might as well just have a
pullover sweater on, you know,

995
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,960
walking around and then she mocks you.
What are you going to cry Bitch,

996
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:22,850
you so me?
Yeah,

997
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,380
it's fucking over dude.
You can't have that if you have a car.

998
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,380
Have you ever cried alone listening
to a song or like get, not cried,

999
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:30,640
but have you ever been like,
oh no,

1000
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:35,110
I completely broken down and I've told
three cars just weeping uncontrollably.

1001
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:42,100
I bought. Yeah, totally cry. No, no,

1002
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,130
I've definitely teared up.
Listen, as an, as an artist,

1003
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,510
at some point you're going to have
to go to those emotions you need.

1004
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:52,020
You need to be a, you need to meet to
with your instrument. No, I have, I,

1005
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,430
what was the ones like I
had this weird thing where

1006
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,630
I stopped crying at some point.
I Dunno,

1007
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:03,160
when I stopped crying and got mad more
when, when I got hurt on my brother,

1008
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:07,950
beat the shit out of me. Um, you
know, most of the crying I'd be,

1009
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:11,050
it's just like at the end of it.
But I wasn't, but I wasn't crying.

1010
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,200
I didn't cry
one time.

1011
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,270
My brother is bigger than me. My little
brother's biggest thing. Right. Big Toe.

1012
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:26,860
Like, and I remember he, I said, I said,
if you fucking take my clothes again,

1013
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,780
if you take my clothes that he did it
every day he would go into my room,

1014
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,260
we take my delta would take my clothes
and I'd come home and he gets in a boy

1015
00:58:32,261 --> 00:58:36,910
band and I need to go, I need to go out,
right. And I go, mom, if he does it again,

1016
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,760
I'm fucking hitting him. If my mom
be like, oh, you know, he and he,

1017
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:44,050
and one time I need really needed a shirt
and I'm fucking throwing shit through

1018
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:44,800
the house.

1019
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,460
And he gets out of his friend's car and
he starts walking up and he's got it on

1020
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,550
and I fucking snapped.
And my grandmother was there.

1021
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:55,120
And I jumped on him and I started punching
him and he stood up and he just goes,

1022
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,790
well, you made your older brother
cried on my younger brother. Oh,

1023
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:04,720
he's bigger than me.
But he didn't know what to do.

1024
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:07,240
He got so upset that he just got,
and he looked around, he just,

1025
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,450
he was so angry that something
needed to come out. And he just goes,

1026
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,860
what did you feel bad? And you start
laughing. Oh, I kinda just walked away.

1027
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:20,530
And you know, we laughed about it
afterwards, but to now, now he's a,

1028
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:23,370
he's a fuck a big kid. But you
know, my mom had the opposite.

1029
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,890
I got a little brother mind.
He's an animal, you know. No,

1030
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,090
my mom said she went to a,

1031
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:30,690
she went to a funeral once and everybody
was there and everybody was crying and

1032
00:59:30,691 --> 00:59:34,440
she was overwhelmed with emotion that
they had to fucking drag her out.

1033
00:59:34,441 --> 00:59:36,900
She said she had them. Uh, one of the
most embarrassing things happen to her.

1034
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:37,321
What she said,

1035
00:59:37,321 --> 00:59:41,040
she uncontrollably laughed because they
said that that can happen sometimes.

1036
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:45,780
So she's sitting there, she's, she's
sitting there and everybody's crying.

1037
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:50,280
And like she went up and she could not
stop laughing and like she and I said,

1038
00:59:50,281 --> 00:59:52,830
why? And she was like, Paul,
I just don't know. She goes,

1039
00:59:52,831 --> 00:59:57,000
I could not stop laughing and I had to
walk me out and like as she just is your

1040
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:57,731
mom?
Yeah.

1041
00:59:57,731 --> 01:00:01,530
She said because the emotions or some
bugs that they said that that could happen

1042
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,740
sometimes where it just, you just
like, she didn't know what to do.

1043
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:08,130
So instead of just breaking down,
she went the other way and just couldn't,

1044
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,090
couldn't, yeah. Controller. Yeah.

1045
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,240
Not like humans like will protect you
and a really like that's what they don't

1046
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:16,780
get sometimes when comics make fucking
horrific jokes about some bad event.

1047
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:19,450
Make good jokes. Yeah. It's about
a horrific event. So they go,

1048
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:22,720
that's so fucking mean. It's a
defense mechanism. It's, my mom isn't,

1049
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,750
my mom was a sweetheart who felt bad
and her emotions just went the other way

1050
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,220
and she goes, Paul, I felt so bad.

1051
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:30,040
I couldn't control myself should
I couldn't control myself.

1052
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,110
I hate to say this because somebody
lost somebody, but there was,

1053
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:36,800
if there was video of that. Oh
my God. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.

1054
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,470
I was saying, so I stumbled
around, I don't know, 10 or 11.

1055
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:43,820
I didn't cry for years. Years and
years and years. And I didn't,

1056
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:46,490
I didn't cry until a friend
of mine killed himself.

1057
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,300
And even then I was sad and
it's just, Oh, I went, uh,

1058
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:53,450
I was in the bathroom once
again. Yeah. And it was in there.

1059
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,020
And I remember I started to cry and then
I started thinking like, wow, I'm crying.

1060
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:57,980
I haven't cried in a long time.

1061
01:00:57,981 --> 01:01:01,790
And then I stopped because I get out of
it cause I stopped thinking about the

1062
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:06,320
Duke killed himself. Wow. Yeah. I went 10
years without a cry and then I had one.

1063
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,890
What was it? Over Yogurt? Gummy bears?

1064
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,210
No. Uh, I think, yeah, it might've been,
it might've been one of my son was born,

1065
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,670
you know, it might've been on my
second one. That's acceptable.

1066
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,250
I guess it's acceptable back in the day.
Just stood out in the waiting room.

1067
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:24,084
Right.

1068
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,890
I had a great time in Vegas other than
when I went down to the pool because I go

1069
01:02:35,891 --> 01:02:39,260
down to the pool, I'm down there
to me, it's fucking j lie had,

1070
01:02:39,261 --> 01:02:42,010
who's been killing it
in front of me and uh,

1071
01:02:42,011 --> 01:02:45,550
the lovely Niyyah and our cousins
and were hanged. Any cousin, I mean,

1072
01:02:45,551 --> 01:02:49,480
and we're hanging out down the pool and
they're doing the usual shit, you know,

1073
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,730
if you're a red head and
he'd go down to the pool,

1074
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,410
like you're just asking for people to all,
you know,

1075
01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:00,220
look how white you are. You
know, like, I had never noticed.

1076
01:03:00,221 --> 01:03:02,200
It's like I'm fucking around myself.

1077
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:06,550
I've been around myself since the 60s,
the late sixties.

1078
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,520
I know how white I am and if
I ever forget how white I am,

1079
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,680
there's always somebody
there to remind me.

1080
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:13,490
Okay,

1081
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:18,140
sorry. I don't know if you've noticed
your skin tone. What am I meditating?

1082
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:22,450
Floating up out of my body. All right,
so these people are with doe. Come on,

1083
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,740
come on in the poor and like,
I don't want to go in the pool.

1084
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,490
I don't want to go on the fucking
pool. You know, they're like, why? No,

1085
01:03:28,491 --> 01:03:31,580
why don't you want to go in the pool?
You know why? Because the fucking,

1086
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:33,650
okay,

1087
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,880
look at, look at these people. Look at
them, look at them. And you're getting,

1088
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:41,030
you're getting you, you know,
would you take a bath with all,

1089
01:03:41,031 --> 01:03:43,220
with any one of the
people that you see here,

1090
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,690
these fucking just masses of human beings.

1091
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,290
There's not enough chlorine in a fucking
pool to kill whatever the fuck they're

1092
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,950
dragging in the pool. You know, it was
like, I finally end up going to the pool.

1093
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:58,190
Then everybody made fun of how white
my fucking alabaster chest was,

1094
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,700
a da that I had to stay in
the shade of the fucking,

1095
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,260
the lifeguard's chair,
you know,

1096
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,180
you know, I had a show to
do, I'm being a professional,

1097
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,980
I can't come out stage later,
half in the bag looking like, oh,

1098
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:18,090
lot stuff right now.

1099
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,640
I've got to do my little song and
dance later on that night. So anyway,

1100
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:25,850
so I ended up getting in the fucking
pool against my, what I wanted to do,

1101
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,833
you know?

1102
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:27,880
Okay.

1103
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,960
And then I get out of the pool.
Uh, first of all, for my age,

1104
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:36,490
I am an absolutely
phenomenal top shelf shape.

1105
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:41,050
Alright,
I got to tell you the fucking,

1106
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:46,530
just the deaf fuck the humanity
that I saw poolside in Las Vegas,

1107
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,190
the fucking humanity.

1108
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:53,250
Okay.

1109
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,790
Keyword manatee.

1110
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,710
Not this gap step on a Jim Gaffigan.

1111
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,520
I just realized he used to use that
reference and I'm pretty sure he used it.

1112
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,400
I can't remember how the fuck he used it,

1113
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:13,780
but if he used it to
describe a fat pale torso,

1114
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:17,530
not really pale border, whatever the
fucking Shit I saw the side of the,

1115
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:21,670
he was dead on that.
Oh my God.

1116
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:27,800
Is there anything worse than seeing
a tattoo come of age? You know

1117
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,650
Jesus Christ. If you get
a tattoo, you better.

1118
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:35,610
You better just make the mental decision
that you're going to pay 90 x for the

1119
01:05:35,611 --> 01:05:38,010
rest of your fucking life.
Cause when you don't do it,

1120
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:41,320
I saw this guy down at the pool.
All right.

1121
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:46,620
He had like not only the worst
tattoos you've ever seen in your life,

1122
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:50,280
like the worst placement,
you know what I mean?

1123
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,340
Like you get one like on the side
of your arm up by your shoulder,

1124
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:56,520
that looks good, right on
the bicep. That looks good.

1125
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,910
You know Joe,
somebody got gets one right over there.

1126
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:03,990
Voicebox like I don't give a fuck
what you have surrounding that.

1127
01:06:03,991 --> 01:06:07,620
That leads into that part of the,
of the of the work or the piece,

1128
01:06:07,621 --> 01:06:12,600
whatever they call it looks fucking
horrible. Leg Tattoos, horrific,

1129
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,080
horrific.
So this fucking jerk off.

1130
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:21,740
He has basically the exact sort of like
tribal thing that the rock has except he

1131
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:26,160
doesn't look tribal. He looks
like an accountant, you know,

1132
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,280
and he doesn't work out.

1133
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,570
So just imagine if the
rock was his pasty as I was

1134
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,920
and it never worked down in his life.

1135
01:06:37,921 --> 01:06:40,530
But has that same tattoo
that starts at the elbow,

1136
01:06:40,531 --> 01:06:44,160
goes up the arm over the shoulder
and covers one whole peck.

1137
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:49,080
But the way this guy had it done was
it didn't cover his whole packet,

1138
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:52,710
came swinging in and went right above his,
his man nipple.

1139
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,010
So now all of the,
all of that is like colored in.

1140
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,390
So because of the pace genus of his torso,

1141
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,600
your eye is just drawn
to his right nipple.

1142
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,420
Is he standing in the fucking pool?

1143
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,560
My neck was sore from shaking
my head at people. It was,

1144
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:17,520
it was absolutely fucking
horrific, right? So, so anyways,

1145
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:23,760
um, I go back up to the, uh, I go back
up to the hotel room, right? You know,

1146
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:28,710
gotta make sure that I'm all ship shape
for my God damn show and I put on the

1147
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:32,130
news and what are they end
up doing a story about?

1148
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,030
They start doing a story
about the amount of, uh,

1149
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,490
fecal matter found in public pools

1150
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,600
right after I just got out
of a God damn pool. You know?

1151
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:50,650
And I know people always think, oh,
stay away from where the kids are.

1152
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,250
Stay away from the Kiddie Pool.
Right? Stay away from that.

1153
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,150
They always blame the fucking kids will,
ah,

1154
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:00,320
you know something after seeing
what I saw a poolside, you know,

1155
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,610
there weren't a lot of kids in there,

1156
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:06,980
but I guarantee you somebody's got a cola.
I know this is fucking disgusting.

1157
01:08:06,981 --> 01:08:09,290
But people you've,
you're basically bathing,

1158
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,910
you know what's even more fucked
up is Vegas is just like, you know,

1159
01:08:13,911 --> 01:08:18,530
people fly in all over the world.
You taking a fucking aids bath,

1160
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,240
you know, with a shot of fucking, uh,
what the hell is that shit that came out,

1161
01:08:23,241 --> 01:08:25,610
but it killed people so fast
that it just burned out.

1162
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:30,260
Everybody just ran into the woods.
The fuck was that shit called.

1163
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,120
Okay.

1164
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,090
Ah, Christ. I can't remember a bola.

1165
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,340
That's it with a shot of a bola.

1166
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,820
Okay.

1167
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:43,450
Oh, whatever. Food poisoning. I don't
know what it is. A salmon, Ellis shower,

1168
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,630
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
I'm done with public pools.

1169
01:08:46,631 --> 01:08:49,900
The only pool that I will
ever swim in again is my pool.

1170
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:54,100
If I ever get one or the pool of some
hot chick that I want to fucking bank,

1171
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:57,160
cause I have knee permission,
that's the only way it's going to go down.

1172
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:00,970
Other than that, you know, I'll
just go, I'll just go take a bath.

1173
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,270
That way I'm out of the sun. You know,
we'll take a couple of vitamin E pills,

1174
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,750
whatever the fuck it is. You get
from the sun other than skin cancer,

1175
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:15,063
I'm done with it.

1176
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:21,270
You know what America needs to implement
after years and years of calling the

1177
01:09:21,371 --> 01:09:23,830
French people smelly.
You know?

1178
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:27,760
That's Kinda like the thing when we went
over to France and saved their ass for

1179
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:32,050
the second time last century. Oh wait, did
we do it once? We did it one time, right?

1180
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,210
I can't fucking remember. So anyways,
we've always made fun of the French filed.

1181
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:40,990
They smell, they smell. If you ever
watched a bugs bunny growing up, man,

1182
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:44,830
you saw pepe Le Pew. If you noticed
he had a French accent, you know,

1183
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,830
that's the kind of shit you couldn't
get away with today because of political

1184
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:51,490
correctness. I guess they were basically
saying that you know that they stuck.

1185
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:56,850
But I'll tell you one thing that the
French have when it comes to hygiene over

1186
01:09:57,551 --> 01:10:02,410
America. All right? Is the day. All right?

1187
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,890
I can guarantee you if I ever go
swimming in a public pool again,

1188
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:10,891
it's going to be at Fred's Ellis

1189
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,350
is a bunch of Americans. I know. I've
been over to England. I never saw it,

1190
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:16,370
but day over there,
you know,

1191
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:22,310
but day is basically a car
wash for your asshole Ed. Uh,

1192
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,520
you know,
it leaves you feeling refreshed,

1193
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,360
puts a fucking smile on your face,
and evidently had France.

1194
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:31,820
She's so fucking happy.
You forget to put on deodorant,

1195
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,790
but I'll tell you right now, you can jump
in that pool. I bet they're not dead,

1196
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,650
but they're not talking
about that shit over there,

1197
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,053
right.

1198
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:23,080
[inaudible].
