5
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:17,241
I'm doing this Sunday night cause
I'm a busy freckled Biba this week.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,570
So I actually got a buddy over going

Hello everybody. How I can't do it. How

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,960
I know the Voice of
Holland, Hank, Dj Helen,

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,690
Hank on emphasis of family going

14
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,540
You heard me on the radio.
I the feeling Dj Howland,

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,060
Hank will be making many, many
more appearances. I hope so.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,600
I love that guy so much. It's not
really hard for me to play it this way.

17
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,940
A coke addict Dj. I mean that's, you know,

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,010
just think back into my past or worry.
I thought you were, will you? Oxy pills.

19
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:11,490
What were, I mean I kind of
did the whole smorgasbord. Uh,

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,870
let's get that. Where you from?
I'm from Germantown, Maryland,

21
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:17,780
right outside of Washington
DC. Okay. Sports affiliations.

22
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:20,510
My podcast listeners
have to, here we go, uh,

23
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:25,190
all crap teams except for one of them. A
Washington Redskins, Washington Wizards,

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,200
uh, and the Stanley Cup
champion. Washington capitals.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,680
I can't believe I get to say that. It's
like the greatest feeling in the world.

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,420
And uh, no Orioles, no nationals. Norman
oils in a nationals fan of cut his splits.

27
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,070
I mean,
W I grew up in an Orioles fan,

28
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:44,300
but I loved Bryce Harper and I
really just root for the whole town.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,090
So I'm,
I'm a diehard oriels fan,

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,460
but I'm also going to root for the nets.
I just want that. Are you old enough to,

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,940
to have been a Baltimore Colt fan before
they left or no, I was, I was alive,

32
00:01:55,941 --> 00:02:00,350
but I was already red skins. I mean, I
didn't think they left it. What, 82 84,

33
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,670
something like that. Uh, something
like that. 83, 84, somewhere around.

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,410
I remember it. This is what sucks is
that I remember just my foot from like,

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,440
he's from like zero to 10 it was just
three Superbowls and then at like 11 I

36
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:18,650
think we got our last one,
which was in nine red one the red skins.

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,630
And then that was just like,

38
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,520
oh we're probably going to be in this all
the time and then nothing. Well that's,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,980
that's what's going to happen
to like the Patriots and all,

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,210
all these kids who are lucky enough to
be born in the 1990s and remember 2000

41
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:36,830
was the first one or 2000 yeah,

42
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,350
2001 you know, it's going to
be like, you know, there was,

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,870
there was kids born when I
was born in 1968 and then, uh,

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,830
they got to watch Dan Marino.
I May,

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,830
but I'm just saying as far as like
just being good and competitive.

46
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,430
I was compared to Dan Marino cause that
guy was the best I ever saw man other

47
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:57,760
than Joe Montana. But even then, I
think Dan Marino with Bill Walsh,

48
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,330
she see definitely wins one.
I only remember,

49
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,540
I only remember bad knees Marino.
That's, that's where I was bad back.

50
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,520
Bad is bad. Everything. When I
got in, he was already in the,

51
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,440
in the down travels

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,450
him,

53
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,450
he came in and he was with
Don Shula and Don Shula like

54
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,340
was a man.
Sheila was a man

55
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,890
but, but by then everybody
had caught up with them,

56
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,940
stolen all his fucking
tricks and he was on like,

57
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,660
cause he was in the final 10 years of,
of going back to like,

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,010
like the 1950s I want to say.

59
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,970
He was on the giants at one point and he
was offensive and defensive coordinator

60
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,120
and the other guy was Tom Landry.
Okay. Those were the two guys.

61
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:41,280
If something like that one though,
I always forget who the hell it was.

62
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:45,470
But anyways, um, I just
remember, you know, we,

63
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,850
they went from Bob Greasy to
fucking Dan Marino and Sydney.

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,620
This kicked our ass
for like the first one.

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,400
One years of me watching the Patriots,
he just couldn't take it. And, and I,

66
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,550
I look at the dolphins fans
now, like this, still waiting.

67
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,280
I feel so for the next,
Dan Marino,

68
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,820
my cousin is the biggest dolphins fan.

69
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,720
He named his dog Marino.
Like he, he fucking,

70
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,900
everybody loves this team
so much and it was like,

71
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,420
I remember the beginning of the season,
I was like, dude, they're looking good.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,230
The winning some games and he's like,
they're going to fuck it up and then boom.

73
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,780
It's just what they finished
like seven and nine.

74
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,830
There are seven and 19 but I mean,
I can't talk. The Redskins are what,

75
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:27,070
like six and 10 I gave up once,

76
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,390
I know once all four of our quarterbacks
broken leg. I was like, all right.

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,750
I was like, we deserve it.
Racist team name we can,

78
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,200
you can't be foreign 12
with the racist team name.

79
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:42,010
You gotta be 12 and four we can't help it.

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,440
I will say this too.
I still can't believe in all of this,

81
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,540
this fucking Hashtag and all this shit.

82
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,310
The fact that they still do
the Tomahawk chop all like,

83
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,370
I can't believe it. Then all of
that, fuck it. It's so fucking bad.

84
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
It's so fucking bad.
And they sit there like it does.

85
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,550
I love when white people justify, like
it's literally a people as saying don't

86
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,431
do where they're like,

87
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:09,431
but we're honoring a hand a is
cause we committed genocide.

88
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,690
Who's kidding?
Who against those?

89
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,610
That would be like if the Germans one
and then at the soccer game everyone was

90
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:21,610
chanting, oh Yay or nay.
And you know what's funny

91
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,820
two is that Whoa,

92
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,850
he's old school Hollywood imitating their
singing and all that thing on so many

93
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:36,110
fucking levels. It's just like, dude,
what can you just, and they just,

94
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,230
they'd fucking refuse. And I
don't know. Well that's why,

95
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:43,310
that's why there's this like a
backlash now on white privilege site.

96
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,940
There's people going out
there and uh, do, uh,

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,970
just there's white people saying
that white privilege doesn't exist,

98
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:50,571
which is fucking,

99
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:53,450
then he listened to their stories and
all their stories are as basically that

100
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,840
they weren't born rich. But at no
point was, hey, I was driving down the,

101
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,980
and because I was

102
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,310
white,

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,310
I got pulled over tased and then shot
to death and then the cop got free

104
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,090
comp was released.
There's none of that shit.

105
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,360
None of this is like,
look,

106
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,150
there's to sit there and act
like they're aren't privileges,

107
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,710
those privileges in everything.

108
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,420
There's all different levels to be in
white and this and there's shit that as if

109
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,070
you're just like a regular white guy,

110
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,720
shit that you see the private
school white kid doing. You know,

111
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,150
that pisses me off. Different levels,
different levels of black people.

112
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:32,880
You know there's a hawks for
sure. Yes, there's, I grew
up, I grew up middle class,

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,591
little note,

114
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,100
lower middle class and it's just like
I had that friend that just like, dude,

115
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,820
I had a friend who was like super rich.
His Dad worked for the FDA, right?

116
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:43,160
This kid always had money.
That family always had money.

117
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,860
His Dad went into a lone star,
remember that?

118
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,860
That steakhouse where they put like you
to give you peanuts and then you just

119
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:53,810
throw the shells on the floor. Right? His
Dad slipped on the floor, hurt his knee,

120
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,770
got like $10 million. They
were already rich. Like that's,

121
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:00,640
that's the kind of shit that shouldn't
happen to my dad cause he had shit to

122
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,980
happen to my dad. I just remember
when, uh, being in New York City,

123
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:08,981
what time and there was his publicist to
fucking snapped or something out on an,

124
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,890
and she was out like,
I want to say she was out in the Hamptons,

125
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,470
long island and h or something,
somewhere out there.

126
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,360
She snapped cause something about some
club or a restaurant and she backed into

127
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:25,100
like 17 fucking people under me. The last
lash drove away. Oh, that's horrible.

128
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,970
Drove the fuck away it,

129
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,670
they got her license plate.
They knew her. She was in,

130
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,850
the cop showed up and the
lawyer was in the driveway,

131
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,150
met the cops and said she'll
turn herself in tomorrow morning.

132
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,440
I remember reading that going like,
what the fuck? How is that possible?

133
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:47,090
Is that what it's that, yeah, but so
to sit there and act like, I dunno,

134
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,380
like I five, it's fucking hilarious.
It is hilarious. It's, it's ridiculous.

135
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,040
Everybody,
the thing is back with the red,

136
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,800
I used to work in a warehouse and
unloaded trucks. It's just like,

137
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,700
I know, but there was no point. Did
anybody ever look at you and like,

138
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:06,260
you have white skin get out
of this neighborhood? Yeah.
This thing is, let him be,

139
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,010
that's the thing with the Redskins
though, is that it's, it's uh, every,

140
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,040
every like six years a
senator or a congressman says
you got to change the name.

141
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,960
And I completely agree at this point
I'm like, just change the name.

142
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:21,830
I can't believe the owner wouldn't do it
considering I honestly don't notice now

143
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:24,560
because it's just been called
that for so fucking and now,

144
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,400
but you're looking at this, you got
to look at the owner is first of all,

145
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,440
we have broadly one of the worst owners
in football because he's like Jerry

146
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,120
Jones, just that doesn't
know anything about football.

147
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:35,660
So he's fucking the team up causing
all these problems, you know, and,

148
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,990
and he wants money so bad that you would
think that he would change the name to

149
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:45,950
get all the merchandising money. Like,
dude, that's like another, you know,

150
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:50,540
$100 million worth of shit. Like that
pays for a new, you know, parking lot.

151
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,160
And here's an argument that I've been,

152
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,040
something that I've been wondering
about for a long for a while now,

153
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,320
and I think I kind of understand it.
Where in every sport,

154
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,170
I like Major League baseball,

155
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,630
I thought they counted world
series titles back to the 18 needs,

156
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,850
but they kind of,
the first one that counters in 1903,

157
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,570
which I think was the Boston red sox.
I literally looked it up last week.

158
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:16,980
I already forget. But like they caught
though all the way back to fucking,

159
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,810
uh, 1903. All right. When
it was a segregated league,

160
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,020
all of this shit, right? Like, you know,

161
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,770
crazy Lake Johnson that was fucking 10
loved him. 10 teams or whatever, right.

162
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,740
Stanley Cup were about that far back.

163
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,560
NBA titles goes back to the 1940s.

164
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,500
And even the Lakers count an NBL title.

165
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,080
They somehow want an end
and a title in the NBL.

166
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:44,250
And that was counted as a fucking NBA
title was there when they were the

167
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,820
Minneapolis Lakers. Yeah.
They're first looking off of,

168
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,760
they want an NBL and then they
want for NBA titles in Minneapolis.

169
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,240
And, uh, but they, they for
some reason caught that one.

170
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,830
But Superbowls,

171
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,840
they only started in 1968
and what kills me, Oh,

172
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:03,630
I saw you post something about
this. Yeah, it's, he's just like,

173
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:07,740
so see it telling me and people
were saying, because it's,

174
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,330
I guess because they call it a merger,
but it was like the AFL came in,

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,230
it was like the Xfl of the USFL
or the world football league.

176
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:19,640
It was just this other competing
football league and the NFL laugh gone,

177
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,690
you're some fucking piece of shit league.

178
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,020
But it was early enough on I guess where
they, you know, and they made it up,

179
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,610
moves and had enough money or whatever.

180
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,730
And then with the style that they played
that they started to compete with them

181
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,140
and then they played them in the first
two games, super bowl one and two,

182
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,690
which were called Nfl
AFL championship game.

183
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,170
And they got the shit kicked out of them
because they weren't as good a league.

184
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,200
And then then the AFL one in Superbowl
three which was still not called the

185
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,430
Superbowl, it was still the AFL
NFL championship. All right.

186
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,910
So then after that they agreed to merge
all the owners agreed in the AFL to

187
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,110
merge with the NFL.
Al Davis was the only one.

188
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:01,510
He wanted to put the NFL out of business
because he was fucking Al Davis. Why?

189
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,460
Just why you away? You got
to love them. Right. So,

190
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,590
and then at that point they just go,
all right,

191
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,260
so those first three
games against the AFL NFL,

192
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,070
that's when we're going to start like
I guess cause they called it a merger

193
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,590
rather than, but I mean like the Aba
in a way merged with the NBA. Yeah.

194
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,920
And they still count all that shit back
to the 1940 days. They own the NHL teams.

195
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:26,400
They only took some teams from the
Aba. They didn't take everybody. Okay.

196
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:29,220
But still. Oh yeah. But still it was,

197
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,240
it was a competing league that was
fucking with their numbers and they had a

198
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:38,220
more exciting game just like the AFL.
And then in the end the NBA at, you know,

199
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,570
it was losing too many players too.

200
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,660
It same way with the NFL at some point
it's like can't beat them. Join them.

201
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,411
And then they came together,

202
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,040
but they still count all those Celtics
championships in the 60s and all that.

203
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,070
So it's like you, you're telling
me that Johnny Unite John Unitas.

204
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,930
I got to look at him in a
certain way or a, in all of the,

205
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,030
in half of those fucking teams, the
browns, the rams, the bears, the packers,

206
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:02,370
the giants, all of those fucking teams
were in the NFL playing each other.

207
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,920
There was, it was actually in
a way you could say, you know,

208
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,380
I just can't say it was more talent
than, but I'm just saying like, I don't,

209
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,940
I don't get why they just wipe that away.

210
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,340
They don't fucking talk about it at all.

211
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,550
And that the Steelers with six fucking
shit and 2018 six championships.

212
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:25,030
Yeah. Like it's so fucking ridiculous
that, that the Patriots, right.

213
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,210
If we win Sunday, which would be next
Sunday, which will be fucking awesome.

214
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,600
We would be tied for the
most championships won in
NFL history and we've got our

215
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,370
first one fucking 17 years ago. That
doesn't, that doesn't make sense. You're,

216
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,550
you're, that doesn't make any
fucking sense. That's still fun.

217
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,970
I see where you're coming
from, but at the same time, um,

218
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,540
you know, we're going by super
bowl one. I, I think, listen, I'm,

219
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:53,870
I'm not a patriots fan. I
think the, in the, in the,

220
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:58,750
since they started winning them and
what 2001 was that the first one? Yeah.

221
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,740
I mean they're, they're definitely
one season two definitely. You know,

222
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,590
one of the strongest thing,

223
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:06,820
but all the people that would want to
fight and put up the fight about saying

224
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:10,860
that, you know, well I saw that thing that
guy posted. The Green Bay has liked it.

225
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:14,530
We've got like 14 or whatever,
but he is green bay though.

226
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,580
Green based won four super bowls and
they won like fucking 11 NFL titles.

227
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:22,690
They've been winning the
entire fucking time. Yeah.

228
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,100
But there's Emma one in a minute.
I mean,

229
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:25,780
how long has it been says Green Bay's one.
What was that?

230
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:29,410
2005 something like that. And I was
like nine or 10 or something. Okay.

231
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:32,290
You're right. Yeah, but well I'm
not talking about that with that.

232
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,200
Well then why would you fucking count
the Broncos having won in 20 years?

233
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,960
So what those there's don't
count. No, they no, they count.

234
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm just saying they count.

235
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:42,730
But I just thought you were getting mad
about somebody posting that Green Bay

236
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:46,870
had x amount because they were enclosed
and the earlier one. That's my argument.

237
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:50,650
They should keep those. Yeah.
But those should fucking count.

238
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,610
If the fucking Montreal Canadians can
count when they fucking beat somebody

239
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:58,250
playing on a pond. Oh, I didn't know which
angle you were going with. Oh, sorry.

240
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,100
I thought you were going against,
I thought you were saying door.

241
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,140
Octos gamble foray. Oh, okay. Then
I love the history of the game.

242
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,270
The NFL has been the NFL and a bunch
of fucking leagues have tried to to,

243
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:13,540
to compete with them. They've
never, they've never been able to,

244
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,320
the best you ever had was
the AFL merged with them,

245
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,490
but it was still called the NFL.
It wasn't called the AFL.

246
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,190
It wasn't called the NFL. Slash AFL,
like Sirius Xm or whatever. And right.

247
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,740
It was called the fucking
NFL. You joined the NFL. Yeah.

248
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,820
So those other championships
were NFL championships.

249
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:36,130
That's cause now you call it
the fucking super bowl. Sure.

250
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,060
It was still the two best teams and
those, you know, before the AFL existed,

251
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,190
those were the two fucking best teams
of who that fucking classic giants,

252
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:49,450
colts game played in fucking Yankee
Stadium. The winner of that, it can't,

253
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,360
can't fucking walk up to somebody
who super bowl four and said,

254
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:55,420
I know what that feels like.
They know exactly what it feels.

255
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:58,090
There's a lot of people are dying off
but yeah, they know what it feels like.

256
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,610
100%. That's a great point. They are
dying, dying but I dunno, I count them.

257
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,230
I that the Green Bay packers are the
fucking New York Yankees and I think the

258
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:13,150
giants and next, and that's the way
it should be. Did I think it was,

259
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,570
well the Redskins are up there. The
Redskins have, we have no, you've got,

260
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,250
you might get three.
And then we had,

261
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,930
I think we had like four other world
championship ones too. All right.

262
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:27,590
I'm going to give you some trivia.
Where did the rams first started? Um,

263
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,670
the city
St Louis.

264
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,710
No, cause then I knew it was
with Los Angeles. I don't
fucking know Jesus Christ.

265
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,290
You know, you just started like
me in math class a long time ago.

266
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,120
That's what I love about you is that for,
I know, I know sports, but dude, you know,

267
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:49,720
fucking sports like you,
like I can imagine.

268
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,390
Fair point.
Because I used,

269
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,360
I used to no fucking everybody in the
league and I just don't have time anymore,

270
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:55,200
so I don't know.

271
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:59,140
But they started off in Cleveland and
I've never understood why they were called

272
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,300
the rams. I don't know that there was
any rams in there. Um, all right, let's,

273
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,350
let's look up.
What am I looking at?

274
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,590
Washington red skins.

275
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,260
What's your fight song?

276
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,420
Hey,
hail to the Redskins.

277
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,630
Dory Braves on the war path.

278
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,360
Fight for Oh, daisy. Oh, there you go.
And then it goes into some weird thing.

279
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,350
Brandon doesn't jump in there.
And Lad Ball,

280
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,690
Steven Dapa Dupa led the point,
so,

281
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,380
all right.
Hey,

282
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,360
go NFL championships pre 1970 merger.

283
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Uh, you got to five. Pretty good.

284
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,260
I'll take it. Yeah. So you got five.

285
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
So right now as far the way I look
at your tie with the Patriots,

286
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:52,150
we've got five super bowls. You
got, you got five champion. We have,

287
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,150
we have five championships and we should,

288
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:58,140
everybody thought like you cause a lot
of, you know, there's a lot of people,

289
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,570
you fucking people have ever said that.

290
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,430
No, I completely agree with
what you're saying. If he,

291
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:10,290
if the one before it was the official
Superbowl, it's still a championship.

292
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,540
Unfortunately a lot of
those people have died.

293
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,440
Yeah. Who would care, I guess.
Um, let's see. Yeah, yeah, Eh.

294
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,310
All right. Uh, Le League
championships. All right.

295
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:28,210
The NFL champ pre 1970s,
um,

296
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,860
the giants won four,

297
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,390
so they've won 40 NFL titles and
they won four super bowl ties.

298
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,930
Those you go to the stadiums, they
had no way to be found then. No,

299
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,440
they're not listed.
It's like it never fucking happened.

300
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,850
See the angle you're coming
with right now, and I respect
the, what you're saying,

301
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:47,070
dude, 100%. That's not fair.

302
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,250
I'm not saying it's not fair. Not
Fair. I'm just, I'm just asking why,

303
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,280
why won't you dude, lead
championships. Chicago bears. Okay.

304
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:04,281
They want fucking nine
19 2119 323340414346,

305
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,390
1963 and then he won a Superbowl in 1985
and all they have is one fucking banner

306
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,690
hallway hanging over their stadium.

307
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,420
Check one of the scores when they beat
the Redskins in one of those league

308
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:18,340
championships. It's like, it's
like crazy fucking lopsided.

309
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,410
70 to like 70 to eight from not mistaken.

310
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,070
So I don't know a lot about sports,
about facts, but I do know that,

311
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,330
that that is right. All right, let's
look up the uh, Los Angeles Rams.

312
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,910
All right. And your fire, you nervous? Are
you nervous about Sunday? Oh yeah, always.

313
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,940
I'll tell you what's the funniest thing.
My uh, verse, he texted me and he's like,

314
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:45,900
dude, Todd Gurley, is it Todd Gurley
tug earlier? Yeah. He goes, he's heard.

315
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,190
And in my head I'm like,
dude,

316
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:52,191
there's no way to stand up comedians
know the injury status of the key running

317
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:56,370
back for the rams if praise. I
got a guy on the inside. Yeah.

318
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,240
Who's your guy in the inside?
espn.com this is my, if,

319
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,220
if he was really fucking hurt, we wouldn't
know. They would keep that under wraps.

320
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,210
But he was hurt in the last game. I saw
them on the bike for a little bit. I know,

321
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:12,270
but here's the thing, what is
everybody's hurt this time of year?

322
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:15,210
They all said he's got to
fucking ruins of book cover.

323
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,480
He's going to fucking play.
If they are leaking it out that he's hurt,

324
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,530
that means that he's,

325
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:22,560
he's way better than they thought he was
going to be because that's just good.

326
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,470
Always hurt and like, but they know
Bella check is going to be like, well,

327
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:29,670
I guess we don't have to
prepare for Todd Gurley. Um,

328
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,660
but it's just funny that, oh no,
he showed up. Yeah. All right.

329
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:36,570
And it fell championships
pre 1970 the rams,

330
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
they wanted 45 and 51 and then they
won in 1999 and they were the y'all

331
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Cleveland Rams from 1936 to 1942 they
took 43 off to finish off the Germans and

332
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:53,241
the Japanese 1944 1945 that was the
last year and then they moved to Los

333
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:53,911
Angeles.

334
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:58,911
They stayed there until 94 came back to
2016 which brings me to something I was

335
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:03,120
making fun of and let, did you see, do
you watch the saints ramps game? I did.

336
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,451
All right.

337
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,450
Everybody thought the worst fucking
thing in that was that fucking helmet to

338
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,130
helmet?
No pass interference call.

339
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,270
The worst thing in that game was when
they cut to the stands after the rams won

340
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,070
and you saw those guys in the rams
jerseys in their twenties maybe early

341
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,660
thirties crying. I saw that, yes. Yeah,

342
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,930
I did see the girlfriends
were trying to come for them.

343
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,320
It's just like buddy [inaudible].

344
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,100
You were fucking two years old
when they moved away. Like what?

345
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:26,934
What are you doing here?

346
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,480
You can waiting since 2016
it says that, listen, you're,

347
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,330
you're fucking pill. Ryan went belt
when you, cause if you remember how,

348
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,650
what happened when we watched,

349
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,000
because you watched the caps game with
me when they won the cup where you are on

350
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:42,721
my computer.

351
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:46,110
I was in London or in London than I was
facetiming you so you could watch the

352
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,380
game if you,
everybody was asleep

353
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,550
and I was a pitch black and I
was in the bathroom of my hotel.

354
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,990
My wife and daughter was sound
asleep and I was going to it.

355
00:20:56,991 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm so happy for you just did.
And I was sitting there going like I did.

356
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,150
I was facetiming with you and you,
you had your fucking TV.

357
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,510
Congratulations Buddy. Like
your husband. I know it,

358
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,520
but my wife probably thought I was
in there talking to a hooker. Okay.

359
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,730
Everybody's asleep. Oh
man, it's so beautiful.

360
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,780
It's so beautiful.
But what was apple?

361
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,020
What was so funny is if
you would have seen me,

362
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:30,800
and I mean like I remember in
[inaudible] 91 with the Redskins won,

363
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,770
but I remember the day
after because my mom,

364
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,380
like I was watching the game and
then the uh, my mom made a bunch of,

365
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,240
of her famous Super Bowl Chili and I ate
a bunch of it and then I fell asleep in

366
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,270
a laundry basket.
Uh,

367
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:48,500
I was 11 and then I didn't get another
championship until this caps one.

368
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,460
And we were watching it together
and you were facing the screen.

369
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,020
And I remember I was just like cheering
as the clock run down and then the

370
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,280
member,
it stopped for a second,

371
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:00,710
there was like a stoppage of
play or like 0.06 seconds.

372
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,300
So I was screaming and then I got
quiet and then they win the game and

373
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:09,110
everybody's running on the ice and I'm
just dead silent. I thought, I was like,

374
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:11,240
am I dead inside?
Like what is wrong with me?

375
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,500
And then they brought
the cup out and dude,

376
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,180
I just started weeping,
just weeping dude.

377
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,680
Just like, I can't do it.
Why does it matter so much?

378
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,990
It's so soon. It's sky, it's everything.
It's just all the, it's all dude.

379
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,730
It's everything. It's all the, it's
all the, it's all the, you know,

380
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:32,790
the Times that they,
they,

381
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,550
they chunked it before when they were
supposed to win and all the times then,

382
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,710
you know, they, they did,

383
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,720
she put so much into it and to
finally get it just was so sweet,

384
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:47,370
man. And it was like, I started
thinking about like, this is great.

385
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm going to go really like
John Cougar Mellencamp here.

386
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,300
But like I thought about all like the
middle class people that live in the

387
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:57,440
Washington DC area that worked these
dead end jobs and then they just,

388
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,520
they get that championship cause they
want it so bad and that, that team,

389
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:03,590
whether it's the Redskins
and the caps or whoever,

390
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,360
it's like that's what they have to, to
hold them escape. And so I, you know,

391
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:12,470
I wouldn't say spring senior team
raise the cup is just like, I, I,

392
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,770
I kind of was just like, I don't think
I'm ever going to see the Bruins steward.

393
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,020
And when they finally did it,

394
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,830
I watched him from 1980 to 2011.
That's how long it took me to,

395
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:26,050
what's that 10 2031 years? 30
ones I watched him. And um,

396
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,720
so from age 12 to a,

397
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:34,721
what does that 43 when they
finally they finally did it and uh,

398
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,350
I,
I was,

399
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:41,060
I told this to before I was at the Chicago
Theater on Jim Norton's tour with Jim

400
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,061
Breuer,

401
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:46,061
David telling myself from this tour called
the antisocial tour and I watched the

402
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:47,280
first period and a half.

403
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:51,090
Then I went on stage and then when I
got off stage I watched the final seven

404
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:55,800
minutes upstairs in one of those where
the green room is something like that.

405
00:23:55,801 --> 00:24:00,801
And I remember being up there by myself
cause none of them cared because it

406
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:02,581
wasn't their team.

407
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:05,340
And the show ended and they went out to
do the meet and greet and I stayed up

408
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:10,050
there and there was like a three minutes
left and they scored a goal or it's

409
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:12,210
just not enough time for
the other team to come back.

410
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,980
Vancouver and I was by myself
and my eye went up like 900

411
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,870
because I was like,
and I

412
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,830
and all I wanted to see, they
were like, hey, like come on,

413
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,430
you got to come down from a
meet and greet people saying,

414
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:27,360
where the fuck are you calling you a
phony finance? I was like, wait, nice.

415
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,980
I just had to see him lifted
up and I told my wife to tape,

416
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:33,550
but I knew she was taping it and just
when I saw Zidane or just lifted,

417
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:34,384
I'm just going,
right

418
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,903
dude,
that was

I was watching you read that and like
you just keep going when you make the

560
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:20,310
mistake. And like when I tried to
tape stuff like that, if I like,

561
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,890
if I fuck up at all, I just like,
I'm like, all right, God dammit.

562
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,260
And I just like to have to start over.

563
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:29,220
It's a seeing you do it so effortlessly
perfectionist where you're so

564
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,460
comfortable doing it. Well, I do.

565
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,240
I've established right out of the
gate that I'm a moron in front of it.

566
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,220
Yeah.
It's like an idiot.

567
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,240
Bill Clinton saw it happen and Gary Hart
and you just got out in front of it.

568
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:45,720
They would just like, did
you? He was like, I fucked
them all. And then he fucking,

569
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:48,570
you know,
but then he went back to his old ways.

570
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:53,550
I did not have sex with that woman.
That's a good Clinton did. And I,

571
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:55,260
if I say if I went,
I,

572
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,940
I do not have problems reading out loud.
Like that would be the end.

573
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,510
I would get impeached. Sure. That'd be a,
you know, I wouldn't leave just like him.

574
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,900
I need to leave my flaws in. That's
what it taught me to do. Yeah.

575
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,500
I do have a podcast. Uh, I love it. Bill,

576
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:11,640
I'm telling you I love
this and more than the 500,

577
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,570
the 500 it's about stock car race.
It is not about that.

578
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,020
It is about the 500
greatest albums of all time.

579
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:22,650
I'm going through rolling Stone
Magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums

580
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:26,280
starting at 500. Working
my way down to one. Uh,

581
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,170
each week I sit down with a
comic actor or musician now, uh,

582
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:31,721
you know,

583
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:36,450
and I give them a week with the record
and then I break the record down and we

584
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:40,710
sit down and talk about it is kiss cut.
One of them I just did,

585
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,890
I just did with Jeff Ross kiss
destroyer. I was going to say, you know,

586
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,970
you could've got Steven
Adler. Ah, I've got, he loses.

587
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,460
I would love to get Steven.
Dude,

588
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,250
I love this so much man.

589
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,150
Like cause it's not just being able to
sit down and talk with my buddies about

590
00:34:57,151 --> 00:35:00,840
the album and ask them questions around
like the meanings of the songs and the

591
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:03,630
facts from the record. But Dude,
since I've started doing this,

592
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,470
like I have listened to music than I
thought I would never listen to who didn't

593
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:11,730
even know about and it's like touching me
and it's just so incredible. Right now.

594
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:15,430
I'm listening to Steve Earle Guitar town.
You ever heard of him?

595
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,870
This guy is fight. He's
like, he's like the key.

596
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,470
This is like his born in the USA,
but country record dude,

597
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:26,220
I never listened to country.
I fucking love this record dude.

598
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,330
When did it come off?

599
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,390
1985 and he has a song
called guitar town and it's,

600
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,310
it's just,
it's just incredible.

601
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,260
I mean especially once you
know the history of this
guy and like how he dropped

602
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,020
out of school and then went to
Nashville like you know, to,

603
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,890
to find Townes van Zandt and like
was writing songs for people.

604
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:46,450
And then the record company was like,
all right,

605
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:49,940
well we want you to make a record.
And he was like, all right. And He's,

606
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,440
he just sat down and wrote the first
song and the last song and then just the

607
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:56,650
whole album came together. But
it's like, that's what I love.

608
00:35:56,651 --> 00:36:00,250
How many albums does he f well he's
got to shed load. How does he decide?

609
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,900
I would listen to anything else.

610
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,390
So he must be real quality cause I don't
know who he is. You know what I mean?

611
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,490
Cause I figured like if I know who
country person is for the most part,

612
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:15,960
they suck because it's going to be like,
you just know like the pop kind of,

613
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,270
here's the thing though. You don't
know. It's like, you know, like if, if,

614
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,480
if you were, I dunno if somebody
say name is speed battlement

615
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:29,520
metal band. Everybody would
know a motorcycle. That's
right. You would say motors.

616
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,800
Motors, sickle, our favorite band.
No, this is, this is the thing.

617
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,670
The guy could have been like enormous.

618
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:40,630
But then he developed like a drug
problem and then kind of fell off.

619
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:45,420
And now he actually still makes
music but a country, the country, uh,

620
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,660
fan base doesn't really fuck with him
anymore because he leans very left.

621
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,470
And I was actually watching
a documentary of his,

622
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:57,460
cause I'm getting ready to record the
episode with Tom Everett Scott from that

623
00:36:57,461 --> 00:36:59,570
thing you do. Um, he played the drummer,

624
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,990
you remember when he came
and did it at the gym. Um,

625
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,120
and you look at the youtube comments, you
know, of this documentary. And it's like,

626
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:11,530
I used to like his music, but he's a
fucking stupid left as liberty card.

627
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:15,850
And it's just like, because they
can't accept that, you know,

628
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:18,880
you can play country music
but still lean towards yes.

629
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,250
Also, why I think, you know,

630
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,510
you shouldn't be constantly putting out
your political opinions. Like, listen,

631
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,930
I just completed, I didn't complete.
I make fun of people, you know,

632
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:34,310
the white privilege thing. I like
this. I make fun of feminists and shit.

633
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:39,110
I tried to be like even handed
or whatever, but uh, you know,

634
00:37:39,111 --> 00:37:41,030
all you do is just like nobody.

635
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,050
All you do is get people who
agree with you to agree with you.

636
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:49,670
And then people who don't agree with you
too now hate you and not want to watch

637
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,780
something that you do because
they can't separate the two.

638
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,620
I can stay at a fucking Trump
hotel and not like Donald Trump.

639
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,550
And a lot of people can't get
past that because in their minds,

640
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,350
the people who run the Sheridan,

641
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:07,130
who were also billionaires for some reason
didn't vote for Donald Trump. I said,

642
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,670
they're all there. They're all the same
fucking pig. Get a hundred percent yeah,

643
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,690
by not dead to mention like it's just to
just painful his name outside the thing.

644
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,320
It's not like living and it's, I've been
in a Trump hotel. They're extremely nice.

645
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,070
They're incredible. They're
incredible. Yeah. I said Nice. I mean,

646
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:24,950
everybody knew what I meant. You didn't
have to one up me and say incredible.

647
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:29,290
It was incredible. I've only stayed at
one. It was fucking fantastic like this.

648
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,910
I want opinion. Incredible.
What this guy should be doing.

649
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,430
Fuck yeah, dude. Fizz to
stick to hotels. Residency.

650
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,930
Was he competent as his fucking
hotel? I made this, this, this.

651
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:41,860
We would be back.

652
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,160
He would make it great again if it's tax
cuts were as good as his bath towels.

653
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:51,040
I made Cobb the fuck. You know what? I
was bringing front of it the other day.

654
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,580
Somebody said like there was some, I guess
it was some sort of taxing out there.

655
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:57,760
If you make $11 million or more and
people would make $11 million or more.

656
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:01,120
We're complaining. Oh yeah. So, uh,

657
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,740
somebody had tweeted that, you know,
hey, you know, this is fucking bullshit.

658
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:08,830
Just pay your fair share so
it makes $11 million a year.

659
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,440
It doesn't work any harder than
somebody who makes 20 grand a year.

660
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,120
And I was fucking dying
laughing. I was like, oh yeah,
they do. Yeah, they do. Yeah,

661
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:20,140
they do.
You wonder why a guy make it $11 million.

662
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,660
He's getting a fucking divorce
is cause he never sees his wife.

663
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,620
That's why it's true. That's why
it doesn't see his kids has a pool,

664
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,120
never been in it. And it's just like,
yeah, there's this 24 fucking seven, I,

665
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,130
I've made 20 grand a year.
You always great.

666
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,700
It's the second the fucker whistle blows.
You don't even think about that job.

667
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,540
But once I think nobody calls
you up, hey bill, uh, tomorrow,

668
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,340
when you unload the boxes,
could you maybe do it?

669
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:46,000
Then we need to get to have a fucking
conference calling how you unload the

670
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:46,720
fucking truck.

671
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,870
It's just as people don't think that
people think of like when you think

672
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:51,310
somebody makes 20 million a year,

673
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:55,210
like we just know shit from
like Falcon Crest and dynasty,

674
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:57,460
all those shows and they're like,
they don't do anything. Yeah.

675
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:02,080
To hang out in country clubs and
they piss on us $20,000. Yeah.

676
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:05,400
And you have pay petty fights with
people within your family. Yeah.

677
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:09,100
That's all they do. Like nobody sees
them like, you know, in the office from,

678
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:13,300
you know, from 6:00 AM until like
3:00 AM and then they go home,

679
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,790
like walk into their kid's room,
the kid's sleeping,

680
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:20,470
they single teardrop falls and then they
go bang the maid and go to sleep. Yeah.

681
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,900
It's kind of what I, that's what
I assume happens. I have no idea.

682
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,900
I grew up lower middle
class, but I love, I,

683
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,700
what I love about this podcast is that
I would do this if nobody was listening

684
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:35,080
because I wanted to
listen to these albums.

685
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:39,610
And I started to, um, I was just
going, I want her to feel inspired.

686
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:43,180
I think I was just musically tapped
out and, and I was like, all right,

687
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:45,940
I'm going to listen to an album a day,
over 500 days.

688
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,180
And I started posting about it
and when I got to like four 98,

689
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,360
which was like on the third
day, Jim Jefferies reached
out to me. He's like, dude,

690
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:58,450
he's like, that stone roses record is one
of my favorite records. He's like, oh,

691
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:02,440
the stories that I think of when I hear
that music and then it like hit me.

692
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,930
And I was like, that's the podcast I've
been waiting to do. It was a great voice.

693
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,120
He can sing.
He's incredible voice.

694
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,860
Uh, but he came on and he
did and he did that episode.

695
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:17,380
And that's basically what
it is. It's like, you know,

696
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:21,220
we're going to go through these great
records and we're going to talk about,

697
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:22,054
and we're gonna,
I'm gonna,

698
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,810
I'm gonna ask you to need more
than a day to listen to an album.

699
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:28,390
And then I give them a week. He
just pointed right at me. No. Oh we,

700
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,150
I give you a week. Oh yeah.
Well you did it. You did.

701
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,300
I thought you only took a day to listen
to it because you're so busy because

702
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:38,020
you're making $12 million.
So you're out. Um,

703
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,420
how can $1,000,001 11,000,001,

704
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,550
so that was the one who complained.
I could tell it was you, that was so,

705
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:51,610
but what it is is like I give every comic
or act or whoever it's going to be a

706
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,680
week with the record and then I break the
album down and like ask them questions

707
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,980
about their life using the meaning of
the songs, the facts from the record.

708
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:02,630
So,

709
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,410
so the album is really just like the
celery and the carrots and the onions have

710
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:09,710
the soup. But it's really just, you know,

711
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:14,600
the basis for me to have a really funny
or deep or whatever the fuck it is.

712
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:17,840
It's just a good conversation
when you run out of those albums.

713
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,180
And I already over that.
No, I know how you'd do it.

714
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,910
Do you do the 500 albums?

715
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,550
That should have been in the top 500.

716
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,480
That'll be 9.61 years.
And uh,

717
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,770
that's not a bad idea, but
I might just be, you know,

718
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:38,660
I think I'm going when I
retire it on May 31st, 2028.

719
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,100
Oh, that's what I was going to have it.
My goal is on the final episode to have,

720
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,180
uh, Oprah. I don't know why, but
it's just shits my white whale.

721
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,690
What's the number one sergeant
pepper's lonely hearts club band.

722
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,490
Then it's, then it goes a
number one album, number one,

723
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:59,510
and then number two is pet sounds.
And then number three,

724
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,260
I think his revolver,
uh, this is white rock.

725
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,290
The number one white rock in the top 10
know Marvin Gaye's in the top 10 Marvin

726
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:14,160
Gaye is number six. Marvin
Gaye, what's going on? But
it's, it's all over the place.

727
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,910
The album 500 was outcast,
Sequenom and I,

728
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,300
and then for lunch I'll be saying is
because the Beatles who really went rogue

729
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:26,480
and started their own Beatles where
essentially a boy band and then they,

730
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,100
that they took control of their,

731
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:31,490
Chris was a lot of people because the
Beatles now get a ton of shit by people

732
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:36,020
being like, you know, I like they,
there's like people who think they stink.

733
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,990
Like I've, I've listened to
two things to beetle stink.

734
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,850
Dumb people will their dumb. Yeah.
I'm not saying you can't be into them,

735
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:46,910
they don't move you or whatever. And
it's been a long time, but that, that's,

736
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,410
that's like Saint Count Basey steaks or
something like this. No, it's just a, hey,

737
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,780
no. Yeah, he don't leverage. That's
the thing is that somebody like my age,

738
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:56,230
I'm 39 like I, I, you know,

739
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,230
was born in 79 so I wasn't really
alive during the Beatles era.

740
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:02,510
And from what I've been told
and everything I've read,

741
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:07,511
like there will never be an artist
as big as the Beatles were like,

742
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:10,370
they were enormous. Like, well, this was,

743
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,400
they broke out of what usually binds you
and they took control of their career

744
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:21,110
and started their own label. And then
when they should have fizzled out,

745
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:25,160
they made this left turn
with a reinvented themselves,

746
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,721
you know,

747
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,690
when they started doing drugs and grew
their hair and all that shit and rubber

748
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:32,160
soul and then, yeah, in revolver

749
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,550
and all that stuff.
And then when that kind of went to,

750
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,070
they will now what the fuck do
we do? It's like, all right,

751
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:41,880
let's just play characters
now will be these, these guys.

752
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,960
How would these guys do that? So
during that time, Marvin Gaye,

753
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,370
I think he was stuck in the
Motown shit and he's got to sing,

754
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:54,180
but they're writing for him.
And by the 70s you know,

755
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,000
he was doing what they did as far
as he kind of broke ways like, well,

756
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:01,590
I want to sing about what I'm thinking
about rather than doing my version of,

757
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:02,880
she loves you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

758
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,250
Well he's doing like heard it through
the grape vine and all that stuff,

759
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:06,920
which I still love all those songs.
I mean,

760
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,370
but then he wanted to go like deeper
so maybe they think that that that's

761
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,650
because when sergeant
pepper I was actually,

762
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,450
what's going on is a better record
than that. Sergeant pepper. Yeah.

763
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,800
I mean it's Ellison.
All of these,

764
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:25,680
all of this whole list is completely,
you know. Yeah. All over them.

765
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:29,590
It's designed to do this. You got
like, because of the way they made it,

766
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:31,590
because I'm already had this
discussion with people. It's like

767
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,740
what is it? It's 20 years ago
today. It's such a bad job.

768
00:45:35,741 --> 00:45:39,640
The bad and the play that are
going in and out of style. God,

769
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,560
mosquito larva down the down
to

770
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,060
ski but diva ski but do boot do.

771
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,100
Yup.
Something like that.

772
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,160
One of the best moments we've had on
the jam is when Jim Jefferies sang that

773
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:57,720
first time he did it,

774
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:02,721
he did sergeant pepper and then into
with a little help from my friends and he

775
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:08,061
was wearing a jacket that he bought at
John Barbados that the only reason he

776
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:11,520
bought it,
it's the gaudiest like most expensive,

777
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,890
weirdest Jackie you
ever seen in your life.

778
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:18,630
And it costs like $10,000 and he only
bought it because he was at this John

779
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,120
Varvatos like event and he
put it on to laugh about it.

780
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:24,960
And then Ringo Starr walked by and when
you look good in that, so he was like,

781
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:26,670
well, I gotta buy it now. I mean,

782
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,310
if a beetle tells you you look good
in something and it's like you got to

783
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:33,030
fucking get the fuck, I'm going to go,
star was there. Yeah. Yeah. I did bring,

784
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:36,390
it was always at like Barbados events.
He wears all that.

785
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:39,970
Like interview with the vampire
clothing was an event. It wasn't a,

786
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:44,350
it wasn't a store. Not
a did. No, no, it was,

787
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,200
I was an event. I spaced halfway through
them. Okay. How would, it's great.

788
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,900
It's great. So what I'm
saying is, is that, you know,

789
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,070
Sargent pepper was this huge thing for
the Beatles because what was the coat?

790
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:59,650
What did it have on it? Oh my God, I'll
send you a picture. Tell the story.

791
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,240
It was like an alligator gold style,
like,

792
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:09,960
like Rock Jack, I don't even know what
you'd call it. Just like a piece of that.

793
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:14,070
If he buys it. Was it a Beatles coat? No,
it was just a job. [inaudible] he was,

794
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:15,750
he was seriously saying he look good.

795
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:17,570
And that fucking code
was just saying to John.

796
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,760
He was saying to Jim that you look good
in it. And so he told him, you know,

797
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:24,240
he's like, you look good. So
Jim bought it. That's the story.

798
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,830
It was boring the second time. It was
interesting to find out, spaced out,

799
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,980
but everybody's laughing
at, you know, I'm not

800
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,680
fucking listening from,
we're not paying attention or whatever.

801
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,770
He didn't think that when
I sang a Johnny paycheck,

802
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,710
take this job
and shove it down,

803
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,650
I believe.
But dobber Debo,

804
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:48,230
what Josh has been trying to get me
to do, you're going to do it. Um,

805
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,590
he wants mother fucker.

806
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,600
You are Gunna do this to get brown curly
wig go out on stage is Don Henley and

807
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:00,760
then he wants me to play drums
and Sing Hotel California.

808
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:03,280
I'm a dad. Does it? Hauwei yeah,

809
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,580
I'm going to help you. I'm going to help
you in the crowd's going to help you.

810
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,100
So everybody knows because
bill's talked about it.

811
00:48:10,101 --> 00:48:13,460
I do a show called the goddamn comedy
jam where Comedians do stand up,

812
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,910
they tell a story about a song and
then they sing it. Bill has done it.

813
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,820
You've done it more than fucking
like anybody. You're the,

814
00:48:19,821 --> 00:48:22,790
nobody counts it cause it
was pre the NFL NFL merger.

815
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,980
They don't call back. Right. But, but uh,

816
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,390
we had my birthday coming up and,
and I asked you,

817
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:37,410
I was like, could you please do
that? And I was going to do it.

818
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:38,510
I said,
I'm about to do it.

819
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:41,070
And then you called me and you give
me one of your [inaudible]. This is,

820
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,940
I've gotten this call a few times
where it's like, Josh, dude,

821
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,940
I got too much shit going on.
I can't learn this fucking song.

822
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:49,460
Don't make me learn this,
play the song.

823
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:53,740
But the fact that they have to sing
along with it and I can't sing, but you,

824
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:58,550
you understand that's a song that's so
popular. The second you start playing it,

825
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,210
the whole audience is going to fucking
join in with you and then you can just

826
00:49:02,211 --> 00:49:03,200
kind of mimic it.

827
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:08,150
And then I'll be singing
in the bass player will be
singing like all the fucking

828
00:49:08,151 --> 00:49:11,080
lyrics in front of me. Like
it's just going to be a shit
show. I think I could do.

829
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,350
I think you know, I can make that
happen. We'd him, there's one in March.

830
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,340
I got one coming up

831
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,720
March 20th do we haven't done one in
awhile? Yeah, Dude. Like am I scheduled?

832
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:24,330
Doesn't open up again until fucking April.
Like I'm just straight. I'm straight.

833
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:26,660
I know what the fuck happened, dude.
I got in this business to not working.

834
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,140
Now we're doing, we're doing F is for
family, man. I gotta be cannot wait dude.

835
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:35,280
Right. And Shit, we're already up
to episode three. We're cruising.

836
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,450
That's great. Yeah, we're cruising. But I
mean, yeah, it takes a lot, a lot of time.

837
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,830
Uh, all right, let's get into some
point. I Will Sing Hotel California.

838
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,130
Oh,
where did my hair okay.

839
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,033
Does,

840
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,170
I just wanted you to do that
one part where it's like,

841
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,920
but what is the killer bees do?

842
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,400
Do, do, do, do. Yeah. On
the Tim Bali. All right.

843
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:10,650
Body shaming.
We got people write in and then they,

844
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,960
for some reason they want advice. I
know this goes down. Okay. Alright.

845
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,980
Body shaming. You'll Billy Brown shirt.
I don't know what Brown shipping.

846
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,580
So it wasn't that the people who
are sympathetic to fucking Hitler,

847
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,870
I have no idea what brown shirts went.
Brown shirts a wait a minute,

848
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:27,700
I gotta look that. How you got to Google
something political. Maybe they hear,

849
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,320
saw you in a picture that you posted
in a brown shirt and they are,

850
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:31,310
they're just rhyming in it.

851
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,300
Brown shirt did.

852
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:39,400
They said so many weird
things like Billy elbows or

853
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:45,140
Billy dangle down. Yeah.
So they just made it up.

854
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,660
No Brown shirts.
Political,

855
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,260
uh,

856
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:54,310
Nazi party original parliamentary did
played a significant role in Adolf

857
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,220
Hitler's rise to power. Ah, I guess
all he needed was brown shirts. St Cs.

858
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,770
What? The Internet stupid. Cause I just,

859
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:06,410
I just fucking grazed over all the
grays. Breezed. Graced. All right.

860
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:07,250
You're Billy Brown shirt.

861
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:12,251
I vomited a little my mouth halfway
through your tirade against fat cons when

862
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:14,870
you suggest,
I don't remember doing this.

863
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:20,260
Those who don't conform to your body
dysmorphic ideal should get therapy and

864
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:25,040
sorted out their lives.
Did I say that guys?

865
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:29,510
You have to understand something like I
have to do an hour usually by myself and

866
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:30,950
whatever topic comes up,

867
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:35,060
I have to destroy it because I'm
trying to make you laugh anyways.

868
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:38,570
I haven't heard anything less healthy
come out of your mouth for some time.

869
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,390
All right. You know something
to dude. First of all the,

870
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,580
I vomited a little bit in my life.

871
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:48,590
You're the fact that I'm
supposed to literally take
what you're saying seriously

872
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:51,800
and you're speaking in soundbites.
Let me get Stan,

873
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:55,640
did you shake your head before you rolled
on the floor? Laughing your ass off.

874
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:59,600
Anyways, if my partner thought
my weight was a deal breaker,

875
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,960
I'd thank her for the honest
glimpse into her vacant prisons,

876
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:08,720
soul and abandoned her in a
heartbeat. No, you wouldn't.

877
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,990
You overly sensitive jackass,
uh,

878
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:15,950
in a heartbeat to the Greyhound Hound
inspired Instagram influencers and

879
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:20,300
consumer program. Neil,
needless, you seem to champion,

880
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:25,290
diversity is not a mental illness,
but body shaming is ah,

881
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:29,860
God, wow. I gotta, I
gotta I gotta like that's,

882
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,100
that's worded so much in that speak that
I don't even believe that that's true.

883
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:38,090
No, they're just throwing
buzzwords together, Brown shirt,

884
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,960
all of that type of stuff.
I love,

885
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,330
now I see why they call it you Billy
Brown shirt. Like I'm a nine mad at you.

886
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:45,500
Yeah, they're mad at, you know,

887
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:48,650
cause what it was was there was
a guy who was with some chick,

888
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:50,870
she had a little meat on the
bones, whatever, and he was,

889
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:53,360
went into it thinking I should
probably fucking lose eventually.

890
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:57,050
I don't know why he thought that
people tend to just get fatter.

891
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,070
Yeah. People, people do
tend to age. That'd be like,

892
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:03,730
this guy has a little gray hair.
Maybe it's going to turn Brown. No,

893
00:53:03,731 --> 00:53:06,650
it's going to flag it to get more
gray. Yes. So anyway, my age,

894
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:07,880
and if so what happens is,

895
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,390
but she was putting it on at what he
considered to be an alarming rate.

896
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,070
So he wanted to stay with her,

897
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,400
but he needed to know how to approach
to ask her in a polite way to stay in

898
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:20,560
shape.
Here's what all these not least gateway,

899
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,530
here's what all these proud fat people
are doing. They're killing themselves.

900
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,010
So if somebody does an intervention,

901
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,490
and then thing about fatties is they'll
fucking sit there and I'll talk about

902
00:53:30,491 --> 00:53:34,690
how addiction, food addiction and all
that is no different than drug addiction.

903
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,160
I completely agree. Why you
ain't? You really agree with it.

904
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,910
You have an intervention
with people to be like,

905
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,370
you're killing yourself with this heroin.
So I don't know.

906
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,640
For some reason with big MACs,
you can't fucking be like, hey,

907
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:48,190
why don't you lay off your
fucking chicken tenders there?

908
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,950
So I have a friend that, that
just had a kid, uh, my buddy and,

909
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:56,900
uh, he, he was, he lost a little bit
of weight because he had prediabetes,

910
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,200
but he's putting it back on again. And
like, we had a thing tonight. And, uh,

911
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:04,660
and I was like, I was like, hey man,
like you, you know, you look at,

912
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,480
you're putting on more weight.
And he goes, yeah, you know,

913
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:09,180
it's just the stress and blah, blah,
blah. I'm like, I know, but you know,

914
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:13,860
we're celebrating your kid's
birthday. It's just, you
should just, you know, and he,

915
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,960
and he wants to it,
it's like that by saying that,

916
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,350
it's just that reality check just
to let him know I'm not shaming him.

917
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,740
And I don't think he's shaming his
girlfriend either, that the, you know,

918
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:26,910
that dude the Rohde. And so it's
just kind of like, hey, you know,

919
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:31,860
it's like you said, it's health, you know,
it's, you gotta you gotta Stop, you know?

920
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,580
Yeah. Fucking, just, you gotta
be exercise. If you want to live,

921
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:38,670
you got to exercise and take care
of yourself. What you eat is fuel.

922
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,653
It doesn't need to be doing,

923
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,940
hi, I'm not gonna say his name, but a
guy I knew a couple of years ago. Yeah.

924
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,870
The last time I saw him, I saw him sit
down and go, this guy does not look good.

925
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,740
And he was not eating healthy food
and he fucking dead a month later.

926
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,520
Fuck yeah, dude. And it's just like, but
you're not supposed to say something.

927
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:01,020
Someone who was addicted to heroin
but out and I got a temper and shit.

928
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:05,400
My wife can skin stepping on that. But
there's something about like, you know,

929
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:09,870
being fat. These people are just
like, no man, I'm a fucking eight.

930
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,780
You've just been convinced by sis.
Like they take it, like you're saying,

931
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,670
they're not beautiful
people. It's like, you know,

932
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:17,820
if I just saw you were just some
fat shit, you know, I don't know.

933
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,380
It wasn't my fucking idea
either, man. So yeah. Yeah.

934
00:55:20,381 --> 00:55:23,490
You can go fuck yourself with all your
stupid like that, that, that, all,

935
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,760
all of that. So you want
about Brown shirt. The way
this whole thing is written,

936
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,090
this is the kind of person that
tries to make you lose your job.

937
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,510
1000000%. Yeah, they're
very active on Yelp.

938
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:37,040
Yeah. All right, and then
fell titles. Hey, pasty pig,

939
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,810
spin pigskin professor,

940
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:43,070
you've asked about super bowl
titles versus NFL champions
of what great or maybe

941
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:47,240
this person has the solution. The issue
here is not the answer, it's the question.

942
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:50,890
If someone asks which team
have never won a super bowl,

943
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:55,610
it has a different answer than if someone
asks which team has never won an NFL

944
00:55:55,611 --> 00:55:58,040
championship.
Even a complicated more,

945
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:01,040
you could ask who's never
won a league championship,

946
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,270
which also includes AFL champion
chips and other leagues. All right,

947
00:56:05,271 --> 00:56:06,260
I understand all of this.

948
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:11,470
For official NFL champions from 1920
to 1932 there was no championship game.

949
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,270
The championship champion was decided
by the best record only. Okay. Now,

950
00:56:17,271 --> 00:56:21,170
none of this is answering my question.
That's like back in the day when baseball,

951
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:23,590
all those worlds series
that the county you winning,

952
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:25,660
the pennant was back in the year.
Back in the day,

953
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,000
you had the brand of the regular season.

954
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:30,460
If you had the best record in the
American league, you won the pennant,

955
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,590
there was no play off. Yeah. And
then you went to the championship,

956
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:34,720
you went to the world series.

957
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,990
So all those years the Yankees
won all those fucking titles.

958
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:42,190
They had one playoff series to win.
It wasn't this divisional,

959
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,690
it wasn't three rounds of playoffs, which
people have to do now where they doing?

960
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,680
Uh,
but were they doing,

961
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:51,460
when they got to their word series was
how many Games was it? Was it I was fine.

962
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,790
That was still seven games.

963
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,770
The early 19 hundreds where it
was best of best five out of nine.

964
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,450
That's five out of nine. Yeah. Fuck Dude.

965
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:05,110
That would go until like December. If they
did that now, like I think the Red Sox,

966
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:08,820
1903 we won that world series
five games to three man,

967
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:12,280
it's gay may come into
your house for game aid.

968
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,290
Anyways,
from 1933 to 1969,

969
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,010
there was a championship game and the
winner of that was the NFL champion from

970
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:25,930
1966 on that champion went on to play
in the Superbowl and then when it was

971
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:28,420
called the world champion,
that's not true. 66,

972
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:33,080
67 68 the end of those seasons
or whatever those are 66,

973
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:35,230
660760860 nine whatever it was.

974
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,950
Those first three against the AFL was
called the AFL NFL title was not called

975
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:41,740
the soup bowl.
Later on retroactively,

976
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:46,300
it was named the super bowl from
1960 to 69 AFL had champions.

977
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:49,240
That's true.
But they aren't counted as NFL history,

978
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,860
but they are counted as the
team's history. If you are
asking how many? Yes. Okay.

979
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,690
Uh, from 19 six, six 69, the NFL
AFL champions played the Superbowl.

980
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:01,600
I skies is telling me Shit,
they didn't play the super bowl.

981
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,300
It was renamed that does he know?
It should be called facts.

982
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:10,360
Just facts. Facts. Facts. Facts. Facts.

983
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:16,110
Okay. So in 1966 the AFL champions, the
Kansas City's chiefs, the NFL champions,

984
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:20,170
the Green Bay packers, this is the plus
one league championship for each team.

985
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,970
Chiefs lost when they played
in, in the first NFL. If so,

986
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,460
they didn't get a Superbowl win,
but they still the AFL champion.

987
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,490
I understand all of this.
I understand all of this.

988
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,730
None of that cleared anything up.

989
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:39,160
I'm saying why don't they count those?
Yeah.

990
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,170
It's like you go to the stadium,

991
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,610
like the AFL merge to be part of the NFL.

992
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,500
So you're saying that at
any most NFL stadiums,

993
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:54,780
there are no trophies to
represent the league championship.

994
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,050
If you look at the flow, I'm sure
in the, somewhere in the stadium,

995
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:03,490
maybe they'll have, they'll have
that, but it's just like, you know,

996
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:08,080
when you go to, uh, you know,
you go to fucking Red Sox,

997
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,930
Fenway park, I mean, we have our
banners right down the thing.

998
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:15,170
1903 to fucking 2018.
Yeah.

999
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,470
Everybody has all of their,
they're all, all of them count. No,

1000
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,060
that that sir. I appreciate it
was to read all that history,

1001
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:25,270
but that didn't answer my question.
Why aren't they counted?

1002
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,470
Yeah.

1003
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:31,370
I mean when it comes to the Superbowl man,
it's just if it's not in those words,

1004
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:35,330
super embol aren't before them. They,
they just, they act like it didn't happen.

1005
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,570
Act like it didn't happen.
Yeah. Well I mean it's,

1006
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,290
it's just you could still say
dean championships, but I,

1007
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:45,820
I completely see where you're saying
right now. It actually takes what we say,

1008
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:49,730
we're kind of fucked up. Eagles,
they've never won a Superbowl.

1009
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,310
They last thing they wanted was
an NFL title. It's like, yeah,

1010
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:55,550
but that was the peak of fucking 1960
they were the best fucking football team

1011
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,530
out there and you talking about it
like it would like they, they, they,

1012
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,630
they lost the election.

1013
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:00,580
Okay.

1014
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:05,080
Yeah, I dunno. Anyways, living
in Wyoming. Hey Billy, silly.

1015
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:06,250
It's silly city slicker.

1016
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:11,290
I was listening to some older podcasts
episodes and came across a rant you had

1017
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:15,530
about Wyoming. I like Wyoming. I
didn't remember what I said. Like these

1018
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,120
tidbits I live in Wyoming. I got
to say, you are not too far off.

1019
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:27,040
I listened to the podcast every
week while I feel my cows off,

1020
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:32,140
feed my cows off the back of a flatbed
truck. Shut off. Find out of this guys.

1021
01:00:32,141 --> 01:00:32,561
Fuck with me.

1022
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:36,550
Last week we killed the problem mountain
lion and it next weekend we'll be

1023
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,830
entering into a competitive coyote hunt.

1024
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,580
I live in the absolute middle of fucking
nowhere. This sounds amazing. This guy,

1025
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:46,270
this guy listens to Steve Earle. Yeah,
but this guy is way more interesting.

1026
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,050
Get a party than I am. I do
standup comedy. Oh yeah. What
did you do? Ah, you know, I,

1027
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:55,210
I saved five of our sheep or you
know, from a mountain lion by, uh,

1028
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,560
I came in, turn it off. I came in
third in the coyote hunting nationals.

1029
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,970
I want to talk to that guy.

1030
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,620
The nearest town population is 3000
miles and it's 40 miles away. Also,

1031
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:06,670
just to clear the air,

1032
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:11,671
most of the billionaire cons live up
in Jackson and the rest of why ohm.

1033
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,010
Oh, that's what I was saying. I still
want to be the Douche in Hollywood.

1034
01:01:15,011 --> 01:01:19,120
That gets a place in Wyoming and the
rest of Wyoming pretty much discounts.

1035
01:01:19,121 --> 01:01:22,810
Jackson is being
part of the state anyway,

1036
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:25,760
so I'll pretty much discount so to speak.
Part of state, partially unrelated.

1037
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:29,090
I finished getting my pilot's license
last year and hope to start on my

1038
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:31,160
helicopter rating within
the next year. Good. Phew.

1039
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:35,720
My family has used a bell jet
ranger to hunt coyotes. Jesus.

1040
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:39,230
How much more of an advantage do
you need for three generations now?

1041
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:41,240
And I'm ready to start
for flying the heli.

1042
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,150
Do you have like one of those fucking
Vietnam? Yeah, job do, do, do, do, do,

1043
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:50,560
do today. How do you shoot a doe? Easy.
You just don't lead him as much. Uh,

1044
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,630
am I ready to start flying
the heli to carry on the,

1045
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,880
Oh and I'm ready to start flying and
they had to carry on the tradition.

1046
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,580
So cheers to a fellow pilot.
That's cool as shit. Uh,

1047
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,630
just wanted to let you know there's at
least one can listen to your podcasts and

1048
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:06,050
Wyoming and love all the shit you put
out. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1049
01:02:06,051 --> 01:02:09,710
That's cool man. I'm trying to get
eight hours a month, uh, flying.

1050
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,210
And have you been flying a lot recently?

1051
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:14,870
I got 7.9 for this month and
I'm flying tomorrow morning.

1052
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,790
What are you going to take me up dude,
when I have three over 300 hours? Uh,

1053
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,300
I'm going to do a little bit of instrument
training and just get better at it

1054
01:02:23,301 --> 01:02:25,120
and, and like do some full, I would,

1055
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:28,310
I would do full downs and the
whole fucking thing before
I would ever take up my

1056
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:32,780
first passenger. And I love you too
much to have you be my first passenger,

1057
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:37,070
but there's a few people in my life that
I like, so I'll be taking them up first.

1058
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,920
Okay. I believe that. And then, and
you know what I mean, it's just like,

1059
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:41,900
do I want to kill this guy or this guy?
Wait,

1060
01:02:41,901 --> 01:02:45,170
dude wasn't like Sophie's choice with
a helicopter. How are we going to go?

1061
01:02:45,171 --> 01:02:49,250
We're going to go to see iron maiden in
Las Vegas and then that should be like

1062
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:51,340
the time that we do that.
Does that,

1063
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,270
sorry. Ps. If you want to try a new cigar,

1064
01:02:58,271 --> 01:03:02,710
checkout deadwood tobacco company
out of Deadwood, South Dakota.

1065
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,810
The sweet Jane is is my favorite
cigar I have ever smoked. See you.

1066
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,680
You see a, you're bald. Fuck.

1067
01:03:08,681 --> 01:03:12,370
Well I mean some guy out there in
the fucking range shooting coyotes.

1068
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,700
I bet you know what a dead word. Yeah,
that sounds fucking pretty cool to me.

1069
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:19,010
All right, we got to wrap this
thing up to, we get some gas.

1070
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,880
Oscar's our three minutes. Perfect.
Alright, drone. Yo Billy up there. Uh,

1071
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:28,600
you were talking about a drone last
week that would taxi people around.

1072
01:03:28,601 --> 01:03:32,980
Sounded like the one you mentioned
was unmanned. Check this thing out.

1073
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:36,670
57 batteries. You have to, that is, I
was joking about that fucking thing dude.

1074
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:37,311
They,

1075
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:39,910
they're going to do this thing rather
than deal with the population problem.

1076
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:43,090
The next thing they do is have
like, like, like a, it looks like a,

1077
01:03:43,091 --> 01:03:45,340
it looks like a helicopter
and you just get in it.

1078
01:03:45,341 --> 01:03:50,110
There's nobody in there and it'll just
take you across to La. Now. First of all,

1079
01:03:50,111 --> 01:03:54,310
I would think it would be super expensive
unless it's electric. Unless, yeah. Uh,

1080
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:58,270
Elon Musk can make the thing, but dude,
you know, you fucking laptop crashes,

1081
01:03:58,271 --> 01:04:00,790
you phone craps out on you.
Oh y'all can like dude,

1082
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,990
you're going to fly somebody like over a,
like the level of insurance.

1083
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:06,220
Like how are you going to do that?

1084
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,460
I was joking that you're going
to have some hipster come flying.

1085
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:14,970
It was on his way to a pocket watch
convention out in fucking Venice beach or

1086
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:18,070
something. And all we've found
was his handlebar mustache. Yeah,

1087
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:22,690
he was on his way to this to meet
this food truck. Uh Yeah. Whatever.

1088
01:04:22,691 --> 01:04:25,090
I think it's there.
There is a,

1089
01:04:25,091 --> 01:04:27,880
so what I just want to get this
clear can show you something super.

1090
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:30,180
Please show it to me. Boy. I remember
just trying to, cause I'm not,

1091
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:30,791
I'm kind of confused.

1092
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:35,791
You're saying there is going to be a
transportation that like he's a drone so

1093
01:04:36,161 --> 01:04:39,790
it's like you get into a tube and then
it just lifts the tube up and flies you

1094
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,760
and it looks like a helicopter.
It looks fucking cool as shit.

1095
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,730
I think it looks fucking cool. Show. And
is that what you're showing me now? No.

1096
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:50,740
I want to show you this,
this app here for flight.

1097
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:55,870
Um, and this is what I'm getting
better right here. So this, this here,

1098
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,570
once I get good at,
you know,

1099
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:03,660
confident enough in my abilities and
I take up a passenger so it just,

1100
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:08,080
you don't have to know.
It's not like back in the fucking day,

1101
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:10,600
we'd had to have like a
fucking sectional map on your

1102
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:16,690
fucking thigh as you flying around.
This thing gives you all the, uh,

1103
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:21,480
the airports,
all the M and e know Santa Barbara.

1104
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:26,040
Where are we? Where are we? The, there's
Van Nuys, there is Burbank right there.

1105
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:30,240
So it's pink. So that's a Charlie.
Uh, and then you go, well,

1106
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:33,810
it's so great is you could just fucking
type in whatever you want to type in.

1107
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,530
It gives you, the aid is, it
gives you the uh, contact tower.

1108
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:40,740
It has a map,
runway aid.

1109
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,710
This is probably what most time would
you land out there and why they slam on

1110
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:47,670
the brakes because this is so fucking
short that it's a small ass landing strip.

1111
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,490
Yeah. Uh, well I don't know how you
could tell it from the APP. I think,

1112
01:05:50,491 --> 01:05:55,140
cause I just told you it was um,
uh, being a cunt right now, uh,

1113
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:59,820
there's Elma Burbank, there's El
Monte. That's one of my favorite ones,

1114
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,680
but it has all,
but it has,

1115
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:05,100
see what you see with this is so
boring for people here. BC right there.

1116
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,670
That's a delta. So grounded 2,400. So
right here when you flying it on the,

1117
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,310
the two 15, you know, I'm
going to be in the airspace.

1118
01:06:11,311 --> 01:06:15,540
I got to call them and they'll just
give you clearance all the way through.

1119
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,690
And then once you learn how to read this
fucking thank you can kind of just fly

1120
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:20,550
around out here.
Now the rest of the country,

1121
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,510
they actually have to do
deal with weather. See,

1122
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:25,850
I don't have to do it because people
like you just fly across the country.

1123
01:06:25,851 --> 01:06:29,960
It's like, ah, this is a dry climate
that I don't have to ever deal with. Hey,

1124
01:06:29,961 --> 01:06:33,590
everything's boo all and it all of
a sudden, yet I can't see anything.

1125
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:38,890
There's a brutal fucking call of a guy
who like me is not instrument rated,

1126
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,510
which means that the clouds
came in underneath me.

1127
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,360
I don't know how to get back down other
than to just shut my eyes and go through

1128
01:06:44,361 --> 01:06:46,370
the closet. Hope I, yeah. Yeah.

1129
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:49,340
So he's up there in the soup is
or whatever the fuck they call it.

1130
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:54,010
And Dude this guy is free. I've
got a die. And then they fought,

1131
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,420
the guy talked to him down and
then afterwards he fucking,

1132
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,850
he lived. Yeah, but he called the
tower. He goes, oh yeah, thanks about,

1133
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,730
and the guy says total ice go. Yeah.
He goes, what happened up there? Yeah,

1134
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:10,080
you fucking pussy is basically saying
what happened up there is he got involved

1135
01:07:10,081 --> 01:07:13,190
in some shit that, that you know,
he wasn't in for. So that's,

1136
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:18,230
that's the one weird thing about flying
is you learn by other people die are

1137
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:24,050
doing the dumb shit cause he died.
So he showed me will be one,

1138
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:29,170
one time this guy was doing a tour in the
44 Robinson 44 and he had three people

1139
01:07:30,711 --> 01:07:35,630
there when he took off. Right. Fucking
just did this really just, I dunno what,

1140
01:07:35,631 --> 01:07:38,540
he just didn't go like he just ignored
everything he's supposed to do.

1141
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:42,610
He was loaded up with people he
had, I imagine, you know, a low,

1142
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,700
heavy with fuel.

1143
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:47,450
So what you want to do is you should
forward momentum to get going.

1144
01:07:47,451 --> 01:07:52,451
And he just pulled all this fucking power
and his low rpm horn comes on and now

1145
01:07:53,121 --> 01:07:56,960
the weird thing was the
chicken, the passenger sheet
was gone like right at this,

1146
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,770
like the same fucking notes. So he didn't
hear it at first and all he had to do,

1147
01:08:00,771 --> 01:08:02,150
he was bank come out of the bank,

1148
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:06,560
lower your collective and it'll go
off and then just gradually climb up.

1149
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,340
And he did it for a second and then he
pulled it out again and it came on again.

1150
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,080
And then he just started descending.

1151
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:16,750
And your instinct is want to pull
because you want to go up. Yeah,

1152
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,593
actually went up.

1153
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:20,650
You actually want to bring you collected
down and he kept pulling power and he's

1154
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,000
fuckers weren't in the ground. They
all fucking died. Oh fuck man. Yeah.

1155
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:28,270
So I'll take you up. All right.
Girlfriend is pregnant. Hey, Billy sat.

1156
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,900
It's um,
I'm uh,

1157
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:35,980
I'm 28 years old and my 26 year old
girlfriend just found out she's pregnant.

1158
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:38,650
Now you're saying this dude,
like you didn't blow the load dinner.

1159
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,880
She found out she's pregnant. Like she
got fucking shingles of stuff. But uh,

1160
01:08:42,881 --> 01:08:47,650
this came as a big shot
because I previously had a
vasectomy when I was 22. Ah,

1161
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:50,490
there's the answer.
Jesus Christ at 22. You,

1162
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,750
they had nine kids by then
and he never wanted any,

1163
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:57,820
he had him a sec 22 set and never wa
had never wanted kids after she told me,

1164
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:02,890
I went to a urologist who told me I had
regained a sperm count, although rare,

1165
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:06,520
it was not unheard of. When I met
this girl, she changed my life.

1166
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:09,040
I had never trusted or loved
any woman the way I do her.

1167
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:13,930
She's the light of my life. Who weren't
planning on this. We both have okay jobs,

1168
01:09:13,931 --> 01:09:17,470
but living in California is expensive
and adding a third mouth to feed and

1169
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:20,470
paying for doctors visits
will crush us financially.

1170
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:23,650
She doesn't have health insurance.
Do you have any advice for me?

1171
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:28,690
My fear is losing the chance to have
kids with her as this may be a miracle

1172
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:33,691
considering my vasectomy and considered
you waited a long time to have kids.

1173
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:37,060
I want to know if you think this would
be a good for someone in my position to

1174
01:09:37,061 --> 01:09:37,894
go through this.

1175
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,040
Thanks for taking the time to read this
poorly and probably not under understand

1176
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:46,750
my situation. You old gray cont
uh, the old grey con t eight word.

1177
01:09:46,751 --> 01:09:49,080
He used to be love your
shows and I hope you here.

1178
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,070
I hope to hear more
your ramblings from you.

1179
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:56,790
Best to you the baby and go fuck
yourself and your gay ass patriots.

1180
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:02,170
All right. Um, can I get any take this
cause I think he should do it. Yeah,

1181
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:06,960
I think you do. Don't, don't wait on life
for your financial situation, man. If, if,

1182
01:10:06,961 --> 01:10:10,260
if you guys will make it work.
That's what you will make it work.

1183
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,310
You'll figure it out.

1184
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:13,950
You might not think that you'll
have enough money right now,

1185
01:10:13,951 --> 01:10:18,540
but something like life is constantly
changing and evolving and it's just like,

1186
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:21,920
yeah, lay off the micro Bruce and have
the kid. Yeah, exactly. Like, yeah,

1187
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,470
you'll make it work. Just I
think you should, you should.

1188
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:29,250
You should consider it a miracle. Just
like you said, I think it's a great thing.

1189
01:10:29,251 --> 01:10:33,950
I'm actually really happy
for you and I think a, put it
this way, I wish, you know,

1190
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:37,740
I wish I didn't wait as long as I did.
And the other day I was watching this,

1191
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,100
I was watching this,
uh, this kid song. Um,

1192
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:44,370
it's just as simple as like snow flakes,
Snow Flake,

1193
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,910
well snow flake, snow
flakes, Snow Flake, Dadada.

1194
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,050
And my daughter was trying to sing it and
she was throwing her head back because

1195
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,970
doing the, I think wasn't
quite in Pitt, dude, I,

1196
01:10:56,971 --> 01:11:00,140
I had to fight off getting emotional,
just watching her do that,

1197
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,180
get the most beautiful thing in the world.
And there's that thing. Up until then,

1198
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:08,030
anything fucking I've done.

1199
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:13,031
Madison Square Garden was not as good
as that 90 and not even remotely is he

1200
01:11:13,491 --> 01:11:16,090
like little man and his stroke.
I was like, wow, that's amazing.

1201
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,960
But that moment with my daughter, I was
like, this is what life is all about.

1202
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,910
100% this is what it's all about.

1203
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:24,130
And then another great
thing is you become a dad.

1204
01:11:24,131 --> 01:11:27,850
And one of the greatest fucking things
ever and some sage advice I learned from

1205
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:31,690
a good dad is he said, how awesome is
cause he goes, it's not about you anymore.

1206
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:35,630
And at first I kind of took that as
like, you know, cause I'm a very like,

1207
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:40,960
like don't tell me what the fuck to do
idiot sometimes. And then I, I realized,

1208
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:44,560
uh, uh, how great that is.

1209
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:48,280
Like the other day I finally had a day
off and my wife wanted to go on and go

1210
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:50,830
get some breakfast. She goes,
you want to do that? I was
like, no, filing homeowners,

1211
01:11:50,831 --> 01:11:54,520
stay home. So then I was just like, I
fuck it. That's what she wants to do.

1212
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,800
And we just went out and he
said, yeah, it's not about you.

1213
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:59,530
They want to go out to breakfast,
take them out to fucking breakfast.

1214
01:11:59,531 --> 01:12:03,010
And I went out to breakfast and I had a
great fucking time and I had great time.

1215
01:12:03,011 --> 01:12:05,680
And it's weird when you're home,
you're a dad or whatever, blah blah.

1216
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:08,020
But when you go out,
you kind of feel more like a dad.

1217
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:09,761
Yeah.
Well No.

1218
01:12:09,761 --> 01:12:13,060
It's like you can take them out to dinner
and what out of the car you're walking,

1219
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:15,390
she's holding your hand or
you're carrying her, you go in,

1220
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,220
you get her in the little booster
seat, he'd get her whatever. And like,

1221
01:12:18,221 --> 01:12:21,430
it's usually like a Mac and cheese or
like a cut up hot dog or some shit.

1222
01:12:21,431 --> 01:12:24,370
And I assume that she's at
that age and you did, you just,

1223
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:27,390
people are looking at the kid and look
how beautiful the kid is and you're like,

1224
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,670
oh, I know. It's just like, dude,
you're in your element, man. Yeah,

1225
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,980
no, it's awesome. I mean,
what's cool? She's really,
really beginning to talk now.

1226
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:37,460
Yeah. So, uh, yeah,

1227
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:39,650
it's getting the point where I can
actually convey to her and she will

1228
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,150
understand how much I love her.

1229
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,880
Which is going to be great
cause that's like doable. Yeah.

1230
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:45,290
Cause I always say you
made how much I love you.

1231
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:48,230
Do you understand that it should just
be looking at you smiling, whatever,

1232
01:12:48,231 --> 01:12:52,040
but I'll be, I'll actually be able to
say it. She'll be able to understand it.

1233
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,590
Yeah. I can't wait. Can't wait
to fucking play catch with her.

1234
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,170
I would teach her how to drive my
truck. Three in the tree. What?

1235
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,650
What kid born in 2018 is going to know
how to work shitty 76 sorry. No, no,

1236
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:06,380
I didn't forget about drivers stick five
three on the column. I took it today.

1237
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:08,480
I took it over to a a Jiffy Lube,

1238
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:10,940
which I know a lot of fucking car
people are going to give me shit for it.

1239
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,770
That you went to Jiffy Lube.
Well, I would change it,

1240
01:13:12,771 --> 01:13:14,550
but the way they designed the,

1241
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:17,180
the guy who have a fucking designed
the engine did not talk to the guy who

1242
01:13:17,181 --> 01:13:19,910
fucking design the frame on
that truck because the frame,

1243
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:23,150
there's like literally a piece that
goes to one side or the other right

1244
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:25,970
underneath the fucking plug for the
drain planet pants. So the only,

1245
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:28,490
it's just a giant fucking mess.

1246
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:32,390
Like when they do what they have to have
this giant thing underneath it and it

1247
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:34,640
comes down and it splashes all over that,

1248
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:38,300
that piece that goes across and then
they have like this spray thing and then

1249
01:13:38,301 --> 01:13:39,950
the air thing that they shoot all off.

1250
01:13:39,951 --> 01:13:42,830
It's like I'm going to do that in my
garage and have a fucking oil spill.

1251
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,450
I can't do it. I hate it. I used
to love doing it when I was a kid.

1252
01:13:47,451 --> 01:13:49,790
I used to though, it's like my favorite
thing because I knew how to do it.

1253
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,050
I would change the fuel filter.

1254
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,210
I knew her to do a loop job
and he'll do the whole fucking,

1255
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,890
all of that maintenance stuff.

1256
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:59,090
But I never had the balls to start taking
apart the fucking engine or whatever.

1257
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:03,370
But, uh, anyway, that's the podcast.
We've got a cigar to smoke. Uh, Hey,

1258
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:05,920
your pick for the Superbowl patriot.
Yeah.

1259
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:11,750
Um, I think it's going to be the
patriots. I really do think so. I, I do,

1260
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:14,240
I can to be honest with you.
Like I kind of,

1261
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,500
I love watching greatness and I didn't
know what people like to hate on the

1262
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:22,160
Patriots. And I know I teased you
sometimes, but it's just like, dude, he's,

1263
01:14:22,161 --> 01:14:24,110
he's so good. The team is so good, man.

1264
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,960
And it's like to be able to say that
I watched Michael Jordan wins six.

1265
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:30,710
Like I know I was alive during that and
nobody else has matched that greatness

1266
01:14:30,711 --> 01:14:31,610
except for Tom Brady.

1267
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,640
Well,
I think it's going to,

1268
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:39,260
I'm going to die a thousand deaths as
always. And I really think that, uh,

1269
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,740
I mean we're going up against what's
looking like the next bell a check. Uh,

1270
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:48,240
[inaudible] he's like fucking 33 34 years
old. I mean, it's fucking ridiculous.

1271
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:49,280
He was just skin dude.

1272
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:53,450
He was our offensive coordinator
and we gave him up like he,

1273
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:57,680
we have fucking one of the
Goddamn Gruden's you ain't
doing shit. I know Bella.

1274
01:14:57,681 --> 01:15:01,610
Check coached the browns at one point and
it happens too. It happens. All right.

1275
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,820
Uh, that's the podcast.
I'm hoping my patriots win.

1276
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,460
I have no idea what's going to happen.

1277
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,830
The fucking rams look great
and I think their quarterback,

1278
01:15:09,831 --> 01:15:11,900
like they just don't make
quarterbacks the way they used to.

1279
01:15:11,901 --> 01:15:14,030
Like they don't come
into the league scared.

1280
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,710
They just fucking come in like I whatever.
I Dunno what it is.

1281
01:15:18,711 --> 01:15:22,100
Maybe because they video games and shit.
They've already seen saying,

1282
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:24,410
I remember that games to beat them
all the time and eighth grade,

1283
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:26,780
now I'm playing him
now he's fucking older.

1284
01:15:26,781 --> 01:15:29,030
I'm not scared of any of these
people. All right, I'm rambling.

1285
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:32,570
Can I give my final pitch on the
podcast? Yes guys. Everybody.

1286
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,540
My podcast called the 500
with Josh Adam Meyers.

1287

1288
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:42,620

1289
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:46,460
