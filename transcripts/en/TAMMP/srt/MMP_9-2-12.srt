Don't say oh no.
Set All.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,510
I've been listening to a oh by the way,
before I get before he,

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,980

Would you like to go to a party with an
ascot on and sound like you're well read?

13
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,360
Even if you don't read this reading,
make you sleepy,

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,730
but for some reason somebody else's voices
in your head reading a book makes you

feel like you're being held well.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,650
When you listen to Spanish radio,
right whenever you call it, Latino,

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,390
Puerto Rican, whatever. He's
supposed to a mere Amira.

19
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,060
Whenever the fuck you supposed to say,
you know,

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,740
you're just trying to pick up words,
right?

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,090
So all I do now is I just listened to the,
uh,

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,600
you know, am radio of course, you know,

23
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,980
white people are on or on FM Latinos and
like fucking psycho political people in

24
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,870
sports are all on am radio,
religious people.

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,903
You know what I mean?

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,200
Like if you're just on FM radio and
you're going up and down the dial and

27
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,020
whatever, like you're living in
a completely different universe.

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,800
If you switch over to am radio,

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,920
you know, it's, it's a interrupt. You,

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,690
you can literally listen to like some
gaming at Laska and Alaska. You can,

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,230
next channel is somebody
talking about Jesus.

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,010
And Jesus said to the
Episcopalians in John 3.6,

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,870
you know, then, um, gay
people are all going to hell.

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,580
Whatever the fuck they're talking about,
right?

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,330
And then you get over to the Spanish
station and you try to fucking listen.

36
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:28,140
He's supposed to immerse
yourself in the language and uh,

37
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,040
it's starting to happen.
I can actually hear different words.

38
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,920
I don't know what the fuck they mean,
but it's slowly but surely happening.

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,510
And I don't know what the fuck they're
talking about unless it's like a word,

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,800
like that's just totally like the
English word with like an o at the end.

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,540
Mouille important though.
And you're like very important

42
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,290
but always in the end, always in the
end when they give out the phone number,

43
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:59,740
I know what they're saying. Oh No. All
Chels Santo, Santo Quatro, Cinco, quatro.

44
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,080
Today's Uno.
Um,

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,990
anyways, and they see, they
see pedal pedal I water.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,950
That's now let's get down to brass tacks.
This is the Monday morning podcast,

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,580
Mi Amigos and Mi Amigos.
Um,

48
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,270
I got a lot of shit going on,
you know, you know, it's weird.

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,730
The last few weeks when I do the podcast,
I do it downstairs.

50
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,330
My fucking dog looks like it got
shot with a tranquilizer gun.

51
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:32,750
Okay.

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,620
Just fucking lays here
mocking. You know, I literally,

53
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:41,621
I feel like I'm bombing because in reality
the dog is my only audience and I'm

54
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:45,110
going to take a fucking picture
of a right now. You know what,

55
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,540
and we're going to upload it.
I've never shown you guys a picture.

56
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,680
You know what's great about this?

57
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,970
You guys have never seen what my dog
looks like and now I'm going to send you a

58
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:56,150
picture and all the dog
people like, oh my God. Yeah,

59
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,420
he's finally got it to it.
Where's the thing?

60
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,790
You're not going to see her face.

61
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,700
It's going to be like people magazine
when they used to try to get a picture of

62
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,534
it

63
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,750
and these to try to get a picture
of like Paul Stanley from kiss,

64
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,050
you know that yet another
horrific group from Detroit.

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,720
What is wrong with white
music from Detroit?

66
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,480
They got the black shit down so well,
Motown,

67
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:23,440
all those guys right through Marvin Gaye,
who I guess was a Motown artists.

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,953
MMM.

69
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,020
But Jesus Christ, they're white
music other than M and M. Woo.

70
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,700
Yeah.

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,170
That is a fucking mess out there.
Huh? The Bay city royal up rollers.

72
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,470
Remember them
is this thing about Saturday nights,

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,050
a little coke spoons hanging around,
twist it up in the chest.

74
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,130
Hair was not that Gig.

75
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,143
MMM.

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,300
Who else? Ted Nugent. Gay. HBH. Viva.

77
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,950
I throw him on the fucking trash heap.
Um,

78
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,760
kiss.
Who else is from there?

79
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,560
Kid Rock.
You know,

80
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,060
you should melt all of those people down
and then fucking reform them into maybe

81
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:16,040
like a coffee house music. You know, Bill,

82
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,220
you've got a lot of fucking nerve man.
How many fucking albums you sold? Oh,

83
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:22,400
go fuck yourself.
I got a God damn hour to fill here.

84
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,903
Okay,

85
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,870
kid rock always walk around with no
shirt on and a Budweiser. We get it.

86
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,430
You're down to earth. Oh,
was there a Paparazzi here?

87
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:37,400
Who as I stepped out of
my limo with my bud tall.

88
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,450
Did you publicists fucking open that
for you? There you go. Bill Trash.

89
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:46,760
Somebody who was relevant in 99. All
right. Have you ever been relevant bill?

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,611
See that?
That's,

91
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:51,770
that's why I like to think that I'm even
handed because as I trash other people,

92
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:56,270
I also trash myself.
Don't die. Maybe not. Um,

93
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,190
anyways, I'll shut off the
fucking goddamn camera. You know,

94
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,740
I keep playing on my iPhone.
I keep playing ice rage.

95
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,480
Do you guys play that hockey game?

96
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,910
I play at the highest level and
I had this motherfucker be like,

97
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,900
I just refuse to play any other level at
this point other than the hardest level

98
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,470
and a at this point I
am one and about 260.

99
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,180
That's my record. And the only
time I won the first time okay.

100
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,170
Was Cause I did this bitch move where I
got two goals right in the beginning and

101
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:32,610
then one another face off and then just
fucking skated with the puck for like a

102
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:34,620
minute, kill on the clock,
just skating around.

103
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:38,610
Whoop getting chased by that
little motherfucker. Right.

104
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,680
So yesterday I'm like,

105
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:45,310
I'm going to beat this dude
fair and square and um,

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
singing in sweet home
Alabama in the morning.

107
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,930
Who downloaded that? I mean, gee,

108
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,320
how many fucking hit songs do
you got to fucking slam together?

109
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,430
And then you get a hit song out of it.
It doesn't fucking make any sense.

110
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,640
You know, you got the whole, the
I woo. Where will the London,

111
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:13,570
you're coming out of the gate with that
bomp bomp bomp ball to put the pool ride.

112
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,940
Hey, we just swiped a hit
song. What do you think?

113
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,650
I don't think that's enough.

114
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,700
Why don't we swipe another one and
we'll put that in the chorus singing,

115
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,200
you know, sweet home,
Alabama, Sheryl Crow's tits.

116
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,050
Um, isn't that what happened? She put a
tits in the camera and then they that,

117
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,370
do you know what it is? That's,
that attic is actually [inaudible]

118
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,190
product of everybody stealing
music and there's no music stores.

119
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:44,280
So this is, and I'm, I'm wrong. Maybe
I won't kid rock and apology. Like,

120
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,150
this is what these,

121
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,660
this is the level of fucking hoops
this dude has to jump through in,

122
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,620
in order to have a fucking hit record.

123
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,740
How do you get your music out?
That's the amazing thing about lady Gaga,

124
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,143
right?

125
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,980
The new Queen Queen of the gay community.
You know,

126
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:09,000
they always loved checks like that, who
played like dress up and wear crazy hats,

127
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,420
you know, pulled down over there,
beat noses. I don't know what it is,

128
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,810
but gay people, they can't get
enough of chicks like that. Right?

129
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,510
But I was sitting there looking at lady
Gaga going, what the fuck is she doing?

130
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:25,440
And now, now I get it.
There's no, there's no audio.

131
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,940
That's another Spanish word for you.
It's not radio.

132
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:33,630
You just roll the out of audio sake.
Now I'm speaking Spanish,

133
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,520
now I'm back to English. That can me, ah,

134
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm fucking crossing you over in a
verbal way. Breaking your fucking ankles.

135
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,780
Um, I'm such a Douche
this week. All right?

136
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:45,780
So don't even send me emails about what
a Douche I am because I'm completely

137
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,370
aware of it.
Okay?

138
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,910
I don't know if that makes me more
of a Douche or more tolerable,

139
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,410
but I'm just letting you
know where it's at. We

140
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
didn't even move,

141
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,450
didn't even fucking move.
And I get her to move all that goes.

142
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,640
Do you want to, and then
it goes to tail. Cleo,

143
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:08,740
do you wanna fucking dogs
like, yeah, I want to,

144
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:11,550
I don't have a fucking driver's license.
I can't open the front door.

145
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,843
You know,

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,170
maybe my dog isn't happy. Maybe
it's fucking depressed and, Hey,

147
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,840
what's the point man? I'm going to do is
walk in another room with nothing to do.

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,460
It's going to lay here all day.
Um, the fuck was I talking about?

149
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:31,180
I was on a nice roll there. Oh yeah.
There's no fucking way. There's no radio.

150
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:34,690
There's no Fuckin,
MTV doesn't play videos anymore.

151
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,500
Nobody buys your music. How the fuck
do you get your music out there?

152
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,460
You got to put on a meat dress.
So then all that guy,

153
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,030
that guy there with his little sippy cup
on that Paparazzi show, we'll be out.

154
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:50,330
They'll just say list, but eyes.
Yeah, lot of flood. Good mate. Ah, ah.

155
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,510
It's not maker the shelf.
Um, anyways, people,

156
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,330
you know what, I'm going to start actually
a am I gonna use audible.com/bill.

157
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,420
She can I use it audible.com/bill
can I go use that and then fucking

158
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,110
what books would I get?
You know why when I,

159
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,140
when I used to read when I was 27 and
I thought I was going to be smart,

160
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,790
I started reading books thinking it would
make me more likely to get a blow job

161
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,920
bought. It never fucking happened. Um,

162
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,540
because I looked like
Ron Howard when I was 27.

163
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,000
Um, so anyways, now I'm 44. Um,

164
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,610
if I was going to have a books read to me,
I would do that.

165
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:49,560
The Irvine Welsh series, you know, cause
I'm a big fan of that. That fucking,

166
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,370
what is it? Cockney accent.
Fucking Irish spring.

167
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:56,910
Let me cut into some soap with a,
with a shank accent.

168
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,240
And there was a bunch of words in there
that I kind of figured out cause he

169
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,650
literally writes it how they say it.

170
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,273
Huh.

171
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,710
And uh, maybe if I, you know, I wonder
if they actually have like somebody

172
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,850
you know who's,

173
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,850
if you're going to do the urban Welsh
series of books on audible.com/bill trying

174
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,080
to fill my contractual
obligations with these people.

175
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm trying to say it as many times as
humans, but I actually like these guys,

176
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,010
you know, considering there's no more,
there's no more bookstores anymore.

177
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,750
These guys are actually
picking up the slack.

178
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,873
Right?

179
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,640
I like audible.com/bill. You
know what? I don't like I, I'm,

180
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:38,250
I'm not doing the pro flowers thing
anymore. Okay. I like those guys,

181
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,940
but I like them on Valentine's Day
and mother's Day. Other than that,

182
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,660
I can't sit here with any sort of good
conscience and trying to sell you guys

183
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:49,110
flowers in the beginning of
fucking September. What do you get?

184
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:53,980
Somebody flowers for fucking Labor
Day. You know, unless you accidentally

185
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,100
ran over somebody foot on September 1st,

186
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,720
there's no fucking reason to
get anybody some flowers. Well,

187
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,450
what if they have a date? Oh
go fuck yourself. You know,

188
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:08,770
then I got to fill out all this
bullshit to, to get fucking $17.

189
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:12,490
It's not even worth it to me.
All right, so pro flowers,

190
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,810
if you're listening,
I will see you in February.

191
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,570
Um, anyone face this is
like reverse good business.

192
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,110
So anyways,
what the fuck am I talking about?

193
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:29,380
Did Anybody Watch any college football?
How great is it that football's back?

194
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,580
Anybody gets suckered into that Michigan,
Alabama game like I did,

195
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,050
I had the fucking fellows
over. You know, my woman,

196
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,270
my piece of property is,
um,

197
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,220
she killed me if I ever said that
is fucking, uh, she's out of town.

198
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,600
So what am I going to do?
There's only two options.

199
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,490
Either I get some hookers and I cheat on
her or I have the fellows come over and

200
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,260
I fucking get hammered.

201
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,810
I chose the louder they give me.
I'm still fucking bitch.

202
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,660
Can't drink like I used to man. I
picked up a cigar habit, you know.

203
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,940
Anyways, so yeah, number eight,

204
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:16,990
Michigan for his fucking number to
Alabama. And in my head I'm going,

205
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:20,500
why is Michigan Number Eight? How are
they number rate? They sucked last year.

206
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,970
What happened?
Who did they get did,

207
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,890
did a couple of fucking beast
from Penn state, you know,

208
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,030
but you'll even then you're only allowed
to sign one. What the fuck happened?

209
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,060
How were these guys number rate and about,

210
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:38,020
I dunno when Alabama was up like 21
nothing or something like right in the

211
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,570
beginning of the second quarter,
that's when I figured it out. Oh,

212
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,830
they weren't number rate.
They just made them number rate.

213
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:46,390
So I would tune in and invite my
fucking friends over like an asshole.

214
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,080
We watched like seven minutes of
that game and then that was it.

215
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:53,970
We were downstairs fucking hanging
out at the grill. You know,

216
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,490
I took out my climbing rope cause
everybody, oh, you climb a rope,

217
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:01,270
I can fucking do that. Then people are
drunk trying to go up and down the rope,

218
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,690
you know, back in the day, that
would be funny to me and all in all,

219
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm thinking in my head the whole time
is somebody is going to fall and they're

220
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:12,020
going to break their hip and then
I'm going to get sued. All right?

221
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,130
And that's what it means to become old.

222
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,040
Okay.

223
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,930
You know, when you're young,
when your friends fall down,

224
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:21,340
you could just laugh when you're old.
There's some,

225
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,920
there's somebody has to pay for it.

226
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,650
There's a liability. Oh Jesus.
Why didn't I bet that game?

227
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,650
Maybe they do. Do I just know
it because now the game is over.

228
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:38,220
But if ever there was a fucking lay up,

229
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,610
everybody [inaudible] he's so fucking,

230
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:46,450
he's fucking sec fast.
And now he's playing an SEC team.

231
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,270
Okay.
Which means you regular fucker.

232
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,250
He just became another fucking
quarterback and that was it.

233
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,970
He actually made a couple of nice throws.
But uh,

234
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,150
I don't know. I don't know
a bunch of fucking people
all in that Goddamn stadium.

235
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,200
Yeah.

236
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,260
Who honestly, who the fuck
would buy flowers in September?
You know what I mean?

237
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,530
Why are we selling flowers? That's
that corporate mentality. You,

238
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,540
why don't you just make all your money
on fucking Valentine's Day and then you

239
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,780
make the varsity of money,
the back end,

240
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,600
the back nine you make on mother's Day
and you call it a year and go sit on your

241
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:30,630
fucking boat. You know what? What if?

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,430
What if we just created this need for
flowers 12 months out of the year?

243
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:39,000
What if you just left him in the ground
and you let them continue to produce

244
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:39,990
oxygen for us?

245
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,480
Why don't you do that instead of
ripping them out of fucking ground every

246
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:47,010
goddamn day. Now, oh Jesus, I
am on a fucking tear here. Um,

247
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,140
you know what it is? No,
Bill, what is it? I am a,

248
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm getting geared up. I'm doing six
straight fucking weeks on the road.

249
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,580
Six straight. Well, my, my year
is basically over. Summer's over.

250
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,480
The summer is over.
I'm going on the road.

251
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:11,481
I'm and to you with Dick Jokes
and a clothes and shit joke.

252
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,190
And that's it for you.

253
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,600
Yeah.

254
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,020
By the time you realize
you got fucked over,

255
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,210
I'll have your money in my
wallet. Bottle. Bottle, bottle,

256
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:30,720
baby.
I'm fucking doin.

257
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,660
I'm fucking doing the white trash tour.

258
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,130
What do you mean by the white trash?
The white trash tour.

259
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,090
Listen to the cities that I am going to
this week. I'm going to be on Orlando,

260
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:44,960
Florida.
Okay.

261
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,130
And unless you have kids and you want
to go visit a giant fucking mouse with a

262
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:53,270
struggling actor inside of it,
there's no fucking reason to go there.

263
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,000
If you're some whore and you
want to go blow tiger woods,

264
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,710
I guess that's another reason to go there.

265
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,770
I don't know why else would you go to
Orlando to buy some bait? You know?

266
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,820
So I'm going there first and then next
week I'm going to be in Charlotte,

267
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,170
Charlotte, North Carolina, east bound
to Dachau and load it up and trucking.

268
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,260
We didn't realize the civil war head and
it, um, I'm going there. Do you want?

269
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:24,060
Or the comedy zone
and uh,

270
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,160
then I go to New York City.
Oh,

271
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:33,080
I'm standing next to a bunch of shit.
That must mean I'm successful too.

272
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,560
Right? Let's get a slice. I'm going there

273
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,140
and then the week after that
I go to Jacksonville, Florida.

274
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,620
This is how bad Jacksonville is.

275
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,390
People in Jacksonville go to
Orlando to vacation. All right.

276
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,673
Okay.

277
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,700
Jacksonville, Jacksonville is another one
of those cities that if it started to,

278
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,270
if there was a flood, you know, you
think you had it bad in New Orleans. If,

279
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,440
if Jacksonville literally
fell into the sea,

280
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:09,420
I think it would take at least,

281
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,260
I would say 36 hours before like that.

282
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:19,790
Lighten that news actually hit
the national airwaves. You know,

283
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,690
36 hours after an entire
metropolis fell into the ocean,

284
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,230
somebody would finally
come on TV, be like, uh,

285
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,330
we have a developing story,

286
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,380
something going on in Jacksonville,
Florida. Is that in the south? Eastern.

287
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,180
Northeastern. Thank you.
Thank you. Robert. The
northeastern part of the state,

288
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:41,750
like no one even fucking know
what goes on in Jacksonville.

289
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,240
You had a USFL team back in the day.
Right?

290
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,440
The Florida gators and the fucking
Georgia bulldogs play there once a year.

291
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,270
Everybody comes to town, they drink their
beer and they fuck you. Women, you know,

292
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,360
and they drive out and then that's,
it becomes quiet again.

293
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:03,170
A couple of tumbleweeds blow across,
you know, you got the Jaguar.

294
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,190
That's actually pretty amazing,
you know,

295
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,500
for a city to get a professional franchise
when they have no other professional

296
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,920
franchises. Like his late in the game
is Jacksonville got a fucking team.

297
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:21,220
You know what I mean?
Like take a,

298
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,750
let's say Portland, Portland,
Oregon. They got a basketball team.

299
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,130
I could see them maybe
getting a baseball team,

300
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,880
you know, I had to get a basketball
team. They showing up for that.

301
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:38,770
Let's fucking try this. Right?
Jacksonville had nothing. Nada,

302
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,480
zero, Zilch. They had nothing.

303
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,670
The Florida gators and Georgia bulldogs
play there because it's some neutral

304
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:51,910
shit in the middle of fucking nowhere.
It's like a musical, you know what I mean?

305
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:55,840
Like when they have like a, the two
gangs are going to fight before they do.

306
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,450
They're going to walk in a circle,
snapping their fingers. Right.

307
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,850
This stupid fucking jeans rolled
up for some unknown reason

308
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,640
other than probably the sexuality
of most of the guys in the play.

309
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,000
Good. How tough guys it. Um,

310
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,390
anyways,
so that's what I'm doing.

311
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,120
And then after that I go to Cincinnati,

312
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,570
Ohio and Cincinnati,
Ohio.

313
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:29,571
That's one of those Zombie cities is all
these great hardworking people right up

314
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:34,260
until four 59 in the afternoon in right
at five. It's like the Fred Flintstone.

315
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:38,100
They all slide down the
brontosaurs getting a God
damn cars and they vacate the

316
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:41,370
city and then all that
is left is drug addicts,

317
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,960
unbelievably poor people. And the
comedian working at the club walking,

318
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,900
that's what's walking down the if five
oh one as the sun starts to go down,

319
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,913
you know what I mean?

320
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,580
Okay.

321
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,140
You started, you know, it's probably the
same feeling like you know that Zebra has

322
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,050
and that that split second where in his,
his peripheral,

323
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,160
whenever the whole herd
scattered and you don't know why,

324
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,330
and you start to feel the breadth of
an alligator and you're like, fuck,

325
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,000
I guess it's me today, right.
Jesus. Bill is Cincinnati that bad?

326
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,350
You know what? Go visit it. Go visit it.

327
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,050
I did. I even mention any
dates. Jesus. What the fuck?

328
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,030
What kind of ways that
to sell a Goddamn tour.

329
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,600
That was like reverse
rock singer right there.

330
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,230
We're fucking rock singers would go
out there and be like, let me tell you,

331
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:36,790
he stopped in Jacksonville.

332
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,210
We've done a lot of cities on his door,
but I've got to tell you,

333
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:44,490
and I think the fellows by me will agree.

334
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,240
We need carbs to crowds,

335
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,220
right?
Just fucking jerking him off.

336
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,020
The reason why I'm excited
to go to these cities,

337
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:58,600
I just want to see what the
fuck people do in these cities.

338
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,700
I've already been to our
land. Oh, I know what that,

339
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:05,410
that's just a bunch of fucking
strip malls. Those Adobe structures.

340
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,050
You know the excitement out
there. You want to go to
five guys, burgers and fries.

341
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:13,980
You want to go down there, you my name,
and they make the base Goddamn burgers.

342
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:20,040
You know, they probably all look
down on Disney world, you know,

343
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,390
bunch of fucking posers. Like that's how
you like you were a rebel in Orlando.

344
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,800
Has You trashed Disney world?

345
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,653
You know?

346
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,570
I don't know why. Why would you
continue this way? You know what it is.

347
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,100
It's not going to be the shows.

348
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,180
It's not going to be the people that
come up to me after the shows and say

349
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:43,240
something mildly racist. You know?
It's not going to be that. It's,

350
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,910
it's going to be the getting
on and getting off of
fucking airplanes out. Jesus.

351
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:52,911
This is like the Tampon fucking menstrual
cramp fucking podcast right now.

352
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,800
We shouldn't. I feel lucky that
I have this amount of work.

353
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,980
You know when all those glass workers got
laid off recently out there in Dayton,

354
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:04,080
Ohio, then they just closed
down the glass factory.

355
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,470
Do you know they're not going to make
glasses in this country anymore? Anywhere

356
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,720
are all gonna be made in the Philippines?
I saw the whole thing on 60 minutes.

357
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,390
Did you guys watch the last
episode of breaking bad?

358
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,110
Did anybody see it as a bunch of fucking
psychos right now covering their ears?

359
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,440
I,

360
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,030
I can't recommend that show enough and
it's not cause old twinkle toes got an a

361
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,950
couple of episodes here.
It's just,

362
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,330
it's the most unbelievable
fucking show I've ever seen.

363
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,470
They just keep,

364
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,440
they just keep twisting it
tighter and tighter and tighter

365
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,840
and every time you think you can breathe,
you know,

366
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:51,880
cause some problem got fucking solved.

367
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,090
Something else comes along
and it's even fucking worse.

368
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,300
Okay.

369
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,240
Unreal.
I'm not gonna say anything that happened.

370
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,100
I probably shouldn't even brought it up
cause this is probably half the fucking

371
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:06,480
people listen to this. Aren't even
listening right now for fear that you know

372
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,930
I was going to give away
something from the show.

373
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,360
Um, I'm not going to do that. All right.
This is the Monday morning podcast.

374
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:22,100
Everybody, if you're new to this
show, um, welcome. Welcome aboard.

375
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,200
If you live in any of the cities I
just trashed. Uh, I stand by that.

376
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,200
That wasn't a joke. Now I know when I, I
know what I'm going to do in Charlotte.

377
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,340
Charlotte, I'm going to go
visit a street side customs.

378
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,400
I'm going to go check out the old cars
there. That's what I'm going to do.

379
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:44,360
Their New York City. Come on
New York. I'll be fine. Orlando,

380
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:46,490
I have no idea what the
fuck I'm going to do.

381
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,060
I tried to find some college football,
I something,

382
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,740
I don't know what I'm going to do.

383
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,630
I think I'm going to walk from the air
condition comedy Condo to the club and

384
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:57,201
then go back.

385
00:24:57,201 --> 00:25:00,320
But I'm actually excited to be there
cause I've never done that one. Let, let,

386
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:00,531
let's,

387
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:03,590
let's try to put a little positive shine
on this fucking white trash tour here

388
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,050
and a Jacksonville.
Um,

389
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,040
there's gotta be some
redneck shit going on.

390
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:15,520
There's gotta be some sort of
rattlesnake roundup, you know,

391
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:18,990
some sort of gun show,
you know,

392
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:21,060
two rednecks with their
trucks chained together,

393
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:25,050
trying to drive in different directions.
Whoever ends up with the other guys,

394
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:26,640
differential wins,
you know,

395
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,790
can I go to something like that as if
fucking something for me to do there.

396
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,880
But actually, when I'm in Charlotte,
I'm going to go to the panthers game,

397
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:35,160
Carolina Panthers Game,
and when I'm in Jacksonville,

398
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,940
I'm going to go to a fucking Jaguar's
game. And when I go to Cincinnati,

399
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:42,690
I'm going, oh, bangles games.
See that? That's how I do
the fucking road. That's how,

400
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,030
that's how I do it. Pointing
at himself with a thump. Um,

401
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,260
all right, here we go. Let's, let's get,

402
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,800
let's get this shot. Let's get some stuff
out of the way here. He voice everybody.

403
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,130
This is like, this has taken off
like wildfire. You know that Cleo,

404
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,240
okay.

405
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,840
I know you're just laying there with
not a fucking excited bone in your body,

406
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:08,290
but I'm telling you, he
voice, he voice is a, is, is,

407
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,540
is killing it. And you're probably
saying eight belt. What is, uh,

408
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,460
what does the voice, he voices
basically your mobile phone at work.

409
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,080
Okay. You can get all kinds of
different phone numbers. Uh Oh.

410
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,670
I always forget the word
virtual virtual phone numbers.

411
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,090
Like when it'd be great if you could
give some guys some guy coming up to you

412
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:32,250
and he wants to buy your widgets,
right?

413
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,780
And you want to give
him your phone number,

414
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:35,880
but you don't want to give me
your real phone number, right?

415
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,600
But you don't want to have 20 cell
phones. All right? With he voice.

416
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:42,270
You can have a whole bunch of different
phone numbers all ring on your cell

417
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:45,570
phone, but nobody really knows your
number. All they know is those other ones.

418
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,980
Right? Did that make sense? Did I
just get lost in the math of that? Um,

419
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:50,550
it basically,

420
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,090
it creates a way that you can actually
make it seem like you have an office

421
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:57,600
building in the beginning when you're
really don't, they got music on hold.

422
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,880
They have professional
voiceover people to be like, oh,

423
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:04,770
La don the s lay something or other,
right?

424
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,170
Whatever English accent,
whatever you want,

425
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,790
they're going to make
you sound professional.

426
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,750
Like this is probably the best way that
I can think if you're starting off a

427
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:15,840
business or if you already have them.
But if you're starting a business,

428
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:19,920
taking that crucial step to get yourself
out of that cubicle and make your

429
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,370
dreams come true today
is to,

430
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,620
is to get the, you got to have some
sort of infrastructure going. Okay,

431
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:32,490
but that costs money. You
know what I mean? Usually it
costs you a bunch of money,

432
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:34,620
but with he voice, it's not going
to cost you a bunch of money.

worldwide drug cartel meeting.

443
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:11,250
I don't know what you need 95 people for,
but just in case you do,

444
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,020
he voices there. But when

call, um, it's easy to use.

Hey,
you know what?

484
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,660
I want to buy a pegboard hanging ended
up on my garage and basically start my

485
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:25,330
own little gym here. It's all body
weight. I got a climbing rope,

486
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,420
I got a dip station, pull up thing and
then I get that peg board right? And I go,

487
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:33,090
I'll and be able to go up and down it
with my skinny little legs hanging off it.

488
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:37,030
Cause I'm not doing any squats you don't
really want to do is a buddy of mine

489
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:40,380
was telling me a on Joe Rogan's
podcast. He's got this hope, uh,

490
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,830
those kettle bell workout.
I heard his listeners are going nuts.

491
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:46,630
Getting all Jack doing that.
I want to do it.

492
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,490
So if anybody knows
what podcast of Rogan's,

493
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:53,900
I got to listen to,
um,

494
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,270
where he basically breaks it down and
then I'll do my cheap ass version of it

495
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:02,230
when I'm on the road by basically going
out and buying two grapefruits and

496
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:06,690
putting them in plastic bags.
Well,

497
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,470
tourists to say principals, um, advice.
Uh, right. Bill Boehner problems.

498
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,080
Oh Jesus Christ. Here we go. Dear Bill,

499
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:19,081
I'm approaching my 27th birthday and in
the past couple of weeks I've had some

500
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:23,840
issues with getting erect. Ugh.
All right. All right, well I'll,

501
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,150
Jesus. Okay, here we go.
Instead of getting wood,
having sex or looking at porn,

502
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:31,390
I now have to fiddle with
myself just to get hard.

503
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,770
I don't know if this is due to
mild do this is so fucking beyond.

504
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,900
Okay.

505
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,560
This is a doctor drew question.
All right, so don't listen to me,

506
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:43,420
but I got to make this funny dude.
All right,

507
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:46,600
so fast forward this cause I don't want
to add to your psychological problems.

508
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,351
Um,

509
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:51,910
I dunno if this is due to mild depression
caused by stress being overweight or

510
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:55,390
I'm just getting old and this is how
I'm going to be. I am overweight,

511
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:59,080
but since April, I've been steadily losing
weight and exercise and good for you.

512
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,460
I do have mild depression. I know
where you're coming from. I got it too.

513
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,640
And I've had bouts of erectile
dysfunction in the past,

514
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,200
but they usually don't last
more than a few days. Um,

515
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,090
yeah,
I don't know what to tell you.

516
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,800
I would say don't rub one out
for a couple of days, you know,

517
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,010
and then stand on your back
porch with the junk hanging out.

518
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:23,560
And I imagine the first time the wind
blows, I think you'll be in the game.

519
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,060
That's my advice. And it's off
to Chicago and let's win there.

520
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,040
Yeah. I don't know what to
tell you, dude. Like I would,

521
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,730
I would seek some sort
of professional help.

522
00:32:34,731 --> 00:32:37,510
See if you've got a circulation problem.
Um,

523
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,920
but I think the biggest
thing you're doing,

524
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,410
which is great as you're losing
weight because a, you know,

525
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,140
eat too many fucking Cinnabons.
It clogs up the plumbing.

526
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,920
And I know that because I
don't have a medical degree.

527
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,270
I'm ignoring girlfriends past bill.

528
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:57,770
I am an Aussie with the beautiful
girlfriend out. Speaking of Australians,

529
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,050
I'm going to Sydney in, uh, in October.

530
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:04,730
You see what I just did
there? This guy's, you know,

531
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,950
actually he basically
started a conversation with,

532
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,000
with me and I just interrupted them and
being that do shit the party right now.

533
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,010
But I actually,
you guys have seen,

534
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:17,090
did you see that video where the fucking
little Aussie bullies punching the fat

535
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:22,091
headed fucking kid who I like outweighs
them by 80 pounds and finally the,

536
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:26,150
the, the kid getting bullied
just can't take it anymore.

537
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,150
And he just picks this kid up and I
can't even like lifts him up basically a

538
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:35,030
little above his head.
And if you just dropped him there,

539
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:37,790
that would have been amazing.
But he liked fucking,

540
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,920
it was like he was ringing out a mat
is how he threw this kid down to the

541
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,830
fucking ground,
like shaking out a beach towel,

542
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:48,770
except it was this kid's
rag doll body like his,

543
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:52,490
the kid's whole body did the fucking warm,
except when he came back,

544
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,330
he'd just from like six feet in the air
and he slammed this kid on the ground.

545
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,590
I couldn't believe this kid's legs
still worked. It was fucking awesome.

546
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,890
But now they got like, they have like,
it's become this entire like mini series.

547
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,570
They interviewed the kid who got bullied
and then they interviewed the kid who

548
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,280
did the bullying and the funny,

549
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:18,200
the bullies crying and he's trying to say
that the fatty fucking was hitting him

550
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:21,290
first, which is total bullshit
because if you look at the fat kid,

551
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:26,210
which I really shouldn't be saying, but
you know, I'm just trying to, you know,

552
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,610
I only have so many minutes here
in the podcast, the Husky Kid,

553
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,450
the fucking kid punches him in the face
and he just stands there with his hands

554
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:36,680
down to his side. He could tell, you know,
if he was walking around hitting people,

555
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,420
his whole body language,
but in a different,

556
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:42,110
I didn't believe that the little
mosquito looking kid. But um,

557
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:43,310
and then so the interview,

558
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:46,430
both of them and then they have the
two of them interviewing each other.

559
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,010
And I gotta tell you, I don't think
I've ever laughed so fucking hard

560
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,450
in my entire life. Not because I think
it's right or I think it's funny.

561
00:34:57,451 --> 00:34:59,730
I just fucking this
just something about it.

562
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:04,710
It just took me back to my childhood.
Just how fucking mean kids are.

563
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,400
Maybe like what, what, what was it
like, what was it like when, when, when,

564
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,970
when you went to skill,
like what was some of,

565
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,450
what was some of the things
the kids used to call you?

566
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:17,360
I know this is a brutal
fucking Aussie accent. Um,

567
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,860
he'd be like, well, you know, they
call me, they call me fatty and,

568
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,330
and with every mean name,
I'm laughing my ass off.

569
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,800
It literally gets to the point where the
kids said he was suicidal and I've been

570
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,130
through all of that.

571
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,320
I've been through all of it and I
actually sat there laughing my ass off

572
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:48,030
watching it and I'm asking you guys, why
am I laughing? I don't find it funny.

573
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,440
I feel bad for the kid,
but with the main,

574
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,300
or the detail is the
harder I fucking left.

575
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,920
I don't know if that,

576
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,600
I don't know if that's like some
sort of like a fallout from trauma.

577
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,980
We're after a while you just like, it's
just becomes funny. There's like nothing.

578
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:07,060
What else are you going to do?

579
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,840
Okay.

580
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,060
Like, I remember like every
fucking movie I go to see,

581
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,570
I know I've told these stories
a zillion times, but this,

582
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,140
this actually fits in it. Like
I'm a one, I saw sling blade.

583
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,880
Okay.

584
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,760
And when that country singer
Dwight Yoakam, when he's zoomed,

585
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:24,380
the guy in the wheelchair
out of the house,

586
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:29,090
why don't you go home and practice Randy
and he get the fuck out of my house and

587
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:33,040
he fucking zone that can the wheelchair
and the guy in the wheelchair like it

588
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:36,620
did like the whiplash thing and
went through the front door, like

589
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,730
the people who are watching the movie
around where either quiet or gasping and I

590
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:46,010
was roaring laughing

591
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,000
and not that. I think that's like it's,
do you know what I mean? Like it's,

592
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,640
it's so wrong.
It's funny.

593
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,550
Ah, I'm probably coming off like
a maniac. I did that one time.

594
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,260
We were flying over to fucking one of
those magical kingdoms over there in

595
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:08,130
Europe where they got a Starbucks
next to a fucking castle, you know?

596
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,133
And uh,

597
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,980
okay.

598
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,060
I was sitting in the aisle,

599
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:18,061
neos in the middle seat and then there
was some girl on the window and uh,

600
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:22,500
yes, I was flying coach, um,

601
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,840
to go do the funny bone in
fucking Afghanistan and uh,

602
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,400
okay.

603
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I was watching a movie on a laptop and I
was laughing so hard at one point I was

604
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:36,400
fucking wheezing and it was one of
those deals where I'm laughing so hard.

605
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,990
People around me are laughing
just at how hard I'm lat.

606
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:43,120
Like the girl on the window was laughing
at how hard I was laughing and I was

607
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:46,930
laughing so hard that I woke me up and
Nia woke up and immediately was like

608
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,950
laughing, like, what the fuck are you
laughing at? And then she leaned over,

609
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:52,660
you know, cause you can't
see in the computer screen.

610
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:57,661
She leaned over and saw that I
was watching the precious and um,

611
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,870
you know, she starts punching me in
the arm, which made it even funnier.

612
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:05,320
And then the girl by the
window found it even funnier.

613
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,240
Okay.

614
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,010
I totally got lost in that fucking story.

615
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:10,960
I don't know what point I'm trying
to make. Like, I'm trying to ask you,

616
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:12,700
why do I find shit like that?
Hilarious.

617
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,420
You know, like whenever I
watched the biggest loser and
they'll be like, you know,

618
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:24,710
so how do you feel about yourself, your,
your fucking Zeppelin, you, you know,

619
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,660
and the guy will be like, well, you know,

620
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:29,600
I have my good days and I
have my bad days. And uh,

621
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,230
then his voice cracks and it's fucking
forehead wrinkles up and he just starts

622
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:37,830
fucking crying like a baby.
I, I, I can't, I don't,

623
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:39,190
I fucking laugh.

624
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:40,840
Okay.

625
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,350
I laughed. Like I'm watching
stripes, intervention,

626
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,313
you know,

627
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,711
intervention.

628
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:54,711
When the family starts reading their
letters of pain to the fucking degenerate

629
00:38:56,011 --> 00:38:59,490
drug addict and a,
they start fucking crying.

630
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,760
I immediately,
I just start roaring laughing.

631
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:03,880
Yeah.

632
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,750
Like it's funny,

633
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,840
like I get more laughs out of that than
if I was watching one of those sitcoms

634
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:09,490
with the good looking people in the couch.

635
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,720
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. Um, anyways,

636
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,250
let's get on with the podcast here. Oh,
Australia, the Australia Guy, right. Um,

637
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,690
if anybody knows what that is, if there's
actually anybody with any steel, what?

638
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,070
Look,

639
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,770
I was just gonna say if there's some sort
of psychologists listening to the shit

640
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,760
as if I deserve professional opinion.

641
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:37,450
After you guys listened to my fucking
moron opinion every week, whatever,

642
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,000
if you're a plumber, I'd like to
hear what you think. All right.

643
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:43,900
Ignoring girlfriends. Uh, pass bill. I'm
an Aussie with a beautiful girlfriend.

644
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,070
How the hell do I stop picturing
her getting nailed by guys.

645
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:51,640
She's dated before me.
I'm torturing myself with these thoughts.

646
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,390
We have great sex and everything. Yeah. Oh
yeah. How do you think she got that way?

647
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,040
Do you use the dice clay line from
banging all those other people, sir? Um,

648
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:04,810
from what I understand, it's something
no one likes to think about it. Dude,

649
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:05,890
I'm just breaking your balls.

650
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,790
All right.
Look,

651
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,150
if you love this girl,

652
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,570
you just got to get past the fact
that she sucked other the Dicks,

653
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,353
you know,

654
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,860
probably enjoyed it. Nah, I'm
just fucking with you now. Um,

655
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,980
that was mean. How do you get past it? Um,

656
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,403
yeah,

657
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,010
I never think about it. I just
look at, I look at women like, uh,

658
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,910
you just picked up a fucking
free agent that's got, you know,

659
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:43,770
good fucking career stats here that
shows that they can get the job done.

660
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,170
You know, they can perform an
October. You know what I mean?

661
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,690
Just look at it like that way.

662
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,110
It's like the Dodgers just picking up
all those red sox. They got Gonzales.

663
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:54,490
You don't,

664
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,370
you think that they cared that he fucking
was playing baseball and some other

665
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,450
towns,
they don't give a fuck.

666
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,710
Just come in here and get the God damn
job done so we can win the championship.

667
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,610
That's how he got to look at it. All
right. If she shows up and she's clean,

668
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,950
she doesn't have any good.
What about you sir?

669
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,850
Yeah.

670
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,610
Next time she's fucking blow in.
You thinking about,

671
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:16,970
think about all the fucking trolls
at the truck stop that you left put,

672
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:19,640
put their mouths on you
and now she's down there.

673
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,033
You know,

674
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,110
there's not enough shampoo and
conditioner to clean your Dick.

675
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,770
Pass a certain fucking age,
and that's the God damn truth.

676
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:30,760
And you don't say anything about it.

677
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,643
That right

678
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,490
as you put it inside of her, give
me a fucking break. All right,

679
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,640
Sarah. It is what it is.
She's banged other people.

680
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:46,710
You're going to have to get facet and uh,
I can guarantee you this.

681
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,200
Okay?

682
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,790
She probably hasn't been with remotely
the amount of people that you have,

683
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,520
not to mention some of the
fucking complete tramps

684
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,060
that, uh, you know what I mean? I like
to think that women are a little more,

685
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:07,770
uh, have a little more discretion
and my issues with women right now,

686
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:10,950
it just kills me that I'm saying something
pro female because I know they're all

687
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:14,280
fucking nodding.
I AskPat um,

688
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,500
yeah,
this is one way or the other.

689
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,300
They're either really discretionary
or they're just fucking womping horse.

690
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,890
And that was a generalization. I
apologize. Um, friends, unholy wedding.

691
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,180
Oh Dude, I was doing so great on
this fucking podcast. I don't know.

692
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,330
It's somewhere I lost
the fucking momentum.

693
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:37,650
I lost my Mojo when I was talking
about why I laugh, you know,

694
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,910
at people with the fucking crutches
falling down a flight of stairs.

695
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:45,690
I don't know why I got into that.
A friend's unholy wedding bill.

696
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,350
I got a problem that I don't think
I can go to go to my friends with.

697
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,060
A friend of mine is getting married.

698
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,560
I've been good friends with the guy since
we were five years old and we are now

699
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:58,440
23. He's getting married
about a year from now.

700
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:01,520
He has selected me to be the groomsmen.
Alright.

701
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,550
I'm guessing either you fucked his wife,
future wife,

702
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,670
or she's banged,
you know,

703
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:13,140
70 people or as fucking around on
him. That's what I'm guessing. Um,

704
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,220
or she's into the devil. One of
the other. This has to be white.

705
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,130
This is an unholy wedding. All right? He's
getting married about a year from now.

706
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,630
Good. You got time. He, he is a selected,

707
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,790
sorry. I need to just was calling
him. She's going to kill me.

708
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:34,150
He's calling from another fucking country
and I just shut it off because I had

709
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:35,950
to pee.
I gotta finish this fucking podcast.

710
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,210
He putting the podcast enemy. Yes. Uh,

711
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:44,260
he's getting married about a year from
now. He has selected me to be a groomsman.

712
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,270
This means I have to pay for a flight
to attend the wedding. Furthermore,

713
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:51,870
his bachelor parties being huge sheet.
Motherfucker.

714
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,350
This is what it's going to be about money.

715
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:01,770
All right. This me, I fucking hate.
Oh, hang on a second. The lovely Nia.

716
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,613
Everybody.

717
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,533
Yeah.

718
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,543
Nia.

719
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,890
Hey listen, I'm doing the podcast.
Can I call you right back?

720
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,660
Okay.

721
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,460
Say hello to the podcast listeners.

722
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,010
Tally Ho I'll talk to you later.

723
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,840
See that she had a fucking hard day and
I'm not there for what? A piece of shit.

724
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,640
All right, let's get back to Tightwad
here and I have to buy a Tuxedo.

725
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,980
You know, uh, a rent one. Ah,

726
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,770
this means I have to pay for a flight
to attend the wedding. Furthermore,

727
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:40,650
his bachelor parties being held in Las
Vegas and I would also have to pay for

728
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:43,290
this light as well as other
expenses of a bachelor party.

729
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,760
Normally this wouldn't be an issue.

730
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,120
I'm a college student and saving the
approximately a thousand dollars,

731
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:51,960
this would cost, would be,
uh, would be stressful,

732
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:55,290
but it would be worth it to see one of
my greatest friends get married. Okay,

733
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,960
so you're not a cheap fuck you
just having money prompts. However,

734
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:02,840
my friend has often lied to
and cheated on his fiance. Oh,

735
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:04,610
okay.

736
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,200
I didn't see that one common. Why
didn't, I guess that. There you go.

737
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,790
There's a whole new fucking
Jesus.

738
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,440
I'm not judging him. I, Tricia,
I disapprove of how we treat.

739
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:21,470
So this guy is actually a good shit and
I actually called them peace of God ever.

740
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,310
I judge you on your first couple of
sentences. What are you gonna do? He goes,

741
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:28,670
I disapprove of how we treat sir,
but I don't get myself involved.

742
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,070
He sleeps around and hides from her.

743
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:34,820
The fact that he smokes pot and
drinks heavily on a daily basis.

744
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:39,380
I don't know how she hasn't noticed.
She's probably because she's a sweetheart.

745
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,360
Okay.

746
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,180
Sweethearts always end up
with fucking dicks like this.

747
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,600
She's never smoked or cheated.
Uh, as far as, you know,

748
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,320
I don't understand why he doesn't find
a different relationship, but again,

749
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,880
I don't get myself involved.

750
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,390
The problem is I can't imagine this
marriage will last very long and I don't

751
00:45:56,391 --> 00:46:01,310
want to pay $1,000 for a sham marriage
at a time when $1,000 is like the lottery

752
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:02,870
to me.
I'm actually offended.

753
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:07,871
These asked me to do all of this for the
wedding and thus spend all this money.

754
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,990
I could not imagine asking any of my
friends to throw away that much money on

755
00:46:11,991 --> 00:46:15,650
something I didn't give a fuck about.
Should I decline to attend the wedding?

756
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:18,020
Any advice would be appreciated.
Uh,

757
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:22,410
I dunno if I can go to our
other friends with this one. Um,

758
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,650
all right.
This

759
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,260
as always as a million different ways
you can play this. There's two options,

760
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,490
three options. All right? One,

761
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,520
you just fucking bite your tongue and
you just go to the goddamn whiting and

762
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,430
think that all right.
Even though it's gonna fucking blow up,

763
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,060
maybe he'll learn something
from it. And then, uh,

764
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,650
you know, by the time
he's 30, he'll grow up.

765
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:58,380
And you guys can actually
be friends again too.

766
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,970
You fucking did I say there was three.
I already forgot the other ones. So we,

767
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:05,963
there's only gonna be two here.

768
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,650
Oh, I'm the why do you guys listen
to this? You know, you know why?

769
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:16,380
Cause it makes you feel better,
doesn't it? It should. Good. No, I,

770
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:21,060
I feel like I'm serving a purpose
now. Um, just sit the guy down.

771
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:24,960
It'd be like, dude, can I ask a
question? Yeah, sure. Matthew, what's up?

772
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,490
What the fuck are you doing? What
do you, what do you, what do,

773
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:29,980
what do you mean what

774
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,590
am I doing? I mean what the
why are you getting married?

775
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,180
Cause I love her anyway.
What is this going dude,

776
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,560
you're fucking everything that moves.
I walked slower when I'm around you.

777
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,990
That's how much shit that you fucking do.
You understand me?

778
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,750
Do you understand where I'm coming
from and you're asking me to go out.

779
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,930
She doesn't know you beaus she
doesn't know that you smoke weed.

780
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:52,970
Yeah.

781
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:57,080
You know I, this is 1000
bucks. If you were actually,

782
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,950
you know,
this is like me flying

783
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,640
to go see the fucking,
I don't know, go see it.

784
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:11,270
The Padres versus the fucking Colorado
Rockies. What is the fucking point,

785
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,350
you know? Yeah. You're,

786
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,590
you're a piece of shit.

787
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:22,010
This marriage isn't going to last and
what's worse is you're doing in front of

788
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:25,130
me and then I got to sit there
and have a conversation. You know,

789
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,190
I got to figure out what part of a face
I'm going to look at cause I can't look

790
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:32,620
at her in the eye. You
dragging me into it. Oh Jesus.

791
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:36,430
This bad advice. I mean you've got to
have, I at least don't say it that way.

792
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,190
Just be like, listen, I don't have $1,000.

793
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,430
I just don't have it
to go to the marriage.

794
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:44,680
And then they had to go to the wedding,
start with that.

795
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,680
And then if he gives you shit,
just say,

796
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,930
oh that's your other option. Just say,
listen, I just don't have the money.

797
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,770
And you bite your tongue and you look
the other way so you don't see them.

798
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,050
The train wreck that's going to happen.
That's the option.

799
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:03,040
Or you can just come clean and just say,
listen dude, I love you to death. Yeah,

800
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:06,310
my buddy. But what you're
doing here, this is wrong.

801
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,140
All right?
You're not being fair to her.

802
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,470
You're not being fair to me,
ed. Yeah, you're fucking,

803
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,400
you're screwing yourself in the long run.

804
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,133
So

805
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,240
this is what you want to do. Go do it.
But I don't want to be a part of it.

806
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,123
All right.

807
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:28,860
Okay.

808
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,730
Yeah.
So my guess is a,

809
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:37,650
your best fucking option as far as
like the least amount of drama is to,

810
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,610
uh,

811
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:43,190
and mental trauma for yourself is to do
the one, I threw it there in the middle.

812
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,080
We just say, listen, I
just don't have the money.

813
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,430
Do Acute believe I'm
supposed to be you, bro. Bro,

814
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,500
it's my wedding dude.

815
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:55,910
I can't believe,
dude,

816
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:58,930
I can't believe you're fucking everything
that moves and you fucking smoke weed.

817
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,760
You booze every day and this girl
doesn't even know how about that.

818
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,910
And you're acting like you're not doing
it even at a fucking me and you expect

819
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,740
me to stay on there. Do you
understand that? You understand that?

820
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:09,710
I realize that you're fucking everything
that moves right now and you're going

821
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:14,270
to go marry this girl and I'm have to
sit there and watch you toast this girl.

822
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:18,110
I love you. You're the, uh, the, the
blood that pumps through my heart.

823
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:20,900
That bullshit. I got to sit there
staring at my fucking Lasagna.

824
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,850
You know there's going to be lasagna.

825
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,980
Anytime you got to cook for
more than fucking 10 people,

826
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:28,700
they just make a big tray of that shit.
We have a meet days.

827
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,820
We have a vegetarian.
Is that big fucking silver tray?

828
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,590
All right.

829
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,840
Is the last one off. This is
a short podcast. 50 minutes.

830
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,230
Satan, this person says, Bill,

831
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,970
if Satan punishes the bad,
doesn't that make him good?

832
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:56,180
And that's from a lady.
Um,

833
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,190
yeah,
I don't get the math on that.

834
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,750
Like most things when it comes to
religion, it doesn't, it doesn't add up.

835
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,393
It's like

836
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:14,280
Satan was in heaven. Right? How
the fuck does it go? Isn't it?

837
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:15,450
What an iron maiden song.

838
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,660
Can I just go listen to like die with
your boots on and then I'll know how this

839
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:20,700
story goes.
Like I fuck or Judas priest,

840
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,193
you know,

841
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,550
point of entry are screaming
for vengeance, don't they
have a song about it?

842
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,740
Whatever St was basically,
you know,

843
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,880
he was like the Zildjian brothers before
they had a fight and then one broke off

844
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:36,920
and created Sabian.
Right.

845
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,020
How about something a
little more mainstream?

846
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,960
It was like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
Right.

847
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:46,710
When they will have been a little
circle jerk around a fucking TRS 80 or

848
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:50,280
whatever the fuck they were doing
and that little fort, you know,

849
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,950
playing dungeons and dragons,
playing poker for each other's loafers,

850
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,900
whatever the fuck they did.
Then they went their separate ways,

851
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,660
whatever Satan was in the club,
but he wanted to run shit.

852
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:08,960
What did he do
the fuck did the guy do again?

853
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,620
Yeah.

854
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,570
Somehow we pissed off God,

855
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,200
Oh, I know. He tried to take over.
He tried to take God's position

856
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,270
and God was like, Oh no, you da all right.

857
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,220
And then cast him into this fucking
pit of fire that never goes out.

858
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:37,370
But Somehow Satan is such
a bad motherfucker that
he sits in the flames and

859
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:42,340
adapted. You know what I mean?
Like somebody back in the day,

860
00:52:42,341 --> 00:52:45,880
they had bronchitis so they'd send them
out to the desert to fucking dry out.

861
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,760
Like that was going to cure you.
He actually got cured to the point.

862
00:52:48,761 --> 00:52:52,540
Now Satan's down there and it's
just chilling. Oh look who got up.

863
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:53,610
Okay.

864
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,110
Oh Cleo,
get over here

865
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,070
now you got to Itch
fucking for nine hours.

866
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,513
MMM.

867
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,890
Yes. So now he's down there
like fucking uh, you know,

868
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:11,891
lucky Luciano hanging out at the fucking
Flamingo and then you go down there,

869
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:20,500
you go down, you basically live
your life the way he wanted you to,

870
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,250
and then you show up at the club and
that he's mad at you and then kicks the

871
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:27,870
shit out of you.
It doesn't make any sense.

872
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,810
And technically he's then punishing
you for doing what he did.

873
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,240
Is it like, uh, like that's like
the mail room, like God's mail room.

874
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,680
So we sit in this sort sorting envelopes,
like he's still working for God.

875
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,680
I don't, I really don't know how it works.
I actually went to church this week.

876
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,890
Oh Gee.

877
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,580
I went there in the second I
walk in, I just can't, like I,

878
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,670
I don't buy into any of it.
I went with the,

879
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,240
I went with Nina's mom,
we went to church.

880
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:02,900
Okay.

881
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,280
And what I tried to do when I go in
there is it go above all of it and try to

882
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:12,150
like, you know, connect with something
like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost,

883
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,250
you know, try to connect with something
else other than what they're saying,

884
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,870
like literally what they're preaching.
It's like,

885
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,420
I ain't no.

886
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,990
Okay.

887
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,890
You guys had the holy wars, you had the
fucking inquisition. I mean, you fucking,

888
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,850
you know,
want Jewish people after World War II.

889
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,410
We're trying to get this shit back.

890
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:37,530
Like the amount of stuff that
went into the Vatican, I mean,

891
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,210
you would down with the Nazis.

892
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:40,750
Okay.

893
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:45,490
Like how has this plate, like, how did
Penn state lose all those victories?

894
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:46,660
Okay.

895
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,560
Right. Lost all those victories. And
what happened to the Catholic Church?

896
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,020
You know, I've, I've talked about
this a zillion fucking types.

897
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,520
They have broken on a global level,

898
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,270
every major fucking
commandment that there is,

899
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,710
and they just sit there.
Okay,

900
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,710
holy,
holy,

901
00:55:05,711 --> 00:55:09,820
holy by Buddha.

902
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,830
Fucking tell me how to
live my life. Um, yeah,

903
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:18,820
I just don't buy into it.

904
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,230
Okay.

905
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,590
And then the money basset came around and
my, I've given these motherfuckers shit

906
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,750
as with me, his mom, and I was like, ah,

907
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,980
I don't want to be an
asshole in front of us.

908
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:29,960
I threw five bucks in their five bucks.

909
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:34,961
I just paid $5 for the fucking defense
attorney in a pedophile case kind of ag

910
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,990
telling me I'm not going to hell right.
Then they'll being so goddamn stupid.

911
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,360
Yeah. Who was a, and they
had the guy, they had the,

912
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:50,361
this Irish tenor guy who was singing
songs keep and behind it and he would do

913
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:51,900
like this big conducting thing.

914
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:54,210
He was like totally fucking into
it to get the crowd going. Right.

915
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:57,990
He had this awful suit on.
It didn't fit them, you know,

916
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,350
looks like he ate donuts and shit
and they stay in the guy in the,

917
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:08,260
the preacher gave him a fucking
shout out. He goes this week. Ah,

918
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:09,790
yeah.

919
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:14,140
We would like to extend a congratulation
to a, that guy over there.

920
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:19,141
It can't fit into a sport coat
for 20 years of sagging sogs hair.

921
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,830
This church yet,

922
00:56:20,831 --> 00:56:25,831
I want to say here's to another
50 years Eric has church.

923
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:29,860
Nobody clapped and it's like
he's going to be dead in 50

924
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,780
we're all going to be, I'll be
dead. Well, maybe not right.

925
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,810
94 what?
Fitbit with dentures.

926
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:43,030
That's going to be a sad fucking day.

927
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:48,010
Me fucking wheel in my ass under
the stage. Fucking at 94 years old.

928
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,230
You know somebody with a Jetsons
haircut interviewing me for the show.

929
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,570
Do you still enjoy it?
Do you still a joke every night?

930
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:02,320
I could get out there bigger Chabot,
the people's faces.

931
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,513
MMM.

932
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,260
Fucking sitting there instead
of like bottled water backstage.

933
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,580
I'll have like vital organs being grown
to be inserted in me before I go out

934
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:18,870
there. That's like the level of a,
Oh no, that won't be available to me.

935
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,950
Dick Cheney. You'll have that shit.
He'll still be walking around.

936
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,083
MMM.

937
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,010
Anyway, what the fuck was I
just talking about? Oh yeah.

938
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:32,840
Phrase another 50 years there. Deck
Chair. He's going to be dead. Look at him.

939
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,790
He's like 40 pounds over fucking weight.

940
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:42,370
He's sliding into 50 at about 90 miles
an hour without a helmet on the way this

941
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,380
guy's fucking eat and he's not,
he's not gonna make it.

942
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,660
He probably has some fucking
horrific collection of porn.

943
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,980
He's not wearing a wedding ring.
This fucking, he's sweaty. Like,

944
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:00,140
what is he doing? Sky's sad. He has
no fucking life. I feel bad for him.

945
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,410
Let's get him a haircut.
Get Him a gym membership.

946
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:06,830
And how about we make the last seven
years of his fucking life enjoyable?

947
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,500
How about that? Why don't we go
out and get a harlot for this guy?

948
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,493
You know,

949
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:16,890
the physical equivalent to a dozen
donuts. He'll be able to relate. You know,

950
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,690
I'm not even saying any
of that's true people.

951
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,170
That's just what was going
through my head when I was there.

952
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:29,120
There was some guy in the pew
hate that Word Pew in front of me,

953
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,130
and he just looked like an evil
motherfucker. You know, he was balding.

954
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,360
He was like in his, uh,
he was like pushing 60.

955
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,370
He was Tan.

956
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,090
Okay.

957
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,820
He fucking balding,
but he still's Diana's hair,

958
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:49,290
jet black and he had a pinky ring
and a bracelet on right there.

959
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,530
Pinky ring and a bracelet. You're a
dishonest motherfucker. All right.

960
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,080
Unless you were a check.
If you're a guy and you're wearing that,

961
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:02,330
you know that Dr Vinnie boombox
fucking outfit. That's it.

962
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,060
You're a piece of shit. And he
just, Oh, when he looked over at me,

963
00:59:05,061 --> 00:59:07,670
peace be with you.
I want to be like fuck you.

964
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,850
Yeah.

965
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,320
Now what do you mean what?
You know what it's for.

966
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:14,950
If whatever the fuck you did since last
Sunday with your pinkie ring and your

967
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:18,580
bracelet, I, Jesus Christ. I think I
was just sitting there judging people.

968
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,570
You know, they all two girls, you know,

969
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:29,150
set of the altar boys just to
keep the priest honest, you know,

970
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,500
which I thought was brilliant.

971
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:35,501
That's a brilliant way to keep them away
from little boys is to let girls do it.

972
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:37,910
Cause they were all girls.
There was no boys there.

973
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,190
What else can I trash about it?

974
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,140
I can't remember. You know, I, I,

975
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,580
he gave the homily and I didn't remember
one fucking thing that he said he

976
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:53,980
wasn't Mike. Well, I couldn't understand
what he's saying. I don't, that was my,

977
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:55,960
those are my little trip to
fucking church. But I went,

978
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:01,390
but I went and I actually saw the
confessionals and I was thinking, Jesus,

979
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:05,320
this shit that I have to get off my chest.
And then,

980
01:00:05,321 --> 01:00:08,080
but then I always think like a,
what a fuck do I want to tell this guy?

981
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:13,190
Why do I got to go in there and tell
it to you? And then it goes, yeah.

982
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,630
Then you run it up the fucking line,

983
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,833
you know,

984
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,670
fucking Weirdo.

985
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,540
You just want to hear all the bad shit
that I did because you're not allowed to

986
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:29,430
go out and fucking bang a
broad, ah, Jesus fill you. Just,

987
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:32,820
you're just, you're just going over old
fucking points. You've already made.

988
01:00:32,821 --> 01:00:36,660
We get it. Oh, Geez. You don't like to
shit. All right, let's, uh, let's, let's,

989
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,360
let's conclude here with,
let's,

990
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:44,100
let's try to bring this around to
something positive. All right. Um,

991
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:50,100
let's start with the video games.

game fly.com but everybody did I you want

995

Dotcom baby. Um, all right.

996
01:01:05,221 --> 01:01:07,440

I'd go to www.game,

1002
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:30,561
fly.com/ [inaudible] or
click on the banner ad on my
podcast page and get a free

1003
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:34,820
trial. And I would joy 8,000 video
games for two weeks. And you know what?

1004
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:38,780
I do have to two weeks,
I'd give him 23 bucks for a membership.

1005
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:44,200
I put on my virtual glasses and I would
go to another world and I would kill the

1006
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,650
bad things, right? And
when I couldn't do what,

1007
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:50,890
I would get frustrated and I would go
online and I'd find the cheats and I get

1008
01:01:50,891 --> 01:01:53,230
all the weapons and I would
finish the game in 20 minutes.

1009
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,410
It would make me feel good,
right?

1010
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:01,260
Then I would yell out at other people
because I would feel guilty. Um,

1011
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,430
anyways. Yeah.

you won't have to deal with the world

1014
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:13,740
anymore.
All right.

okay.

1024
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,750
They kicked me a percentage
of whatever you know,

1025
01:02:43,751 --> 01:02:47,680
people buy and then I take a
percentage of that. I, I basically,

1026
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,300
I'm kicking her overall 10%,
as I say,

1027
01:02:49,301 --> 01:02:51,630
every week of the advertising
money that I make,

1028
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:55,330
and I sent it over to the wounded
warriors project. It's a great damn thing.

1029
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:59,620
And a why not after this last hour of
filth and all the horrible things that

1030
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:02,290
I've said, it's nice that I
could bring it around to this.

1031
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:04,990
This a nice little moment here.
You know?

1032
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,810
Holy Moly.

1033
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,870
All Right Dad. Still fucking
podcast. Go Fuck Yourself.

1034
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,150
That's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1035
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,380
Please come out and see me at
the first stop on the white trash

1036
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:26,060
tour. Um, in, at the, uh, what
the hell am I going to be?

1037
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:30,470
I'm gonna at the Improv in Orlando,
Florida. Would you like the exact dates?

1038
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,290
You want me to hold your hand
through this whole thing?

1039
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:38,240
I know we're Alando with the,
when am I supposed to be there?

1040
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:43,700
Go this fucking computer. Come
on. Orlando Improv September 7th,

1041
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:49,200
eighth and ninth since September
7th and eighth. Is that true?

1042
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:53,400
I thought it was there for
three days. Thursday, Friday,
Saturdays when I'm there.

1043
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,910
Comedy Zone, Charlotte, September 13th,

1044
01:03:56,911 --> 01:04:00,150
14th and 15th and I'll see
you at the game on Sunday.

1045
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,620
MMM.

1046
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,221
Oh by the way,

1047
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:06,180
if anybody has any ideas of some shit
that I can go to a gun store or something

1048
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:11,070
that's going to fucking be a cool thing
to do in any of these cities for the

1049
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:12,270
love of God,
let me know.

1050
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:15,090
Cause God knows the travel
channel never comes to your towns.

1051
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:20,130
Caroline's the makeup date from July,
I'm going to be there September,

1052
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:25,130
2021 22 and 23 and I will be there with
the teen idols sensation from the and

1053
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:30,840
Anthony Program, the one and
only Joe, Joey Rose's Derosa.

1054
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:36,470
Okay. This is his farewell
performance as a feature act. Okay.

1055
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:39,950
This is literally the end of an era.
Um,

1056
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:43,400
I can't even say he's arguably the
greatest feature act of all time.

1057
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:47,690
He is the greatest feature
act of all time. And A,

1058
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:51,740
we want to thank him all the headliners
in this country for his dedicated

1059
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:56,270
service in the, uh, feature
position for all of these years. Um,

1060
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,890
he stayed there longer than he had
then he had to kind of like a blue chip

1061
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:04,250
prospect in college sports who leaves
after his freshman or sophomore year.

1062
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:07,550
Joe is like the Tim
Duncan of feature acts.

1063
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:12,500
He did all four years and this
is his farewell performance. Um,

1064
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,400
of course he's going to get even
more dressed up than usual. Uh,

1065
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,300
which usually is the one thing
that if I could criticize him,

1066
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:22,720
it's the way he always out
dresses me as a feature. But um,

1067
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,810
he always pulls back the
reins on his talent, you know,

1068
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:30,811
because he chooses what's good for the
show over what's good for Joey roses.

1069
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,220
Okay. And that's why he's the,
he's the greatest of all time.

1070
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:38,140
He did things in the feature position
that have never been done before and a,

1071
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:38,980
and in the opening.

1072
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,350
Okay.

1073
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,650
And the opening slot is Sean Pat and
one of my favorite new comics out there.

1074
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:47,970
It's going to be a great show.
All of us have drinking problems.

1075
01:05:47,971 --> 01:05:51,150
So we'll be at the bar afterwards.
Please come by and say hello,

1076
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,060
but don't overstay your welcome,
if you know what I'm saying. Right.

1077
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,950
Come by little fucking high five,

1078
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:59,850
get a picture with Joey roses on
his final performance and then move.

1079
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,040
Keep it moving.
All right.

1080
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:06,270
Unless there's somebody there that's
going to show us the tits. Okay.

1081
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,440
I think that that's reasonable.

1082
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,010
I think that's a nice little zone
that we can exist in. Can't we? Um,

1083
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:17,760
then the comedy zone in
Jacksonville, Florida. Okay.
I have never been here before.

1084
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:22,110
If this is literally carved in the side
of a fucking barn right next to a check

1085
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,330
cashing store,
it will not surprise me.

1086
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:29,130
I'm really looking forward to
seeing what human beings look like.

1087
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,900
Like what if you were gonna say like
Jacksonville, Florida, you know,

1088
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:37,830
you got a cities, you
got B cities, c cities.

1089
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:40,910
Like where would you put that?
You know what I mean?

1090
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,500
That was like the other day I was
talking to a, I was talking to somebody.

1091
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:46,650
Okay.

1092
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:49,840
And we were talking about this guy who
was dumb but wasn't mentally challenged.

1093
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:54,900
And I basically said, yeah, he
got the f brain is basically it.

1094
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:57,340
That was my way of saying that, you
know, there's nothing wrong with them.

1095
01:06:57,341 --> 01:06:59,860
He just got, you know, there's
the a brain, the bee brain,

1096
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:01,600
okay.

1097
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,880
The sea, like the brain
would be fucking, you know,

1098
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:07,510
Bill Gates and those types
of guys. Einstein, you get,
you get the deal, right?

1099
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:10,090
It's just like writing a paper. You
get the f brain, you know, you failed,

1100
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:15,490
you failed at life. There's nothing
technically wrong with your brain.

1101
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,350
You know what, it's like a car, you know,

1102
01:07:18,351 --> 01:07:22,270
like when they had the z 28 but they also
had like the rally sport with like a v

1103
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,300
six engine and no air conditioning.
You've got the brain version of that.

1104
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:29,800
All right,
so I'm going into a city.

1105
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,870
I wouldn't even, I, when I
say Jacksonville's an F, I
wouldn't say an EP. I was,

1106
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,220
it's a d, it's a fucking day. All
right, and you people in Jacksonville,

1107
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,860
if you fucking offended by this,
come out to the show.

1108
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,870
And I will give you the floor.

1109
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:49,170
I will give you a minute during my show
to stand up like it's a town meeting and

1110
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:54,541
I want you to defend your fucking city
and tell me why it deserves a better

1111
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:57,330
grade than a d.
All right.

1112
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,860
If you can tell me why
you're better than Tampa.

1113
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,703
Yeah.

1114
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:09,410
You know, at the end of the day to
use that overused expression, um,

1115
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:16,010
I'm going to be in all of these cities so
I'm not above them. You see that? That's

1116
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,310
me pretending like I'm being humble and
down to earth right now. Hey, can I,

1117
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,900
can I talk to you guys
about that right now?

1118
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:25,730
Not being humble or pretending to
be humble, kind of, uh, the fucking,

1119
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,090
the amount of hacky shit
that's on the Internet,

1120
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:34,540
like on Twitter that somebody comes up
with something and everybody dives on it,

1121
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,073
you know,

1122
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,020
like when people do that,
that,

1123
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:44,020
that feeling when those tweets.

1124
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,320
Okay.

1125
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,280
You know what I mean?
Like why,

1126
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:51,230
why would you think when you like the
90th fucking person to do it in a last

1127
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,780
minute? That that's still fucking
cool. The shaking my head.

1128
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,373
Okay.

1129
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:56,900
You know,

1130
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,380
just a bunch of fucking hacks and then
they'll turn around and criticize movies

1131
01:09:00,381 --> 01:09:04,880
and Shit, you know, or a guy like
kid rock. What's wrong with people?

1132
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:10,940
Alright. Oh, full of shit. Huh?
A hypocritical bill. That's it.

1133
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:14,930
I'm done. Go fuck yourselves. Have
a great week on all the podcasts.

1134
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,810
Was a little wait late today,
but uh, you know, it's a day off.

1135
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:21,020
Stop acting like you were in your cubicle.
You weren't doing shit to you today.

1136
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:24,890
Right? Football season
starts. Who Do you like?

1137
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,970
Jesus, I can't end this
podcast. I got to tell you this.

1138
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:32,600
I have fucking issue with
the quarterback on my team.

1139
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:39,310
All right. I saw something very
disturbing that started to, you know,

1140
01:09:39,311 --> 01:09:43,120
to start this season and it had nothing
to do with the horrific pass protection

1141
01:09:43,121 --> 01:09:44,740
that I've seen in the pre season.

1142
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:50,850
It has to do with a particular quarterback
on the cover of this magazine with a

1143
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:54,400
Doberman pincher and
the Dobermans growling.

1144
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:59,680
And he's also going like,
ah, like the dog too. And uh,

1145
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,600
it's just,
it's just not a good look.

1146
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:06,300
I remember there was a time when this
particular individual said, you know,

1147
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:09,540
I'm not into commercials in that I just
want to win championships and now I'm

1148
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:12,740
looking at this guy with
his perfect teen idols,

1149
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:17,550
stubble on the cover of the
magazine as if he said, hey,

1150
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:21,210
I have a shoot on Tuesday.
What Day should I stop shaving?

1151
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:26,010
Um, I dunno. I'm hoping if I do this,

1152
01:10:26,011 --> 01:10:28,920
this'll be like the reverse jinx will
this will actually make them win a

1153
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:30,780
Superbowl this year.
Okay.

1154
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:36,570
Because we won that thing last year in
fucking choked it away and it's still

1155
01:10:36,571 --> 01:10:39,210
bugs me.
We had that fucking game one

1156
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,340
we had at one and we fucking
choked it away. Actually,

1157
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:46,980
I can't say choked it away cause that's
takes away from the giants victory.

1158
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:51,360
I'll say this is what it is. We had the
opportunity to win the game and choked.

1159
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:55,230
They then had the opportunity to win
the game and did not. They delivered.

1160
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:59,550
We did not. All right, so I don't
know what the fuck we're on.

1161
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:02,820
Magazine covers for ground
with dogs for when we came in.

1162
01:11:02,821 --> 01:11:06,990
Second doesn't make sense
to me. I don't, you know,

1163
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,240
it's like back in the day when I used
to watch Peyton Manning, you know,

1164
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:12,060
lose another fucking playoff game.
And next thing you know,

1165
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:16,710
he's driving down fucking street in a
pacer, waving at a camera, you know,

1166
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:19,740
with a Gillette razor in his hand.
I don't fucking understand that.

1167
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,300
Really build with 20 minutes of
fucking advertising on your podcast.

1168
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:26,540
You don't get it. You'd dump
content. Alright, I'm RDF Sia.
