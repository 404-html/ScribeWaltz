1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,060
Hey, what's going on?
It's bill burr and a,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,410
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:11,320
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.
And Ah,

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,800
what's going on? How are you just checking
on you? You having a good week? Huh?

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,190
You getting along with people
and they driving you nuts?

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,830
Do you got somebody that
you're not talking to?

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,220
I am not talking to that person.
Huh?

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,230
What a fucking waste to
energy that you know,

9
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:36,010
many times in my fucking life I've been
involved with not talking to somebody.

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,350
How much fucking effort it takes to not
look at somebody that you're not talking

11
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,320
to in a goddamn room.
You know,

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,700
so fucking weird to know somebody.
No,

13
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,220
they were in a room and
not fucking talk to the,

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,090
you can't even focus on the person
you're talking to. It's weird.

15
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:57,520
Cause if they were a complete stranger,
you wouldn't even notice them.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,390
Let's they add a nice rare or
if you're an ass man like me,

17
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:03,810
they've got a nice ass, you know, you
do that thing where you kind of law,

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,470
you know, you look at around him,
like act like you're stretching. Um,

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,260
so anyway, so what's going on with you
guys? You know, it's Thursday, Thursday.

20
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:16,990
Lighten up. Lighten up.
Just, just, just fucking, uh,

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,970
you know, smooth out the, uh, the bridges
there. Whenever you build the bridges,

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,590
whatever the fuck you say, just walk up
to somebody. Say, listen, you know what?

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,680
Aa and I still think you're a cunt,

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,730
but I'm still gonna say Elodia cause
I'm sick of not saying hello. So, hey,

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,660
how are you? Oh yeah, that's
good guy. Fuck off. No,

26
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,490
you know, just leaving that option
open. Cause it doesn't mean you, you,

27
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,960
you can't cut somebody out
of your fucking life either.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,780
Don't ever be afraid to do that.

29
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,530
Don't ever be afraid to treat
somebody like a fuck tumor. Um,

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,090
I don't know why I'm saying all
this shit. Um, I'm actually in a,

31
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:53,420
I'm in a great fucking mood.

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,820
All Billy red face has been
fucking first time in my life.

33
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,180
I've been working in Hollywood
23 years.

34
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,910
I'm working in Hollywood.
Up until now,

35
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:09,870
all I've done as a random acting gig
and I've done stand up and we all know

36
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:13,050
that's not working. That's just fun. Um,

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,550
the little last week to keep you guys
interested to keep stoking the fires here.

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,250
Uh,
me and the guys down at wild west,

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
the men and women down at wild
west have been editing. Uh,

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,920
the six episodes of f is for family
that's coming out on Netflix in December.

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,270
And, um, Jesus Christ, dude, Jesus Christ,

42
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,120
um,

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,680
all knew I already had respect for fucking
editors and all of that type of shit,

44
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:42,210
but actually going through
the fucking process, um,

45
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:46,830
I just just been going all fucking day
long and into the night and all of that

46
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:51,390
shit. But I gotta tell you this, I am
so ridiculously excited about this show.

47
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:55,860
I think this might be the one,
this is a, I really got a,

48
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,010
I'm not going to jinx it.
I think I'm,

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,110
you guys are going to find it as
funny as we're finding it, but um,

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,490
that comes out in December
and uh, I actually, we did
some of the music yesterday.

51
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,000
You wouldn't fucking believe all the
shit you got to do next time you watch

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,650
anything. Just listen to
the music, that transition.

53
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,910
Like you got to sit there and watch the
fucking episode and when you go from one

54
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,990
fucking thing that's going on
to another thing, it's like,

55
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:25,570
do you need like some music there?
If we do,

56
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,600
what kind of music or
this emotion is happening?

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,920
What sorta doing that, you know,
I gotta be honest with you,

58
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,090
I love music but doing it that way
it becomes fucking work. But, uh,

59
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,830
I still had a good time cause I'm
the studio that does the music. Um,

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,110
they got this one classic song that we're,
that we're going to buy.

61
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,340
You gotta buy the music,
right?

62
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,340
And one of the cool characters
is driving down the street,

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,280
not to give anything away here.
And uh,

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,270
they let me play the drums over the drum
track to put it on that just to some

65
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,250
fucking cool to do. And
uh, I got to tell you,

66
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:04,160
it's one of the coolest fucking
things they ever got to do. And, uh,

67
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,180
this guy had a home studio where they
built a room inside of the room and I was

68
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,640
blown away because my whole life, I pick
the fucking instrument we have to go.

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,780
Typical fucking comedian, right?
I'm already isolated enough,

70
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,250
already enough of a loner already.
Enough of a psycho. I picked drums. Well,

71
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:26,080
you basically have to go play in some
studio space in a warehouse in the middle

72
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:30,610
of some fucking trucking district so
you don't piss off your neighbors and

73
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,520
seeing this person, you know,
personally, I had a house, you know,

74
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,860
with people right on either side,
one of those,

75
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,810
reach out the window and
touch your neighbors house.

76
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,250
And they had built a room within
the fucking room. I mean, Gut,

77
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:44,770
granted it cost a fortune, but dude,
like you're in there, it's Trump's,

78
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,940
you gotta have your plugs. You go
outside fucking dudes playing. No,

79
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,660
he just said it was cool. It was so
fucking quiet. I couldn't believe it.

80
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,840
So now of course I'm
obsessed with that and uh,

81
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,540
I don't have any room in my house
to do it, but I'm thinking like,

82
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:03,070
you know this kitchen? Nah. You know, we
don't need to sit down to have breakfast.

83
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:07,690
I could fucking build a little room
within a room. I could put my fucking,

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,820
my drug drums right in there.

85
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Then I'm staring at right now that I
can't fucking play 71 Ludwig green spot.

86
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,120
Right.
Got a fucking kind of play him.

87
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,690
I actually, this is
well fucked up. This is,

88
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,930
I actually have professional carrying
cases for my drums because I have to pack

89
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:31,481
them up,

90
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:35,740
put them in the back of my truck and drive
them to a fuck if I want to play them.

91
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,940
I just can't sit down like all you
can to play the Ukulele. Right.

92
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,140
Just sit down and you jam jams and cross
your fucking legs and start singing tip

93
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,080
toe through the tulips, whatever. The
few new with the fucking windows open.

94
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,030
Nobody gives a shit.
Right? It's a Ukulele.

95
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,070
If you get a noise
complaint for a Ukulele,

96
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:57,900
do you have any idea how bad you suck?
I'm just saying,

97
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,090
all right. The greatest drummer in
the world could be playing drums,

98
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:06,090
somebody next to those and be like,
know they're going to freak the fuck out.

99
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,760
Um, till it typical. Why?

100
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:13,050
Why would I pick something so antisocial?
So anyways,

101
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,100
so we've been having a great time and uh,
I got to tell you man,

102
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:21,270
I think it's a fucking
great God damn show. And um,

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,430
everybody,
we got so many people on Sam Rockwell,

104
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:27,850
Justin Long fucking crushing it on this
thing and it got me laughing and watch

105
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:32,580
these tapes like 50 fucking times in a
row and they still got me laughing. Um,

106
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,810
uh, I dunno. All right.
Whatever, whatever.

107
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,560
Let's just plow ahead here that Kate has
been a little geek out fucking excited

108
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:44,250
about this thing. You know I'm loving
about it is Netflix is letting me,

109
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,650
letting us be like standup comedy.
Funny.

110
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,370
Cause they don't have any
fucking advertisers, right?
They don't have them. Well,

111
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:51,120
when in doubt,

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,980
fucking cunts age at 12 to 13 and a half,

113
00:06:55,981 --> 00:07:00,100
aren't you a, you know, fucking uh,

114
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,040
I dunno suggesting that they sniff glue,
whatever the fuck it is that they do.

115
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,830
You know, I don't even know what
they say cause I just glaze over.

116
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,540
I glaze over whenever a meeting and that
happens during a script thing I owe for

117
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,140
my whole career. I just glazed over and
there's just something in my head going,

118
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,240
yeah, yeah, so don't pick it
up. Don't pick it up. Fuck it.

119
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,460
Let's end this business relationship.
Let's get outta here.

120
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,680
I'm gonna go back down to the comedy
club and have a good fucking time.

121
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,900
So we get in this,

122
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,780
this God Damn Romper Room Shit where
you got to babysit adults every fucking

123
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:32,250
joke you tell whatever. Staying positive
here. Speaking to say in positive,

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,860
all Tom Brady,

125
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,830
the manual wall want to be
the life you all want to have.

126
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:44,180
I got such a kick out of everybody
trying to rub it in that they upheld his

127
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:47,000
suspension. And by they,
I mean the guy who gave,

128
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,870
who gave out the fucking suspension,
who then was judge and jury. Gee,

129
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,480
did we lose?
Um,

130
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,080
I can't tell you how fucking excited
I am to have a rested pissed off with

131
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,670
something extra to prove Tom Brady
coming in game five. All right.

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,930
All you fucking NFL fans out there
who are loving this shit, right?

133
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,150
Cause you don't have a
dimple in your fucking chin.

134
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,200
You don't got a supermodel on your arm.
You know, got a great head of hair.

135
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,130
That's um, but I don't resent
him for it. I'm rooting for,

136
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,490
I'm rooting for, I'm rooting
for his hairline. Um,

137
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,340
deaf fucking guy is going to come
back. I'm telling you right now, he's,

138
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,400
he's just going to fall.
He's going to fucking destroy.

139
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,650
He's never going to
address this thing again.

140
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,470
And he's going to go in there and he's
gonna kick the shit out of people.

141
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:41,420
And then I just can't wait to see what
the fuck the colts are going to whine

142
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,330
about next year. What are the Raven's
going to whine about next year? What?

143
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:44,501
What the,

144
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:48,770
what are they going to whine about those
two upstanding football fucking clubs.

145
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,300
Jesus Christ.

146
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,120
Realize if Robert Kraft had the personal
life of Jim or say it would never be

147
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:59,120
off at ESPN. I'm telling
you right now, man,

148
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,040
if you want to be a complete the generate,

149
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,300
do it in the fucking Midwest cause
nobody gives a shit. All right?

150
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:10,301
The press is in New York and they're
new in La and maybe they'll Dell Dell 50

151
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,670
cheap bastards. They'll stop off and
fucking Chicago to get themselves up.

152
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,080
I don't know what a fucking hot dog,
whatever the fuck it is.

153
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:20,180
You people lead out there.
They don't give a fuck.

154
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,510
Yeah.

155
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,240
If there is no ocean near it,
okay.

156
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,420
There has to be stacks of bodies before
the mainstream press gives a flying

157
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,620
fuck. So if you're a complete piece of
shit, I mean I'm telling you, Indiana,

158
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,890
it's the place to live in
Indiana is the place to live.

159
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,000
If you're in the clan,

160
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,430
you don't even one of the highest
clan memberships in the country.

161
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,150
And what does Hollywood do?
They make these golly, Gee,

162
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,190
aw shucks movie about basketball teams.

163
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,320
Bunch of white people playing
with the fucking globe.

164
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:53,220
Trotters shorts on even though they're
not on the globe trotters. Right.

165
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,770
I know what I'm talking about. So anyways,
um, uh, I got such exists, one kid wrote,

166
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:02,280
he goes to employ these
legacies destroyed though.

167
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,750
Is it amongst two?
Huh?

168
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,320
Guys like you who were fucking somebody
else's Jersey and you sit there eating

169
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,690
wings becoming even fatter,
get another chin on your fucking face.

170
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,300
It's destroyed with you.
Do you think he gives a fuck?

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,670
His reputation is not destroyed amongst
any of the all time great football

172
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:24,600
players. That's all it gives a fuck
about. All right. And is that the,

173
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,190
you know what I love about,
he gets his suspension.

174
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:30,030
There was no proof while you had a bunch
of circumstantial evidence. All right.

175
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,050
And the best you got 'em on is taking
a contest of air out of a ball.

176
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,130
That's all you have,

177
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,960
which is basically watching somebody
had a 500 foot fucking home run,

178
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,110
but they have too much pine tar.
And then you try and be like, well,

179
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:47,840
if you do know the pie tarp, he wanted
to ground it out to short. What do you,

180
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,910
Oh yeah, we, we won by 38
points. Is that what you're
telling me? Whatever. Enjoy it.

181
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,900
Enjoy it.

182
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,400
You got something to say to a patriots
fan when you fucking lose to us again

183
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,550
next year. All right, so when
join, and as I mentioned before,

184
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,260
I'm totally on board with
dawn Sweeney. Now I got to
be, I'm a Bruins fan. Fuck it.

185
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:10,930
I've had my little pout. I
love Lou Cheech always. Well,

186
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:13,380
same thing with Douggie Hamilton,
but what am I going to do?

187
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,100
They're not Brian's anymore.
What am I not watch the fucking Berlin is?

188
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:22,101
Am I going to start watching Calgary
up there in the fucking saddle dome?

189
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,920
No, I love the king's man, but I'm not
gonna find yet. And I will, you know,

190
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,720
the only good thing about
the Lou Cheech traders,

191
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:32,620
I got to fucking drive down the
staple center. I can watch them

192
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,020
just sit in the crowd crying.
We miss you man.

193
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,260
So,
but I'm going with this.

194
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:46,261
This is my obvious prediction with dawn
Sweeney and this is why I love the guy

195
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,430
already.
He is either,

196
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,690
this is going to be either an absolute
fucking debacle or he's going to be

197
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,180
considered an absolute genius.
And I'm telling you,

198
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:59,630
you gotta respect a man that's
too finally gets this job,

199
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:04,631
who's got the balls to come in
day one and in the short term,

200
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,970
piss off the fan base,

201
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,390
risking in the end that they're
all going to be loving them,

202
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,380
carrying him down the street
when we went another cup. Um,

203
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,200
he's going all enough and with this and I,
I love it.

204
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,900
So I'm going to sit here and I'm
gonna Watch this Bruins season. Well,

205
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:25,200
I don't even know if we'll make the
playoffs, but I'm going to watch, um,

206
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:26,931
I'm gonna,

207
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:30,230
I'm gonna look for the rays of light
is a gradually building this thing up.

208
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,940
And then you try it,
you know,

209
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,750
so fucked up now it's like you literally
have like three years as a GM now to

210
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:40,190
start with nothing and to somehow
turn it all around and when a cup are,

211
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:42,020
they fucking shove you off.
But uh,

212
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,980
whatever my fucking hats off to for a,

213
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,540
for dawn Sweeney for having the
fucking balls to do it and um,

214
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,100
that doesn't work out.
I forgive him the fuck you gay.

215
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:57,060
You somebody got the balls to
do that, you know, I dunno.

216
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,740
What do this is how starved I
am for fucking sports right now.

217
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,120
This time of year,

218
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,630
is it me or does the WNB eight not the
level of play is not nearly as bad as it

219
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:09,620
was years ago.

220
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,340
And I'm looking at the highlights and it
looks pretty fucking entertaining to me.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,040
I'm just saying an entertaining all right.

222
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,520
I know that they can't jump as
high as the guys and all that shit,

223
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:22,280
but at the end of the day, I tell
you, I watched that women's World Cup.

224
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,830
It was fucking phenomenal. Very
entertaining. I will watch.

225
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,020
I like women's soccer better than men's
soccer. The women, they get knocked down,

226
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:31,880
they get back up, they
don't fucking, you know,

227
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,640
rolling around on the ground like the guys
doing the shit they do.

228
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,330
And then when they don't get the yellow
car, the red car, where the fuck it is,

229
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,770
they sit there on their knees.

230
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:46,500
You know what the eyes all up and
fucking their hands out like this.

231
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:50,660
Sing in the last few notes in an opera,
the fuck up off the ground.

232
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,890
Jesus Christ,
you are a disgrace.

233
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,610
Anyways.
Um,

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,910
does that mean I'm going to go out of
the way to sit down and watch a w and NBA

235
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:04,310
NBA game? No I won't, but if I'm
flipping through the channels,

236
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,231
I'm not going to shut off.

237
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:11,150
You'll be great if WMB NBA became this
great thing cause right now they would be

238
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,540
in the fucking ABA years.
You know what I mean?

239
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,250
If I was in broadcasting right now and
I couldn't get in with the big boys,

240
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:21,020
I'd fucking tried to do a w NBA game.

241
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,120
Try to get in with them the way Bob
Costas has got him with the Aba. Right.

242
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,240
He got in and uh, he became
a made guy. Look at him.

243
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:33,320
Now it's what you gotta do when
the dinner did Jackie Moon years.

244
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,540
Is that the name of Wheel Ferris
character? I don't fucking know. So, um,

245
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,610
anyways, so they upheld the Tom Brady
thing. Who's kitten? No, off the record.

246
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:48,290
The guy destroys his cell phone. That's
not a good look. Does it make sense?

247
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,120
This is defense. Makes Sense. Absolutely.

248
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:55,121
What's Tom Brady going to throw out his
cell phone with a bunch of hall of fame

249
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,190
numbers in there,
you know,

250
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,970
budget models, supermodels, phone.
You can't throw the fucking thing out.

251
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:03,840
He's got to destroy it.

252
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:07,530
I would think a lot of famous people
have to destroy their cell phones,

253
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:12,120
their laptops, everything
before they throw it out. Um,

254
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,700
do I think that, uh, you know, I do.

255
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,990
I think that he knew about
the fucking football thing.

256
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:20,580
He probably did do I think it's like
this epic level of fucking cheating and

257
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,920
that's why we won. No, not even remotely.

258
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,000
I think it's a little bit of gamesmanship
and I think Jim Irsay is a fucking

259
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:30,570
baby and that if anybody
did what he did to our team,

260
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,220
you'd find shit that they're doing.
Now.

261
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:36,990
I know a lot of you guys want
to know only the Patriots cheat

262
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,080
and I don't know what to tell
you. I don't know. You know,

263
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:43,440
if you can't be honest about your own
fucking team, I'm sure the Patriots Ben,

264
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,740
the fucking rules. But you know, do
you think the buffalo bills don't,

265
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,240
they've never won a Superbowl
Jesus fucking Christ

266
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,120
if,
if you caught them dead to rights.

267
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,330
Okay.

268
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,740
Not just hearsay with Brady. If you cut
the buffalo bill's dead to rights. I mean,

269
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:03,950
I don't think that you get punished.
They've tried everything else.

270
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,250
They've tried every legitimate
way of fucking winning, right?

271
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,130
They're actually going to be
good this year, man. I think,

272
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:14,480
I think rex Ryan's going to do real well
with that fucking team because he's a

273
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:16,480
defensive minded guy, Danny. And he, they,

274
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,790
they already have a great defense and
I think they led the league in sacks

275
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
according to this person that I talked
to who was not connected to the NFL in

276
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:27,380
any way. All right. I think
they're going to do okay. Um,

277
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,521
and you know what?

278
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,420
I bet they play us early on when Brady
is not playing and they're going to win.

279
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:35,780
And guess who? I'm going to get
a call from all shred and Reagan.

280
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,480
Okay.

281
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,660
I hear from those guys once every six
years because that's how long it takes a

282
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,790
team from buffalo to
beat anybody from Boston

283
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,830
being a country, you know, that's
what I do. Just want to do on here.

284
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,630
A little nice little surf and turf. Little
sugar, little salt. Go Fuck Yourself.

285
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:55,500
All right, let's read a couple
of advertising here and uh,

286
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:57,550
I'll try to be a good boy.
I'll try to be a good boy.

287
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,790
They read this shit so I don't get in
fucking trouble again. Well, you know,

288
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,750
like the way you said that big.
So the chickens were cut off.

289
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,390
Well good. So you're fucking chicken in
your A's. All right. Mile Iq, everybody.

290
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,100
Mile Iq.

291
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,530
Yeah.

292
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,390
Smart Miles here, my luck. Cue Driving
for work is a double edge sword,

293
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,090
right? Uh, you don't have to be an
office but your ass falls asleep.

294
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,800
Let me right there. There's your two
sided sword. I never understood that.

295
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:33,150
Double Edge sword by stabbed some way.
I'm still on the side of the handle.

296
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:36,450
So how is that a problem? Aren't I
slicing the other guy up a little better?

297
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,230
All right, don't just
read the coffee. Okay. Um,

298
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,530
either you're spending too
much time tracking every
mile or you're guesstimating

299
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:51,171
and you end up losing money and even
then your estimates falls about 20% short

300
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:56,580
of what you could be deducting. Stick
it to the mat. Welcomed up Mile Iq,

My like he was the only mileage tracker
that detects logs and calculates your

304
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:09,450
drive for you automatically. You
don't have to worry about it. My,

every time you turn on the ignition.

308
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,660

You know what? I didn't know that.
Is that a good time to hire people?

323
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:26,670
I figure everybody's laying around.
I don't want to get a job, man.

324
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,563
I want to go to the beach.

325
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,380

zip recruiter.com/bar.

341
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,380
That's what I'm doing now when they
make me say it three times, I just, I,

342
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:31,770
at that point I have to act like somebody
is not paying attention. All right,

343
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,110
what am I speaking to? A
toddler. Um, so anyways,

344
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,760
uh, what else did I want to talk about?
What do I have? Your foot being forced.

345
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:45,720
Fed. Do you guys see this story?
I didn't really see the story.

346
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:50,250
What I did was I just looked up Google
news says prisoners on hunger strike in

347
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:55,251
Israel maybe forced fed under new law.

348
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,330
They're going to do it
like they do to the ducks.

349
00:20:57,331 --> 00:21:01,190
Like stick a funnel in them that Fragua

350
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,550
okay.

351
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,610
I fucking hate that Shit, man. I
fucking it. Why do we have to do that?

352
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,090
How do you force feed a duck? Man? I,
first of all, how do you not like a duck?

353
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm not gonna lie to you. I'll
fucking Aye. I duck is delicious.

354
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,410
When I was overseas,

355
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:22,390
I had this breast of duck that was
fucking outstanding. All right?

356
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,740
But as far as I know, the thing wasn't
forced fed. You know what I mean?

357
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,600
What you want to do with animals is you
let them live a life and then in the end

358
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:36,160
you take them out like stacks
and fucking a good fellas, right?

359
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,800
You have the duck put on a pot of coffee.
You know what I mean?

360
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,490
He's walking around in his yellow
Skippy's coming up right behind him with a

361
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,640
silencer. Big Bang, done nothing.

362
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,530
They're sticking a funnel on his fucking
mouth. All right? Jillaroos alum,

363
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,810
Joe Rose alone.

364
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,410
This is where Jesus washed his feet.

365
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,650
Joe Russo's alone sticks
on paper in a wall.

366
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:07,471
Maybe something and visible will
care and make your dreams come true,

367
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,890
but it's your wall.
Shoot.

368
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,240
Anyone else is this. If you had
the love boat in the Middle East,

369
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,180
dig in oil drilling oil,

370
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,840
funneling the money through
the mosque to the Tahoe.

371
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,550
So now be blowing up a pizza parlor.

372
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,790
Alright? Um, Israel.

373
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,720
Less legislator voted Thursday to
allow the force feeding of hunger,

374
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:42,370
striking prisoners in extreme cases.
By the way, shout out to anybody,

375
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:44,710
one of those countries.
So who's listened to this fucking thing?

376
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:49,540
You know who plays drums? You
know, how are you? How are you?

377
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,150
Me Over there. How's it going? Anyways,

378
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,180
a move that appeared to be aiming at
preventing Palestinian inmates from using

379
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:01,300
fast to when they're
released, particularly from
indefinite incarceration.

380
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,390
All right? There you got to
say, what are they in jail for?

381
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,850
And then you also got to
be like, well, what? Well,

382
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,370
if they want to starve themselves to
death, doesn't that save you money?

383
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,510
Or they become a martyr. They're
already in jail, are already a Marta,

384
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:15,430
so why don't you just let
them fucking a naughty,

385
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,403
Huh?

386
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,580
It's usually helps when you fucking
read up on these things. This is me.

387
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,550
If I ever did the national news,
I'd wear a suit though.

388
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,690
I would dress up a little,
boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop. Got a black knight.

389
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:33,290
Leidos, a professional
is that, it's a lie.

390
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,330
I'm bill burr a rides grubs,

391
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:40,331
cut dab the MOH and the Israeli medical
is though Jason called it torture and

392
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:44,390
vowed, well wait a minute, it's
torture to force feed somebody.

393
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,800
How do you force feed somebody?

394
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,690
You know what you do is you make like a
fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

395
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:54,390
but there's no peanut butter cause you
don't want it to be hard to go down.

396
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,390
You wet the bread like
that Asian dude does.

397
00:23:57,391 --> 00:24:00,970
When he wins to a hot dog contest against
all those fucking fat fucks over there

398
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:05,760
and Coney Island, right? You'll wet down.
It's a jelly sandwich. You ball it up,

399
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,530
may just walk towards, we have a
buyer and you're back. You know,

400
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,970
and then you know, you go,
hey, look at that. When he's
not looking, you get clash.

401
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,510
She Hammond on the nape of his neck
and then you just fucking shove it in.

402
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,830
Very good.
Alright,

403
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,480
most talk about fucking a stamina,
you know what I mean?

404
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:31,180
If somebody is trying to force feed me.
If I was starving myself,

405
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:36,080
they came up with a sandwich, you know,
four hours in, I just be like, hey, no,

406
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,630
there's no reason to do that.
I'll eat it.

407
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,490
I wish he didn't dunk it under the water,
but this point has been four hours.

408
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:47,290
I don't give a fuck. I'll eat it.
All right. Anyways, in recent years,

409
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,080
hundreds of Palestinians and conducted
collective individual hunger strikes.

410
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:53,110
Let's get to do force feeding.
How the fuck does that work?

411
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,010
You said force feeding. When
not, I thought they just
stuck like an ivy in. Yeah.

412
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,950
Wait a second. Wait a second. Where
the fuck is that? That's the part.

413
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,360
It's absolutely clear that
this is torture. All right.
Wait a minute here. So now,

414
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,770
now what do you think?
I'm going to Google. Huh?

415
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,410
Not going to Google the fucking weather

416
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,520
force. Feeding the fuck
did I get on this subject?

417
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,163
Methods.

418
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,170
Okay.

419
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,330
Oh, Ben, your mouth.

420
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,810
Okay.

421
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,050
Oh, we'll shove it up. Your
digestive tract force feeding

422
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,910
autonomo force feeding.

423
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,510
Here's what really happens
when you force feed someone.

424
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,700
This is somebody that you
know, who the fuck knows, okay,

425
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:44,340
this needs to be a wire here and
the medical associations, red cars,

426
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:48,510
both condemn force feeding, widespread
condemnation. Nobody likes it. All right?

427
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,430
So they stick in a fucking chair that
looks like one of the prototypes for those

428
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:57,660
weeder. Jim. Thanks. You know, like just
imagine if you work in your upper chest,

429
00:25:57,661 --> 00:26:02,661
so you got to use at a 45 degree angle
and then they got these two like cushion

430
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,910
things so you can't turn your head.
You don't like the neck pillow.

431
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:07,770
Just imagine if it was
for the side of your face.

432
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:09,720
They got these two giant
blocks on either side.

433
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:14,721
Then they strap you in and they will yen
like fucking Hannibal Lecter placement

434
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:17,790
or they put a feeding tube.
Oh, they shove it up your nose.

435
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,240
No matter the circumstance.
Placing the feeding tube is tricky,

436
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,730
especially when the subject is thrashing
around saying, stop doing that. Uh,

437
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,150
it's also vital doctors
performed this procedure.

438
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,690
Even on willing patients have noted
that the tube can go through the nose,

439
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,840
out of the mouth at which points that
it has to be pulled out and replaced.

440
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,520
The tube can also be,

441
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,360
can go down the wind pipe instead of
the esophagus and forcing food into

442
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,040
someone's lung can cause permanent
pneumonia, a collapsed lung or death.

443
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,690
Why aren't they coughing at
that point? Uh, but blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. Right?

444
00:26:52,691 --> 00:26:54,250
So that's how they do it.
A feeding tube,

445
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,970
starvation and refeeding
soon force feeding.

446
00:26:57,971 --> 00:27:00,070
Is it something that
is done on one ms meal?

447
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:02,860
A person who is forced fed has often
been starving themselves for days.

448
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,340
There are complications that come with
feeding someone who just stopped eating

449
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:10,030
entirely,
one of which is called refeeding syndrome.

450
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:14,830
When a person has started themselves for
days, their body metabolism has shifted.

451
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,270
Shifting it back with a sudden lodge
thing of above bar releases insulin.

452
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,473
All right,
this is basing off,

453
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,430
there's this fucking terrible how we
can't get along to this fucking point that

454
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:27,250
you actually have to put somebody in a
jail and then they stop eating and then

455
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:28,300
you got to force feed them

456
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,360
and now cause you give a fuck whether
they live or not. This is just depressing.

457
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,020
We're fucking animals, man. You
know what I mean? We really are.

458
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,570
At the end of the fucking day, half
the shit we do. You know what I mean?

459
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,411
Just watch it.

460
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:44,070
Watch the discovery Channel One time
when they show monkeys and the horrible

461
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,360
shit that they do to each other.

462
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,500
Now that we're finally past the fact that
we realize fucking chimpanzee can rip

463
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,130
your face off and that they also eat
meat and they eat other monkeys and they

464
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,690
enjoy it slowly killing them.
Very sadistically like the, the,

465
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,750
the fucking parallels to human
beings. It's, it's unbelievable.

466
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,820
We're fucking animals. Fucking animals.
So that's why I don't watch the news.

467
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,980
Why don't talk? How fucking
disgusting was that? All right.

468
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,590
That's 28 minutes everybody.
Sorry for the force feeding thing.

469
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,420
You did get to listen to me sing the love
boat theme about the Middle East. Um,

470
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,940
all right. So anyways, I'm
back to playing hockey,

471
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,970
which I'm psyched about
cause I embarrassed myself
so much when I was up in

472
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:22,950
Canada and, uh, that's a good move built.

473
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,560
Don't play hockey for a while
and then go play in Canada.

474
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,900
I'm sure you'll match up. Well. Um,
I actually played last Tuesday night,

475
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,630
which is great too for the fucking,
uh, trying to lose the weight here.

476
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm down to a buck 78.
All right.

477
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,450
It's supposed to be one 77 by Sunday,
um,

478
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,910
to lose my three pounds for the fucking
week. And once they get to one 77,

479
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:48,090
then the next one's one 74. And that's
when it starts to get exciting for me.

480
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,640
Right? That's when the, uh, the fuck,

481
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,760
you know what I've learned
about trying to get abs,

482
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,100
especially at my advanced age, is the
top two abs. They're easy, you know,

483
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,160
that's like that chick that would fuck
anybody in the high school. It's just,

484
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,770
you know, it's, if you
don't have the top two abs.

485
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,260
So like I don't know what to talk to you.
I had came fucking talk to you.

486
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,150
All right. The middle ones are
motherfuckers and the last two,

487
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,760
I know you have eight packs,
eight packs of those long fucking ones.

488
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,860
And that's when you got to
show people your pubes. So I'm,

489
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:21,060
I have no interest in those fucking
things. But those bottom two,

490
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,810
the ones that are basically
the security for your navel,

491
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,700
those two that, that it's
basically, it's fucking impossible.

492
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,193
You know what I mean?

493
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,410
That's like one of those deals where you
gotta be starving yourself and eating a

494
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:38,690
whole chicken every other hour to keep
your body burning it. This when that,

495
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,770
when the trainers use that thing,
it's basically they use creepy shit.

496
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:45,240
Like basically your body is eating itself,
you know,

497
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,290
he said they went, they're
fucking Orange Tan. Um,

498
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,020
well it's a looks business. It's all
about looks. Um, all right, this is your,

499
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,961
this is your Monday.

500
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,630
Does your Thursday afternoon fucking
podcast or I don't know what the hell you

501
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:02,410
guys want from me looking at Bam
30 minutes and to just like that.

502
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,240
Um, I'm actually, you know
what, I'm actually starting
to take drum lessons again.

503
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,470
I had so much fun when I was
up in Montreal and typical me,

504
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,440
I got like 10 fucking things going
on once I'm editing the show,

505
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm taking drum lessons and then I also
enrolled in the a that helicopter safety

506
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:22,840
course because I want to start
getting my cross country miles up.

507
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,290
You know what I mean? Which is basically
anytime you fly like round trip,

508
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,270
I guess 25 miles away from the airport,
something like that,

509
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:31,840
I don't fucking know what I'm
talking about. Um, but uh,

510
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,450
I just want to have all the emergency
procedures down so I'm gonna learn how to

511
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:34,810
do that.

512
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,040
Fucking an autorotation ought to take it
all the way down to the fucking ground.

513
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,730
Pick out a spot, bring that fucker all
the way down to the ground and then,

514
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:45,280
you know what? Then I can fly
around out there. I could feel good,

515
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,480
get myself my 200 hours.
Plus if you have less than 200 hours,

516
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:53,020
you've got to do an annual review.
And who wants to do that? 200 hours.

517
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:54,640
It's every two fucking years,
right?

518
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,810
So then I can blow off studying for
23 months instead of the fucking 11.

519
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,320
I'm going to be in the same boat.
What are you going to do? But, uh,

520
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,270
I want to get my hours
up to like 200 hours.

521
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:07,660
And then I feel like once I have like 200
hours and have really flown around the

522
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:10,540
La based and I know all the fucking
radio calls, got it down by heart,

523
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,100
I really feel like I
know what I'm doing then.

524
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,330
And only then will I bring up a passenger.
Um, but I'm really excited about it.

525
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,640
And uh, I dunno, I got add,

526
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,980
I have to have at least three
fucking things going on at once.

527
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,510
And then my schedule gets
totally overloaded. And then
I'm like, what the fuck?

528
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,730
And then my wife's like,
you need to relax.

529
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,450
And then I get rid of a couple of things
and I chill for a few days or maybe

530
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:36,190
even a week. And then it slowly
builds back up again and um, uh,

531
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,730
it's, uh, it's how I do it.
So go fuck. He's not, and I
don't say that on Thursdays.

532
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,810
You know what?
Enjoy your weekend.

533
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,460
[inaudible] you know I have a
good fucking time. Oh, by the way,

534
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,940
I want to learn how to smoke. No
thing I'm trying to do. I've got,

535
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,790
I've got some ribs this weekend.
All right.

536
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,730
Anybody else got the big green egg?

537
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:00,810
Just tell me how high to pile the fucking
charcoal and then they hickory that I

538
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,220
put in there.
I'm a little confused about that.

539
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,080
Do you always have to soap the hickory?

540
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,010
I know they have the hickory
chips where you're soaking,

541
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,230
but if you get a big block, a hickory
that doesn't need to be smoked. Right.

542
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,000
Just in general. That would, when
it lights, it's, it doesn't burn.

543
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,390
It's smokes. Am I correct in
thinking that cause everything else,

544
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm fucking ready to go. I got
the barbecue, I get the rib rack.

545
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,640
I got that Barbecue Guru thing that's
got the fan on the fucking timer.

546
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,970
I got the place I'm ready to go.

547
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,930
And what I want to do is basically just
start doing it fucking like I always

548
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:38,590
tell how I always learned how to do shit
fucking up royally and making an ass of

549
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:42,260
myself and then gradually
I get it down. So, um,

550
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,710
I'm interested in doing
that. So if anybody, uh,

551
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,460
if you'd done a pork shoulder on the,
on the egg or if you've done ribs,

552
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,800
just let me know.
Uh,

553
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:55,460
I'm really interested in how that whole
thing works as far as building that fire

554
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:59,030
and on how the fuck it
stays lit the whole night.

555
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,420
Like I watched this guy do a,
a pork shoulder with pork,

556
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:06,830
but more fucking accurate.
And um, he put his, uh,

557
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:10,130
the things that will lighten the charcoal,
the little squares he put them, he,

558
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,830
the way he did it was he just stuck them
on the left side knowing that they were

559
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:16,130
going to slowly, they'd light and then
they'd slowly burn all the way across.

560
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,820
And this fucking guy just went to bed
and woke up like eight hours later and he

561
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:26,450
was still right at the temperature
that he needed to be. And um,

562
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,780
you know what I mean? I'm not the
brightest guy. That fucking blows my mind.

563
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,170
So if you guys know how to do it,
please let me know. Cause, uh,

564
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,630
I want to be one of those guys
making youtube videos going. Oh,

565
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:39,200
look at that smoke ring.
Oh, alright. So that's it.

566
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:42,500
That's the Thursday afternoon
podcast. Enjoy the, uh,

567
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,400
the throwback podcast here from,
uh,

568
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,280
a podcast a long time ago from
a time, uh, that was not now.

569
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:52,340
That was a back then.
That's it. Uh, oh. Hey.

570
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,620
And also I'm a book in my fault.

571
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,910
I got a bunch of fucking dates coming
up that it will be announced, uh,

572
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,980
in one granddaddy of them all. Um, and
I'll be announcing those soon. All right,

573
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,020
so that's it. I gave a little teaser.
Everybody started telling you friends, oh,

574
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,190
red face has a show calledF is for family.

575
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:13,640
It's coming out on Netflix in
December. And, uh, he's pretty, uh,

576
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:17,450
he's pretty excited about it and
right be the first to tell people,

577
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:21,200
well, the watch that show, so you can
be the dude. I called a guy, whatever.

578
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,450
Just do me a solid if you
can. I appreciate it. The
can I understand. All right,

579
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:24,840
that's good.

580
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,673
Have a good weekend.

581
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,810
Um, all right, so let's get on with the
podcast. Last week, ladies and Gentlemen,

582
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,230
I had the pleasure fear of performing
on the David Letterman show.

583
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,880
And uh,
most of you went out,

584
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,080
you watched it and you all set
me wonderful emails about it.

585
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,580
And I would read you the wonderful emails,
but they're not funny,

586
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,170
but you are in luck.
You know what ones are funny?

587
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,620
The ones where people did
not like my performance.

588
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,430
So let's read a couple of
those, shall we? Um, all right,

589
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:20,420
let's read the hate mail here.

590
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:24,470
So what happens with all of all of my
hate mail is when people don't like,

591
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:29,450
my act is you can't just
write me evidently and just
say that you don't like my

592
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,000
act. You don't appreciate
what it is I do on the stage.

593
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,500
What you have to do first is you have
to establish what an incredible sense of

594
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:41,501
fucking humor you have and how open you
are to all different forms of humor.

595
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,470
You know, it's that classic thing
like those douchebags on Youtube. Oh,

596
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,760
palm is a fucking idiot
and I'm a Democrat, right?

597
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,550
So then we can be like,
wow,

598
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,630
this guy is left and even he
doesn't like this lefty guy.

599
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,140
So this is what they
do. All right, so here.

600
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,240
So these both these emails follow to a
Goddamn fucking t did the motherfucking u

601
00:36:09,641 --> 00:36:12,790
and v um,
they follow it.

602
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:17,230
They follow that pattern bill. Just read
the fucking thing. Okay, here we go.

603
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,360
All right. Hi there. How this one
starts. Starts off. Nice enough.

604
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,420
Hi there.
I've been a fan for a while.

605
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,710
You seem to have a unique take
on things. Look at this, Huh?

606
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,600
Pat me on the head.

607
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,860
Let me sniffer hand making
me nice and fucking relaxed.

608
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,900
I loved your bit about the muffins
and the mass vehicular murder.

609
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,230
So there you go.

610
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,540
She just showed how it just her
sense of humor spans the globe,

611
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,430
whether I'm attacking food are actually
running over human beings on the

612
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:58,630
sidewalk.
She finds it all funny though.

613
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,990
And here's the rub though.
As a stay at home mom,

614
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,420
I now completely despise you.

615
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,760
I did this bit about being a
stay at home mom. Um, so anyways,

616
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:14,761
she says the hardest part about being
a stay at home mom is being respect is

617
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:19,390
being disrespected by everyone.
I now hope the worst for you,

618
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,890
despite what funny acts you
may think up in the future.

619
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,090
You are a jerk and deserve the
worst that life has to offer.

620
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,283
Okay?

621
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,030
I don't fuck it. I don't, I
don't understand like these,

622
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,450
this is the classic fucking person
where everything is funny until it comes

623
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:45,010
around to some shit in her life.

624
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:49,510
And I make some fun of some shit that
she's doing, being a stay at home mom.

625
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,660
And now all of a sudden she goes from
being a fan of mine to now I am a jerk and

626
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:59,230
deserve the worst that life has to offer.
That's,

627
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,520
that's a fucking hard courts that you
deserve. The worst that life has to offer.

628
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:06,130
So what? I'm going to get leprosy, ed, uh,

629
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,330
be constipated all at the
same time and fucking, uh,

630
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,110
survive a plane crash, but
not in a good way, you know?

631
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,860
Anyways, I don't fucking know. Rarely
you're going to take it to that level.

632
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,980
So I wrote her back and
I said a sweetheart.

633
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,940
Oprah Winfrey called your job
the toughest job on the planet,

634
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,050
on national television and got
an applause break of approval.

635
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:34,060
How much more respect do you need?
I think that's a great point.

636
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:38,240
If I could step outside the email,
break the fucking fourth wall.

637
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,170
Is that what it is? The third wall? I
never knew what the fuck it was. Huh?

638
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:48,080
Oprah Winfrey's on TV saying you have
the toughest job on the planet and

639
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:50,510
everybody claps.
All right.

640
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,410
Did she say being a standup comedian
is the toughest job on the planet?

641
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,880
You think you know what it's like to be
fucking disrespected you apron wherein

642
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,640
sheltered son of a bitch.
Huh?

643
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,580
You want to talk about being disrespected?

644
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:08,150
Look at fucking comedians anytime
they show a comedian in a movie.

645
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,270
Is it a Chris Rock level comic?
It never is.

646
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,540
It's the fucking hack with the lampshade
on his head going Wakawaka right.

647
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,280
Okay.

648
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,180
Didn't the fucking comedian gets
shot in his gut during Scarface.

649
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,510
Ah,
did a fucking stay at home.

650
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:29,980
Mom gets shot in the fucking stomach with
that Mr. Potato head mask on her face

651
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,330
during that show. No. You know why?

652
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,830
Cause she was at home taking
care of the fucking kids. Ah,

653
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,020
Jesus Christ jobs can read
the rest of this email.

654
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:39,250
I didn't even fucking make sense.

655
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:44,230
It started off funny and then it just
went right off the rails like a Prius that

656
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:48,950
you can't fucking stop. Um,
anyways, uh, she says, so I wrote,

657
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,490
I wrote how much more respect do you need?
And then I said,

658
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,610
meanwhile there are children
working in sweat shops.

659
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,720
Would you rather be a stay at home
mom or an eight year old sewing Adidas

660
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,550
together for 16 hours a day?

661
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,770
Yeah.

662
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,970
I came up with another great example
that I wish I had used on TV. How about,

663
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,920
how about you work on one
of those fucking oil rigs,

664
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,900
like those poor bastards who work for BP.

665
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,250
Then all of a sudden out of
nowhere the fucking thing explodes.

666
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,440
You standing on a metal structure in
the middle of the goddamn ocean and next

667
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:24,250
thing you know blows up.
Probably blew up both your air drums.

668
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:28,660
He had deaf now and you're on fire.
All right?

669
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:33,810
And your only option is either burning
to death or jumping off of basically the

670
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,370
equivalent of the top of a brownstone

671
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,090
trying to enter the water without doing
the world's biggest flaming belly flop,

672
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,740
right?
You land in the water,

673
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,090
second and third degree
burns in saltwater. Alright,

674
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,980
pus and blood is oozing into the water
and now all you can do is pray to God

675
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,720
that the Coast Guard gets there
before a sea of sharks eat you alive.

676
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,540
Okay?

677
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:02,930
All right,

678
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,350
you want to do that or you want to
watch Bob the builder for the 800 time

679
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:11,030
lighten up. And then I wrote, Oh,

680
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:13,190
and don't despise or
hope the worst for me.

681
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,040
That causes premature aging hugs.

682
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,300
I know that was kind of mean to say,
but you know what? Go Fuck Yourself.

683
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,780
All right. Here's another one. Once again,

684
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,780
we have to establish credibility
at the top of the email.

685
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,830
Are you guys ready for the credibility
to be established? Jesus Christ,

686
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:34,340
I know I am. Here we go. Ah, Bill,

687
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,640
I am never appalled or capital letters
offended by comedy that I see in here.

688
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,980
All capitals. This sentence,
I have a great sense of humor.

689
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,870
Wow. This is unbelievable. Isn't
that amazing podcast listeners,

690
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,020
this person is never appalled or offended
by comedy that she sees or hears.

691
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,620
She has a great sense of humor.
She has such a great sense of humor.

692
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:04,880
People that she had to
yell at at me and emails.

693
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,560
All right, so just no way she
had a problem with my apt, right?

694
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,110
Let's read the rest of the
email, however. Oh Gee.

695
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,830
You're a parents on the David
Letterman show that I just watched.

696
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Just put down women and motherhood
to an extent that is just downright

697
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,780
unbelievable. dot.dot. Now she's
going to yell again and tasteless.

698
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,220
Now she yells for the rest of this email,
but I'm going to spare you guys.

699
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,370
All right.
I'm going to read it and soothing tones,

700
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,410
but she's screaming the entire time.

701
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:42,950
That's what I'm guessing because
it's all capital letters. Um,

702
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,990
this is what she says.

703
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:49,991
I challenge you to be a single parent
and raise a child and work and attend

704
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:56,471
college alone without any help just in
case you don't know what being a single

705
00:42:57,891 --> 00:43:01,160
parent meets. All right? Um,

706
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,740
you have no idea how hard it really is.

707
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,430
I am disgusted with your act and
will not ever buy any of your DVDs,

708
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,210
et Cetera.

709
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,350
For the first time in my life,
I am disgusted with comedy.

710
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,840
Your comedy, that is like a, she
starts speaking like in film nor,

711
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,530
and I'm disgusted with this comedy.
Y'All comedy that is say, Eh,

712
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,070
23.
Skidoo alright.

713
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:35,150
Your Act touched on many topics that you
were disgraceful and very unappealing.

714
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,910
I think she got so mad she stopped writing
sentences. Um, first of all, sweetheart,

715
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,620
I wasn't making fun of a
single, uh, single, uh,

716
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,200
parents that was making fun of
single parents. Nobody would laugh.

717
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,650
I was talking about stay at home moms.
All right.

718
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,910
You don't remember that
line hanging out all day,

719
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:58,760
making grilled cheese sandwiches.
You given a puppet show,

720
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:02,600
you dress like a dragon and
then some other adult comes
home and gives you money.

721
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,800
You're like a big kid.
That's some other adults coming home,

722
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:09,470
giving you money is your fucking husband.
You dumped broad.

723
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:12,740
Do I gotta fucking spell it out to you?
So I just wrote her back.

724
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:14,780
I just said I wasn't
talking about single moms.

725
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,240
I was talking about stay at home moms.
You weren't listening

726
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,790
just about the time.

727
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,990
I've actually been talking
about this shit on stage and uh,

728
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,120
I don't give a fuck because
it's such a topical bit.

729
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,090
I don't even know if people are gonna
think it's funny in a month. But, uh,

730
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,260
can we please talk about fucking
Bill O'reilly going on the view?

731
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,070
Um, I gotta I gotta tell
you something right now.

732
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,700
I don't like that guy's politics.
I don't like his face.

733
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:15,310
He has, he has that
racist face. You know his,

734
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,820
when he gets mad, his
fucking, his face gets pointy.

735
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,620
He just looks evil.

736
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,240
He's just not a pleasant
human being whatsoever,

737
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,040
but I got to tell you,

738
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,990
he fucking destroyed on the view,

739
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,070
you know,
and I,

740
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,110
somewhere in there was a victory for men
because he took on for fucking women.

741
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:41,320
They were all yelling

742
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,820
and he got two of them to walk
off their own fucking show.

743
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,670
How do you do that?
I as a comedian,

744
00:45:51,671 --> 00:45:54,910
I was embarrassed to,
to stand up Kummete comics just quit,

745
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,190
which is why I'm nominating Joy Bay harbor
and Whoopi Goldberg is Douche bags of

746
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,810
the week. What did you think was going to
ask? Do you think he was going to go? No.

747
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:06,310
Wait,
don't leave.

748
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,240
That's exactly what the
fuck he wanted you to do.

749
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:15,040
I was actually hoping at that point that
the other two women were going to leave

750
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,820
and then he could just start hosting
the O'Reilly factor on the view.

751
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:23,821
That would have been he just totally
100% dominated at the very least,

752
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:28,320
that segment, because I don't,
I don't watch that fucking show,

753
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,400
but just, he just came on.
First of all, he sits down,

754
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:38,401
he's got on that shiny fucking Joe
Pesci shoot Joe Pesci Peshy suit.

755
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,920
It's difficult to say Joe Pesci suit and
he's got his fucking leg spread like a

756
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:49,310
with his ball bag. Hang his
shiny ball bag. He locally
if do you ever see like, uh,

757
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,860
when Kennedy debated Nixon, how,
if you listen to it on the radio,

758
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:56,740
how everybody said Nixon won.
But if you watched it on TV,

759
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:59,380
Nixon was all tanned up.
He had his legs crossed,

760
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,740
he looked like a winner and Nixon sat
there with his fucking legs splayed and

761
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:07,930
cross like underneath the chair.
He looked like a fucking moron.

762
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:11,980
That's what bill O'Reilly looked like.
And he, he just, he still dominated.

763
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,960
I love when he turned to joy and was
just whatever I, I'm paraphrasing here,

764
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:19,930
but he was just like,
be quiet and learned

765
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,190
that she had nothing,
a fucking standup comic.

766
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,660
She had nothing.

767
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,060
The whole segment was fucking
hilarious. And when he goes, uh,

768
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,630
another gem of a moment was when he goes,
you know,

769
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:38,920
a lot of people don't realize this,

770
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:43,921
but 70% of Americans don't
want a mosque at ground zero.

771
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,890
And Joy goes, she goes, well,

772
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:50,570
I'd like to see that that
poll or something like an,

773
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,390
as she sang that the crowd is
applauding what bill O'Reilly just said.

774
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,080
So you really don't need to see
the pole at that point. And,

775
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,150
and getting beyond that,

776
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:05,980
what he really should have said was 70%
of Americans don't realize that they're

777
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:08,830
not building a mosque
at ground zero still,

778
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,640
that they're actually making a rec room
with a ping pong table and an area to

779
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:19,180
pray kind of like they have an area to
pray it every fucking airport, you know,

780
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,721
three,

781
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:24,220
four blocks up the street at a God damn
coat factory is where it's actually

782
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:24,761
being built.

783
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:29,530
But the fact that he said that they're
still building a mosque and that he got

784
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,580
an applause break,

785
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,290
joy is so wrapped up into her own fucking
opinion that she doesn't even hear her

786
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,260
own studio audience back up.

787
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,830
The guy that she's trying to shit on and
the fact that this fucking guy is still

788
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:45,950
putting out inaccurate information,
that people are still back in edit.

789
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,870
It just was fucking awesome
on all of those levels.

790
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,360
And a, I liked how Barbara Walters was
old school. Cool. And she didn't walk off.

791
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:59,710
She gave those two Douche bags of the
week shit for walking off their own show.

792
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,740
And then she got him with a nice
little classy Zinger. He said,

793
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,980
Bill O'reilly's on here this week. When
we come back, we're going to talk, um,

794
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,080
or he's on the show today. We're
going to, when we come back,

795
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,340
he's going to talk about his new
book called pinheads and Patriots.

796
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,550
And then she looked at bill and
she goes, at this point, I, uh,

797
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,900
I'm not sure which you are, or something
like that. It was a great little zinger,

798
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,930
but she wasn't like judging the guy.

799
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,240
I Dunno if the whole thing was funny
and just how bill O'Reilly is, is,

800
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,670
is viewed as this intolerant person.

801
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:37,780
And then he comes on the show of a,
I guess mostly liberals,

802
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:43,140
and then they show absolutely no
tolerance for him and then throw a fucking

803
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:46,840
temper tantrum and walk off their own
goddamn show. I mean, you can't tell me,

804
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:51,841
everybody over at at Fox News wasn't
literally jerking off to that moment.

805
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:56,680
I, Bill O'reilly Bomas became a fucking
rock star in that moment. That was,

806
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:00,100
that was like a standup comic
moment that he did to two comedians,

807
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,790
which blew my mind.
You know?

808
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,870
And I know I'm always trashing
the odds on this show,

809
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:12,850
but that really was a chick way of
handling, losing an argument. Like,

810
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:14,880
I'm just going to get
off up and stormed off.

811
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:20,050
He is so used to people paying for your
drinks and holding the Goddamn door for

812
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:20,410
you.

813
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:25,240
You actually thought that as an adult
that you were just going to walk off the

814
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:28,910
shell and this was going to be this big
moment. And he was going to be like, oh,

815
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:30,650
wait a minute,
let me stop.

816
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,893
Ah,

817
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,610
I loved it. He was like, go ahead
and leave. I don't give a fuck.

818
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:43,420
I'll take over your fucking show.
Um, so anyways, there you go.

819
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,580
Douche bags of the week.

820
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:50,581
Joe Bay Harbor and Whoopi Goldberg for
walking off your own fucking show when a

821
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:54,040
shiny suit fucking,

822
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:59,080
I can't say he's a moron
because he does know.

823
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:03,280
I mean, I look, he, he, he's very red up

824
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:08,620
on that. Yeah. I don't know. I'm
too stupid. This is why I wouldn't,

825
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,361
this is right here.

826
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:13,920
Why I would never engage as much
as I disagree with his opinions.

827
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,200
I don't fucking pay attention
to politics at all. I don't,

828
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:24,140
I find it frustrating. I find it
to be it just a rigged fucking gay.

829
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:28,380
I don't give a fuck, you know,
and I, so I would never try to,

830
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,750
as much as I disagree with Bill O'reilly,

831
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:34,440
I would never go on his show and try
to fucking one up the guy and think I'm

832
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:38,740
going to, uh, beat the guy in an
argument about politics. It's like he,

833
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,470
he's paying attention to
these politicians the way I,

834
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:46,140
I give a fuck about football. I'm not
gonna, I'm not gonna win that argument.

835
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:46,291
I mean,

836
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:50,730
why don't I bring fucking Roy Jones Jr
rover and start debating him in about

837
00:51:50,731 --> 00:51:54,570
boxing. I know. It's just, it was, uh,

838
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,860
it was fucking hilarious at
the whole thing was just,

839
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:03,780
it was hilarious and a big,

840
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:07,500
big fucking victory for that fucking,
I dunno.

841
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,070
I Dunno. It's a stand
up comic. You fucking,

842
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,480
he just tap out. That
was embarrassing. Anyway,

843
00:52:18,481 --> 00:52:21,310
so let's get on with the God
damn podcast for this week. Um,

844
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,120
I kind of liked that you
guys liked that format.

845
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:26,010
Just getting the Douche bag
or the week out of the way.

846
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,970
Right off the fucking best.

847
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:33,020
[inaudible]

848
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,050
notice and remind you, you guys
have a haze. Anybody at work?

849
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,710
I used to work in this
warehouse and we were,

850
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:53,790
we were a bunch of fucking maniacs and
all day long, all we did was break balls.

851
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,050
Uh,

852
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,670
I've told you this shit before because
we were basically mentally smart enough

853
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,450
to work in a warehouse by the time you
went third grade. You know what I mean?

854
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,260
It's supposed to be 10 boxes according to
the packing list. One, two, three, four,

855
00:53:07,261 --> 00:53:11,370
five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10. There you go. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

856
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:15,690
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Sorry,
sesame street, flashback. Um,

857
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:17,440
okay.

858
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,120
So we used to fuck around all the time
and our manager had no control over us.

859
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,900
You know, we didn't respect him. We
knew he wasn't going to win fire.

860
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,080
We wasn't going to fire us.
He didn't have the goddamn heart.

861
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,000
And at the end of the day
we got a fucking job done.

862
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:32,900
So he decides that were the problem is,
is that we're all too fucking young.

863
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,670
There's a level of immaturity out there.

864
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:38,660
Cause we were all in our early twenties
that we, uh, that he should hire.

865
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,340
He hired this 38 year old guy.
Um,

866
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,770
I actually remember his name,
but I'm not going to any,

867
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:50,330
I don't name names on this
shit. And uh, Jesus Christ,
that fucking guys, almost 60,

868
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,420
he was like 38 and that was
22 fucking years ago. He's 60.

869
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:56,960
Okay.

870
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,360
What the fuck?
So anyways,

871
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:04,361
this guy drove a fucking Sky Blue
Chevy cavalier station wagon,

872
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:09,500
four door, bare bones,
factory fucking rims.

873
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:13,640
The car was like three years old.
He had 8,000 miles on it.

874
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,643
All right?

875
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,120
And this guy was a Weirdo and
he had these fucking glasses,

876
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:25,100
these black frame glasses that nobody
wore in the eighties so we immediately

877
00:54:25,101 --> 00:54:28,810
started calling them
woody. We'd be, hey woody,

878
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,390
how many boxes we get over there?
And this guy was just bizarre.

879
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,540
And he'd come home, why call me? What
are you, are you trying to bring me down?

880
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,610
She kept saying,
you're trying to bring me down.

881
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,520
Did I already tell this fucking story?
This sounds oddly familiar to me.

882
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,010
Okay.

883
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,520
So we would just fuck with them.
We would just be like,

884
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:49,540
okay at four 31 today, everybody just
start going, what do you, what do you,

885
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,670
what do you, what do you, that's
what we would do. He would be

886
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,660
picking orders down in the,

887
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:58,600
in the warehouse area and we would
all be picking orders with them.

888
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:01,150
And then out of nowhere
we were just talking

889
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,083
cold water,

890
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,040
top of our fucking lungs.

891
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:10,020
I know it's fucking as sophomores
but it would fit. And what,

892
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:13,700
we wouldn't say it to him,
we would just fucking be,

893
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,400
it was really passive aggressive cause
he already talked to management about us

894
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,770
calling him woody. So it's like,
dude, we're not calling you.

895
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:23,940
Woody would just go on
woody, woody, woody, woody,
woody, look in your vicinity.

896
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,480
So we do the same thing trying to bring
me down. You're trying to beat me down.

897
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:30,600
So eventually we haze this guy so
much that he fucking quit. All right.

898
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,440
He and his little Chevy Cavalier fucking
four door sky blue bare bone station

899
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:38,010
wagon drove right out in the back of
my head. I was like, you know what,

900
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:42,710
I got a bad feeling that mother
fuckers coming back. That's right.

901
00:55:42,711 --> 00:55:44,990
Right around the time when people
first started going postal.

902
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:50,240
So it wasn't enough that that we
actually drove this guy out of work.

903
00:55:50,241 --> 00:55:54,740
What are they fucking maniacs I worked
with somehow got the guys home phone

904
00:55:54,741 --> 00:55:59,741
number and the following week he still
didn't have a job and he picked up the

905
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:02,030
phone. He's like, hello.

906
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,880
And there was 10 of us standing
around the phone and we all go,

907
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,163
Ooh.

908
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,840
And I always pictured him slamming the
phone down and then looking up like that

909
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:17,590
dude in a clockwork work orange when he
realizes the dude who came and fucking

910
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:21,700
kicked the shit out of him and
he raped his wife, came back. Um,

911
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:25,680
that's kind of an ugly story.
It, you know, for, you know,

912
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:28,740
for as much as people sit there and they
talk about this cyber bullying and all

913
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:33,240
this type of shit and how fucking
horrible it is, which it is obviously,

914
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,650
uh, you know, I don't like how everybody
tries to act like they were a victim.

915
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:44,740
Well, I mean weren't you a little bit of
both? Cause I know I used to get bullied.

916
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,930
Jesus Christ walking up the street
looking like fucking that kid on the, uh,

917
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:53,320
the family Griffith.
What the fuck is that

918
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,970
the hell an Andy Griffith. How did
I come up with a family? Griffith.

919
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,010
Ah, my fucking brain is
mush. Um, yeah, people,

920
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:07,340
you immediately came walking
up the street. My fucking mind.

921
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,210
My hair was orange when I was growing up.

922
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,200
I think I didn't get the shit kicked
out of me, you know? But then, you know,

923
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:16,230
I got to live with big, bigger.
I got a couple more freckles.

924
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:19,470
I got got some more confidence and I
just started picking on kids who were a

925
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:20,400
younger than I was.

926
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,170
So now whenever I see
those God damn stories,

927
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:30,970
um, I just, I dunno, I,

928
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:33,890
I see both sides of it. I just see
like, yeah, you shouldn't have fucking

929
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,980
done that, but I don't judge the
bully because I did shit like that.

930
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:44,080
You guys didn't do shit like that.
That's the theme of this whole

931
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:52,230
[inaudible].
