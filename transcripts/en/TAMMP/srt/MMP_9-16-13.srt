1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,930
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,850
September 16th, 2013. I hope
this doesn't sound weird.

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:13,940
I don't know what happened.
I think my dog laid down on my mix.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,580
It sounded weird. Sounded weird to
me, man. It's freaking me out. Me.

5
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,130
And, um, how was your weekend?

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,130
Why do I ask questions
that you can't answer?

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,640
Like I'm talking to a listener on the
phone. I'm not, I'm not doing that.

8
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:33,641
I'm laying here by myself as
always excited to be back home.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,610
Um,
for those of you who have lives,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,240
for those of you who just happened to,
I dunno,

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,240
end up on this podcast.
Welcome.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,260
I do one of these every single week and a,
I have a website,

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,830
they bill bird.com and a,

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,460
if you like what you hear here and
you want to hear my fucking a standup

15
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:55,971
specials,

16
00:00:55,971 --> 00:01:00,971
they have a hard copy version
and a $5 downloadable version.

17
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,470
Whatever the hell you want to do,
it's right there for your taking.

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,950
All right there.
Whored myself out early.

19
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:11,450
People showing a lot of
leg early in the podcast.

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,650
Um, I don't know where to
begin with this weekend.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,670
Okay.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,810
[inaudible] let's start at the beginning.
First of all,

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,560
just when I think Paul
Versey is a smart man.

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,380
Just when I think like,
no, no. You know what?

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,250
This guy isn't like,
I don't little,

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,820
I don't know what the word is.
Do you know?

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,940
I bet you guys have a lot
of people like this. I,

28
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:41,941
I know a number of guys in this business
who have these unbelievable like

29
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:47,750
perceptive powers. Like they see somebody,
they can read them and, and they,

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,200
they can figure out situations,
but you know,

31
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:54,230
you give them a simple math problem
and you just see the look on their face

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,860
and you the whole time you're friends
with them, you wrestle. You'll,

33
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:03,890
is this guy a smart guy?

34
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,560
Yeah.

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,240
Or is he a moron who just guesses
really well? Now fucking with you,

36
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:13,660
I obviously think Paul's a smart guy,
but you know, we all have our moments.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,080
Paul Versey had a moment, uh, but
right before we went to Texas,

38
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:21,670
and this is the deal,
we're doing El Paso on a Thursday night.

39
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,040
We're doing San Antonio Friday night
and then Saturday we'll go into the,

40
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,874
uh,

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,950
the Alabama and Texas a and m game and
then we're going to get back and we're

42
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,650
going to watch the Mayweather fight.
That was basically the weekend.

43
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,760
That was the plan. That's
what was on the books. Okay.

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,790
El Paso is a makeup date on the Billy
red state tour and we added San Antonio.

45
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,010
Okay. So one step back, two steps
forward. That was the game plan.

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,270
So me and Virginia ridiculously excited
cause we're going to this fucking game

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,070
and we're going to drive from El Paso
to, to San Antonio. And in Texas is like,

48
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,030
you're driving that all
my God, good luck. That's,

49
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,190
you're not gonna see anything.
There's nothing.

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,340
It's going to be like driving on the
surface of the moon and all this shit.

51
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,030
This is what they tell us.
So I don't know what somebody told Versie,

52
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,680
but evidently he's watched a couple,

53
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:19,681
two or three things on these Mexican
drug cartels and he was freaking the fuck

54
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:25,710
out. Like he's going. Yeah, dude,
I don't know about this. Uh,

55
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,350
this El Paso, you know, they
got like these drug lords
down there and blah, blah,

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,050
blah, blah. And I don't know
if, wait, are we talking about
Paul? He goes, yeah man, I,

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,310
I just wish we had a gun or something.

58
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,480
He kept saying how he wanted to
bring a gun and I was like, Paul,

59
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,390
we're not going across the border.
I'm not saying it's not a dangerous city.

60
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,140
I'm not saying that it's not right
next to a really dangerous city.

61
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,700
And I'm not saying that something
fucked up might not happen, but you,

62
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,180
you're freaking out and I need you to
relax. And he just kept going. I'll do,

63
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:57,210
we should take the tire iron
and have that under the car.

64
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:00,410
I mean under the front seat of the car.
Like before when we liked,

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,590
this is a guy who lives and
works in New York City at night.

66
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,200
All right? This is a classic, classic
fucking New Yorkers. I'm telling you,

67
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,860
they are no different than somebody who
grew up in the middle of nowhere and

68
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:18,360
lives on a farm. They're the exact
same way. All they know is their world.

69
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,130
He's so used to the danger that's familiar
in New York City that he doesn't even

70
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:27,210
see it anymore and he watches one on one
or two of these fucking hardcopies 60

71
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:30,780
minute things on, uh, you know,
people get in their faces,

72
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:34,650
peeled back and getting tortured and
kidnapped and all that shit down there in

73
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,360
Mexico and all of a
sudden he's freaking out,

74
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,940
freaking out about Mexicans as he's
driving by the Puerto Rican day parade.

75
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,923
You see what I'm saying?

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,510
Worried that he's going to get robbed
when Wall Street is right down the

77
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:55,120
fucking, I dunno, right around
the corner from where he lives.

78
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,350
Those people have their fingers
in your fucking account already.

79
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,980
You're worried about some
hypothetical shit. All right.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,620
Where you live as third and short El Paso,

81
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:11,010
that's a fucking Hail Mary when it
comes to something actually happening.

82
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,730
So I'm kept going, Paul, will you
fucking relax? It's going to be fine.

83
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,900
It's going to be great.

84
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,380
It's going to be a part of the country
you haven't gone to and we just kept bad.

85
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,590
No, dude, I'm just saying I'm not
an idiot. I know I'm from nude.

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,380
It just kept escalating and at one park
point I'm yelling at him on the phone

87
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,490
and I went and I screamed
the words drug cartel,

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,630
trying to reason with them and then I
just stopped and you can ask him this.

89
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:38,190
I just said, listen, I just said drug
cartel. I'm done with this conversation.

90
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,340
I'll see you in El Paso
so I fucking hang up.

91
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,290
So I get to the fucking airport.

92
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,370
I fly out and I'm ridiculously
excited to go to El Paso,

93
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:54,480
Texas and then fucking do this
drive down to San Antonio, Texas.

94
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,530
All right. That was the game. And
to let you know a left turns coming.

95
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,950
How about a little foreshadowing?

96
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,490
Here's a fucking letter in
email I got from some somebody,

97
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:09,410
I don't know where they live either in
New Mexico. I don't know what Orin, Texas,

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,010
this is what it says that my heart
is like, I can't wait to go here.

99
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:15,860
Can't wait to make up this date. I'll
probably do an hour and a half on stage.

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,760
This is going to be fucking awesome.
That was my intention.

101
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,300
This is the email I get Monday
morning. Thanks for nothing, Bill.

102
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,230
I'm done with you.

103
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,070
I twice you've ditched El Paso
and yesterday he means like, uh,

104
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,920
the day of the Gig,
he goes,

105
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:35,921
I wasn't notified until 4:12 PM the show
was at eight o'clock after a five hour

106
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:40,760
drive to El Paso, basically that
the show was canceled. He goes,

107
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:43,730
apparently you think nothing of El Paso.

108
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,150
So right now you got to
be sitting at your desk.

109
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,850
You gotta be sitting in your shop.
You got to be sitting at your cubicle,

110
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,440
maybe sitting,
sending a bus stop.

111
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,170
Maybe you're waiting for that
fucking plane to take off.

112
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,650
And there's some [inaudible] telling you
you have to power down your device and

113
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:01,400
you don't feel like doing it because you
want to know what happens in El Paso.

114
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,140
All right? So this is what
happens. I fucking, uh,

115
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,230
I landed in El Paso and overseas already
there and he's meeting me at the term

116
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:15,170
and El Paso's a great fucking airport.
It's one of those ones where there's no,

117
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:18,920
am I in terminal a terminal B?
The whole fucking thing is in one area.

118
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,730
It's like a mom and pop airport. Get
in, get out the securities grades.

119
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,490
Fucking awesome. I love it. All right,

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,510
so I land there and I get off the
plane and there's Versie alright.

121
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,050
Dressed like he's going to go
clean somebody's fucking pool.

122
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:34,940
Yeah,

123
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,350
he's got these fucking basketball shorts
that are hanging down below his knee.

124
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,030
Right. He didn't have on flip
flop. He had on black socks,

125
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,860
black sneakers and I think white shorts,

126
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,250
Mesh shorts that hung down below. He was
a fucking, and he said he was already,

127
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:56,000
it was already a shit show and he's got
his tee shirt on and he's sitting there

128
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,220
with a backpack,
like a book bag,

129
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:02,390
like he's going to class or something
and then like some assorted duffle bag,

130
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,310
like he's going to go to the gym in
1977 this is how the man travels.

131
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,893
Okay.

132
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,370
And he's standing there
with like this excited,

133
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,280
relieved and nervous look on his face.

134
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:20,810
He's at the airport and he's
fucking nervous about being
in El Paso because he's

135
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:25,220
convinced that he's going to get
kidnapped by some drug cartel.

136
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,400
Dragged back to Mexico
and held for ransom.

137
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,450
And evidently Obama's going to
get on TV and be like, you know,

138
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:36,050
we got to get this, this citizen back.
He's done so much for this country.

139
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,500
You know, this, this is what
he's fucking concerned about.

140
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,710
And immediately he starts going
like, yeah, dude, dude, you know, I,

141
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:45,530
I was just over there. You see that
they are selling a bunch of skulls.

142
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,160
They sounded like all these skeletons
and all these skulls in the, uh,

143
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,150
the gift shop and it sent Mexican holiday.
You know that the day of the dead,

144
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,010
I don't know when it is,
but they celebrate the dead.

145
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,630
It's a little weird, but whatever
Santa Claus isn't, you know,

146
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,000
some fat fuck coming down you
goddamn chimney to give you toys.

147
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,380
And if you're a cunt,
he puts some sort of fossil fuel.

148
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:08,970
Okay?

149
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,860
I love that. If you're
bad, you get coal. Well,

150
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,560
you still giving me a way to
heat the house. You dumb cunt.

151
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,420
Why don't you just hit leave?
Nothing.

152
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:19,990
Just why don't you just leave a terse
letter in my stock and you have a think

153
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:24,640
about that. Um, it's not Santa Claus.

154
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:27,250
It's Billy Gibbons. Grandfather.
A lot of people don't know that,

155
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,990
but let's continue. Speaking of Texas. So
I'm already laughing and I'm just like,

156
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:34,660
Paul, come on man. It's
the day of the dead.

157
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,810
And I actually went up and I bought the
magnet knee is actually into that shit.

158
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,910
So I was like, all right, let me, uh,

159
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,280
let me grab one of these fucking
magnet things here. And um,

160
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,940
so I'm just laughing at them.
So now we drive over and it's,

161
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,840
it's like already starting to rain.

162
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,800
Okay.

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,700
Which in my, in our worlds is no big
deal. It wasn't even that bad or rain.

164
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,020
It was kind of bad, but not that
bad. Right. So we're driving around,

165
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,830
I'm fucking all excited just checking out
the landscape, the different buildings.

166
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,980
And it's a really cool city where, you
know, they have some corporate shit,

167
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:10,090
but for the most part the Starbucks is
and those kinds of things. I don't know,

168
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:12,340
the skyscrapers aren't
really fucking with El Paso.

169
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:14,940
Like everything's kind of
like get, you know, like, uh,

170
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,460
no more than like a five story building.
There's a few, but generally speaking,

171
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:19,510
you drive down the street.

172
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,080
It looks like one giant main
street is all these places, right?

173
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,380
The lady at the Hertz Rental
car tells us where to get, uh,

174
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,850
some good Mexican food. We go there, I
forget the name of this shit that we had,

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,850
but it was on fucking believable.
It was great.

176
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:38,350
And of course we walk into the place
and it's some mom and pop kind of place

177
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,650
that the locals go to. We walk
in, everybody turns to look first.

178
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:43,690
He immediately thinks he's going
to get kidnapped. He goes, dude,

179
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:45,850
you just see that everybody's,
everybody's looking at us.

180
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,190
It's like Paul that happens in
a dive bar where you're from,

181
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,840
where you fucking relax,

182
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,080
you're going to get us fucking punched
in the face with that fucking look on

183
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:59,920
your face. Alright, Jesus Christ.

184
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,390
So we sit down,

185
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:05,470
we have an amazing fucking meal first
starting to relax a little bit, right?

186
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:10,240
And I'm sitting there and I haven't this,
this might, this little FedEx envelope.

187
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,170
I have the four tickets to l pass up
to El Paso to the, uh, the Aggie game.

188
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,670
And I got the four cigars were going to
smoke. All right. And, uh, you know, for,

189
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:22,090
for the, for people going into the game
and I just keep holding onto that thing,

190
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,400
like, yeah, might as well had
it handcuffed to my wrist.

191
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:27,010
I was so paranoid that I was
going to lose the tickets,

192
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:31,090
crushed the cigars and just fuck
up the whole weekend. So, um,

193
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,940
we eat, it's awesome. And we drive down
the main street and versus you just going,

194
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:39,290
yeah, I do that. I don't, I don't
like this, I don't like this. Right.

195
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,490
And he said she's all fucking
nervous and we get to the hotel,

196
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:46,610
it's a fucking hotel. They check
us in, everything's all good.

197
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,880
We get up to the rums and,
uh,

198
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,030
I called the venue by tee
shirts for the red state towards

199
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,260
shown up. Everything's looking
like it's going to go good.

200
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,830
Then it starts raining a little
bit more. But once again, you know,

201
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,970
actually when we would go in there too,

202
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,820
there was some streets that were blocked
off because of flooding. And I'm like,

203
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,520
ah, you know, it's kind
of a desert out here,

204
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,400
so I guess they don't handle the rain
too well, but I wasn't thinking anything.

205
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:14,401
And then all of a sudden my agent called
up along with the promoter and they

206
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,384
said,
listen,

207
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,360
the first thing they sent me was that
it had the venue, it got switched,

208
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,370
which should've been the first red flag.

209
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:29,020
They said the venue I supposed to perform
it lost power and they were having a

210
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:32,440
little bit of flooding or something
like that. And I was like, you know,

211
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,300
I'm looking at my hotel
window like really?

212
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,280
I had no idea I that doesn't seem
right. So then they fucking, they said,

213
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:43,780
change of venue. It said, please
wait, let me confirm that.

214
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,130
And I said,
all right.

215
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,160
So I sat there and all I'm thinking is
people are driving into the fucking show.

216
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,830
I don't want to start the show and have
half of them go to the wrong theater.

217
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,780
The other half girl, the right
to you. So I say fuck it.

218
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:59,770
And I tweeted out and I say,
a, the venue has been changed.

219
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,820
It's now over here, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. Um,

220
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,500
about a half hour after that,

221
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,620
my agent and the fucking promoter
call up and they say, listen,

222
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,480
um,
you know,

223
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,260
we're now having problems
at the other theater.

224
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:22,060
Like there might be a power outage and
because of the flooding and roads and all

225
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:22,930
this type of shit,

226
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,580
people like maybe half the
crowd is going to show up.

227
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,070
So I was like, all right, wait a minute
now if only half the crowd shows up,

228
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,710
does that other half get
refunds? And they said, no.

229
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,440
So what do you want to do?

230
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,170
Do you want to do the show or
do you want to reschedule it?

231
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,880
So at that point I'm going to fuck
over half the people. So I said, no,

232
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:50,760
let's reschedule it. I'll fly back out
here. It's only, you know, a couple,

233
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,550
two, three hour flight. I'll
do it again. And uh, you know,

234
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:58,060
I'll figure something out. You know,
let's rescheduled as soon as we can.

235
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,680
So I went on Twitter,
I deleted that one,

236
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:02,620
and then I sent the thing and I knew that
there was going to be people like this

237
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:05,140
guy who's fucking pissed.
Um,

238
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,590
all of that shit happened
between two and four o'clock.

239
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,630
So my apologies to the person
who's done with me, but, uh,

240
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,483
you know,

241
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,800
and I said on Twitter to
quote breaking bad and uh,

242
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,480
Hule slash Lavelle Crawford
who's a fucking, a phenomenal
comedian and actor, uh,

243
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,310
was an act of God. There was nothing I
could do was I supposed to do, you know.

244
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,070
Um, so I, uh,

245
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:38,330
I apologize that it didn't
happen and then, you know,

246
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:42,410
me and [inaudible] went out and got
absolutely fucking hammered and spend as

247
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:46,340
much money as we could in El Paso
killing our livers and brain cells.

248
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,180
I actually,
we went to a bar and we uh,

249
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,410
I ran to a couple people that was supposed
to come out to the show and they kind

250
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:57,170
of explained to me that because
it doesn't rain out there a lot,

251
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:01,220
that the grounds really dry and it can
absorb it and then you just kind of flows

252
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,290
down right over the top of it.

253
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,290
I have no idea because that looked like
a above average rain storm to me and um,

254
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,320
so whatever. So I am going to reschedule
it. Surf you are done with me. Uh,

255
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,170
I understand,

256
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,820
but I was not my fault and the first time
I guess it was my fault cause I chose

257
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,540
an acting gig in a movie. But um,
what the, what am I supposed to do?

258
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,860
I have to do that. That'd be
like, sir, you are going to
go to my, my fucking show.

259
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,370
And all of a sudden the chick you always
wanted to bang says, Hey, you know what?

260
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,860
You can hit it but only tonight.
What are you going to say?

261
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,400
You're going to come and see my
dump. Freckled redhead, you're not.

262
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,670
So there you go. All right.
So that's just the beginning.

263
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:43,310
People of my Texas trip,
my tech,

264
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:47,810
my trip to the great state of fucking
Texas. Um, all right, let me, uh,

265
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,120
it's not one of these things out here.

266
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:53,900
People will advertise and for the
weak dollar shave club, everybody,

267
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,650
there's so many things in the
world that irritate me. Um,

268
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,960
reigning in hell in El Paso, Texas
that causes the shows to get canceled.

269
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,410
This guy walking around telling
everybody wherever the hell he lives,

270
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,570
then I'm a piece of shit and
that I don't care about El Paso.

271
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:13,070
I care about a party.
Um,

272
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,850
when you fly out of a smaller city,
so they stick you on a smaller plane.

273
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,290
So instead of taking 50 minutes and now
it takes the same fucking three hours,

274
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,760
so you might as well just flown out
of Dallas. That also irritates me. Um,

275
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:29,150
when so many things can irritate you,
why add razors to the list?

276
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,120
It's time to stop milking
your razor blades. Everybody.

277
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,160
I know with brand name razors,

278
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,730
you're used to paying outrageous prices
and exhausting those razors until they

279
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:41,390
start to look like rusty soda
cans. Um, it's time to move on.

280
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,530
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing
quality blades to your door for just a few

281
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:49,730
bucks a month. Never think about it
again. They send a pack every, oops,

282
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,300
they sent a pack every month for the
love of God. Can we fix this copy?

283
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,030
I trip up over that every damn week.

284
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,080
They send a pack every month so you
can change your blades every week.

285
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:02,660
So it's a four pack.
Giving a new blade every week.

286
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,420
I love these guys and you flight
your face will love them too.

287
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,010
I don't love their copy though.

288
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,880
They've also got a new pop up new
product called one wipe Charlies people.

289
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,890
You have to watch this video.
It's hilarious.

290
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,890
It's a buttwipe for men and it's classy.

291
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,300
Check out the video for that and
sign up for your razors today.

292
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,830
It's basically the poor man's per
day. What it is is it's a, it's a,

293
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:28,190
it's a baby wipe one wipe Charlie baby.

294

Charlie got a dollar to dollar shave
club.com forward slash bur bur.

Catch up on current shows, binge on
old favorites or catch a great movie.

309
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,940
You can do it all on Hulu plus right now.

310
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:30,180
You could try Hulu plus for
a couple of weeks free on me.

311
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,050
When you go to the podcast

an extended free trial. And so that,

314
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:49,110
so they know that we sent you. All right.
That's it. Hulu plus.com/bill. Okay.

315
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,060
All right,
let's continue on.

316
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:56,061
So unfortunately for the second
time the El Paso Gig did not happen.

317
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,080
Um,
I don't know why.

318
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,290
I have no idea why it didn't seem
like it was raining that bad.

319
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,030
I definitely saw a lot of
emergency vehicles. There
was definitely a lot of, uh,

320
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,300
you know,
flashing official lights.

321
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:16,860
I know I had to make like three d toward
turns because the road's kept getting

322
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:20,400
blocked off. But, uh, I don't know.

323
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,550
I'm determined to make this show happen.

324
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,680
Maybe the third time
will be a fucking chair.

325
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,070
Um, all right. So anyways,

326
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,820
so me and [inaudible] go
out and we watched the, uh,

327
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:40,821
the Patriots jets game and he's cracking
up because I have the entire patriots'

328
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,260
offense and defense and jets offense
and defense written down on two cheat

329
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:47,760
sheets,
flipping them over and that type of stuff.

330
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:51,120
So I know what the hell is going on
because I'm obsessed with watching the

331
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,360
offensive line this year,
you know,

332
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,810
and I'm also enjoying watching Brady
playing with the level of talent that he

333
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:05,140
has at the wide receiver
position and watching him, uh,

334
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,820
getting frustrated and trying to
get those guys on the same page.

335
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,000
And I already saw a huge
improvement between, uh,

336
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,010
the first week and the second week,
especially from a, that Tompkins kid.

337
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,750
The first week he had a brutal week,
I think maybe you have one cat,

338
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:24,420
she bumped into another receiver on like
a pig play down by the end zone. And uh,

339
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,870
I know I thought he was a 100%
better and I know it was a sloppy,

340
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:35,190
ugly game, but I liked to, shit,
I like watching a team rebuilt.

341
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,730
Like I said, it's a very, it's
very healthy for the fan base.

342
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:43,140
It's kind of like a forest fire where it's
necessary. It's kind of a horror show.

343
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,770
You don't want to see it, but
it's necessary, you know, and uh,

344
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,310
when a team has to rebuild,
what it does is, uh, it Kinda,

345
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,970
it burns off a lot of the bandwagon. Um,
I actually got into with a buddy of mine,

346
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,970
he was sitting at saying that
Bellacheck is overrated. And, uh,

347
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:02,740
what has he done since 2004 when
last time we won? It's like, I dunno,

348
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,390
went to two more Superbowls.

349
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,910
Okay.

350
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,030
Four grand total of seven
Superbowls that he's, he's been to,

351
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,210
is that right? Three. Five, seven.
Yeah. And he's won five out of seven.

352
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,700
You know what I mean? Hey, find
out what the fuck you problem is.

353
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:24,270
And we went through a soup bowl two years
ago. That's like some New York, Philly,

354
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,390
Boston shit where it's like,

355
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,420
they get this so fucking,
I don't know what,

356
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,910
so quick to pull the trigger and be like,
fuck this. I'm Outta here. You know?

357
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:39,900
I mean, a lot of shit happened.
We lost Welker to free agency.

358
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:42,690
We didn't want to pay him, but we've
always done that. That's been our model.

359
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,630
We let ty Lago,
lawyer Malloy all the way back.

360
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:49,170
We let all those guys go when we felt
they wanted too much money and that it was

361
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:52,860
going to affect, uh, the overall
level of what we wanted to do.

362
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,610
Bella check is always, you know,
traded his way out of the first round.

363
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:59,580
He's running to get a second round guy.
We could have had Dez Bryant. He goes,

364
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:01,410
I don't want to get that fucking guy.
You know,

365
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,860
he doesn't like that flash type shit.
He just doesn't,

366
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,250
and it's when you want too much money,
let you go.

367
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,710
He's been doing that
forever and it's worked.

368
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,670
So I'm not questioning the guy and uh,

369
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,720
I'm going to enjoy watching
them try and, uh, you know,

370
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,960
win some games this year and the
very what looks to be very weak,

371
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,500
AFC east.
Um,

372
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,360
I'm going to say some really obvious
shit this week about football. Uh,

373
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:34,960
I watched the Broncos giants
yesterday tape that game.

374
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,520
And a Broncos are obviously
the team to beat. Um,

375
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,240
I didn't know they had
holiday to being an Lsu fan.

376
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,060
I was trying to keep an eye on
him when he went to the Texans.

377
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,730
He just was so exciting to
watch when he played for Lsu.

378
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,370
I didn't get to see him too much.
Um,

379
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,250
I know he took back a word kickoff
and upon a playoff game last year,

380
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,920
but now the Broncos have,
and we took one back.

381
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,840
So now that special teams are a threat,

382
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,320
they got a great defense or offensive line
is ridiculous. They got that dude, uh,

383
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,160
the hell's his name there. Uh, no,

384
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:10,330
Sean Moreno and Peyton looks
better than he ever did.

385
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:14,290
So obviously that's the team to beat.
Uh,

386
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,830
okay.

387
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,770
You know, the usual powerhouse
teams, the Patriot Steelers in them,

388
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:20,690
they're not looking too good.
Somebody for the love of God.

389
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,740
Figure out the fucking San Diego
chargers for me, Jesus Christ,

390
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,370
those fucking guys,
what they're doing to their fan base.

391
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,820
If I hadn't been down to a game
and had such an awful time,

392
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,000
I would actually feel bad.
I actually still do.

393
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,850
I feel bad for most of the people because
I'm sure most of the people were cool.

394
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:40,760
It's just a cut sitting behind me.
Um,

395
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,570
okay.

396
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,400
But anyways, but I gotta tell
you, even after the Broncos

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,030
handle their business with the,
uh, the giants, I have to tell you,

398
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:53,010
watch and Seattle on the 40 niners was,
it was what,

399
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,030
it was a whole other level
of a professional football.

400
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,030
And,
um,

401
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,940
and even though Seattle really manhandled,
not manhandled,

402
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,950
but really handled the 40 niners,
um,

403
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,590
I've just watched enough football
to realize it's only September.

404
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:13,130
And that doesn't mean shit. It's
definitely a good thing you won the game.

405
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,900
But that by no means basically says,
well, you'll definitely beat them again,

406
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,640
and then you'll beat them
again if you have to win.

407
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,590
If you've got to play in January, it's
probably going to go back and forth. But,

408
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:27,020
uh, I guess, Hey, that
dude, Richard Sherman,

409
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:31,880
not only is a fucking phenomenal player,
but he, that guy's fucking hilarious. Um,

410
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,050
somehow I missed last year when he
would yelled at Brady. I miss that.

411
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,440
You know what it is? I don't watch
pregame and postgame analysis.

412
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:44,441
I just can't sit there and watch about
people talking about people getting it

413
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:48,200
done and not getting it done and what
people have to do that day. It's like,

414
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,910
I dunno, I, that shit drives me well,
you know, you know what I really like.

415
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:57,110
I like when they cut to that guy who knows
the rules and can break down what the

416
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:58,970
fuck just happened.
I liked that stuff.

417
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,240
And I like listening to the
former players tell stories,

418
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:06,620
but like analysis of what just
happened or what's going on.

419
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,780
So I usually just shut the thing off.

420
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,450
MMM.

421
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,280
And so what our eyes,

422
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,240
I saw the Brady thing and then I
watched that thing where he came at skip

423
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:19,140
Bayless. We see set, I'm
better at you in life.

424
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,870
It said I'm the top whatever in my field
and I would not put you in that level

425
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:32,980
and broadcasting.
And I just thought it was hilarious

426
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,600
and um,

427
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,530
I dunno, I thought he could
have hit him even harder.

428
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,750
You know what he should have said if
some point Richard Sherman should've said

429
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,080
to skip Bayless when skip
was disagreeing with the,

430
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,970
with, with, you know, Sherman,
that he was one of the,

431
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,700
I guess top guys in the League,
whatever the hell the argument was,

432
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:58,690
what he should've said to him was he
should have said, yeah, what do I know?

433
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,160
What do I know? I just play for a
real professional football team.

434
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,030
I don't play in a fantasy football team.
I just do this for a living.

435
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,830
I play football for a living. You
Watch it? Yeah. Why? Why would I know?

436
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,870
Why would I know better than you
please you, you sit there with the,

437
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:20,050
a brand new knees and shoulders that
have never been fucked up in your brain

438
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:23,390
that's never been concussed cause you
never played a context sport you bad bit

439
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:28,270
and play in Jackass with your fucking game
show host hair. Why don't you tell me?

440
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,860
Why don't you tell me who the best
fucking quarterbacks are in the league?

441
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:35,350
I if he, if he went that way. Oh,
I already loved what he did. So,

442
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,313
mmm.

443
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,950
I'm looking forward to
that. A, he was funny,

444
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,230
he went up be pat his old coach on the
ass after he beat him. I think that's,

445
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,700
I think that's really,
especially

446
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,100
if it gets the job done,
but if you are gonna run your mouth,

447
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:50,250
you better hang out on the field if
they loose. Which, but like I said,

448
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:53,610
I don't know much about him,
but a Seattle looks fucking,

449
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,380
they look amazing and uh,
I,

450
00:26:57,381 --> 00:27:00,970
I was laughing my ass off when I
saw Pete Carroll doin though. Woo.

451
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,100
He's got more of an edge to him now.

452
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,110
He used to just look like he was Robert
Young on father knows best to bring out

453
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:14,820
a fucking reference from 60 years ago.
He used to look wholesome.

454
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:18,660
I don't know what happened to him at USC.
I know some dirt went down,

455
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,210
you know. And uh, do you
guys see the cover of this?
Why don't Fall Pete Carroll?

456
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:26,580
Did you guys see the cover of
our sports illustrated this week?

457
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:31,530
Talking about all this stuff that happened
at Osu and all the filth and the sex

458
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:36,180
and the scandals and the boosters
and all that type of shit. Um,

459
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,020
I think at this point sports illustrated
has done a cover story about probably

460
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,860
half the football programs.

461
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,830
They write that article every
fucking year and a half,

462
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:51,390
two years about some sort of scandal
about either football, basketball,

463
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:55,500
whatever sport that's going on.
And they act like it's shocking.

464
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,310
Um, here's the deal. Okay.

465
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:04,000
If it wasn't for these football
and basketball programs
and the money that they

466
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:08,650
generate, most people's fucking
campuses would look like El Paso,

467
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:13,300
Texas, a fucker with the El
Paso. But you know what I mean?

468
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,410
They'd look like
there would be nothing there.

469
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,360
The sports programs build
all the dormitories,

470
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,700
the eye and that article,

471
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:30,701
I read the pack 12 sine of $3 billion
TV contract and these kids are going out

472
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:35,270
there,
you know,

473
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:41,670
doing lifetime damage to their bodies
for no fucking money for no money.

474
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,380
Um, I know a lot of people
go, well you mean no money.

475
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,500
You give free education to joke the foot.

476
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:53,590
Say they had time to fucking go to school.
Okay,

477
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,140
let's just say they had time to do,

478
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,950
let's just say that the schools also
only drafted people who could actually,

479
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,140
you know,
uh,

480
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,300
only sign people could actually
handle the school work load.

481
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,773
You know what I mean?

482
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,260
They didn't get somebody
who flunked everything in
fucking high school and found

483
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:14,290
a fucking loophole and then stuck
them in the basket weaving class.

484
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:17,590
Let's say they actually fucking tried
to educate them. You don't have time

485
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,500
with that. I Dunno. I don't think you do.
Anyways, I'm going to skip Bayless. He,

486
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,880
I never fucking play. And then
secondly, if you get hurt,

487
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:27,700
they'd take away your fucking scholarships
and then not trying to educate you.

488
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,100
And even if they do fucking educate you,

489
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,170
the amount of fucking money generated
versus what it costs to stick you in a

490
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:39,910
fucking dorm is a joke.
It's a fucking joke. So

491
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,040
I don't

492
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,050
know what the solution is.
I Dunno if you pay him,

493
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,120
but I understand why those boosters come
around and give the money. I get it.

494
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,030
It's fucking ridiculous.
Look,

495
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:57,031
if I go to some fucking strip mall and I
give a great show and I sell a bunch of

496
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,550
tickets,
like I get compensated,

497
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,733
you know what I mean?

498
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,270
I, I don't, and these guys play
in front of an entire stadium,

499
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,290
entire fucking stadium sold out nationally
televised fucking games and they

500
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:20,210
don't get any, they get like a
$15 like stipend, $15. I mean,

501
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:23,300
I guess you could feed you and two other
teammates if you went to Mcdonald's.

502
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,430
I don't know what, but anyways, I'm just
saying it's a filthy fucking business.

503
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,060
So,
uh,

504
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,530
I don't need sports illustrated to expose
what you already know what's going on.

505
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,700
I mean, Jesus Christ, it's the same
story they've been doing forever.

506
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,080
And then they get some hot girls there
and they fucking bang the recruits so

507
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:46,460
they feel like, wow, I'm going to be a
rock star here. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

508
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,790
They're doing what they're
supposed to be doing,

509
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:57,260
that trying to make money and that's how
the game's played. All right. So anyways,

510
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,153
uh,

511
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,660
so the El Paso Gig gets rained out and uh,

512
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,350
I was anticipating way more emails
like that. So, uh, people of El Paso,

513
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:08,570
you're very understanding and
the person who's pissed at me,

514
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:12,800
I get why you mad at me. Uh,
but I, I can't handle it at the,

515
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,570
the weather or the typography is not,
is beyond my control.

516
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:23,060
All right? So I'm going to
reschedule it and uh, you know,

517
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,740
if you don't show up,
I understand why.

518
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,020
Okay.

519
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,280
I, you know, go fuck yourself at fucking
rain and they cancel it. I did, you know,

520
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,830
Geez, I'm done apologizing. All right. Um,

521
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:37,780
so next day we wake up in the morning
and a, we're going to go drive to,

522
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:40,690
uh, from El Paso, San Antonio, Texas.

523
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:45,350
And everybody is telling us that, you
know, like they said that there's,

524
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,990
you know,
there's nothing out there.

525
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:49,030
It's going to be like driving
and they'd like laughing at me.

526
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,340
Then I'm going to do it cause
it's like a seven hour drive,

527
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,050
eight hour drive or whatever.

528
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,240
And I got to tell you was one of most
beautiful drives I've ever gone on in my

529
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:00,340
life verse.
He's freaking out.

530
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:05,370
Like he was worried that between El Paso
and San Antonio Somehow we were going

531
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:09,640
to get abducted driving the
speed limit 80 miles an hour.

532
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:14,290
So I'm doing like 87 88 and got the
cruise control set. We're fucking flying.

533
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,770
I don't know what he thinks somebody
is going to jump off, you know,

534
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,930
down a highway.

535
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,490
I don't know what he thought was going
to happen and if you saw what was on

536
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:26,350
either side of us,
anybody who comes

537
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,780
at us is going to be like
hallucinating from lack of of water.

538
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,400
It looked like a spaghetti western out
there. It was absolutely fucking gorgeous.

539
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,860
You ride a motorcycle,
that would be a great one to go.

540
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:43,940
I would definitely wait till it
wasn't so fucking hot out. Um,

541
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,490
I'm telling you Plat, we saw
a fucking, everything we saw,

542
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,500
we saw vultures on the side of the road.
The real ones.

543
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:53,981
The ones,

544
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:58,600
what the hell boy heads that
fucking all red head and,

545
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,660
and the fucking those black feathers
just picking apart this carcass was

546
00:33:04,271 --> 00:33:08,170
fucking, I was unbelievable.
Absolutely gorgeous.

547
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,670
It made you want to ride a horse. It was
one of the great drives I've ever had.

548
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,390
Um,
so underrated El Paso,

549
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:20,110
Texas and then driving to San Antonio,
Texas.

550
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:22,690
It was a fucking great time.
Um,

551
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,120
and people saying that there's,

552
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:29,020
I guess nothing out there to see
basically means you can't go to a subway

553
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:32,440
sandwich. There's no
mall, there's no outlet.

554
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,750
There's no movie theater. That classic
shit. Well, when I go out there,

555
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:40,120
I can't see what I can already see here.

556
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,120
Therefore they got nothing
out there for me to say.

557
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,960
I shouldn't have done that in a southern
accent because they appreciate the

558
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:51,550
outdoors. Those southerners, hell half
of them live in the outdoors, don't they?

559
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,000
It is a stereotype. Sorry. Um,

560
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,370
okay.

561
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,950
Silversea it now [inaudible] is
enjoying ease and joy and Nah,

562
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,650
he's starting to enjoy Texas about,
look at this Paul.

563
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Every fucking twist and turn
every going up and down the hill.

564
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:08,410
Look at this valley. Look at that.
Look at that plateau, look at that.

565
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,070
I don't look at those rocks. Legit
shit. We're not going to see. Um,

566
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,550
yeah.

567
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,510
And meanwhile our buddy
who's going to the game,

568
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,440
he'd already arrived in San Antonio and
he thought we were driving. So he's like,

569
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,780
dude, I'm already at the
hotel bar. Where are you guys?

570
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,020
So rather than text and back,
we made them this fucking, uh,

571
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,800
this video that we actually, we did
with two. We did it with two i-phones.

572
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:38,190
We use the music on my iPhone.
I ran it through the radio and then verse,

573
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:42,330
he filmed it and we did it. And uh, I
think it was two texts. The first take,

574
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,320
the music was too loud.

575
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:47,800
And then the second take is the
one that we actually used. And uh,

576
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,720
he fucking laughed his balls off.
It's basic.

577
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:54,210
It's a video from us to our buddy who's
sitting in San Antonio letting them know

578
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:58,080
that we're driving and we're on our way.
So definitely check that out.

579
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:02,970
That'll be up on the, um, the
podcast page. Bill [inaudible]
dot com check it out.

580
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,260
Now. What am I saying?
It's going to be up.

581
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:08,670
It'll be up by the time are listening
to this, hopefully. Um, so anyways,

582
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,180
we're driving and as far
as finding places to stop,

583
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:15,480
it's definitely slim
pickings. So we ended up, uh,

584
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,860
we stopped at
this Mcdonald's.

585
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,530
We had to get gas and we just
stopped at a fucking Mcdonald's.

586
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:25,140
There was nothing else out to any
port in a storm. So we go in there,

587
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,670
we walk in and Mcdonald's is something
you do, I love about Mcdonald's. You know,

588
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,980
you shouldn't be nay.
So you always avoid it.

589
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,470
But when you finally give in
that you're going to eat it,

590
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:37,590
this is certain level of excitement
or you just like, fuck it.

591
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,930
If I'm going to eat it, I'm strong
with down. So I went in there,

592
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,170
I had been in there and I can't remember
the last time, and they got something,

593
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,690
they got a triple cheeseburger
and it's like, absolutely,

594
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,710
I'll take one of those fuckers as perfect.
I'll take one of those,

595
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:53,040
give me a large fry and a,
then I got a water.

596
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,110
That was my way of trying
to be halfway healthy.

597
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,800
Forsee orders like a fucking smoothie.
I love it.

598
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,960
It Mcdonald's go to is a fucking smoothie,
right?

599
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,800
It's probably ground up like squirrel
tail with some, I don't even know.

600
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:08,280
I don't know what, um, so he orders that.

601
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:11,760
So we're standing in line
and we're waiting to get
our food and all of a sudden

602
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:16,240
Versie just creeps up on me,
gets right in my ear,

603
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:19,990
and he just goes, dude, don't turn around.

604
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,850
I don't look.

605
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,930
But there is a guy right behind me sitting
down in a red shirt with the mustache

606
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
who is trying to fucking stare me down.
He just,

607
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,930
no joke,
dude.

608
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,920
He just gave me one of the most hardcore
fucking stare down it looks I've ever

609
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:42,580
seen in my life. All right, so now
he's got me fucking nervous. I'm like,

610
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:43,690
what the fuck's he talking about?

611
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:48,670
So I kind of do the pretending to stretch
and I glance over and I look over at

612
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:53,290
the guy and he has like some
sort of brain damage. Okay.

613
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,920
He's sitting there, you know
that full metal jacket. Look you,

614
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,000
your head's kind of down.

615
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:02,660
So you're looking through the horizon
of your eyebrows with your mouth hanging

616
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:06,410
open. That's what he's doing.
There's barely any brain activity.

617
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:11,220
I don't know if he had some sort
of, uh, a head trauma or whatever,

618
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:16,221
and then I kind of scan around them and
there's like seven other adults with the

619
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:20,010
same look on their face.
And then I look in this two reasonable,

620
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,350
not reasonable to regular
looking at adults.

621
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,770
Whatever adjective I use is
going to be offensive. Um,

622
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,600
two adults with all their faculties,

623
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:30,660
obviously they brought these people
here in a van to fucking Mcdonald's.

624
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:34,560
And I look at Paul, Mike
Duke, the guy's fucking idiot.

625
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,470
It's got special needs.
You should've seen the guy though.

626
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:41,210
He looked like fucking a,
you know,

627
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:44,030
Jack Nicholson in one flew over the
cuckoo's nest. When he fakes it,

628
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:48,070
he got the lobotomy. That's what
the fuck this guy look like. And

629
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,701
so finally verse,

630
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:54,140
he just starts laughing and he
realizes that he's being an idiot.

631
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,330
And now he's so into Texas.

632
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,840
We're driving for the rest
of said to San Antonio,

633
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:01,910
he's looking for a place
to buy a cowboy hat.

634
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,170
And a couple of cap guns cause he wants
to make another fucking youtube video of

635
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:10,160
him standing on the side of the road
of this, of this highway on a rock,

636
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,340
you know,
doing some shit about how he loves Texas.

637
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,870
And this is the same fucking guy who
like two hours earlier wanted to have a

638
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:22,490
tire under one under the seat and some
sort of fucking pistol to shoot whoever

639
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:26,630
the fuck was going to kidnap
us. So I don't know, long
story short then we've got,

640
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:31,310
we have got to San Antonio, we did the,
we did that Gig. Had a great time. And uh,

641
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,920
I think I'm going to run out of time here
because I've got to read your letters.

642
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,630
We ended up going to
the, uh, the next day we,

643
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,030
we go to the ag you game and
we were coming up from Houston.

644
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:43,960
We drove over to Houston. So we basically
drove across the state of Texas, uh,

645
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,470
on the 10 from El Paso all the
way to Houston and then a Houston.

646
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,480
We fucking drove to a Walmart to
meet this booze bus to drive us up.

647
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,690
Now they had to booze buses and
eight in the morning and one at 1130.

648
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:58,420
Everybody jumped on the eight
in the morning cause they
wanted to get fucked up.

649
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,600
We showed at the 1131,
it was like us,

650
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,870
this older couple and then a
group of four people in the back,

651
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:06,190
the whole bus to ourselves.

652
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,240
And they are Alabama fans and they were
all cool as hell. And it was awesome man.

653
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:15,190
They had all these beers and then they
had like this, uh, you know, some brisket,

654
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,170
beans and all this shit
that they made for you.

655
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:20,880
It was fucking great with Chow and
the food was slamming beers. Um,

656
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,560
we've got the cigars, we got the
tickets were ready to go drive up there.

657
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,270
There's no fucking traffic because
everybody's already there partying and we

658
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:33,820
pull into college station,
we see the stadium,

659
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,110
we see everybody up there with
the fucking, uh, Aggie colors on.

660
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,270
I never noticed how much,
how much rent,

661
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,250
a brighter red Alabama's
colors are then the ag is.

662
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:47,560
And until you saw the two fans, you
know, Stan it together and was just,

663
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:52,060
it was fucking awesome. We had a
great time going into the game,

664
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,771
right as we got,

665
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:57,790
and we got an adjust right up to the
flyover and Manzell was starting to drive

666
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:58,611
down the field and do it.

667
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:00,880
I gotta tell you when they scored
those first two touchdowns,

668
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,270
the stadium was going fucking crazy.

669
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,000
Aggies go up 14 to nothing.

670
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,510
Okay.

671
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,090
And uh, you know, cause we were
thinking Alabama was going to win.

672
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,280
I didn't think they were going
to cover it, but I was like,

673
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,620
I think they're going to win.
And uh,

674
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,210
he goes up 14 and nothing and they was
shutting them down on defense and then I

675
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:24,070
don't, it was one of the loudest
stadiums. I fucking bed and,

676
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,070
and then all of a sudden,
oh by the way,

677
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:32,030
that whole fucking thing with the Seahawks
fans trying to set the record to be

678
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:36,380
the loudest crowd is one of the gay
is things I think I've ever seen in my

679
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:40,640
fucking life. You know, what
are you guys doing? You know,

680
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,170
you know what that shit,
somebody tweeted me that and I said,

681
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,500
well you know when you've never won a
championship you got to hang your hat on

682
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:49,334
something.

683
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,870
What is the purpose of that Seattle
fans and you might win one this year,

684
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,630
but as of right now, what, what are you
guys doing? What is, what is the, the the,

685
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:03,050
do you guys have a team song?
If it is, I, I, if I, if it is,

686
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:05,060
I have to guess it's going to,
it's basically this,

687
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:10,061
we are the loudest by friends,

688
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,843
eh?

689
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,113
Okay.

690
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,500
Till we lose Doo Doo,
Doo Doo.

691
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,870
Who we are the loud it is.

692
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,370
Oh louder.
Loud.

693
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,680
Cause the architect designed the
building to make a sound louder.

694
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,440
You're a bunch of cheaters up there.

695
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,730
You're not louder than anybody else,
you know louder than those Aggie Fan.

696
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,520
They had some rooftop orchestra
fucking pit to keep it all

697
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,010
contained. Bade sound loud
to this is the thing people,

698
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,300
I went to a game there, I heard I'll
fucking unbelievably loud it was,

699
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,690
but I looked at the fans and
you weren't yelling any louder.

700
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,630
There was no guy like,
like fucking punching himself.

701
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,620
Like how you could yell louder
than any other human beings.

702
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:16,180
You're, you're, we're basically created,

703
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:20,470
we call came out of the same fucking mud
puddle. You can't yell louder, you know,

704
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:24,610
more passionate or nothing. You just
got that little rooftop thing there.

705
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,860
Hold it in.
You know why?

706
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,090
Because for all these years you've
needed that extra help. All right?

707
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,130
But enough, just when a fucking
championship, when a Goddamn Chan,

708
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:39,790
which might happen this year,
I hope it does because when it does,

709
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,650
you won't waste your time on stupid
pointless things like trying to be the

710
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:48,220
loudest, you think you're louder
than Kansas City chief fence.

711
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,900
Those fans allowed. Okay. And
they've had nothing to chairs about.

712
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:54,310
Tear of off for fucking years.
So anyways, so we go in there,

713
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:56,650
the fucking Aggie game.
It was ridiculously loud.

714
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,460
All natural to no ped snow
architect trying to help him out.

715
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:02,440
Just fucking completely natural Christ.

716
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,140
They didn't even have half a fucking
third. A third of the stadium was missing,

717
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,010
you know, one of the end zones, they
just had these little bleachers.

718
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,690
You could see the dorm rooms, the
traffic going by, you look far enough,

719
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:17,770
he could probably see a cow taken
a shit out in the field. Um,

720
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,720
so anyways, they go up 14 to nothing.
And then here comes fucking Bama.

721
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:28,420
14, seven, 14, 1421,

722
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:30,820
14, Alabama, 28,

723
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:33,820
14 Alabama than halftime.

724
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,240
And I gotta tell you they took the fucking
air out of that stadium. All right.

725
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,580
Fucking Aggies. Did they get the ball
back? I think Alabama had at first,

726
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,550
I don't remember. I was
pretty hammered. Uh,

727
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:48,040
but all I know is that they
stopped them or whatever,

728
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:53,041
but then the Aggie start fucking drive
and then they throw a fucking pick and

729
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,340
the guy takes it back. 35, 14,

730
00:43:57,341 --> 00:44:01,150
five unanswered touchdowns. And, uh,

731
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,220
one of my buddies that I'm,

732
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:08,020
I'm with WHO's in the pro
semipro football hall of fame.

733
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,430
All right. Which is a fucking
accomplishment, more than
skip Bayless of it. Did.

734
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,310
Why am I attacking skip? I just think
it's funny to make fun of that guy.

735
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,610
I don't give a shit about him either
way. Um, he was just talking about, uh,

736
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,740
Alabama's offensive line that just
saying like the blown them off the ball.

737
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:26,710
I don't give a fuck who you, what weapons
you have. If you went in that war,

738
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:29,590
you're going to win the fucking game.
And he was saying how uh,

739
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,080
what's his face was going to run
the score because they uh, they uh,

740
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,310
they lost last year or they beat,
they got beat last year. And uh,

741
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,240
so I'm sitting there, I, I can't believe
once again, I get unbelievably depressed.

742
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,450
I just want to see Alabama fucking
loses is the second year in the role.

743
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:50,770
But then all of a sudden here
come the Aggies, 35, 21. Okay.

744
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:55,150
The kind of back in it and then it
was dead. Fucking Alabama scores. 42,

745
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,620
21, people start thinking it's over.
But then the Aggie score again, 42,

746
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:00,580
28.

747
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,150
Then they finally got that number four
in Alabama to fucking do something wrong

748
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:06,880
all day. He fumbles the
ball, they get the ball,

749
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:09,610
they throw it to that number 13
kid. Fuck, I should know his name.

750
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:14,290
The guy had like 290 something
yards receiving at Goddammit,

751
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,160
I'm the worst.

752
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,120
I really should know his name and I
should say at the name of every fucking

753
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:22,150
offensive lineman on Alabama,
they were fucking unreal. Anyways,

754
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:26,650
they're on like their own
six or five yard line. He,

755
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,920
Johnny football throws
the thing like 50 yards,

756
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,050
13 catches it's stiff arms
to dude covering them and
runs the rest of the way of

757
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:36,250
fucking like 96 yard touchdown.

758
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,350
And now all of a sudden it's 42 35.
It's like,

759
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:45,790
what the fuck?
Here come the Goddamn Aggies.

760
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,670
And then right when you think
they're going to tie it up,

761
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:48,840
just Mike going overtime.

762
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Fucking Alabama scores 49 49 35 and then
fucking Aggies come back 49 42 and then

763
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:59,850
that was it. And it was fucking
over that. Why me? Tell me,

764
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:04,650
what is that seven 76 13 touchdowns,
13 touchdowns.

765
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,270
The Aggies had over 600 yards in
offense and still lost the game.

766
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,940
Um, I dunno, it was an, it was an
unbelievable, unbelievable game.

767
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,870
Um, [inaudible] self at some point
you got to go to college station,

768
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,490
go take taken an Aggie game.

769
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,420
We didn't have time to hang out the Dixie
chicken and all those places that look

770
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:28,650
cool as hell. Um, cause we had to
catch the fucking bus going back.

771
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:33,030
And uh, all right, as great
as the bus was going back,

772
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,550
it was an absolute shit show. I mean,
coming up, it was great going back,

773
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:41,550
it was an absolute fucking shit show.
First of all, we get back to the thing,

774
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,110
you know where we're supposed to meet
and everybody's breaking open brews.

775
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:47,820
And at this point I'm done with drinking,
you know,

776
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,170
cause I'm gonna fucking fall asleep
and I want to watch this fight and I'm

777
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:53,490
sitting there and then this,
this,

778
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,380
this lady comes up to me and she
starts talking to my buddy and he said

779
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:02,430
something really nice about is she asked
him a question and he said something

780
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:07,060
really nice about his wife like
ours or she just said, hey,

781
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:10,610
what do you think about all these ag
girls out here? And he goes, ah, you know,

782
00:47:10,611 --> 00:47:13,280
I'm married, I love my wife, I don't
really look above blah, blah, blah.

783
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,850
And then she goes, good
answer. Like all of a sudden,

784
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:21,290
like he has to fucking get her fucking
approval and immediately I'm just like,

785
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,124
can't

786
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,523
cunt.

787
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,310
You know when you're going to whisper
it. Right? What a Dick. Good answer.

788
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:31,650
Okay,

789
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,910
so you give me another thing
too was nobody's talking to you.

790
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:37,210
Just come fucking walking up, right? So
she says to me, what are you doing here?

791
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:39,820
I said, Oh, you know, I've just hanging
out with my friends who had came out.

792
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,040
She goes, I was, is she? She
goes, is this your little,

793
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,730
is this your little guy's weekend out?
Right?

794
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,800
And I'm just like looking at, and I
just looked, I was like, no, no, no,

795
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,634
it isn't.

796
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,983
Okay,

797
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,010
Doug, who are you? Get the
fuck Outta here. You know?

798
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,680
Then she went over and she started
throwing a football and she could throw a

799
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:01,470
football. So that I think that I
shouldn't have whispered, can just cut.

800
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,480
She's not a right. She could
throw a football. This,

801
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,370
there's gotta be something that's all
right with her. Right. So anyways,

802
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,990
so this guy on the way up on the bus,

803
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,850
like 30 year old guy from Alabama was
a cool guy, funny guy and all that.

804
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:23,120
Now he's completely loaded and is one of
the biggest jerk offs you're ever gonna

805
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:27,110
meet and your fucking
life in Amelie's like

806
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,960
you hang here college day, should you,
hey here you go. Hey come on you are. Hey

807
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:35,840
cause it was two buses, the early one
in the next one left for another four us

808
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:41,970
the chain here called station.
We you are hanging here in college station

809
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,900
and I'm like no I'm on the early bus
and all I'm thinking is thank God this

810
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:50,340
fucking jackass is not on the early bus
cause I don't know what happened to him

811
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:54,600
cause he was a great guy and the way up
shut the shit with them almost for like

812
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:55,800
the whole fucking write up.

813
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,650
We were all taught his group and our
group was totally cool but I don't know

814
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:01,680
this fucking guy,
one of those guys add alcohol.

815
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:03,360
He becomes a completely different person.

816
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,120
So now we got to go meet
this booze bus back.

817
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:08,250
There's a bunch of people I
know it's going to be packed.

818
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,810
And who comes walking up this
fucking Shit Bird, right?

819
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,980
Well, you know, no one else is.
Dang it has the word taking the bus.

820
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,290
We get on the bus,
I sit down verse,

821
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:25,810
he sits next to me in this fucking jerk
off and his buddy, his buddy was cool.

822
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,100
They sit right across from us cause sort
of diagonal. So immediately what I do,

823
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,440
because it's pitch black out,
it's Sun's gone down.

824
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,860
I just closed my eyes and I act
like I'm sleeping. Cause I'm like,

825
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,270
I'm not making contact with
that fucking shit show. Right?

826
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,950
And are the buddy sitting right in
front of us and uh, this fucking guy,

827
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,910
I'm telling you,
the whole ride back would not shut up.

828
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,590
And he's just yelling,

829
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,120
hey, hey, 12th man, I ain't he shear.

830

You guys were quiet as hell.
I, no couple of touchdowns.

831
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,530
Then he just starts
saying I'd suck a Dick.

832
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:01,840
Okay.

833
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,860

834
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,460
Say I suck a Dick.

835
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,830
I would suck a Dick Right

836
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,430
And he would name somebody famous.
Who's playing that king?

837
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,520
Would you fuck Kathy
Bates if you could fuck.

but it wasn't.

841
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:37,370
It was like old people. A couple rows
up and at one point this girl got up,

842
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:41,420
this lady gets up to go to
the bathroom and he does this.
Whoa, Whoa, hey, you know,

843
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,790
like this. And all of a sudden I
felt like I was like in the accused,

844
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:48,791
like he was making her uncomfortable
in like a fucking sexual way.

845
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,010
It was really fucking bad.
So,

846
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,360
okay.

847
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,130
I Dunno, I don't, I don't even
fucking remember. Then file infers.

848
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,250
He keeps going like I'm going to
say something and we keep saying,

849
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,080
I just keep going. Forsee the guy
is a jerk off. Okay, you got a wife,

850
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:08,370
you've got kids, you got a
house. Okay. When a lose the
fight, you're going to lose.

851
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,120
All right? Just this in our life
for another fucking half hour,

852
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,340
just ignore him and [inaudible]. I
Dunno why, I dunno. Started gate verse.

853
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,760
He finally just said to the guy,

854
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,470
cause he kept butting into
our conversations and I
would just go, hey listen,

855
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:25,590
I'm talking to my friend, you know, I
don't want to talk to you or whatever.

856
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,470
And then he just goes, hey, you know,

857
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,020
Bass Bass versus bursary basic
just told them to shut up.

858
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:35,040
Said you being a drunk asshole. Nobody
wants to talk to you. All right,

859
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,240
just shut the fuck up.

860
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,770
And all I'm thinking is I have my sneakers
off and I five to fucking pull these

861
00:51:40,771 --> 00:51:43,620
guys apart.
I got to run in my socks on a bus

862
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,180
that, that verse, he couldn't
have handled. This guy's
guy was just a drunk idiot.

863
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:55,920
But anyways, uh, and then the
guy turns around and faces front,

864
00:51:55,921 --> 00:52:00,921
like he's been scolded and
he shut up and I'm like,

865
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:04,950
thank God. And we found out
afterwards, people around us were like,

866
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:08,220
thank God you said that Shit.
But then I don't know what happened.

867
00:52:08,221 --> 00:52:09,930
Then he just started back up again.

868
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:13,290
And one of my other friends
started talking to the guy
and then he started going

869
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:17,770
again, you know, I'd suck a dick. Hey,

870
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,860
would you fuck blah, blah, blah,
blah. He was a fucking moron.

871
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,690
Tell you what I need. I need a
loose horn, some Mexican food.

872
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,730
These are direct quotes

873
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,510
and I'm telling you there's these two,
all this cute old couple,

874
00:52:36,511 --> 00:52:39,150
like two seats in front of them.
It was,

875
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:44,040
it was an absolute fucking shit show,
and by the time we get off the bus,

876
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,630
it's like, I don't even want to, I
don't even want to go to the fight.

877
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,610
I'm so over people at this point. But
in, and of course we get back late.

878
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,090
We can't find where we, where we were
staying at the Sheraton or whatever.

879
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:00,480
We finally get back to the Sheridan.
We go up, don't even shower,

880
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,360
just put on some remotely
respectable fucking clothes.

881
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:07,560
And we run downstairs to catch the shuttle
where we're going to go see the fight

882
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:13,610
is like 11 miles away in the shuttle
will only go in a five mile radius.

883
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,370
So He'd go, fuck our, I call a cab,
call a cab. The guy calls a cab,

884
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:22,020
never calls comes, he calls another cab.
It never fucking comes. And at that point,

885
00:53:22,021 --> 00:53:26,100
I'm looking over at the bar, the
hotel bar, and they're serving food.

886
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,970
And I just say, it's four of us. I
say one of the guys that go, look,

887
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,070
I go, I'm done man. I'm just going to get
a case of d and go to bed. Just fuck it.

888
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,480
So version and the other dude, uh,
looking at like, what the fuck? Come on.

889
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:41,790
We gotta make this happen.
And then the other guy,

890
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,990
I just don't name names in the podcast,
the hall of famous friends. It's like,

891
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:47,010
yeah, dude, that's what I'm doing.

892
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:51,570
So we go saddle up to the bar
and it was fucking hilarious.

893
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:55,380
We're sitting at the bar now we're done.
Our Day's done,

894
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,880
which is going to get something to eat,

895
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:59,730
maybe get a drink and we're going to
go upstairs and go to fucking sleep.

896
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,760
But if we,
if we look to the right,

897
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:05,730
we see the TV with the highlights and the
score is, but if you look to the left,

898
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:09,060
we can see into the lobby and I
see [inaudible] and my other buddy,

899
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:14,210
and they are still in the anxiety
of trying to get to the fight.

900
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,520
So I say to the dude, I'm
sitting at the bar with, I go,

901
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:19,680
you know what's funny that over there,

902
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:22,590
and I was pointing Diversey in the
lobby is going to become way more

903
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:26,310
entertaining than this shit on the TV.
And about five minutes and sure enough,

904
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,300
four as he starts flipping out,
I swear to God,

905
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:35,390
he must've said Sheridan
like 58 fucking times.

906
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,770
He just kept calling like,
well, we're at a Sheridan.

907
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,610
How can you not get a cap? And it,
and it shed is a Sheridan. This is,

908
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,940
this is a shower.
I don't understand this.

909
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,840
How do you not get a Cabinet Sheridan?
Right.

910
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,650
And then he walks over to the bar and
he's leaning in between me and the other

911
00:54:55,651 --> 00:54:59,130
dude just go and ask. I
just don't understand where
we're at. A Sheraton right?

912
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,993
He's drunk.

913
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,650
So that's sitting there and they walked
back and forth like 58 times trying to

914
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,780
get the guy at the front desk
to get a cab. That'll show up,

915
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:10,650
but for some reason they're not showing
up. It's a fine. And then I'm like, Paul,

916
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:14,790
just just fuck it to wrap. Sit down and
get some food. He goes, no, fuck that.

917
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,290
Fuck that. This is one of the best fights
of the year and I'm going to miss it.

918
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,280
I want to see it live.

919
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:24,690
I want to see like I just never been at
a shower where you couldn't get a cab.

920
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,290
So now the cab doesn't show up. 20
fucking minutes later, whatever.

921
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,370
We got a couple of drinks in front of us
and my fucking burger shows up with the

922
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:38,010
French fries. I got a coke.
The other guy's got an,

923
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:42,330
I don't know whether he had a salad with
some chicken Assam Shit and fuzzy at

924
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:44,520
this point. He's like, invading my space.

925
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:48,180
He's literally becoming like that
jerk off on the bus. I'd suck a dick.

926
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,590
Except he's going where to Sharon?
How do you not get a cabinet at Sheridan?

927
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,610
And he's fucking leaning
on the bar and all that.

928
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,720
My food finally comes in before the
plate even hits the fucking bar.

929
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,340
He goes, Hey, can I get
one of those French fries?

930
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,380
And I looked at him and I was so fed up
with people. I looked at him, I said,

931
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:12,360
you know what? No, no you
can't. And then the lady goes,

932
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:17,040
the kitchen closes in five minutes. I go,
Paul, just order a cheeseburger. He goes,

933
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:17,910
no,
I'm going to this fight.

934
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,310
And then he sits down on the other side
of the guy who just looks at me. He goes,

935
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:24,400
you know what? That was fucked
up. That was fucked. What
you just did there, right?

936
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,720
Because if I buy it some French fries,
you want to have to ask me.

937
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:33,220
I in mind grabbing like two huge
handfuls. I go here, I'd go here,

938
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:37,780
take this, take this, and I'm like,
fuzzy. You would lean an I for,

939
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,830
I don't lean over people's food.
How to fucking,

940
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,350
you're not getting a cabinet at Sheridan.

941
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,260
So finally I look at them and I just go,

942
00:56:49,261 --> 00:56:54,261
you guys realize you have a rental car
sitting out there in the parking lot.

943
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,220
I don't know if you're too drunk to drive,

944
00:56:56,221 --> 00:56:58,470
but if you're not drunk enough to
drive the fight as it start enough,

945
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,370
just go jump in the car and drive down
the fucking street. So they go fine.

946
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:05,220
That's the plan. So the other
guy goes up to look for the keys.

947
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:11,130
He's up there for like 20 minutes and
I'm polishing off the Burger in Versie is

948
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:16,070
telling me that he,
you know what a piece of shit friend I am.

949
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,120
And at one point I go,
Paul,

950
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:22,920
I didn't look you like an athlete who
doesn't know when to end his career.

951
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:27,780
It's over. We're not going to see the
fight. It's fucking over. You know?

952
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,990
So then he tries to order a fucking
cheeseburger and by then the kitchen's

953
00:57:30,991 --> 00:57:31,824
closed.

954
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:37,610
Then they find another place that's
within five miles that they can see the

955
00:57:37,711 --> 00:57:41,820
fight. So they run up to the front desk
and they go, Oh, the guy drives a shuttle.

956
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:45,570
Just went home and fuzzy
is fucking losing his mind.

957
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,731
And uh,

958
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:52,620
that guy upstairs could not find his keys
to the rental car though it was a shit

959
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:54,120
show.
It was one of the most,

960
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:57,420
it was almost as entertaining as the game
watching those two guys trying to get

961
00:57:57,421 --> 00:58:01,260
to the fight. And uh, they
finally find that, oh,

962
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:04,080
the guy I was sitting with had to
go up and find the fucking keys.

963
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:05,220
He finds the keys

964
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:10,650
and then they decide they're going to
jump in the rental car to go watch the

965
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:13,890
last half of the fight. And they like you
share you to want to go. And I'm like,

966
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:17,000
dude, I am paying for this and I'm going
to go upstairs and I'm fucking going to

967
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:20,910
sleep. And uh, and that's
exactly what I do. I go upstairs,

968
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,051
me and the other dude,

969
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:24,930
we go upstairs and we're just laughing
our asses off and those two fucking guys

970
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:29,640
jumping a car to go find this fight in
like a Dave and busters or whatever.

971
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:30,600
So whatever,

972
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,170
they went to some ESPN zone place and
they go there and they don't have the

973
00:58:34,171 --> 00:58:35,004
fight.

974
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,780
So the whole thing was a fucking wash.
I'm laying in bed,

975
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,560
right just about ready to fall asleep.

976
00:58:46,561 --> 00:58:49,310
Just laughing my ass off and just
think what a great game it was.

977
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,050
What a wonderful drive. It wasn't all
that stuff. Right. What a great weekend.

978
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:57,650
And all of a sudden my phone buzzes and
I get this picture and the underneath

979
00:58:59,161 --> 00:58:59,281
it,

980
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:04,281
it says pussies and I fucking look at
the picture and it's a picture of Paul

981
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:08,190
Versey with a Mug of beer. You can't
even see his face. He's sucking it down.

982
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:14,330
And I laughed and I just texted him back,

983
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:16,070
don't get arrested cause
I'm gonna have to get out,

984
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,220
basically fucking bail you out.
And then he fell asleep.

985
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:24,320
I fall and like three hours later.

986
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:25,640
Okay.

987
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,490
I think I started dreaming
about chainsaws out of nowhere.

988
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:32,690
And then I fucking wake up
and vs in the bed next to me,

989
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:38,530
he's in the other twin there and he is
fucking snoring at an Olympic level.

990
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,770
So I'm waiting on forsee frozen anything.

991
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,553
Okay.

992
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,403
Yeah.

993
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:49,900
Okay.

994
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,380
Like, like that. And
I'm just like, firstly,

995
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:57,400
I'm fucking kicking the bed and
he's with ha ha ha. And I'm like,

996
00:59:57,401 --> 01:00:01,600
dude, don't just snoring.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

997
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:04,390
All right.
And then two seconds later,

998
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,370
like immediately would fall back
to sleep and sound like, I dunno,

999
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,370
like someone was choking
a fucking wart hog. So,

1000
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:13,770
okay,

1001
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,581
I'm sitting over there,

1002
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:19,260
I'm making like a pillow sandwich with
my fucking head trying to block them out.

1003
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:23,280
And uh, he swears that he
heard me yell, motherfucker.

1004
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,360
I don't remember saying that,

1005
01:00:24,361 --> 01:00:27,990
but I kept falling asleep and then
waking back up to this fucking jackass.

1006
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,211
I Emilia,

1007
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:32,520
have sympathy for every housewife out
there if your husband snores like that.

1008
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,230
Right?
So I fucking,

1009
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:38,490
I went into my bag and I got earplugs
out that I wear on the plane or whatever.

1010
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,300
Jan, those things in there. And then, you
know, there's like four pillars to a bed,

1011
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:46,020
had two on one side, two on the
other. And I, you know, it's, in fact,

1012
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:48,060
it was possible to put
myself in a headlock.

1013
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:52,560
I would have to try and block
my ears and uh, I was hilarious.

1014
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:54,600
Woke up the next day when
I woke up in the morning,

1015
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:57,210
he was already gone and get an
early flight. And at that point,

1016
01:00:57,211 --> 01:01:00,090
of course we were laughing about
the French fry. He's still pissed.

1017
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,560
He's still pissed on some level is
questioning my level of loyalty to him.

1018
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:10,740
Um, and I don't give a shit. All
right? That's the deal. I would never,

1019
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:11,970
if you're listening to this,
Paul,

1020
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:15,910
I would never hover over your fucking
food and I would never ask you for any of

1021
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,700
your fucking food before you've had a
chance to get byte number one. Okay?

1022
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:25,410
There's this, there's etiquette. There's
etiquette. You don't show up to picture,

1023
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,420
all right? You don't sit on
somebody else's motorcycle.

1024
01:01:30,421 --> 01:01:33,840
Y'all play somebody else's drums without
asking them. There's all kinds of stuff.

1025
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:37,140
All right? You don't tell some you
don't. You don't criticize about waste.

1026
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:39,510
So many parents that are on kid.
You don't do that. And for the,

1027
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,580
and you don't fucking
take somebody French fry.

1028
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,240
You fucking do that before the
plate even hits. How dare you?

1029
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:49,500
How dare you Paul Versey you
weren't raised right. All right.

1030
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:54,570
I fucking stand by that in any way with
a piece of shit out there that defends

1031
01:01:54,571 --> 01:01:57,900
him. You know what? Go eat with versa.

1075

1076
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,350
as disappointed as I was that we
didn't get to do the show in El Paso,

1077
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:40,710
the upside is I get to go to that
wonderful part of the country again.

1078
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,940
And I think what I'm gonna do this time
is I'm going to do the show and I'm

1079
01:04:44,941 --> 01:04:46,120
actually going to do a road trip,

1080
01:04:46,121 --> 01:04:49,530
but the other way I might
drive out to a Albuquerque,

1081
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:54,390
New Mexico where they, uh, they shot
the unbelievable show breaking bad.

1082
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,030
I got to do a few episodes of that and,

1083
01:04:57,031 --> 01:05:00,660
but they also shot one of
my favorite movies of all
time, no country for old men.

1084
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,320
And I want to drive around and look at
some of those shooting locations like the

1085
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:08,790
motel with a shoot brought or they killed
Josh Brolin and all of that type of

1086
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:11,910
stuff. Um, I am converted.

1087
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,220
I the southwest,

1088
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,480
all of that stuff is some of the most
beautiful scenery you can ever see right

1089
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:23,260
up through Colorado, Wyoming, Montana,

1090
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:26,680
all those places they fucking make fun of
man. I'm telling you, they unbelievable.

1091
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:31,300
Um, and my apologies to that
guy. I'm going to try and
get his email from my, uh,

1092
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:32,710
the guy who helps me with my podcast.

1093
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:36,500
I get to try to smooth shit over with
him cause I feel bad about that. Um,

1094
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,780
all right, here we go. Let's read some
stuff. All right. Character assassination.

1095
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:42,663
Hello billion.

1096
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:46,840
I'm a freshman in the university over
in England and everything is good in the

1097
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:49,210
world apart from one small annoyance.

1098
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:53,290
I have just gotten in from a night out
on the time I had just got in from a

1099
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:57,130
night on the town and
it's 7:00 AM I experienced
something that I feel I need to

1100
01:05:57,131 --> 01:06:00,880
ask you about and I had loved the advice
you give and I love the advice you give,

1101
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:04,510
so feel and so feel you're the
best person to ask. All right,

1102
01:06:04,511 --> 01:06:08,170
granted you're hammered. You're writing
this at seven in the morning. Okay. Um,

1103
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:12,280
I've been at the university for five days
and everyone is getting on really well.

1104
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:16,030
I have been the guy that cracks the jokes
and make sure everyone is included and

1105
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:18,940
make sure everyone comes
out to drink every night.

1106
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,490
This evening I'm a new guy,

1107
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:24,760
moved into my flat and immediately
the group dynamic changed.

1108
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:29,740
He seemed to be very sure of himself
and it felt as though he believed he was

1109
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:30,574
better than us.

1110
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:35,320
He constantly made remarks about the lack
of girls in the group and at a general

1111
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:38,890
air of complacency. Uh,
to put a long story short,

1112
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:41,050
he tried to humiliate
me in front of everyone.

1113
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,560
He made me feel little by making
a big deal out of a remark.

1114
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:49,240
I made sarcastically. I said that I
had a cousin who is quite attractive.

1115
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:53,530
I was clearly joking, but he made it his
mission to say it was incest you with.

1116
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,060
And because I'm from Wales,

1117
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:58,420
he suggested that I have sexual
intercourse with sheep. Oh,

1118
01:06:58,421 --> 01:07:02,620
you guys are the ones who get that out
there. I'm a well known Welsh stereotype,

1119
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:07,900
but is potentially true. He wrote
with a Little Smiley wink face. Um,

1120
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:11,440
I sensed that the entire room knew I
was joking and found it strange that he

1121
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:14,440
made such a big deal out of it.
But due to is highly confident,

1122
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:18,130
almost cocky personality. They were
scared to argue with with, well,

1123
01:07:18,131 --> 01:07:21,700
you got to nip that in the
butt. Yeah, you got it.

1124
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:25,390
You got to step to that guy immediately
be like, dude, it's just a joke.

1125
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:29,380
Why do you keep talking about it?
Do you secretly want to fuck his sheep?

1126
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,440
So you're trying to put it on me cause
you dick gets a little hard as you

1127
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:36,100
talking about it. You fucking
Weirdo. Just so you've got it.

1128
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:39,780
You got to come at that guy.
You know,

1129
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,870
you don't have to do like dough.
You shade it again.

1130
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:44,490
I'll fucking Yaki teeth down your fucking
throat. You don't have to go there yet.

1131
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:49,260
You don't have to. All right.
Anyways, let's, let's, let's,

1132
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:53,050
let's move on here. Uh,
they sense the entire room,

1133
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:57,930
but Blahblahblahblahblah I
explained myself for several
minutes and he continued

1134
01:07:57,931 --> 01:08:01,260
to make a big deal out of nothing and
I feel most of the room agreed with me.

1135
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,630
Yeah. You, you were giving
them like to a guy like that,

1136
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:10,430
that's a sign of weakness. A few to
keep explaining where he goes. Nah,

1137
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,550
I take you want to fuck a sheet? No,
no. It was a Joe. No, I was just,

1138
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,900
I thought I died it at, I said, you are
right. Spider. He become a spider here.

1139
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:19,970
You can't do that.
Um,

1140
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:23,210
I felt like the best course of action was
to punch him as hard as I could in the

1141
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:26,450
face. Ah, all right. I
like that. Good move.

1142
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,260
I resisted the urge to punch him and have
removed myself from the situation and

1143
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,580
as I have a feeling that the best way to
deal with shitty peoples to avoid them

1144
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,650
while depends on wolf.

1145
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:39,050
Avoiding him means not hanging out
with the friends that you're making.

1146
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:41,480
You have to address it now.
You don't need to punch him in the face.

1147
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,890
So I'm just joking.
Uh,

1148
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:47,420
the problem was that most of the room
came with me as they felt I was in the

1149
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:52,160
right, thus isolating him
on his first night. This is
not what I wanted to happen,

1150
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:55,040
dude. You got to stop being a people
pleaser. He's been a continent.

1151
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:57,890
Needs to sit there and think about it.
Um,

1152
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:00,870
he said this is not what I want it to
happen as the first night in universities,

1153
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:01,723
the hardest.

1154
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:06,760
And I didn't want to be the cause of
his lonesomeness even though it was

1155
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:11,120
somewhat self inflicted, somewhat in
self-inflating was totally self inflicted.

1156
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:16,100
Sir He go, this made him dislike me more
and as we left to go out drinking in the

1157
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:20,210
nightclubs, he came up to me and locked
me in the eyes and said, I hate you. Yeah,

1158
01:09:20,211 --> 01:09:24,150
this guy is just an insecure can't
he goes,

1159
01:09:24,151 --> 01:09:28,890
I did not handle it as I was not set out
to make enemies and he seemed to want

1160
01:09:28,891 --> 01:09:29,724
to hate me.

1161
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,103
Yup.

1162
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:35,640
I just say, all right, well
cool. All right, well we
got, we got that over quick.

1163
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,490
Enjoy your time at the university.
We don't have to be friends.

1164
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:43,030
Have a nice evening. Yeah. He goes,
I feel like I've tried to be nice,

1165
01:09:43,031 --> 01:09:47,410
but he has beef with me. Don't be nice
to this guy. Fuck this guy. He goes,

1166
01:09:47,411 --> 01:09:48,550
my question for you is,

1167
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:53,350
would you have left the room when the
guy tried to humiliate you or would

1168
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:55,750
punching him be the best option?
All right.

1169
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:58,720
At this age I wouldn't have left the room
and I would have given him shit and I

1170
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:01,120
wouldn't have punched him in the face.
At your age.

1171
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:04,090
I probably would have let them
roll all over me, bully me,

1172
01:10:04,091 --> 01:10:07,000
and then would have for some reason become
friends with them and let them treat

1173
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:09,250
me like shit for the next
five years in my fucking life.

1174
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:13,300
That's what I would've
done at your edge. So, um,

1175
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,730
pet space at work,
you shouldn't avoid this guy.

1176
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,350
He shouldn't take any shift from this guy.
This guy has got a lot of issues.

1177
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:27,351
He probably has a bad father or home
situation and he's basically in the

1178
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:30,930
beginnings of going out into the world
and taking out his childhood and other

1179
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:35,460
people. So the only way he can do that
to you is if you allow him to, uh,

1180
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:37,080
you don't need to be friends
with someone like that.

1181
01:10:37,081 --> 01:10:39,240
But what you do need to do is
you need to draw a line in.

1182
01:10:39,241 --> 01:10:42,840
That guy has to respect the fact that
he can't get out of line with you.

1183
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,970
All right? So if it comes up
and says, I hate you, just
be like, hey, you know, well,

1184
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:51,430
you know, it's not going to do about that.
Have a nice evening. And he said, yeah,

1185
01:10:51,431 --> 01:10:55,180
I really fucking hate you. And just be
like, listen, dude, do you have a problem?

1186
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:59,020
Is there something, you know,
if you're going to do something,

1187
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:02,750
do what the fuck you feel you need to do
or get the fuck out of my face and just

1188
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:05,390
leave it at that because he's not going
to throw a punch and it comes up and

1189
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:07,430
says, I hate you. It sounds
like a fucking seventh grader.

1190
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:11,110
And it sounds like you have it in you
to punch somebody in the face. Uh,

1191
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,980
so you know, and if, and if you already
know that about yourself, you don't

1192
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,160
have to prove it again. So don't, don't
go with violence, man. That's just,

1193
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,680
that's stupid advice just when it comes
up and says, hey, you just be like, yeah,

1194
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,200
all right. It's not an I could
do about it. It's unfortunate.

1195
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:32,040
I wish it wouldn't happen,
you know? I mean, I don't,

1196
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,690
I don't know what he
wants out of you, but, uh,

1197
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,780
the biggest thing that
I've gotten from this,

1198
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:39,720
cause I can't tell you what to do because
I'd have to know a lot more about the

1199
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,310
situation as to how to handle that guy.

1200
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:46,020
But the biggest thing I got out of this
is your need to try and make things

1201
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:49,110
better and be a people pleaser with
someone who doesn't deserve that.

1202
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,730
You sound like a really nice guy.

1203
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,930
All right?
And you know what happens to nice guys?

1204
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:57,430
They attract assholes because
people who don't tolerate assholes,

1205
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,230
they can't get in there.

1206
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,890
So some of the biggest countries in the
world hang out with some of the nicest

1207
01:12:02,891 --> 01:12:06,010
fucking people in the world who don't
know how to stick up for themselves in

1208
01:12:06,011 --> 01:12:06,940
certain situations.

1209
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:11,650
So this is what I've told a couple people
in my life may make somebody earned.

1210
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:13,690
How nice a person you are.

1211
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:18,600
Don't just be giving it away and
just being nice to everybody. Uh,

1212
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:22,840
this guy hasn't earned it, so fuck
him. All right. Fuck that guy.

1213
01:12:22,841 --> 01:12:26,080
Don't take any shit from him. And,
uh, but don't, don't let them,

1214
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:28,990
don't allow that guy to make you mad.
Yeah.

1215
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:31,120
And then you throw a punch and
then you've got issues at school.

1216
01:12:31,121 --> 01:12:34,420
Cause this guy's a cunt. He had
a bad dad. Fuck that. Fuck that.

1217
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:36,820
If it comes up and says he hates you
again, just be like, dude, I got it.

1218
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,830
You already said that.
I understand you don't like me.

1219
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,180
So get out of my face and
get on with not liking me.

1220
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,280
All right. If you really didn't like
me, you wouldn't be coming up to me.

1221
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:50,550
So why don't you prove to me how much
you don't like to me. Don't listen.

1222
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:51,570
When I say everything I say will,

1223
01:12:51,571 --> 01:12:54,390
it always escalates into a fucking
rolling around on the floor kind of thing.

1224
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:58,210
I hope something in there
helped you. Um, all right,

1225
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,880
Hiroshima and documentary to checkout.
Dear Billy von Reddington

1226
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:07,340
bill, I ain't, I'm American

1227
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,800
good living in Hiroshima teaching English.

1228
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:13,160
It's a great gig where I get to meet a
lot of the locals and teach them how to

1229
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:15,890
pronounce things the way we do.
My Dad was in the army,

1230
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,140
so I grew up learning a
lot about American history,

1231
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:21,800
especially military history since
it was such a big part of our lives.

1232
01:13:21,801 --> 01:13:25,430
Being in a military family
and all, I'm a huge fan, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1233
01:13:25,431 --> 01:13:29,120
He writes and I am happy to hear that
you are getting into world war history in

1234
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:30,300
a big way.
Uh,

1235
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,350
the last few weeks in the man podcasts
have almost been weird as you are

1236
01:13:33,351 --> 01:13:37,280
discovering a lot of the same things
I did about our past and about how the

1237
01:13:37,281 --> 01:13:40,880
modern world came to be when I was a kid.
World War II aviation,

1238
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:45,710
especially in this Pacific had a profound
effect on me and the book fly boys was

1239
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:48,080
the first time I ever read about,
uh,

1240
01:13:48,081 --> 01:13:51,530
about shit going down in the Philippines
and how we got all these oversee

1241
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:54,650
territories in Puerto Rico
and Guam and all of that.

1242
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:59,150
Before that I was just bought into
believing that we were the good guys and

1243
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:02,060
everyone else was to blame for
everything wrong in the world. Also,

1244
01:14:02,061 --> 01:14:05,720
I have to agree with the last person who
wrote in that the Dan Carlin podcast,

1245
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:10,460
ghost of the oss front. I got to listen to
that. Asked front, O, s, t, F, R, O, n, t,

1246
01:14:10,461 --> 01:14:14,950
everybody, Carlin spelt the same
as George Carlin, c a. R. L. I, N,

1247
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,070
ghosts of the OSS to front
O. S. T. F. R. O. N. T.

1248
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:21,730
All one word from the hardcore
history was life changing.

1249
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:27,670
The fucking Russians lost between 20
and 40 million people and many of those

1250
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:32,200
were civilians. We lost a half
million in the whole war. Uh,

1251
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:35,740
there is a saying that World War II was
one with Berlin, British intelligence,

1252
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:39,730
American steel and
Russian blood. Wow, man.

1253
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:44,930
Jesus Christ. That's a sacrifice and a
half, huh? Understatement of the year.

1254
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,930
I got to listen to that.
This could not be more true,

1255
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:52,070
you saying about that expression after
the war when we went to rebuilding

1256
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:56,330
western Europe and the Russians basically
occupied everything to make sure this

1257
01:14:56,331 --> 01:14:57,560
shit never happened again.

1258
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,243
MMM.

1259
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,180
Oh, me read that sentence in
a better way. After the war,

1260
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:06,350
we went to rebuilding western Europe
and the Russians basically occupied

1261
01:15:06,351 --> 01:15:08,690
everything to make sure that this
should never happen again. All right,

1262
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:09,763
now the cold,

1263
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:14,000
now the Cold War from the Russian side
makes total sense to me and I think it

1264
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:17,600
will to UFT listened to
the podcast and also,

1265
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:21,980
I know you mentioned that you hate
ancient shit before cowboys and Indians,

1266
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:26,060
but you have to check out the podcast
also from Dan Carlin called death throes

1267
01:15:26,061 --> 01:15:28,130
of the Roman republic.
I'll do it. I'll listen.

1268
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,020
If someone's going to tell me about it,

1269
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:32,330
I can listen to anything
but to sit down and read it.

1270
01:15:32,331 --> 01:15:36,890
My brain doesn't work like that. It just
goes, why don't we go get a beer man?

1271
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:41,210
Why are we reading all this
heavy stuff? Man. Ancient Rome,

1272
01:15:41,211 --> 01:15:44,990
you see used to be a democracy before the
Roman empire and it faced a lot of the

1273
01:15:44,991 --> 01:15:49,340
same problems. Jesus Christ rail. We
actually learning things here. My God.

1274
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:54,260
All right, stay with me people. I
got a little more to read here. Um,

1275
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,620
ancient Rome used to be a democracy
before it became a Roman empire,

1276
01:15:57,621 --> 01:16:00,500
and it faces a lot of the same problems
we face today before it ultimately

1277
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:05,330
became an empire rather than a democracy.
Oh Jesus, that sounds familiar.

1278
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:09,320
You see, there were two groups in
ancient Rome that basically ran shit.

1279
01:16:09,321 --> 01:16:12,290
The public caneys.
I hope I said that right.

1280
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:14,660
Who were rich and conservative.

1281
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,260
And the popularity is the populist who
sought power through gaining the support

1282
01:16:18,261 --> 01:16:21,920
of the poor. Oh my God. So basically
this is their Fox News and CNN,

1283
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:26,720
and ultimately it was this struggle that
led to the imperial Rome. Check it out.

1284
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,620
Uh, last one here. You need
to check out fog of war.

1285
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:35,270
It's a documentary free on youtube
that won the Oscar back in 2004.

1286
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:38,240
I think it's about
Robert S. Dot. Mcnamara,

1287
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:41,840
who was most famous for being secretary
of defense during the Cuban missile

1288
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:46,010
crisis in Vietnam. Before all that, he
was a statistician and World War II.

1289
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:49,070
He was one of the guys who crunched
the numbers to see how much destruction

1290
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,320
could be caused by daylight
bombing in Germany.

1291
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:53,810
And later in Japan and this documentary,

1292
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:56,510
he points out that by fire
pump firebombing Japan,

1293
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,470
we killed more civilians in Tokyo in
one night than we did in the bombing of

1294
01:17:00,471 --> 01:17:01,304
Hiroshima.

1295
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,430
And that's also amazing when you read
the that fly boys book is you just

1296
01:17:04,431 --> 01:17:05,270
realized that

1297
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,190
okay.

1298
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:10,190
You know, cause I always learned
that we were trying to our dominance,

1299
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:12,440
that's why we ended up dropping
the bombs that we didn't need to.

1300
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:17,300
But like when you see how their people
were taught that we were devils had

1301
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:19,970
tails, had green blood and we
were going to eat them if we won.

1302
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,690
And when we approached the civilians
they would throw their babies off cliffs

1303
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:26,150
and jump off to that.

1304
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:30,110
I mean we were going to have to
lose way more people. I don't know.

1305
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:32,480
There's an argument for
both sides. It's, it's nuts.

1306
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:36,650
It's crazy and it's nuts that there's
actually rules and war and that it's

1307
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:39,050
somehow legal. Um, anyways,

1308
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:42,650
the bomb looms still to this day and
the town of Hiroshima and there is an

1309
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:46,670
overwhelming belief that it should not
have been used no matter what. Yeah,

1310
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:50,150
of course. Absolutely. You think
that they would think that, you know,

1311
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:54,170
and over here we were like,
well, you know, you're going
to lose a lot of guys. Um,

1312
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:57,620
but here they seem to to miss
a few things. First of all,

1313
01:17:57,621 --> 01:18:01,640
a land invasion would have resulted in
a million more Japanese dead since they

1314
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:04,370
would not surrender and were told that
the Americans would eat them and their

1315
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:06,740
families. Yeah, we read
the same book. Second,

1316
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:10,420
if we had blockaded the island rather
than invade or drop the, the a bond,

1317
01:18:10,421 --> 01:18:12,800
millions would have starved to death.
Last of all,

1318
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:16,430
and most often overlooked is if
the allies had invaded Japan,

1319
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,660
then Russia would have invaded too.
And just like in Europe,

1320
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:24,470
we would've given a large part
of Japan to Russia to rule over.

1321
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:28,070
So northern Japan could have been like
North Korea if we had dropped the bombs.

1322
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,880
I'm not a hippie and I'm not writing from
some idea that America is evil and our

1323
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:33,170
enemies did nothing wrong.

1324
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,730
But it is amazing to see how much was
going on from all sides, good in bed.

1325
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,661
And it gives a richer,

1326
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:42,290
fuller version of what actually was
going on all of the world at the time.

1327
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,860
Exactly. That's why I loved reading that
book. I like, you know, that's why got,

1328
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:48,860
I like listening to people
trash the Patriots. How,

1329
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:50,990
what is your viewpoint of this?
How do you look at it? You know,

1330
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:54,080
you got to listen to some of that.
Right. Anyways, love the podcast.

1331
01:18:54,081 --> 01:18:57,560
Come to Hiroshima to the bomb museums
sometimes for a pretty sobering history.

1332
01:18:57,561 --> 01:19:01,130
Keep Up. Oh, I'll definitely
do that someday. Keep it up.

1333
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:03,140
And most of all go fuck yourself.
All right.

1334
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,710
It's probably the most intelligent
thing has ever been uttered. Of course,

1335
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:08,090
it was written by somebody else.
All right.

1336
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:12,230
I'm plowing through all of this
people. We got a couple more to go. Um,

1337
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,900
Henry Kissinger, dear
Billy Westwinds, uh, oh,

1338
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:22,080
Billy West, the great a voiceover guy. One
of the voices of Ren and Stimpy. I mean,

1339
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:25,050
he might have done
both, right. Steepy ETF.

1340
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:29,680
You don't deserve to live. I'm
sorry. Terrible impression. Um,

1341
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,730
do you know how Evil Kissinger
is? The man is a war criminal. Uh,

1342
01:19:34,731 --> 01:19:39,500
he carpet bombed Cambodia, oversaw the
coup in Chile that practically destroyed,

1343
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,060
destroyed their great nation,

1344
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:45,140
jacked off to the dropping of agent
orange all over Vietnam. Okay.

1345
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:48,020
This is very slanderous,
sir. He's pure evil.

1346
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:51,230
He's a Zionist who believes
in ethnic cleansing,

1347
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:56,120
cleansing and has gone on record promoting
policy that promote d population,

1348
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:01,400
not the, hey everyone.
Hey, everyone's cool.

1349
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:07,950
What not the hey everyone cool it on
the fucking deep population. More like,

1350
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,380
let's get guys to fight those guys.

1351
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:13,350
Both sides will have
civilians die and go hungry.

1352
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:18,630
I think you've left out some
words in that. Um, he goes,
I'm Jewish. I love juice.

1353
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:21,360
The good ones. I love all
people no matter their religion.

1354
01:20:21,361 --> 01:20:24,690
I've been to Israel and believe it
is a beautiful and moving place,

1355
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:29,010
but the state of Israel is pure
evil, not the people, the government.

1356
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:33,090
My father worked for a company that did
business with the Israeli government.

1357
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,190
That's all I can say about his business,

1358
01:20:35,191 --> 01:20:37,980
but I can say that he was
privy to some insane things.

1359
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,050
The types of things that
make you lose sleep.

1360
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:44,220
The main objective in almost all policy
he saw was to create money and wealth

1361
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:47,490
for a few families,
for the few families that run Israel.

1362
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:52,740
True Judaism and love for the religion
is almost obsolete when you get high

1363
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:53,580
enough in power.
Yeah,

1364
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:58,220
that's kind of true everywhere kind
of all goes out the window. Um,

1365
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:00,960
when she gets to that
eyes wide shut level, uh,

1366
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:05,400
they heads of the state used Judaism as
a way of silencing anyone who questions

1367
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:09,030
their actions where we
use support the troops,

1368
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:14,330
call someone to antisemites and see
how quickly they shut up a college.

1369
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:18,570
You and anti Zionist and it's
the same thing. They shut
up. US Jews have suffered,

1370
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:22,710
but so have lots of people who can't
be quantified into that group. Anyways.

1371
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,010
Fuck Kissinger. All right, well I guess
I have some reading up on to do on that.

1372
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:30,720
Uh, that's one man's opinion,
but I mean it just, it doesn't,

1373
01:21:30,721 --> 01:21:33,990
it all just what you start reading about
it all just seems to be the same story

1374
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:38,010
over and over again because we really
are all the same. And I think that like,

1375
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,120
you know,
once you go beyond a certain level power,

1376
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:46,800
I think there's maybe a handful of people
in the world that can handle it and

1377
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:51,360
the rest of us start to feel
like we're godlike. And uh,

1378
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:54,630
we start summoning people to
come in and give us blow jobs

1379
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:01,110
and drinking wine out
of some JAKKS bladder,

1380
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:04,620
whatever the file over the fuck they did
that. That's disgusting. Um, all right,

1381
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:09,240
last but not least,
I probably shouldn't fucker.

1382
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:14,070
Uh, hey there could QB,
the freckle faced kid. Hey,

1383
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:17,400
how cool was it last week where
they gave my character a first name?

1384
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,450
I don't want to ruin anything,

1385
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:22,380
but I was sitting there on
pins and needles watching
that stuff. And by the way,

1386
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:27,030
if you're up to date, I'm not going to
ruin anything on breaking bad, but, uh,

1387
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:31,230
I'm asking this people outside the
United States because I don't know of any

1388
01:22:31,231 --> 01:22:35,850
United States show that has ever
been better than breaking bad. Um,

1389
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:40,970
my stomach has been an absolute Nazi
watching the show and each week it just

1390
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:43,620
keeps getting ratcheted higher and higher.

1391
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:48,630
Like last night's episode was like one
of the most disturbing things I've ever

1392
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:53,370
seen. And if you live in another
country, okay. And you know,

1393
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:56,310
have a show. If you've watched
all of breaking bad and you know,

1394
01:22:56,311 --> 01:23:00,630
have a show that you think is
on par or dare I say better,

1395
01:23:00,631 --> 01:23:04,830
I want to know what it is and I
don't care if there's no subtitles,

1396
01:23:04,831 --> 01:23:05,980
I will sit down and just

1397
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
view it because what they've done with
the second half of this fifth season,

1398
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:12,651
I've,

1399
01:23:12,651 --> 01:23:17,620
I've never seen anything like it in my
40 years of sitting in front of the idiot

1400
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:20,140
box. I could actually say
it's not an idiot box anymore.

1401
01:23:20,141 --> 01:23:22,900
When this something like that on TV,
it's just unbelievable.

1402
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:27,340
And if you're late to the party,
by all means,

1403
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:32,210
when all five seasons come out,
you,

1404
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:36,250
you owe it to yourself to download them
by him and don't blow through them.

1405
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,510
Okay. It's a fine wine.
Open a bottle at night,

1406
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,540
sit there with your
friends and discuss it. Um,

1407
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:47,470
it's incredible.
I mean,

1408
01:23:47,471 --> 01:23:50,380
a lot of the stuff that we're talking
about as far as people handling power,

1409
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:54,940
you know, it's, it's unreal. It's
unfucking believable. Anyways, last one.

1410
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:59,350
Here we go. I want a lot of people
have asked me about the Saul, uh,

1411
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:05,170
you know, Saul Goodman spinoff. Um,
I know as much as you guys know,

1412
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:07,690
I just heard it. I heard it. It's
not, it's going to be a prequel.

1413
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:11,050
So if it's a Prequel,
I would feel that that's years before,

1414
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,730
I dunno if he gets to Albuquerque and
people have been asking if I'm going to be

1415
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:20,170
on it. I have no idea. I
hope so. I have no idea.

1416
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:23,980
But whether I am or whether I'm not,
I'm watching every episode.

1417
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:30,550
Um, anyway, it was a prequel.

1418
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:32,440
Shouldn't I come in at
like the very last one?

1419
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,880
And then we all moved to Albuquerque.
See that right there.

1420
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:41,380
That's why I don't write
ups. Terrible idea. Sorry.

1421
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,880
Anyways, I probably shouldn't.
Fucker is the last one here. Hey,

1422
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:50,260
there could be the freckle face. I need
some help. So there's this crazy broad,

1423
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:51,580
it might job who's I'm,

1424
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:56,170
who I'm 99% sure I could
fuck if I asked directly.

1425
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,720
Uh,
now I feel free to,

1426
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:03,850
now I feel free to think this because
she isn't exactly top shelf trim,

1427
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:08,200
but she certainly worth trying
a shot if it's free. Um,

1428
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,940
I got to tell you, do this. That's one
of the biggest lies in the universe.

1429
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:14,980
It's never free.
There's never been a free,

1430
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,770
there's never been a free
piece ever did the history.

1431
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:23,740
It all comes with a
price all and all does.

1432
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:26,620
Especially when you're trying to bank
somebody you're working with right there.

1433
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:31,120
You're shitting where you're eating and
you take that could go very bad very

1434
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:32,680
quickly. Uh, he goes,

1435
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:35,710
I've worked with her for about two years
and for awhile she was putting on what

1436
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:38,140
seemed to be a pretty strong press,

1437
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,610
excessive hanging out at my desk,
finding random ways to mess with me,

1438
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:46,510
laughing at anything I do, you
know, office flirty, bullshit. Well,

1439
01:25:46,511 --> 01:25:50,200
maybe she likes you.
She might actually like you see,

1440
01:25:50,201 --> 01:25:54,250
this is the way guy looks at.
She was the suck my Dick, right?

1441
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:58,720
So she's going to be sitting
there thinking you're
making love and you're like,

1442
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:03,680
ah, good cum in your mouth. Right. And
then you treat her like I'm telling you,

1443
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:06,980
that's how shit starts.
So anyways,

1444
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:10,310
then I launched a
passive attempt to smash,

1445
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,000
told her we should get drinks.
Oh no dude.

1446
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:17,870
Just the way you talk about women in the,
which is hilarious coming from me,

1447
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,120
but the way and totally hypocritical,

1448
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,860
the way you talk about women like this,
this is not going to end well.

1449
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:27,800
I told her we should get drinks.

1450
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,970
We went out to catch a movie after work
but didn't make a major move because of

1451
01:26:31,971 --> 01:26:36,800
fear of her having a story to tell the
office about rejecting me. Very smart.

1452
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,670
Nothing happened and
things cooled way off.

1453
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,890
Uh,
long story short,

1454
01:26:43,891 --> 01:26:47,640
since then she's exhibited
advanced signs of female dementia.

1455
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,470
Well, before I go any further, I'm
going to guess that because you,

1456
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:54,660
you didn't make a move.
She thought that, oh,

1457
01:26:54,661 --> 01:26:58,670
he went out to see what kind of a person
I am and was expecting maybe a follow

1458
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:02,640
up date and when it didn't happen, that's
sending her the signal that you didn't,

1459
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:05,160
you didn't like something about her.

1460
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,480
So maybe now that's why she's distant.
I don't know.

1461
01:27:09,481 --> 01:27:13,200
He said the worst one being an incident
where she invited me to hang out with

1462
01:27:13,201 --> 01:27:15,720
her and I taught her how to rip a bond.

1463
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:17,320
Yeah,

1464
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,150
it's all right.
This one is a wholly different direction.

1465
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:20,020
Totally different direction.

1466
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:24,100
She got unreasonably high and wound
up locking herself in the bathroom,

1467
01:27:24,101 --> 01:27:24,851
calling her mom.

1468
01:27:24,851 --> 01:27:28,690
Just say how she invited me over God
high and was worried I was going to take

1469
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:33,520
advantage of her. Her mom was about to
call the cops, but she did stop her.

1470
01:27:33,521 --> 01:27:34,301
For what it's worth,

1471
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:39,010
I'm six five 200 pound black guy
and she's a small Asian girl.

1472
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:43,210
So I really saw Ben into that
storyline. Oh Jesus Christ. Absolutely.

1473
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:49,320
So we are now back to normal with her
being a 200 proof bottle of crazy and me

1474
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:54,391
wondering if the crazy too good pussy
positive correlation holds true.

1475
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:58,210
That's fucking hilarious.

1476
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:03,220
If I figure she can't get any crazier in,
if I just ask directly,

1477
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:07,570
we can eliminate the chance of
confusion and calls to the police.

1478
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,780
Am I totally insane for still
wanting to fuck this girl?

1479
01:28:10,781 --> 01:28:14,680
Thanks and go fuck yourself
bitch. Um, all right.

1480
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,880
I hope there's women listening to this

1481
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:25,910
cause right now because you
don't have a dick. You probably,

1482
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:31,090
and this is why you think guys are so
dumb and I want you the same way this guy

1483
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:34,400
was talking about World War
II from the other perspective.

1484
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:39,530
You got to look at having a Dick from the
other perspective with, I swear to God,

1485
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:43,400
empathy and I'm going to pause
while you roll your eyes ladies.

1486
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,190
But this is how powerful

1487
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:51,090
having a Dick is.
This is how much it runs your life.

1488
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,730
Like the amount of shit.

1489
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:55,260
Yeah,

1490
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,580
that just got shot across the
bow of this guy's Dick. Okay.

1491
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:02,100
And he's still thinking like,
I think I can make it.

1492
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:05,820
What if I just said, hey, you
want to fuck and we just fucked.

1493
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I could somehow get this urge out of me
and then I could then go back to work.

1494
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:13,170
You know what's funny,
sir,

1495
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:18,171
is the fact that if you fuck this girl
and if it is as good as you think it's

1496
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:22,110
going to be like you're
going to be able to go back,

1497
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:26,160
you know to work and where
you're never going to bang again.

1498
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:30,030
You already know that this girl
is fucking nuts. All right?

1499
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,830
I'm removed from the situation.

1500
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,080
I haven't seen her so I don't
have any desire for you.

1501
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:38,310
I could tell you 100 fucking
percent do not repeat.

1502
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,720
Do not. Fuck this girl.
Stand down, sir. Abort.

1503
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,490
What other of the other military
rub one out before you go to work.

1504
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:49,590
Okay,

1505
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,780
go out.
You know what?

1506
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:57,060
Go out and find some other crazy fucking
woman that you don't have to see at

1507
01:29:57,061 --> 01:29:57,894
work.

1508
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:01,410
Okay,
that's it.

1509
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:05,750
That's it. All right. Do not do it. Yay.

1510
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:08,810
You're not totally insane for fucking
this woman. If he didn't have a Dick,

1511
01:30:08,811 --> 01:30:10,280
you would be,
but you do have a dick.

1512
01:30:10,281 --> 01:30:15,281
So I understand cause God knows I've
made neverending mistakes with my Dick.

1513
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:21,110
Trust me. All right. And by the
time you figure out your Dick,

1514
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:23,840
women don't want to fuck anymore anyways,
so it's pointless.

1515
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:26,750
So I'm trying to fucking fast
40th to where the hell I'm at.

1516
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:35,120
Hour and 30 minute podcasts. It might be
one of the longest ones ever. All right,

1517
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:38,540
that's the podcast this
week. Everybody. Um,

1518
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:40,490
before I do the little wrap up here,

1519
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,750
I want to just let you guys know
where I'm going to be this week. Uh,

1520
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:47,810
hang on a second. Hang on,
hang on. Hang on, Bill.

1521
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:53,900
Ah, you can't, I can't even type
with two hands. Forget about one,

1522
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:59,150
one finger. Uh, all right. Official
website. Being a beggar. Barnwell.

1523
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:01,430
I know I'm going to be able to
be in West Virginia, Pittsburgh,

1524
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:05,330
and Toronto this weekend.
Uh, this week I should say.

1525
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,960
So let's see if I can get the
uh, all right. On September 18th,

1526
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:11,120
the fuck Outta here.

1527
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:18,090
I got to fly out to him Wednesday.
No,

1528
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:24,140
at Jesus Christ. I really have.
No, I have no fucking life.

1529
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,190
All right.

1530
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:29,570
Evidently on September 18th I'm going
to be a Keith Alby theater provided

1531
01:31:29,571 --> 01:31:31,910
there's no rain.
Whatever the fuck could happen,

1532
01:31:31,911 --> 01:31:36,320
what could happen provided nobody's
still blows up near the fucking venue and

1533
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:40,670
lights it on fire. I'll be at the Keith
Alby theater on the 18th. On the 19th.

1534
01:31:40,671 --> 01:31:45,560
I'm doing west. Spread your near West
Virginia University in Morgantown,

1535
01:31:45,561 --> 01:31:47,120
West Virginia.
On the 20th,

1536
01:31:47,121 --> 01:31:51,560
I'm doing Hines hall for the
Performing Arts in Pittsburgh,

1537
01:31:51,561 --> 01:31:53,840
Pennsylvania,
Heinz Hall.

1538
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:58,970
And then on the 21st I'm doing Queen
Elizabeth Theater, Toronto, Ontario.

1539
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:02,590
Uh, that is it. In the
following week, September 28th,

1540
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,860
I'm doing the Chicago theater for
two shows. First one is sold out.

1541
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,980
The second one is almost
there for the love of God.

1542
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:13,750
Get your ass down to the show. All
right. And with that, let's do the,

1543
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:18,740
let's do the old wrap up here, the
old wrap up. Where the hell is it? Uh,

1544
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:19,810

Thank you everybody for listening.
I apologize.

1551
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:50,140
Everybody in El Paso was an act of God.
There was nothing I could do about it.

1552
01:32:50,141 --> 01:32:51,100
I'm definitely coming back.

1553

We're going to get that
makeup date as soon as we can.

1554
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,590
I don't give a shit if I have to come
there 50 times. I'm doing a show there.

1555
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,470
All right. That's the podcast. Go fuck
yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.
