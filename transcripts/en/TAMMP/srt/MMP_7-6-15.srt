1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,010
Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's
some Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,130
July 6th,
2015 how fucking

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,060

weekend? Did you have a good time?

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,130
Did your blow off your fucking fingers?
Um,

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,280
did you enjoy the 4th of
July? You know, first of all,

6
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,580
before right out of the gate,
right out of the gate,

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,610
I want to thank everybody that did some
dumb shit with fireworks and it had the

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:37,090
presence of mind to fucking
make a youtube video out of it,

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,790
you know?
So guys like make it just sit down.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,470
I was laughing my ass off last night.

11
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:45,790
I went to bed and I was watching people
shooting bottle rockets out of their ass,

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,180
having a Roman candle fights,
seen somebody take one to the face.

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,510
Do you know some guy in
Maine lit something off on
top of his fucking head and

14
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:58,420
he died instantly.
They will like he lit off,

15
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:02,380
they said some a mortar or
something fucking insane.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,770
What could,
what kind of,

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,720
you know what kind of a fucking
asshole would do something like that?

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,230
He must've had it. There's
no way. Everybody knows,

19
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:17,820
once you get up to anything like a pack
of firecrackers on your head, you like,

20
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:22,470
that's, that's funny. You're going to
fucking kill your ear drums and you know,

21
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,060
but you're going to survive.
But what,

22
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:28,890
what do you put an [inaudible]
in his mouth or something?
Well, I don't know, Bill.

23
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,290
You fucking brought it
up. All right, relax.

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,480
Let's just look at main guy dies.
Fireworks.

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,293
Okay.

26
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,310
All right. Man. Shoots off fireworks
from top of his head dies instantly.

27
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,270
A 22 year old man was drinking
and celebrating the 4th of July.

28
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,560
Happy Birthday to America.
Don't put it on my head.

29
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,580
Happy Birthday to America.
I'll fucking lie again.

30
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,400
Happy Birthday.
Wow.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,510
Okay,

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,020
Michael. Oh my God. So many cool. Um,

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
that's how I went down.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,500
22 year old man who was drinking
and celebrating the 4th of July.

35
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:11,410
I tried to launch a firework from Trump,
is his head, killed him instantly.

36
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,550
Authority said,

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,470
okay.

38
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,071
30 said,

39
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:17,760
you gotta be an authority to say that
somebody is fucking dead after the light.

40
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:22,270
Something off on their head.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Claire. Claire the way.

41
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:25,060
Click yes. Yes, he is dead. Well,

42
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,450
we kind of knew that he has Brian's all
over the sidewalk. Watch your mouth.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,550
Watch your mouth woman.

44
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,170
It's one of my favorite quotes
in sports over the last fucking,

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,130
I don't know how many months, six
months. Watch your mouth woman.

46
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,010
When that woman called,
uh,

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,180
ask the Braun what it was like to be a
punk ass bitch and then that guy's going

48
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:47,320
to watch your mouth.
Woman wants your mouth woman and you know,

49
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,240
you would think that the
broads would've had such,

50
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,150
which have fucking difficulty
with it. Like, you know,

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,300
I realized that she said something
derogatory towards him through excuse,

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,490
go change your Bra Lady.
All right.

53
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,820
I love that they didn't say anything
because even they knew even they knew that

54
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,350
I guide. Yeah. That bitch was out of line

55
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,610
up just talking shit today.
Um,

56
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,350
they won't say what kind of
firework it was. All right.

57
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,100
Apparently he thought that was a great
idea that have just when you died in a

58
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,080
stupid fucking way,

59
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:27,080
when somebody starts it off when
they start your yield eulogy off with

60
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,830
apparently. Yeah. Apparently this guy,

61
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:33,220
Todd sticking his head in the
garbage disposal was a, you know,

62
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,210
going to give him a good buzz. I
mean, I'm sorry to bring it up Claire,

63
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,000
but you know, how did they
even get it in there? Um,

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,460
his friends said they thought

65
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:46,670
okay.

66
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,880
They thought they dissuaded him from
doing it. The next thing they knew,

67
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,730
he ignited the firework and
he was killed instantly.

68
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,520
What the fuck did he shoot off?

69
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,870
Yeah,

70
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,940
there was no rushing him to the hospital.

71
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,580
There was no Devon left when I got there.

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,840
She said 25 year old Cody.
Jesus Christ.

73
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,630
The names of this
generation. Huh? Devin Cody

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,080
jeep wrangler. Uh, Devin was the kind
of person who would do something stupid.

75
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:17,711
Absolutely.

76
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,340
He was the kind of person who would
pretend to do something stupid to make

77
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,530
people laugh. Well, he wasn't faking it.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,793
MMM.

79
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,230
All right,
so first fireworks fatality,

80
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:32,920
since they legalized
fireworks January 1st, 2012,

81
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:36,420
while he just fucked it up for
the whole state, it's bad enough.

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,750
Everyone's on heroin now you're
going to give them fireworks. I mean,

83
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:45,370
what next does isis get
their own juice store?

84
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,050
Come on,
people.

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Over 80% of bottle rockets are shot out
of people's anuses in this state alone.

86
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,280
This needs to stop.

87
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,270
Woo.

88
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,040
That's going on in main
street right now in Maine.

89
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,320
Okay.

90
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,660
Hi. Do you know me? Of course you don't.

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,860
I'm your regular housewife here in Maine.

92
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,260
My son is on heroin.

93
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,000
My other son shot a
Roman candle up his ass.

94
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,980
I'm sorry to be graphic.
He was trying to shoot it out of his ass.

95
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:30,210
But apparently his excitement.

96
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,540
Okay.

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,840
Who was getting who? I mean,
in order to light the wick,

98
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,220
you gotta be able to see it.

99
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,870
So I don't know how these things
were done when we were kids. We just,

100
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,280
we let them and we ran away. We hid
under a desk. That's what we did.

101
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,380
Devin was a great person.
Um, and in New Jersey,

102
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:55,210
a 52 year old man blew off a large
piece of his leg below the knee.

103
00:05:55,211 --> 00:06:00,010
When he set off a tennis ball size
in Montana,

104
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,230
Montana, Montana, a 32 year old man
was killed. That is billings home.

105
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,190
In a fireworks accident
involving a mortar tube.

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,930
Okay.

107
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,900
All right. At least there was some sort
of mortar round. I mean mortar around.

108
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,760
I mean,
first of all,

109
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:19,270
when you start lighting off shit where
your neighbor starts screaming and

110
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,720
comment, you know what? What do
you think is going to happen?

111
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,250
Okay,

112
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,160
so look up a mortar tube here,
everybody.

113
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,760
I'm learning about fireworks through
the death of my fellow Americans. Um,

114
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,710
I spelt motor.

115
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,923
All right.

116
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,970
Firework, mortar tubes. How
about some images? Let me see.

117
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:42,060
What the fuck these things look like.
Is there some sort of,

118
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,910
all right. All I see is army guys. Yeah,

119
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:53,800
that's not good. You know when, when
the shit you're shooting off. Oh,

120
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:54,670
there we go.

121
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,910
Okay,

122
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,870
well there's one that looks like a little
barber shop thing. What a fucking dope.

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,010
He shot that off his head.
You know what probably happened,

124
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:08,730
I would guess is that there was some sort
of discharge from the bottom end of it

125
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,620
and he concussive force,

126
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,250
but it seems like there was no
Deviney fucking blew his head off.

127
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,400
Know Jesus. Want to where to start.
I had such a wonderful weekend. Um,

128
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,350
I didn't mean this one. I was talking
about funny shit I was just talking about,

129
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:26,430
you know, people, they haven't
Roman candle fights. Come
on, we all did that shit,

130
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,910
right?
That's,

131
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,080
that is the evolution of
all weaponry and all right.

132
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,890
Anything that has an explosive
device, anything that, that, uh,

133
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,120
it's explosive device. Anything that,
that fucking blow shit up. You just,

134
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:46,920
you start or do you anything
that you can shoot at a target?

135
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,780
It always starts simple.
Let's light it off. You know,

136
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,960
let's, let's point it in
that direction at the trees,

137
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,733
right?

138
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,300
And then what? Then you move up to
a, let's torture some insects. Uh,

139
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,240
let's shoot a bird.
And eventually,

140
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,040
because you know,

141
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,530
the way human beings are that we always
try to top one another and we get bored,

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,730
which is the reason why we went from
walking to the horse to the car.

143
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,330
I'm really in deep right now.
I know.

144
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,390
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

145
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,950
Eventually you're going to move to the,
the, the ultimate prey, the human being.

146
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,670
You know,
something that can think the same way.

147
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:33,960
You do something that may have done
better in math than you did. You know,

148
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:37,470
that's the challenge. This
person passed Algebra. I did not.

149
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,570
We're both trying to kill one another is,
you know,

150
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,850
first outside, inside, last,

151
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,780
going to come into play here
when we're out in the woods

152
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,700
are opposite angles being congruent?

153
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,870
Is that going to be the death me or
do I just have that extra something?

154
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,010
Do I want it a little bit more? Am I
able to block out the fifth commandment?

155
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,160
Do I have such a strong
religious background that I
can hear God's voice in my

156
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:14,390
head telling me that I'm
right telling me to deliver?

157
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,470
Okay,

158
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,670
that animal, so he met a man anymore.
It's a fucking animal. Deliver that animal

159
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,160
in the express lane to its maker.
Right?

160
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,280
Do I have that? I mean, it's inevitable.

161
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,670
That's personally why I
don't fuck with fireworks.

162
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,090
I don't fuck with fireworks because I
know that I am scatterbrained and I get

163
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:44,851
bored easily and I have 10,000 fucking
hobbies and eventually lighting it off on

164
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:49,840
the driveway is not going to be
enough for me. Okay. I have neighbors.

165
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,490
I have neighbors that I get along with.

166
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,030
Maybe I'm bored with the fact that I get
along with them. Maybe I want to stop.

167
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:01,140
Maybe some days you just wake up and
you just want to start some shit and you

168
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:05,520
just happen to have some
fireworks that don't just blow up.

169
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,590
They go way up in the air

170
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,260
and you want to shoot
somebody. Right. Okay.

171
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,180
Anyways,
uh,

172
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,920
my condolences to anybody who knows
somebody that died and I don't have any

173
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:21,770
condolences for the people that die
because you're fucking dead and you are

174
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,970
either dead or I think you were in a
better place because someone who's dumb

175
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:30,360
enough to blow themselves up on the
July 4th weekend with their own goddamn

176
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,213
explosives,

177
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I don't think ever had the brains to
really hurt another human being knowingly.

178
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,390
I never knowingly, Lloyd knowingly
hurt another fucking human being.

179
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,360
I mean, honestly, if
you're that fucking stupid,

180
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:47,330
obviously could go out and you
could hurt somebody, but you know,

181
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,090
do you really have the mental
capacity to understand, you know,

182
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:53,924
your actions.

183
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:55,780
Okay.

184
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,300
It's gotta be one of the dumbest
fucking things you could ever do.

185
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,390
Yeah.

186
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,460
Take something of that level.
You know what it is.

187
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:05,090
I really think it's the fucking, while
they don't, there's no video of it.

188
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,050
I was thinking this is the
youtube generation where you know,

189
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,100
everybody's basically on TV is that
fucking skinny blood disease to cont who

190
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:22,810
painted the soup cans and everybody
flipped out over Andy Warhol,

191
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,280
one of the most overrated,

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,590
overrated fucking artists of all
time. All right. I almost said,

193
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm sorry, but I'm not
sorry. I'm not sorry.

194
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,140
That fucking jerk off drugging up people
and banging them in the ass and then

195
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:42,340
fucking drawing a soup can. I mean, if
that's, if that's an artist in your world,

196
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:45,610
then you know what? There's a lot
of artists in prison right now.

197
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,690
They're fucking tasty. Jacquez, you
know, he was the original hipster,

198
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,083
you know,

199
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,560
didn't have the balls to fucking
strike out and do something new.

200
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:08,040
He just sort of mocked it just by the way,

201
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,880
did anybody see the last two
episodes of the comedians?

202
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,323
Ah,

203
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,710
did anybody with Josh
Gad and Billy Crystal,

204
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,620
I fucking love that show.
And uh,

205
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,440
this is a mini spoiler alert.

206
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:29,441
Basically Josh gets caught talking shit
about Billy crystal in his act and uh,

207
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,820
then they still have to do what
they gotta do promos to do.

208
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:39,170
The upcoming is through the fight
that they fucking have is great.

209
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,910
And,
um,

210
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,250
Billy Crystal's character and makes fun
of Joshua's like fucking hipster friends

211
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,880
and such a fucking
just beautiful way,

212
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,900
eloquent way,

213
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,240
and just really sums up that whole when
your creativity is just mocking whatever

214
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,074
exists,

215
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,910
it's such a pussy place to create from
because at some point that's what I

216
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,260
always do whenever I watched somebody,

217
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,800
like even one more time watching
somebody that went on on TV

218
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,430
and they just mark the artist's stand up,
you know,

219
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,350
which on on a certain level was funny,
was basically doing all the,

220
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:21,320
I don't know what is, what is the
word in the industry, the tropes,

221
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,220
the Hacky fucking, you know,
setups and all that type of shit.

222
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,800
Did all of that. But you know, after
a couple minutes it's like, okay,

223
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:32,150
I get it.
I get it.

224
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:35,120
There's some tried and trued fucking
paths that you could walk down and as a

225
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:38,210
comedian, all right, if you
so adept at seeing that shit,

226
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:40,190
why don't you show all of us the new road?

227
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,660
And that's what those hipster cons
never do. They never, they don't cut,

228
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:46,130
they don't carve out any new ground.

229
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,720
They just stomping all over shit that's
already been done, making fun of it.

230
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,320
So I actually, you know, it's weird to
me it's because there's so much of that.

231
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,260
Okay.

232
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,830
During this period of time, you know,
like whenever, in 20 years from now,

233
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,600
when this generations of directors makes
their fast times at Ridgemont high,

234
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,860
they're fucking dazed and confused.
You know what I mean?

235
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,070
Okay.

236
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,200
No,

237
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,330
actually fast times at Ridgemont high
took place in the 80 so that was actually

238
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,490
very current. But I'm
just saying how, you know,

239
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,960
when the nineties to
seventies became the strategy,

240
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,880
can you made fun of all the clothes and
the fucking hairstyles and all that in

241
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:24,120
the two thousands and people made fun of
the 80s and now people kind of mocking

242
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,160
the 90s what are you going to mock now?

243
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,600
People mocking the decades before.
Like that's what people did in this.

244
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,410
There's gotta be something. I know what
that did. I see. What will they do?

245
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:38,460
They'll do a DJ music and being
too hard on this generation.

246
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,870
They got their own stuff.
They get math.

247
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,870
Every generation has to have their
own drug. By the way, you know?

248
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,980
Okay.

249
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,980
And heroin, a little bit old.
Something old, something new.

250
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,520
Something borrowed. Something blue. Right?
So what he did a, they get the math.

251
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,780
That's the new thing, right?
The old things. Heroin,

252
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,550
something borrowed. They're mocking
all this shit and something blew.

253
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,010
That's when they fucking Odie and they
don't have any oxygen in their blood

254
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,740
anymore. Jesus Christ. Bill,

255
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,960
what are you doing poetry over here?
Um,

256
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,881
I'll tell you right now,

257
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:18,050
that was a solid 15 minutes and
15 seconds of absolute horse shit.

258
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,480
And you know what?
You sat there and listened to it.

259
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,180
That's what you're doing today.

260
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,620
Two days after the fucking birthday of
America when we kicked England's ass.

261
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,190
Jesus Christ.
Fucking England.

262
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,760
Isn't it amazing that that
little ass fucking island,

263
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,720
that there was full of so many fucking
evil white people that they could

264
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:45,530
actually actually kind of took over
the world for a while? We're actually,

265
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:48,620
there was way less people.
It wasn't there. You know,

266
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:53,360
most of the places they went
to, you know, they weren't,

267
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,470
uh, they weren't as advanced, right?

268
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,960
This is where a white guy gets in
trouble for saying some racist shit.

269
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,670
You know what I mean?
I'm not trying to say that you know,

270
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:04,880
your boats weren't as good as
their boats. I wasn't there. Okay.

271
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,060
And in a lot of ways,
cultures that were considered primitive,

272
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,030
if we continued to live that way.
I want to ask you,

273
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:13,970
do you think that the planet
would be in the, the, the, the,

274
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,610
the polluted state that it is?
I don't think it would be,

275
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,190
but I'll tell you this right now.
I would already be dead.

276
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,140
I would already be dead,
you know, which for me,

277
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:28,400
selfishly, I'm glad we continued to
advance and pollute the fucking world,

278
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,190
you know?
But that's just a selfish fucking move.

279
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,940
I should, I should have said like, you
know what? I wish it stayed the same.

280
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,090
And I died of a ruptured appendix when
I was 12 years old under a stack of

281
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:47,060
blankets, sweating in a fucking
log cabin, log cabin, too advanced,

282
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,150
too many trees in a hot may not have
the skins of the animals that ate

283
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,540
throughout my life, my life. I
was going say my lives, my life.

284
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,710
I was actually trying to think the,
I was watching something the other day

285
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,080
and uh,

286
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,240
I've been doing this weird thing where
I fucking start to nod off watching TV

287
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:14,600
and then I wake back up, back up again,
and then I start thinking like that.

288
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,670
I just watched that or
did I just dream that?

289
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,740
And then I always do
the math and I was like,

290
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:21,440
that is way too fucked up
to have been on television.

291
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,030
I must have just been dreaming.

292
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,490
And then I never have the presence
of mind to fucking write it down.

293
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,550
You know what I mean?
I'll tell you,

294
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,550
it'd be fucking insane as
we could actually make a
movie that made people feel

295
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:39,230
like they were dreaming. Right.
But you knew you were dreaming,

296
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:43,040
but you couldn't wake up. Am I
describing a coma right now? Am I awake?

297
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,560
Can you guys hear me?
Hear me, hear me? Um,

298
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,920
okay. Closest thing to that would be, I
guess we'd be movies like Jacob's ladder.

299
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,070
Jacob's fought Gandel.

300
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,480
That movie was fucked. That movie's still
great. I watched that the other day.

301
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:05,830
Very underrated movie starring a,
the guy from shark,

302
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,760
Tim Robbins,

303
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,610
the guy he used to be married
to Susan Surandon. Oh, crush.

304
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:13,180
Two names in a row there.

305
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,130
I saw Susan Surandon
recently in a movie with a,

306
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,440
I want to say Melissa McCarthy.
I don't even, I don't remember.

307
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,440
All I know is she was fucking
hilarious. Oh, it was Melissa McCarthy.

308
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,320
She was fucking hilarious.
Fucking hilarious. Um,

309
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,590
it has what's Melissa has always.
So anyways,

310
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,590
speaking of lady luck,

311
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,770
be a lady two night.

312
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,370
Okay,

313
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,280
you won the ladies World Cup.

314
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,350
Okay

315
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,183
baby.

316
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,510
You stuck dead ball and the mother
fucking goal and you won the World Cup for

317
00:18:57,111 --> 00:19:00,810
the first third fucking time though.
Fucking man.

318
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,360
Have any even wanted one.
It isn't fair.

319
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,970
It is not right.

320
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Why do all leave the ladies with the
fucking World Cup while all the guys got

321
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:19,940
their soccer balls on ice? Sorry. Um,

322
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,360
the ladies World Cups.
I actually fucking really got into it.

323
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,660
And by really getting into it,
I kept forgetting it was on,

324
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,900
but whenever I saw it I kept going,
you know what? I'm going to watch this.

325
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,810
I saw Japan versus Australia.

326
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,100
I Japan obviously one that one,

327
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:39,550
cause they played the lady to the file,

328
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,610
you know the fucking women had.
Um,

329
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,140
okay.

330
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,250
The women had what? Three goals in the
first four goals and like the first,

331
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:55,120
I don't know how many minutes,
like five minutes or something like that.

332
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,590
I missed it. Of course I was out. Uh,
what was I do? I was playing drums.

333
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,130
You know what I mean? I was doing that
shit and then he fucking came back.

334
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:04,810
This is what I do.
I look like a fucking eight year old.

335
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,110
I should have died when I was 12.
What am I doing here?

336
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm walking around like a big kid,
you know, I to have a bio shit,

337
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,580
have a fucking pacifier. The way I
live my fucking life. It was, he goes,

338
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:18,760
Weirdo guys, you know, they can't
let go. They fucking childhood.

339
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,030
Remember on Opie and Anthony one time
we were watching these things and they

340
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:25,390
fucking walking around in diapers and
then mothers treats him like a big baby.

341
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,520
Jesus Christ.

342
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,400
Okay.

343
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,340
You know what I mean?
That's the one good thing.

344
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:35,460
If Hitler lived the one good thing,
if Hitler lives,

345
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,940
people who want to be adult babies
would would have been exterminated.

346
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,210
That's the only good thing. That would
be the only time Hitler got it right.

347
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,663
You know what I mean?

348
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,550
That you'd take out child molesters and
all we know beyond a shadow of a doubt

349
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,061
that guilty.

350
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:59,500
You got the guy dead to rights lane
in a fucking play pen playing with the

351
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:03,730
mobile mobile. One of those fucking
things that hang over. You had shell,

352
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,780
Exxon, what do you call those?
Fucking thinks immobile. A Menorah

353
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,480
Menashe. What the fuck is it
called? You know what it is?

354
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,210
The things that hang over and the kids
look at it cause they haven't like a

355
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:20,020
fucking acid trip. Dude. That would be
the ultimate drug. Don't worry ladies,

356
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,880
I'm going to get back to the
women went in the soccer.

357
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,570
I got a lot to say about that. Or football
as they call it, around the world.

358
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,900
That would be the ultimate fucking drug

359
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,500
is if you could take something that
erased temporary temporarily erased

360
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,390
everything you've ever learned in life
and you could go back to being a baby

361
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,960
again. Like the first time it opens its
eyes and you're just staring at a chair.

362
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:48,950
Like what in the fuck is that? Is
that my mother? Is that edible?

363
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,813
I mean,
you know what I mean?

364
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,270
Like cause I heard when baby's
first opened their eyes,

365
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:58,260
it is, it's like an acid trip. When
they're taken in all the colors,

366
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,420
light in every, they don't know what
the fuck. They didn't want that fucking,

367
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,420
they don't want their own hands
are sit there staring at the hand.

368
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:09,110
Can you imagine,
can you imagine the wonderment of that?

369
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,810
That's why, that's why babies need
diapers. Cause there's, there's,

370
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,050
they're on such a trip that you,
if you could fucking do,

371
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,660
then you looked at every no, you
shit yourself. Cause you don't even,

372
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:20,860
you don't even want a toilet is,

373
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,750
yeah,

374
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,010
he'd never been teased for
shitting yourself. You'd
never even smelled the shit.

375
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,840
You have no fucking idea
what it smells like.

376
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,360
You just have to shit and your shit.

377
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,950
Okay?

378
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,450
You know what tie do it nice.
You fucking end zone.

379
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,850
You just bury in threes like Steph curry,

380
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,590
except we hit all of them where he only
missed two out of a hundred but you bury

381
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,770
all of them because you don't know that
it's fucking practically impossible.

382
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,980
Tell you right now, if I was running
a basketball team, might sign a baby.

383
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,270
You know, get him up on his feet.
Just get them up and his feet. Okay?

384
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:02,290
Keep feeding this kid. All right. This
is the new triangle offense. Okay?

385
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,120
We got the fucking baby
right at the point.

386
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:07,620
We're going to keep fit and keep
working it around to him. All right.

387
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,820
[inaudible] kid, kid over
here. Hey. Yeah. Oh yeah.

388
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,960
You just keep launching it.
Everybody under the fucking me.

389
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,190
You just keep fucking throwing up,
right?

390
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,310
Be like when the nuggets decided not to
play defense and they thought that they

391
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:24,940
were going to have the first 200 point
game. What am I talking about now?

392
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:29,090
Fuck you. I got an hour to fill here. I
don't have any fucking advertising copies,

393
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:32,650
so this is just going to be
me just running my fucking
Yap for as long as I can.

394
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,320
Um, all right, so back to the
ladies. The ladies of women's soccer,

395
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,650
the soccer playing human beings
that have the, the, the lady bits.

396
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,010
All right. Um, so they scored four goals.

397
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,600
Of course I missed all the fucking goals.

398
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,410
The only goal and was 41 the only goal
I saw was when Japan all of a sudden cut

399
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,120
it to four to two when I was like,
oh fuck,

400
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:59,150
is this like Nhl hockey were
no lead is safe anymore.

401
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,410
And then the ladies came right back
down and gave Japan the old right there.

402
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:08,120
Fred, they gave me all right
there. Fred Bam. Shut the fuck up.

403
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,253
Go home.

404
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,150
Go home crying because you
just lost all right now.

405
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,080
Okay,

406
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,440
let's look at, yeah, I actually,
the sound into motor sports nerd.

407
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:23,790
I am even a sport that now don't even
admittedly do not even watch or don't

408
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,820
watch it nearly as much as I should
because it is a beautiful sport.

409
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,010
Especially the way that women play it.

410
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,850
I actually prefer women's
soccer to men's soccer.

411
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,650
Why you say over there?
Jolly Old England,

412
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,890
Ireland, a WEF, fucking
Argentina, Brazil, Germany,

413
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,740
all this fucking soccer giants.
Football.

414
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:51,230
I'll tell you why I preferred because
the women don't dive every three seconds

415
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:52,940
crying like a bunch of babies.

416
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,610
Okay?

417
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,000
Like when the women go down,
like they fucking, you know,

418
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,090
they got tripped up and then they,
they look at the ref like,

419
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:05,050
what the fuck you going to call that?
I thought the women play down.

420
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,120
They play a better game. They just play
a better fucking game. I'm sure the men,

421
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:12,080
right? This is a little faster,
fucking blah, blah, blah, blah.

422
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,830
But all the God damn fucking whining and
crying and men's soccer gonna tell you

423
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,950
right now, men's football players,
you gotta be ashamed of yourself.

424
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,210
And that goes for you too.

425
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:24,000
They're fucking Rooney or whatever you
fucking name is there. And Man United.

426
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,100
All right,
look in like fucking,

427
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,270
I don't want to fucking what?
Champs Sport,

428
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:41,160
whatever the fucking characters name is.
Sorry.

429
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,700
All right, let's just fucking
plow ahead here. Yeah. The women,

430
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,400
don't fucking cry be two seconds,
but I will tell you this.

431
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:52,401
What is fucking funny is when they lost
Japan's goalie just started crying.

432
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,880
I mean the defense sucks.
The defense had a total fucking meltdown.

433
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,500
I don't know what the Lady's coach saw,

434
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,580
but whatever it was,

435
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:10,320
they exploited it fucking three
times in the first five minutes.

436
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,760
And the only bad goal was when they
actually shot one from center ice.

437
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:20,460
And uh, the goalie looked like me playing
right field when I was in fourth grade.

438
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,070
Like, oh, it's going to drop
in for a single room. Come
on, come on. Maybe all shit.

439
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:26,904
It's over my head.

440
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,090
Remember that when you totally
misjudged it. Second it hits the bat,

441
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:37,680
you start running in towards the
first baseman and then, I don't know,

442
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,220
and I'll tell within three steps you
do that fucking just immediate stop.

443
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,850
And then all of a sudden your head's back
at a 45 degree angle is that ball just

444
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:49,770
keeps going up over your head.
That's what she did.

445
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,130
And what's funny is she leaped up in
the air with the one hand to try to stop

446
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:58,380
it,
and when it went over ahead head,

447
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:03,381
she just fucking landed on our entire
backside and you could already see her

448
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:07,590
just going fuck.
And in the end of the game,

449
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,390
I guess she felt that she caused her
team the victory, which she didn't.

450
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,750
It was absolutely horrific defense.

451
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,610
She just burst out crying,

452
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,870
which is one of the beautiful things
about being a woman. You know,

453
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:25,200
when you look at a baby,
all right boy or girl,

454
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,650
you know they want something,
you know that's yours,

455
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:32,280
something of value when you take it away
so you can't have that and they want it,

456
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:36,060
they immediately,
or you can just start fucking crying.

457
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,050
They're upset, they don't like
what's happened and they immediately,

458
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:43,860
they just cry it out.
When we can do that,

459
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,060
women can do that and you feel bad
for if a man cries another man,

460
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:55,440
the only thing you can do is just laugh
in their face and tease them until they

461
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:59,490
stopped doing it because it makes you
so fucking uncomfortable as a man.

462
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,270
The only time it's acceptable is when
your friend blows his head off with a

463
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,710
mortar round. Whenever the
fuck he did at a, at a, uh,

464
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,150
you know, and a 4th of
July party. And even then,

465
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,880
okay,

466
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,470
even then,
you know,

467
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,100
you got to shake it off within a
couple of Miller high life there.

468
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,790
Okay.

469
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,800
You know. All right, cliff. He's dead.
Okay. It's not going to bring them back.

470
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,040
We still got all these beers.
What is the difference?

471
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,020
If we'd say it now or in the morning,

472
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,580
he's going to be just as dead in the
morning. We're running out of ice.

473
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,930
We got to finish these sinks. And you're
like, you're right. You're right. Sorry.

474
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,650
Why would he do that? Sorry. Um,

475
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,620
cheeky.
That's the thing about women.

476
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:56,621
They can just fucking cry and we're not
allowed to and it's that combination

477
00:28:56,811 --> 00:29:00,770
that they are allowed to cry out their
pain and we have to hold onto it.

478
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,510
And the fact that they then turn around
and Nag the fucking shit out of us,

479
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,090
that they actually take
10 years off our lives.

480
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,140
Do you realize that if women
died 10 years before men did,

481
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,460
can you imagine how much they
be complaining about that?

482
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,170
How much they would be blaming us for
it? You know, when we say that we die,

483
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:25,250
you know men die 10 years earlier. They
just blame us. Well, you know, you don't,

484
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:29,000
you hold onto your emotions.
You don't go to the doctor.

485
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,670
Yeah. And what about the
current factor? Uh Huh.

486
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,670
Anything there? Can
you, if I'm sweaty, got,

487
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,110
if you turn the fucking tables
and women died average of 10 years

488
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,470
before men did. All right. What color,

489
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,830
what pansy colored uniform with the
NFL players have to wear for an entire

490
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,860
fucking month as they raised awareness,
how much would they be blaming us?

491
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,670
How many movies would Meryl
Streep Win an Oscar for?

492
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:03,290
Playing the woman that was strong enough
to die at the same time as the guy in

493
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,750
her life?
I don't know.

494
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,530
You know what's funny about guys
in the beauty of guys is we still,

495
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:10,610
we don't even give a shit.

496
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,380
We die 10 years sooner than you
do and we don't even give a fuck.

497
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,470
It's the beauty of this
simplistic man brain.

498
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,550
Okay.

499
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,250
Um, anyway, so let's plow ahead here. Uh,

500
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:28,251
so women's World Cup soccer has been
around since 1991 and as of yesterday,

501
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,550
the United States of America,
we've won the most,

502
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,830
we've won three once.
Germany has one too.

503
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,100
I'm spice.
Norway has one,

504
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:49,080
one the death metal capitol of the world.
And Japan has one,

505
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,230
one Japan actually when the last one.

506
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:56,070
So we different the champions.
Alright.

507
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,110
Um, men's World Cup soccer,
there's only been so wait, wait,

508
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:04,440
women's World Cup soccer,
there's only been five, six,

509
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:07,680
seven times it's been played.
All right.

510
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:11,010
This is why I'm finally
gaining respect for this.

511
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:13,800
I always get had respect for the
championship because the entire world does

512
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:17,550
compete, but not only does the whole world
compete, they do it every four years.

513
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,470
So it's really,
it really fucking mean something here.

514
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,770
And all these people around the
world who are going like, yeah, Bill,

515
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:26,670
you'd dumb fucking Yank it. Yeah, it
means something. Well, you know what?

516
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:30,780
Maybe if you guys want a bunch of fucking
girls flopping all over the fucking

517
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:33,360
place and you could actually
pick it up with your hands.

518
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,940
The fuck did,

519
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,270
I don't understand a sport where you
have four fucking limbs and you only

520
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:44,720
allowed to use two of them. Yeah.
Jesus Christ. It's like, it's like,

521
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,060
it's like you're mocking the
handicap the entire time.

522
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm watching the fucking
game. Anyways. Sorry.

523
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,280
So this is only been 20 men's world cups.

524
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,250
All right.
Brazil is one the most at five.

525
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,710
Italy and Germany. You have both one four
and I got to give the nod to Germany.

526
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,330
As much as I love Italians,
the way they dress their food,

527
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,600
they're flashy fucking jewelry.
I'm all about it.

528
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,110
I love Italians and I am fucking German.

529
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,660
I got to give the nod to Germans because
they won their first three with half of

530
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:27,290
fucking country. They won their
first one. Let's let me look this up.

531
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:32,240
Let me make sure that I have this
correct. Um, they won their first one,

532
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,380
I think in 1954.
I mean,

533
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,910
that's literally like,

534
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,530
what is that like about nine Yeoman?
Less than a decade.

535
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,581
Yeah.

536
00:32:44,581 --> 00:32:49,581
They formed their first one in 1954 world
war two ended in 45 46 something like

537
00:32:49,831 --> 00:32:50,664
that.

538
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,170
1944 maybe we'll say 45 what the fuck?

539
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,410
Within nine years of trying to take on
the entire world and losing Dresden and

540
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:05,620
bombs all over the fucking place.
They,

541
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,720
they won a world cup with half
their country, West Germany.

542
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,920
You know what I mean? I'm sure
East Germany was actually in it to

543
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,600
who's getting know Jeremy is just, I mean
that is just a roid factory over there.

544
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,030
1974 they want it.

545
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,410
Okay.

546
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,030
They are, they were on, they were on.

547
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,300
They were doing so many
steroids by 1974 dad,

548
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,690
a lot of people don't know this,

549
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:34,200
that West Germany team
was actually 80% a women.

550
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,420
A lot of people don't know that. East
Germany, east German women, you know,

551
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,200
they were so write it up. They didn't
have to sneak out of the country.

552
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,370
They just stare down the people in the
guard tower and they were just like, Amen.

553
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,430
I don't want any problem,
bro. All you, all, you,

554
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,500
you want me to open that gate for
you? Okay. Um, 1990 they want it.

555
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,790
All right, let's get back to what the
fuck I was talking about here. Uh,

556
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,150
what the hell did it go?
Oh, there we go. Alright.

557
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:07,170
Uruguay as one to Argentina.
Hand at God.

558
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,510
One, two, and then England,
France and Spain have all one one.

559
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,250
And that is it.

560
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,310
It's only been one 20 times
and one, two, three, four,

561
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:23,760
five, six, seven, eight countries.
Only eight countries have one.

562
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,060
So now I feel better that the u s a
men's have never won a fucking world cup.

563
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,580
You know, most people given a shit. It's
like, well how many did you fucking win?

564
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,890
You'd never want it either.
And I love that.

565
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:39,690
I now know who's won it and who hasn't.

566
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:42,090
So I've ever walked into
a soccer sports bar.

567
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,940
I know who I can talk shit to
and who I can't to. What are you?

568
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,390
Huh? You from Brazil. Oh, Chile. Oh, go
fuck yourself. You ever won? Shit either.

569
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,050
What's your big butchy big feather
in your cap that she care? Um,

570
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,640
which makes the women winning three,
all the more impressive,

571
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:00,930
but you got to give it up to Germany.

572
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Germany is the only country that has
won both the men and the worlds in,

573
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,450
in the women's and they've won for men's
and they've won two women and they were

574
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:21,750
only off by one and bolts.
You got to respect to Jesus Christ.

575
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,550
When is Bryant Gumbel real sports going
to be doing a what's in the water,

576
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,140
what's in the water over
there and fucking Germany.

577
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,030
He know why they're not going to do it.
Cause we have a base over there.

578
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,150
We already know what's in the water.
A van of fucking steroids.

579
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,510
I got to tell you, it's amazing, you know,

580
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,900
to watch Germany channel all their hatred
for other races and nationalities and

581
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:54,130
and put it into something more productive
like sports and look at the success

582
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:56,320
that they've had.
You know what I mean?

583
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,880
Bad Burning Passion

584
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,040
to incinerate people that aren't,
that don't look like them.

585
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,240
The fact that we've been sitting on their
fucking chest for the last 60 years,

586
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,340
they've had to to,
to focus that energy in different areas.

587
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,960
And they are dominating the world,
game of soccer, football, whatever,

588
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,710
and look at the cars that they make.
It's incredible.

589
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,540
If you've noticed all the fascist
countries make the greatest cars, Germany,

590
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,310
fuck in Italy.

591
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,670
Who else? Finland. They
don't make good cars.

592
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,810
They make good phones for a minute.
But look at them. Angry birds.

593
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,720
They made those angry birds.
You know what I mean?

594
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,130
Yeah.

595
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,110
All of a sudden they couldn't
exterminate the people.

596
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:49,840
They didn't want to exterminate near
country. What did they do? They said,

597
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:52,390
all right, what, uh, what are we
going to do with all this? Hey,

598
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,440
what do I have to make some phones?
Sorry. Can't do a fucking Finland accent.

599
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,160
Actually,

600
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,060
I give fin when a pass for
being down with the h bomb in a,

601
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,150
in a World War II. I, uh, you know,

602
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,950
what were they supposed to
do? You know what I mean?
This ship was like, all right,

603
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,700
where we are geographically,
you look to the right,

604
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,750
you got Adolph Hitler with beads of sweat.
There's bdis in his fucking eyebrows.

605
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,880
[inaudible] or are you against us? Right?
And on the other side, they got, uh,

606
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,980
eastern Europe's Tom Selleck,
the one and only Joseph Stalin or Yosef,

607
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,180
if you're a history buff,

608
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,220
okay.

609
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,480
Staring you down.
Right?

610
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:40,190
This motherfucker would sacrifice 100,000
Russians every day just so we can have

611
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,040
fresh pineapple juice. I mean, this
guy was a fucking maniac. They will,

612
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,830
they will between
too.

613
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,350
They were stuck between two of the
biggest psychos in the history of,

614
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,650
of in modern history. All right? So
they had to go with self preservation.

615
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,473
All right.

616
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,990
Hitler's style and equally out of
their fucking minds. All right,

617
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,520
so that's a wash and what's
the next thing? All right,

618
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,930
let's go with technology.
German cars. What do we got?

619
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,900
What do we got going on here?
They got their Mercedes Benz,

620
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,570
they got the Duesenberg.
Did they make the Duesenberg?

621
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't know what the fuck they had. They
had fucking, I'm they, you know, they got,

622
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:18,620
they got,
they got a,

623
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,760
they make an eight track tapes over
here fucking 50 years before the gout.

624
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:27,260
40 years, 30 years before the fucking be,
Geez, what are we supposed to do here?

625
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,500
They got real real machines. You go
over to Russia, what do they get?

626
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,520
They got vodka.

627
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,050
They got a God damn fucking made with

628
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,610
a lawnmower engine spitting
out blue smoke. And they,
you know, they got, you know,

629
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,620
they've got those checks with the
fucking lousy to watch. You know,

630
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,170
by the way, Russian women
have really come around, Huh?

631
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,510
Jesus Christ to fucking gorgeous.
Now back in the day during the Cold War,

632
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,430
maybe those are the only
women that they showed us.

633
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,910
They all had those fucking Popeye, the
sailor man. Boop, boop, fucking forearms.

634
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,740
You know what I mean? From throwing
calves over some fucking hill.

635
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:09,980
They weren't supposed to run over. So
whatever. So Finland goes, you know what?

636
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:14,210
Fuck it. We'll go on with
the h bomb, you know, but

637
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,820
we'll have it up.
Boom.

638
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,070
They went with him by
flashlight gas chambers.

639
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,880
They fucking went with this maniac.
What were they supposed to do?

640
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:28,010
They fucking pick the wrong guy.

641
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:33,250
And you know what's funny was Russia
actually attack Finland in Finland,

642
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:37,640
kicked their fucking ass with no help
from the Germans as far as what I

643
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,120
overheard and bars and Finland,
and this is the funny thing,

644
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,010
but they went down with the ship
with the h bomb over there. Right.

645
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,180
They went down with that guy who fucking
pussied out and killed himself in the

646
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:52,700
end.
This fucking broad.

647
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,950
Rather than going out like Saddam
Hussein talking shit is they put the rope

648
00:39:57,951 --> 00:39:58,850
around your neck.

649
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,240
Yeah.

650
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,440
Even people heckling you was still,
he's still add them on their heels. Huh?

651
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,550
For me that's like a,
like when you know,

652
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:12,480
when people bring up comics getting
fucking heckled and that type of shit and

653
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:16,140
people like to watch it, the ultimate
one, like if I was a dictator,

654
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,900
I would be looking at how sit down
was saying when I'll be like this

655
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:23,550
motherfucker here, right there. Right. And
everybody La, what about Hitler? You know,

656
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:26,730
we killed all those people. Like that's
probably be respected with fucking,

657
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:30,210
you know, dictators like that's
how many HBO specials you had.

658
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:33,020
Like how many fucking people
you killed. They, but you know,

659
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,130
all evil people are going like, ah, man,

660
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:38,640
like his fucking amazing numbers
that he had. It's like, yeah,

661
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:41,670
but he went out like a bitch.
You know,

662
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,780
he went out like a bitch just like
Gaddafi went out like a bitch pleading for

663
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:49,860
his fucking life. So now I'm going
to say, walked right up going, yeah,

664
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:54,150
go fuck yourself. Fuck you. I'm going
to come back. I want a hot chill. Right?

665
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,300
He fucking stare at them all down.
He didn't give a fuck standing there,

666
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:04,410
stepped onto that thing. No one at any
second, they could pull the fucking lover.

667
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,840
He wasn't even shaken.

668
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,300
Okay?

669
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,410
He was staring them all down. Go Fuck.
He wasn't even nervous to meet his maker.

670
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,260
It's one of the sickest things
I've ever seen in my life. Um,

671
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,030
what am I talking about?
So they fucking, they beat,

672
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:22,900
they beat the Goddamn Russians, but
because they, they picked the wrong guy.

673
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,930
Okay.

674
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,470
You know what I mean?

675
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,570
That's like when you were in
the wrong division in baseball,

676
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,290
you have like back in the day,
you know,

677
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,160
you'd have a better or I want a pill in
that year when the patriots 11 and five,

678
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,720
but they didn't make the fucking playoffs.
That's what,

679
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:40,310
that's what fucking Finland did.

680
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,400
And they actually had to give up
even though they beat the Russians.

681
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,380
They didn't have that.
They still had to give him some land.

682
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,100
How fucked up is that? Oh, war. All right.

683
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,150
I hope some of that was even just remotely
historically accurate. I have no idea.

684
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:58,070
As long as it's entertaining.
Did it entertain you? All
right. So anyways, I had,

685
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,660
I had an amazing weekend. I
had an amazing weekend. Um,

686
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,750
I uh,
you know,

687
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:09,600
it had some family came in and
for the first time ever I, uh,

688
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,460
I gave a helicopter ride
to some family members.

689
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,980
I went up with the fucking uh,
instructor though, cause I'm on a moron.

690
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,330
But we did this great flight.
We flew out of Long Beach,

691
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,900
we ran around the palace Verdes peninsula.
It's great man.

692
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:25,400
You fly right over the Queen Mary.

693
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,880
And then you go around the peninsula
and then as you go around the peninsula,

694
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,910
that's when you start realizing how
many goddamn things are in the ocean,

695
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:33,230
even though we fucking fished him out.

696
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,580
And we started going along the beach
and I thought they were dolphins and my

697
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:41,390
instructors going, no, those were
actually baby great, great white sharks.

698
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,300
They just haven't reached
the predatory stage yet.

699
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:47,900
And I swear to God there
was like five of them. Um,

700
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,610
and there was one and there's all these
people frolicking in the fucking water.

701
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,290
And there was this one jackass who
had swam beyond where they were.

702
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,090
Um, they were perpendicular to him,
but he was further out into the ocean.

703
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,820
They were closer to the beach.
I hope I'm explaining this correctly.

704
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,110
And he was swimming out to like a bully
like that naked chick in the beginning

705
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:13,970
of jaws. Um, yeah, I
said it a million times.

706
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:16,310
You're out of your fucking mind.
If you swim in the ocean,

707
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:19,160
if you don't believe me,
take a helicopter ride,

708
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,500
have him fly a hundred feet
off the fucking ocean. I
know you're thinking bill,

709
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:23,241
once Jesus Christ.

710
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:27,260
And went the how fucking nuts and they
have a 2100 hour fucking overhaul.

711
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:29,990
It's a brand new helicopter every
2100 hours, go fuck yourself.

712
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,790
What I'm doing is infinitely
more safe. All right. Um,

713
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,170
and then we uh,

714
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,290
made a right turn at the Ferris
wheel on Santa Monica Piers.

715
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,720
We flew over Santa Monica over Beverly
hills right over fucking Aaron de Aaron

716
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:47,810
Spelling Mansion,

717
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:51,710
which is the most ridiculous house
ever built that I can think of.

718
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,420
Do you know that house was so big?

719
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,330
I saw a thing one time they did
it on the Aaron Spelling House.

720
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,390
They actually have a room in there
just for wrapping gifts to have a gift

721
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:05,360
wrapping room. You know
what I mean? To me,

722
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:09,830
I always thought that the people who do
American horror story like that would be

723
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,960
a great place to do one of those things.

724
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:15,440
People that are that level fucking
rich and then somehow the kid,

725
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:20,030
the children and the poor people that put
together all the things that they wrap

726
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,000
in there somehow come and haunt him.
I have no idea,

727
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:26,420
but feel free to send that
to the producers over there
so they can fucking laugh

728
00:44:26,421 --> 00:44:29,000
you out of the Goddamn Room.
Um,

729
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,220
and who doesn't like watching
a fucking rich person

730
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,280
get haunted and die a horrific
death? I mean, it's just fun. I mean,

731
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:38,130
that's a fucking home run right there.
American horror story.

732
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:44,170
You know, you don't have to give me
any money. All I ask is if you use it,

733
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,010
just give the Monday morning podcast
the fucking shout out. That's all.

734
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,210
That's all.

735
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,870
Just have somebody tells somebody else
to go fuck themselves and have them

736
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:57,680
wearing an orange wig and I'll be happy
right there. That'll be enough for me.

737
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,460
Um, all right. Plowing ahead here. Uh,

738
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,630
in the playboy mansion is right to
the left of it. Then we flew up, um,

739
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,960
to the Hollywood sign
over the observatory,

740
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,610
did a lap around dodger stadium
and then my favorite part ever,

741
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,380
we flew up route to bang the
left up and over the hill.

742
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,270
And where is it at?

743
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:26,340
Eight at grand daddy of them all flew
over the fucking rose bowl and then went

744
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:31,200
right back. Took right down,
back down to a long beach. Um,

745
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,670
it was fucking awesome man,

746
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:37,300
but flew in what's called an
our 44 Robinson 44 some day.

747
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,610
You know what I mean? Some day
I want to get one of those. Um,

748
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,080
when I get a little more,
uh,

749
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:47,700
confident and I also have the kind of
money to blow on a fucking helicopter.

750
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,860
I imagine I don't have to drug my
wife on some level. There's a lot of,

751
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,210
there's a lot of,
you know,

752
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,110
variables as a man to buying a helicopter.

753
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:02,210
Like the amount of fucking money and and

754
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,300
hand is, they sit on Seinfeld,
the amount of hand that you,

755
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,450
you got to have hand in a relationship
that you'd have to have to fucking

756
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:14,590
justify buying a helicopter when you
really have nowhere to go in the thing.

757
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,530
So anyways,

758
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,380
don't get a used one on fucking
craigslist. Damn. Things are awesome.

759
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,390
Um, all right. So guess what?

760
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,890
Last night was my last cigar and my list.

761
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,640
I'm taking a booze break. Old Billy
clean cakes is back in the house.

762
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,560
I got a nice round white
belly from, uh, you know,

763
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,060
grilling,
drinking.

764
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,090
I had a great fucking weekend
and I mad my own grill man,

765
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:49,960
my own Grill Aza. Man Does. Even if you
don't know how to do it, even if you're,

766
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:50,270
you,

767
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:55,270
you risk giving the people at your party
eat Kolai it doesn't make a difference.

768
00:46:55,901 --> 00:47:00,550
You are a man and you fucking
human your own goddamn grill.

769
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,650
Um, I, I kept it simple.

770
00:47:02,651 --> 00:47:07,651
I've just made burgers and hot dogs and
what's fucking amazing is we got this

771
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:10,270
butcher,
um,

772
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,690
in the next neighborhood over
from us and they make their own.

773
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:14,740
Okay,

774
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,640
you can order homemade
hamburger buns and hot dog buns.

775
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:22,270
They made us like the hot dog buns.
They came in like a,

776
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,510
it looked like ribs except
they will hot dog buns.

777
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:28,540
And you had to cut them to separate them
and then cut them again to make them,

778
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:31,290
you know, to them. So you put
the hot dog in. It was fuck,

779
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,450
I felt like it was like the 1920s
assumption, you know what I mean?

780
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,620
Everything was homemade and boy,
oh boy, was it refreshing. Um,

781
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,350
so anyways, uh, let's get to, let's
get to some of the questions here,

782
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,370
um, for this week. Yes. So I am,

783
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:53,020
I am announcing it on the
fucking podcast because uh,

784
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,860
that I am not drinking or smoking or
anything like that, so I will stick.

785
00:47:56,861 --> 00:47:58,820
So you guys will hold me to it so,

786
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:01,840
and I don't have to hang my head in shame
next week and tell you that I fucked

787
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:06,070
up. All right, so, oh, here
we go. I finally got my
advertising here for this week.

788
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:09,640
It was a little bit late.
Um, all right, here we go.

789

heard me talking about them for years now.

793
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,320
Do I got to break it down for you again?
Obviously I do. Their razors are amazing.

794
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:36,250
It's more convenient and cost a
fraction of the price. All right,

795
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:37,390
here's how the club works.

796
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:42,391
You go to dollar shave club.com and
pick one of their three great razors.

00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:59,890
If you like Brad Mash and you can grow
a beard in between periods back in the

801
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,500

like a hot dog that's been overcooked.

838
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,820
That's little right before,

848

00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:20,830
count them three mentally challenged kids.

And what?

937
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:27,340
You have my permission to use the word
whenever you want to describe idiots that

938
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,400
you show. I don't want permission.
I don't want to use the word.

939
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:32,440
I don't want to hurt people.
Okay?

940
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:37,441
But I reserve the right to every once in
a while if I flip out and I dropped the

941
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:42,070
fucking word in a moment of anger cause
I'm standing there in front of a fucking

942
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:46,090
drunk who won't shut up, I still
expect you to give me shit about it.

943
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,720
But just accept my apology and know that
I don't have anything against mentally

944
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:53,560
challenged people. I just was pissed
at this person and I made a mistake.

945
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,480
That's all I'm asking. I'm not
asking for a license to use the word.

946
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:02,170
I don't want to use it. Jesus. Alright.

Not a grain.

951
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,170

954
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:36,160
Um, oh, that's great. I'll have to
let her know that Orzo is a pasta.

955
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,600
Pasta shape is pasta. Oh, Jesus Christ.

961
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,673
You know what?

962
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,760
Anybody who listens to this podcast
has gotta be at least as dumb as I am.

963
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:10,840
Let me fucking look this up.
Maybe they're right or zo

apostasy gig. You got it.

965
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:20,080
You got to think it's true.
Orzo.

966
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:23,660
It's Italian for Bali from the Latin.
Also.

967
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:27,560
Risoni is a form of shortcut pasta shape,

968
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:32,561
like a large grain of rice or as
oh can be served alone as a soup,

969
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:37,870
a coup Trumbull as part of a salad
or Pilaf or Geo Vestey or Bacon,

970
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,970
a castle role, which she invests the,

don't want go to Greece right now. Hey,

974
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,840
I didn't, I didn't even see
how the fuck did they vote.

975
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,410
They vote to fucking let
them. They're there. God Damn.

976
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,550
Banks just fail.
That's what they should do.

977
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,320
They should just let
everything fail and then,

978
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,020
then everybody's money isn't worth shit.
And then you know something,

979
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:12,110
those bankers got to come out in public
and then you fucking stab them in the

980
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:15,970
gut. Like that dude at the
beginning of Scarface, right?

981
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,990
Leading gap lay band, gap, uh,

Greece. Vote. Let's see what,
come on, man. Come on Greece.

983
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:27,921

resilient after no vote.

985
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,920
Uh, and we always plus
the out. We always pussy.

986
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:41,480
Everybody always ends up pussy
and out. You know, something.

987
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,350
Only fucking Iceland has had the balls
to stand up to their fucking bankers.

988
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,870
And you know what? I hope I'm
wrong about that. And if I am,

989
01:00:47,871 --> 01:00:52,840
please tell me who else has. All right,
no idea where to start. Dear Mr Burr,

990
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,160
I'm a 16 year old high school,

991
01:00:55,161 --> 01:01:00,161
junior from a rural town in Mississippi
just to good old bar they ever made in

992
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:07,430
no hall getting the conferred or red flag,

993
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:12,431
birthday cake every fuck and see x months
because his parents are too dumb to

994
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:17,690
know what a year is.
You're not even 16, Buddy.

995
01:01:17,691 --> 01:01:20,300
You're really fucking a sorry.

996
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:23,260
That was totally stereotypical and
I shouldn't have done that. Um,

997
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:27,080
now that I'm nearing my final year of
high school and will soon be having to

998
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:28,850
decide where to go to college,

999
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,210
I realized I have no idea what
I want to do with my life.

1000
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,420
The only two things I have interest
in his writing and standup comedy,

1001
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,880
unless those are two phenomenal things
you can make a hell of a living.

1002
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,300
I flunked everything in high school.
Uh,

1003
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:43,580
but here's a few places from where I live,

1004
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:47,390
but there's a few places from where I
live where I could do something like an

1005
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:52,190
open mic and Jesus Christ. But you know
some that should inspire you right here,

1006
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,810
right here.
How awful.

1007
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,800
I am at reading out loud yet I've been
able to do something in this business.

1008
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,060
You know what I mean?
I'm able to make a living and,

1009
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:06,070
and I can put frosted mini wheats
on the table for my family of one.

1010
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:10,430
I'm the only two things I am
interested in is running standpoint,

1011
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,480
but there's few places from where I live
where I could do something like an open

1012
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:19,070
mic or get honest opinions on my
comedic writing. I'm writing to ask,

1013
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:21,890
in your opinion,
would be a great town for starting,

1014
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:24,890
for starting convenient to start.
Uh,

1015
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:27,690
also if you think someone can
juggle college in a standup,

1016
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:31,160
do you think someone can juggle
a stand up in a car, a college,

1017
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:32,000
in a standup career?

1018
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,120
I would truly be grateful for your
advice and also go fuck yourself.

1019
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,520
I'm all right.

1020
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:42,310
Any place is a good place to start.
Just start. If there's an open mic,

1021
01:02:42,311 --> 01:02:46,800
I would drive
as long as I had to drive to go to it.

1022
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:52,260
Um, let's see. You're in
Mississippi. All right. What do I,

1023
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,460
what do I know about down there?
I mean,

1024
01:02:56,461 --> 01:03:01,290
the closest thing that I
know of from Mississippi,

1025
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:05,100
Atlanta and Nashville, uh, Texas.

1026
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,740
Houston was always a great comedy town.

1027
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:11,220
I don't know what the open mic
scene is like. If anybody, anybody,

1028
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:14,250
any comedians out there
starting out and even buddy,

1029
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:16,890
anything going on in Alabama,
what's going on in Mississippi,

1030
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,560
right in give this kid some fucking
advice. Uh, tweet me about it.

1031
01:03:22,561 --> 01:03:23,400
I'll retweet it.

1032
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,250
That's the easiest way to do it because
we might not see your emails because we

1033
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:30,000
get a bunch of them. So just tweet
me about it. And, uh, you know,

1034
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,660
at Bill Burr on Twitter and if you got
some good advice, I will retweet it.

1035
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:38,950
Um, can you juggle college
and a standup career? Yeah,

1036
01:03:38,951 --> 01:03:42,640
absolutely. Absolutely. Um,

1037
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,580
you can do whatever you want to do in
life, dude. You can do whatever you want.

1038
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:51,190
That's the one fucking thing.
Everybody, you know, you know,

1039
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,320
cause people want to make it,

1040
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:55,820
they try to look at what is working
for the most people and then they,

1041
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,420
they get locked into that.
I,

1042
01:03:57,421 --> 01:04:01,800
that's the biggest advice I can give
you is do not get locked in to what

1043
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:05,580
everybody else is doing. Get locked into
what's going on in your fucking chest,

1044
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,610
whatever that thing saying like do
this unless they say and to shoot your

1045
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,290
neighbors. Don't do that. But if it's,

1046
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:13,830
you're doing something that's not going
to hurt somebody, like writing jokes,

1047
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:18,390
telling them, writing a script. Yeah, you
can do whatever the fuck you want to do.

1048
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:22,110
And the fact that you're 16 and you're
already are listening to yourself,

1049
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:24,420
you're way ahead of the game. So, um,

1050
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,550
and you have the intelligence to
understand that, you know, hey,

1051
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:32,700
I need some help and you reached
out for it. Keep doing that,

1052
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:38,280
my friend and I hope to see out there.
Give it a shot, you know. But I would,

1053
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:42,690
I would, I'd write five minutes is shit
tonight and then sign up for an open mic

1054
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:45,900
somewhere and within the
week I would start do it.

1055
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:50,130
And that's unbelievable balls to be able
to do that as 16 it took me almost a 24

1056
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:53,730
to get the balls to do it. So my
hat is off to you sir. Or ma'am,

1057
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:58,140
I don't know who you are. All right, here
we go. Girlfriend has prejudice parents,

1058
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,520
a Billy Billy dingleberry. I am a
white man who was dating a black woman.

1059
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,430
She is the greatest thing that has ever
happened to me and there's no doubt in

1060
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:08,160
my mind that I want to spend
my life with her. Well,

1061
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:11,390
congratulations until now.
Don't done.

1062
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:16,320
We'd been dating for 10 months then I
finally met her parents this past weekend.

1063
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:19,110
When I got there,
seemed shocked by my skin color,

1064
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:23,760
almost like my girl hadn't even
hinted to them that I was white. Well,

1065
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:27,360
that's probably what happened
if they are fucking racist. Um,

1066
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,190
the whole dinner was very awkward.

1067
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:33,030
I wasn't being looked at in the eye
and I was left out of most of the

1068
01:05:33,031 --> 01:05:33,960
conversation.

1069
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:39,450
Then they make a movie about this Ashton
Kutcher in the late great Bernie Mac.

1070
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,680
I even tried talking to her dad about
music since we are both musicians,

1071
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,810
but he just kept giving me short answers.

1072
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:49,020
Like he didn't give a fuck
after the whole thing was over.

1073
01:05:49,021 --> 01:05:52,950
My girlfriend said that they
didn't like that I was white. Uh,

1074
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:57,540
she said that they wanted her to have
strong black babies and not to dilute the

1075
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,490
bloodline
also.

1076
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:03,990
Uh,

1077
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:07,620
they sprouted a bunch of other shit about
how much trouble will run into as an

1078
01:06:07,621 --> 01:06:11,760
interracial couple. It has been four days
and we still haven't talked about it,

1079
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,330
nor is she told her parents off
for being prejudice assholes.

1080
01:06:15,331 --> 01:06:18,750
I truly believe this is the only
situation where a white person can fully

1081
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:22,290
understand what a black person go. I
don't know about that. Dewayne you get,

1082
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:24,480
you get, you get a little
sprinkling of it. Uh,

1083
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:28,500
a black guy with the microphone on the
street corner can call me cracker all he

1084
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:32,730
wants and I won't lose a wink of
sleep over. But when you told, uh,

1085
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:34,710
the person you love is wrong and invalid,

1086
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,700
that's like a kick in the balls anyways.
How should I go about addressing this?

1087
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:43,020
I'm assuming you didn't run to this
problem with Nia. No, I didn't make,

1088
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:47,670
maybe she could weigh in on this as well
anyway. Thanks and go fuck yourself.

1089
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,820
Uh, Jesus. Um, I would
say if you love her,

1090
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:56,760
I would stay with her.
If, if you questioning it,

1091
01:06:56,761 --> 01:06:59,900
I pull the rip cord cause that's
just going to be a fucking nightmare.

1092
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,810
That'll end up being a nightmare.
You know what I mean?

1093
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,770
You gonna be going to be in a relationship
where you're waiting for the other

1094
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:09,010
person's parents to die.
Sitting there going like one down

1095
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:15,400
today. You know, that's just the
fucked up. You know, you really,

1096
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:17,820
when you're going to get
married is you have to, uh,

1097
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:19,200
okay.

1098
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,830
I Dunno. I mean, who are the fuck am
I to say I waited so God damn long.

1099
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:27,770
So I'm not an authority.
But you know, if you,

1100
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,920
if you're with somebody that's fun,
you know,

1101
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:35,970
and they come from a good family and
their family supportive of you guys.

1102
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:39,060
I mean that's so much of the battle
actually, you know, something,

1103
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:42,190
this past week when I was in
Vegas, somebody came up to
me, said, hey bill, I want,

1104
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:45,120
let me, I got to ask you a
question. Who makes you laugh?

1105
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,140
And without even thinking,

1106
01:07:46,141 --> 01:07:49,560
I said my wife and it made me feel really
good like that. It's quite, you know,

1107
01:07:49,561 --> 01:07:53,790
my wife saw hot shit. She makes
me laugh, we have a good time. Um,

1108
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,670
and uh,
so I don't know,

1109
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,890
she might not be bringing it up because
she's embarrassed about it or whatnot.

1110
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:06,080
Um, I have no idea. But uh,

1111
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,310
okay.

1112
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:12,090
I mean that's going to be a hell of a
fucking situation if that's how they're

1113
01:08:12,091 --> 01:08:15,040
going to view their grandkids.
I mean, that's kind of a,

1114
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,580
that that's a major fucking
situation where I would at least

1115
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,140
want to see where her head is at.

1116
01:08:25,141 --> 01:08:28,770
And then you throw out certain
scenarios about the future.

1117
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:33,720
So how are we going to handle this?
And Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Um,

1118
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,470
you know what?
I'm sorry you're going through that dude,

1119
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:40,230
but you definitely need to have some
fucking conversations. I would think.

1120
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,940
I would definitely think
some conversations that were
in the order. All Right,

1121
01:08:44,941 --> 01:08:49,770
Collin Farrel movies.
He, Billy Redskin, uh,

1122
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:54,490
Colin Farrell has done a couple of great
movies since phone booth. You should, uh,

1123
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:59,040
you should like, namely in Bruges, Bruges.

1124
01:08:59,160 --> 01:08:59,993
I don't know how to say it.

1125
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:04,710
And seven psychopaths with the
always excellent Sam Rockwell.

1126
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:09,630
Oh, Jesus Christ. I got to
c seven s seven psychos.

1127
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,460
Seventh Psychopath. I got to see that. Um,

1128
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:18,930
you could give, you could
give them a look. All right.

1129
01:09:18,931 --> 01:09:22,170
Coming to California next
year from Ireland on holiday.

1130
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:27,590
Hope to see you in action.
All right, well, I hope you
make it out to a show. Oh,

1131
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:32,520
right. Said, I got hit with
a wave of fucking tired.

1132
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,010
