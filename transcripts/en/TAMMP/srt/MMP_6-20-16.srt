1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,520
Hey, what's going on? His Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:05,970
And it's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:10,230
June 20th,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:14,770
How are you, how are
you doing? You Collins?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,220
Um, she noticed sounds a little weird. Uh,
I'm in a hotel in Baltimore, Baltimore,

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,550
Baltimore.
Um,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
I can't say that because I've watched
Scarface so many fucking times.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,720
I can't watch, I can't say Baltimore
without picture and fucking, you know,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,200
Tony Month is that fucking
ac coming back on again.

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,150
How many fucking times I got to
hit off. Ah, Jesus fucking Christ

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,630
is a fucking button on here. Literally
just says off off. There we go off.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,820
Shut off. Please shut off.
Thank you. Fuck Sakes.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,420
I'm sorry. Um, anyways,
so believe it or not,

14
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:59,220
I'm doing this because I'm flying back
to La as you're listening to this and I'm

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,660
so sad to say, I haven't watched
the fucking NBA finals yet,

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,400
but, um, I do promise you if Cleveland
wins that I will do something. Uh,

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,470
I got to do something special as
something. Um, because WHO's kitten? Oh,

18
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:18,150
the warriors already want it,
right? If they repeat, fuck. Sorry,

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,600
I held it too closely. If they repeat,
then it's going to be like, all right,

20
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,950
can they three pizza next year?

21
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:26,730
I feel like is their big thing so that
they can go down with all the teams that

22
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:30,810
have won three in a row. So this year
is sorta like, you know, you know,

23
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,900
it's not as exciting. I'm sure
warrior fans who I don't give a fuck.

24
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,120
I'd love to see Lebron do it.
You know,

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,370
after everybody gave him
shit for the way he left,

26
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:43,150
which they should have because like I
said, he gave everybody fucking, you know,

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,260
sports blue balls. Like maybe
I'll go here, maybe I'll go there.

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,960
Who wants to buy me a drink?
Yeah,

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,280
he was being very conty and then he
went to fucking Miami. Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,610
What the fuck happened to her? I got
have the TV not on in the background.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,400
Okay,

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
good Lord. Getting old as the
worst. I just saw some woman,

33
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,090
she had her fucking head.

34
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you ever see like when a dog
gets confused and cocks her head,

35
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,220
like your head was just like that? Um,
what is that called? What is that from?

36
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:15,090
How do you avoid that as if fucking
alternate neca exercises you can do on the

37
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:17,370
other side of your fucking head.
So that doesn't happen to you.

38
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:18,770
Okay.

39
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,650
It's so fucking weird. Why? Why
can't you just like, you know,

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,030
why can't death just be like the old
right there for it? You don't, I mean,

41
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:32,031
why does it have to be just like this
slow fucking descension into like God

42
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:37,270
knows what the older I get,
the more frightening that
is. When you were younger,

43
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:40,360
you just like, Jesus, that old
fuck what happened to them and me,

44
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:44,770
I'm looking at it now go like, you know,
in the next 20 fucking years, you know,

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,130
I better start eating better.
Jesus Christ.

46
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,510
I'm off the rails and my fucking day.

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,160
Does anything make you feel fatter than
eating room service in your bed in a

48
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,470
fucking hope.
Just eating and yet in a bed in general,

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,280
not that makes you feel fatter
than eating in a bed. You know,

50
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,640
just fucking sitting there getting crumbs
and your sheets and shit and you're

51
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:08,290
trying to scrape it off onto the floor.
You just feel like a fucking animal.

52
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,220
You like laying on you. I was like,
literally on my side. I'm in Maryland,

53
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,810
so I get some sort of crab cake sandwich.

54
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,990
Of course it's sucked because I got to
the hotel instead of the spot to get it

55
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:20,050
at right. And I'm on my fucking
side and I'm eating the fries.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm literally sitting there like
that fucking lifeguard, you know,

57
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,560
when he got shit faced and he was eating
the burger and everybody laughed at him.

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,700
Hasselhoff, everybody was laughing at
him. Like it was fucking nuts to me.

59
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,220
It's like, like, dude, you never did that.

60
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,520
You never just been laying on your full
floor, hammered eating a fucking burger.

61
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:41,320
You should try it.
Sometimes the food is delicious.

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,150
It takes it to a whole other level.

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,310
You're so fucking psyched
and so appreciative of the
God damn food, you know,

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,420
if he want. So I advocate everybody doing
that this week. Get fucking hammered.

65
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,370
Order a burger,
lay on your floor.

66
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Just start talking shit in
honor of father's Day while
your daughter films you.

67
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:04,150
And I think that's, I think
that's the way to go. Um,

68
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,120
people already texted me, you
watch the game anyway, tonight.

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,650
Now I'm fucking working. Actually somebody
tweeted at me going, what the f what?

70
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,830
What's with your agent? Why to,
how would your agent book a show?

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,560
You know, when this game seven of
the NBA finals, it's like, hey,

72
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:24,340
stupid. Like it's not like
we booked it after game six,

73
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,750
six been on the books for months. We
had no fucking idea. I didn't know.

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,220
So, um, anyways, uh,

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,550
I really want to see a, I love the
warriors man, by the way. You know,

76
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,880
I have no beef with those guys,
but it's just as a sports fan when,

77
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,960
I don't know if the dog in the fight,

78
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,280
it would just be great to see the Brown
after all the Shitty God and all those

79
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:49,330
sad sack Cleveland fans burned his
Jersey standing there and they're fucking

80
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,540
cargo shorts, right? Burden the Jersey.

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,440
What people filmed it so fucking stupid.
That is so stupid.

82
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:59,500
And I'm not singling out
Cleveland Cavalier fans,

83
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,020
but when people just take
sports to that level,

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,200
like when Lane Kiffin left
fucking Tennessee and there
was that one guy going,

85
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,400
let me tell you something,

86
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,710
you fucking piece of shit and link care
for and you're going to fucking leave

87
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:15,880
here. You're going to leave
here. Like Tana sees it. Uh, uh,

88
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,510
we ain't no stepping stone to USC.
We were booking,

89
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,460
we were fucking destination skill.

90
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:25,020
This is what I think book
and lean bird can key up and,

91
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,530
and I don't know what he had.

92
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,880
He had some lane Kiffin something or
like a program and he fucking peed on it.

93
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,250
A grown man filmed themselves paying
on that program. It's like toad.

94
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,250
Someday you're going to have kids.
The fuck is wrong with you. Well,

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,920
I'll give birth by a fucking kid.
It,

96
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,160
I'm right there at their little
dicks out paying right with me.

97
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,380
I don't take it to that
fucking level or whatever.

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,340
So I always thought it was stupid.
You know,

99
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,710
this is something like
really like medieval about
like is it looks like you're

100
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,510
at a book burning or something when
you sit in there burning a jersey,

101
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,031
you know what I mean?
It's like,

102
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,440
is Jesus is going to come down
the street with this cross neck?

103
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,860
Next thing he'd start yelling,
crucify him. It's, you know,

104
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,560
at the end of the fucking day,
who you know, who gives a shit?

105
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,600
If you at the fucking options,
Cleveland fans, all right?

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,710
Of staying and miserable downtown
Cleveland with all those miserable fucking

107
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,000
fans are going to Miami beach with some
of the hottest fucking ass that has ever

108
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,870
been fucking grace the earth.
You know?

109
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,740
Beautiful fucking weather, right?
You buy a hurricane proof house.

110
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,060
I don't know what the
fuck that looks like,

111
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,510
but God knows if anybody had the money,
it'd be a fucking professional athlete,

112
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,180
you know? Of course you would go
down there. You want a couple, two,

113
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,650
three. What? He went three down there,

114
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,730
I four or five [inaudible] six finals in
a row and he'd come back to Cleveland.

115
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:50,650
All right,
you fucking Snowden conch.

116
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,670
And we go and I'm going to say I'm going
to go bigger on this one right now.

117
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,510
I say if Lebron,

118
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,220
if Lebron fucking leads the Cleveland
Cavaliers to the championship tonight,

119
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:12,960
tonight, tonight, gave seven,
seven, seven, seven years. Um,

120
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,700
in my mind he passed his Coby Brian. All
right, I'm just pausing right now. Oh,

121
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:22,520
what the fuck everybody's going to
say all that shit. I just feel like a,

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,500
the level of leadership
that he would have to show

123
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,920
in order to do that.
You know what I mean?

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,640
Compared to the teams that Coby played
on where he had all this fucking help.

125
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,893
You know what I mean?

126
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,740
Cause I feel like Lebron's already done
the Cobi Championship where you piled on

127
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,210
with Shaq and all that fucking shit.

128
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,070
He went down there with Dwayne
Wade and all those guys,

129
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,350
but to go to the middle of fucking
nowhere as far as sports goes and lead a

130
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,120
fucking sad sack,

131
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:52,570
fucking city said sex city out of,

132
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,060
out of the fucking they're cursed.

133
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,800
Lack of championships is,

134
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,680
is a way bigger accomplishment than
any than any of copis five that he had.

135
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,710
You know,
my big beef with him is he,

136
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:10,711
if Phil Jackson wasn't the coach and he
didn't have major free agents signings

137
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,280
there, they immediately became a 500 team
with Colby score and 40 points a night.

138
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,510
You know, just being like, well,
I got my stats, you guys suck.

139
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,050
And then he just would walk
off the court. I don't know. I,

140
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,630
I would in my sports mine,
my unathletic comedic sports mind,

141
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,310
I put that with like,

142
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,790
just watching like the Pistons walking
off the court when the fucking bowls

143
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,391
finally beat him.

144
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:38,170
Those out of was just something fucking
wrong about that walk in off the fucking

145
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:41,360
court when he fucking share.
Um,

146
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,110
um, did she have a walk off the court
that she walk off a battleship ever when,

147
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,810
when she didn't think the sound was
right? I have no fucking idea. Anyways,

148
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm plowing ahead here. Um, had an
amazing fucking time. I did a Newark,

149
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:03,050
New Jersey, um, performance ad,
Santa, whatever the hell they called.

150
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:03,900
They had some great shows.

151
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,150
And then last night I played
this some fucking place in, um,

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,830
I don't know why. I don't know the
names on this run. Um, hang on a second.

153
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,040
Typing in the password.
One fucking word letter at a time.

154
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,470
I played this place last night and it
was the same venue where Mike Tyson

155
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:27,390
knocked out fucking, uh,
Michael Spinks. Now granted,

156
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,460
you know,
the way they sat it when he had zonked,

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,370
I sold the same amount of
tickets, believe me. Um,

158
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,930
they can see it in all these different
ways. So they sat it more for comedy show,

159
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:39,930
but when he fucking did it, it was like
right now a turtle Gadi fought there.

160
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,910
All these amazing boxing
matches, uh, had had been there.

161
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:49,080
And if you went in there, man, I
literally felt like I was in citizen Kane.

162
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,450
I got to get you guys in the
name of this fucking place.

163
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,250
One of the more amazing places
I've ever gotten to walk into.

164
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:56,370
We had this old fucking,
um,

165
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,660
it's old organ there and shit is,

166
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:03,340
it could still going to be on my website
or not. Ah, for Fuck Sakes, Bill,

167
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,660
Bill, er, ah,

168
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,290
just go build a fucking dope
Phenix city. Let's see. Let's see.

169
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:18,150
Let's see. There's something
ballroom come and get fence.

170
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,260
You know, you fucking cow fucking, it
just disappears. It's unbelievable.

171
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:26,080
You get kicked in the balls at
fucking lives forever on the Internet.

172
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,230
Fucking one goddamn day later. I
can't find it. Whatever. Well, Anik,

173
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,530
I'll tell you, if you ever want to make
a zillion dollars in Atlantic city,

174
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,650
opened up a tattoo removal,
fuck a tattoo removal store,

175
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,280
whatever you called service Jesus Christ.

176
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,580
Those were some of the worst fucking
tattoos I've ever seen in my life.

177
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,120
What the fuck is the name of the venue?
You can't,

178
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,860
this is what I do and
I can't figure it out.

179
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:57,600
Just start landing city boardwalk hall.
And um,

180
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,520
actually, you know, my, my back has been
way better, but just riding in a car,

181
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:05,520
I don't know what it is. It just
fucks with my leg. I get this,

182
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:09,600
the nerve starts acting up again,
but I'm like 85% of the way back.

183
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,950
I'm really psyched. So, um,

184
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,830
I didn't want to deal with driving that
two hour thing down the turnpike. So,

185
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:20,550
uh,
I actually for once blue,

186
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,680
a little bit of cash and uh,

187
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,900
I took a helicopter ride down from the
fucking west side of Manhattan Down to

188
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:31,380
Atlantic City was the shit.
I flew on an a star. Um,

189
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,540
I've got to sit up
right next to the pilot.

190
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,550
I didn't get one of the seats in the back,
which was cool.

191
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,620
I bought a ticket and piled on this thing.

192
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,710
Some other people going down
there and I'm so fucking shit man.

193
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,320
He came out like I was always
terrified of being like, Oh man,

194
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,770
I don't know if I would want to fly.
I still wouldn't,

195
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:52,920
I would never fly around
Manhattan without uh, in its,

196
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,710
cause it's just so much fucking traffic
but you just go out over the Hudson and

197
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,020
just like you're driving down the street,
you just get on the right side.

198
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,260
I couldn't look over and see his gauges
to see what altitude we were flying out.

199
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,150
We went right down the
Hudson River and um,

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,710
by the freedom tower and all that stuff.
And then we got to the other side.

201
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,070
Now the other side, we've got
the south side and this, um,

202
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,060
you know the statue of Liberty's
right there, Ellis island,

203
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,720
and then we went right over the Verrazano
Bridge and there's no way to fucking

204
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:27,520
go over that thing and not think of
fucking Saturday night fever. You know,

205
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,580
when that fucking Guy Bobby,
whatever his fucking name is,

206
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:34,770
tries to do the head stay looking at
me. I'm like, you guys, I look at me,

207
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:37,910
they're like, Bobby,
don't fucking do it by me.

208
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,120
And Him and his ball,
he has to suit,

209
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,180
just go all the way down
to the fucking bottom.

210
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,590
Man is fucking fucking unbelieve.
I'm at that fucking scene.

211
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:51,780
Scared the shit out of me when
I was a kid, but now you know,

212
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,740
just him as his fucking Afro and
just fucking big call. You know,

213
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,350
it's almost like if he went in head first,

214
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:02,080
he would have been fine or actually
maybe it would absorb too much water and

215
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,420
he'd hit the bottom. I have no idea.
But anyways, when we went over that,

216
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,550
then we went over Red Bank,
New Jersey,

217
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,000
made a right and went right down
the coast. Went by Asbury Park.

218
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:14,350
So the forking Jersey shore.
And it actually made me think like,

219
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:17,920
I can't believe I never went to
either one of those places. Um,

220
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,610
went down to Atlantic City and then we,
uh,

221
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,870
had a great time down there and tonight
I'm in Baltimore, so that's basically it.

222
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,030
But a fuck an underrated,
underrated being in Manhattan,

223
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,410
blowing a little bit of cash,

224
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,160
piling onto a fucking helicopter with a
few other fucking passengers get in the

225
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:38,150
last seat and fucking flying
by that amazing skyline, man.

226
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,760
It was the shit.
It was the shit.

227
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:43,790
And I finally got to
ride in an a star and a,

228
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,580
it was way less intimidating than
he thought it was going to be.

229
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:49,180
I thought when I looked at the cockpit,
all the gauges and everything branded,

230
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:53,170
they were analog. I don't like that
digital shit. I fucking hate that stuff.

231
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,800
I don't trust it. I don't like
it. I'm not a technology guy.

232
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,410
I like when everything looks
like a fucking weird clock,

233
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,010
then I feel like I can read it. I don't,
I don't like all that, that type of shit.

234
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:07,360
So, um, anyway, so many
minutes away up to here,

235
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,200
I would do the advertising and they
just don't know if it's come in yet. Um,

236
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,490
let's see if we got anything.
Nothing. So anyways, as always,

237
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,680
as I've been trying to mention here
so I can support my fellow comics, um,

238
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,110
if you liked this podcast or stuff like
this or maybe you're sick of it and

239
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:26,330
you'd like to listen to
another one. Uh, we have,

240
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,650
I feel the best collection
of 'em of podcasts on of
any other podcast network at

241
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:38,750
the all things comedy network. We

Esparza's what's up fool podcasts?

243

fucking sports with the balls.

244
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:52,070
We got Dean del Rey's let,
let there be Doug. Stan.

245
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,710
Hope this is murder is fucking row here.

246
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,680
Bunch of other fucking people on here.

got all kinds of stuff there. So, uh,

250
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,740
um, let me click on a few of these
here so I can give some shout outs.

251
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,870
Ari Shaffir skeptic tank. Um,
it's a great website and a,

252
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,830
we just got some investors on it,
which is great.

253
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,020
So we're going to start having
some more original content,

254
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,970
which is why I'm trying to
drive some traffic there.

255
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,670
It'd be a good fucking team player.
Okay.

256
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,320
So after I do my show here tonight
and beautiful fucking Baltimore,

257
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,730
Baltimore, um, I'm flying,
this is my fucking day.

258
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:39,170
I'm flying out to la.

259
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,270
I go right into the writer's
room and after that I'm doing a,

260
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,750
I'm doing a benefit that's really
important to me. Um, great friend of mine,

261
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:48,411
Bobby Slayton,

262
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:52,010
unfortunately his wife passed away
a few months ago and we're doing a,

263
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:57,011
a benefit and memory of her at the Saban
theater and a Beverly hills and uh,

264
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,170
the fucking lineups.
Ridiculous.

265
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:04,930
Arsenio Hall is hosting and there's a
few other up and coming comics you might

266
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:09,410
have heard of. Like, I dunno, Ray
Romano, Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz,

267
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,270
Brian Regan,
Bob Saget,

268
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,530
and I'll be a fucking
pulling up the rear there, a

269
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,450
low man on the totem pole and that
show would definitely be me. Um,

270
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm a huge fan of all of those guys,

271
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,710
so I can't believe I'm going
to get to work with them. Um,

272
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:29,000
unfortunately it's not the greatest
reasons why we're doing it, but um,

273
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,470
we love Bobby and um, it's a great
benefit. There are a few tickets left.

274
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,410
It's going to be a crazy show and I have
a feeling all those guys are going to

275
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:40,160
be fucking with each other cause they
known each other for so long and a,

276
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:44,600
I want to be like beyond a fan
boy that night. And then, uh,

277
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,420
then after that I go home and then
I go right on a fucking plane.

278
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:51,800
I have to go back to New York because a
got to work with some actors to do some

279
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:56,600
voiceovers. We're up to episode eight.
Everybody. No recording episodes. Seven.

280
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,360
Huh?
Dog Days of summer.

281
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,440
We'll come around but coming
around so fucking psyched.

282
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,350
We're up to episode seven. We're going to
do the table reef episode, April accord,

283
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,510
the table, uh, the fucking episode. Um,

284
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,830
uh, next week. Hey, you know, I just
realized, you know, be cool if there's,

285
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,700
if one of you guys out there
want it to come to a table read,

286
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:23,900
I got to figure out how to do a, uh,
some sort of contest or something.

287
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:28,490
Maybe bringing in for episode
10, whenever we record that. Uh,

288
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,770
I don't know why the fuck I never
thought to do that. You know, it's funny,

289
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,860
I don't even invite my wife to him.
I'm so busy like pouring over the script,

290
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:38,600
making sure, you know, I don't fuck up
the jokes at the table read, but um,

291
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,730
you know what, I'm going to
figure out how to do that and I'm,

292
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,100
I'm promising you right now, by next
Thursday. Yeah, Thursday podcast.

293
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,000
We'll have something set up for that.
I think that'd be a really cool,

294
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,720
if you're into the show, if you're not
into the show, then you probably be like,

295
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,810
well, hey bill, maybe I just want to go
get a fucking cheese stick or some shit.

296
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,490
Cheese, steak, sorry. Anyways, let me, uh,

297
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,110
what else do I want to talk about here?

298
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,510
This is usually where I do
the fucking advertising. I
guess I can't this week. Um,

299
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,830
okay.

300
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,330
Oh,
formula one racing,

301
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,340
how the European Grand Prix over there.
Um,

302
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,280
I actually didn't get a chance to watch
that because I stayed out too late,

303
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:21,720
but I did tape it. But
spoiler alert, spoiler alert,

304
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,140
a Nico Rosberg fucking Nico,

305
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,990
Nico Rosberg, he won his fifth fucking
race, right? One, two, three, four, five.

306
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:34,150
He's won five of them. He's
the points leader. He's a,

307
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,120
he's with the German team.

308
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,210
Okay.

309
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,690
And he's just funny. Ross
Park, you know what I mean?

310
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,020
It's about time they fucking made up
for it. Had a Jewish guy drive for them,

311
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
you know, um, I don't even know
if he's Jewish or anything,

312
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,760
but he also drives from Mercedes.

313
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:52,360
So I always root for Germany
and Mercedes because, uh,

314
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,500
I've never done a background check, but
I think I'm mostly German just based on,

315
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,500
uh, what my parents have told me. Um,

316
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,780
but oh my God,
I saw the pictures of it too,

317
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:04,820
just driving through this
beautiful fucking city.

318
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,110
I don't know where the fuck I been for
so goddamn long when it comes to Formula

319
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:12,590
One. Now of course me, cause I'm a psycho.
Somebody told me about the fucking,

320
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,810
you know, the basically the former
formula one of motorcycle racing. Um,

321
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,400
I don't know why I'm not watching that.

322
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,630
I sit there and I flip out where I love
all these fucking crazy contact sports.

323
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,110
Right. You know, I like
rugby, Australian rules,

324
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:30,920
football and this fucking Mad Max shift
that people been showing me lately where

325
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:34,640
it's sort of rugby sort of soccer and
after somebody scores you can punch him in

326
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:39,440
the face. I don't know what the
fuck that is. It's like football,

327
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:44,090
soccer, rugby in bullying all
at the same fucking time, man.

328
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,970
It's just, I dunno about
that. Sports you don't,

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,660
you don't think it was missing was just
to have a couple of bowls run in there

330
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,930
and just start fucking trampling people.
Um,

331
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,780
okay.

332
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,670
But anyways, uh, let me
shut this fucking TV off.

333
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:02,560
This is really fucking with my brain here.
Um,

334
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,500
I don't know why if I liked
all that type of shit.

335
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:09,430
Why watching somebody ride a
motorcycle 200 fucking miles an hour.

336
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,780
Um, it's absolutely, and you know,

337
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:16,580
it is amazing to me is these guys
are so good that when they go down,

338
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:20,390
they don't die somehow. You think they,
I mean, not saying people don't die,

339
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:24,320
but you'd think they would die every
fucking time. You know what I mean?

340
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,300
Okay.

341
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,610
The fact that you can wear a fucking suit

342
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,480
that is so God damn strong,

343
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:35,920
you to go 200 miles an hour and you could
fall off your fucking bike and it just

344
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:40,921
doesn't like what should happen there
is like after fucking two seconds of

345
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:46,990
skidding on the asphalt at 200 miles
an hour immediately you should just see

346
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,450
guy's ass. His bear has, should be there.

347
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:53,830
And then you just see it looks like steak
and then it would look like bones and

348
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,960
then that would just be it
and the guy would be dead.

349
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,730
You would think that that
would happen every time.

350
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,470
And these fucking guys just slide in
these goddamn soaps there were incredible.

351
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,910
Not saying people don't
die. But um, I think, um,

352
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,000
I think this is sort of my next thing
man. Cause like, you know what's funny,

353
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:14,680
this time of year when hockey ends and
basketball ends, everybody a football fan,

354
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,030
you know, Pixie the hockey or
hoop for the most part. All right,

355
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:21,580
very few go hockey and
then wait and go baseball.

356
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:26,050
I only know a couple guys like that. So
people go hockey or fucking hoop and um,

357
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,200
people who watch hockey don't
watch who people watch hoop,

358
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,320
don't fucking watch hockey. They have
nothing in common with each other.

359
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,230
And the only thing that they have in
common with each other other than their

360
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:40,060
love of football is the sheer fucking
panic of the day after the game.

361
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:44,290
Seven or your final or your finals when
that's over and you're like, holy fuck,

362
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,290
what am I going to do now for the next
two and a half fucking months is I wait

363
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,030
for the NFL regular season to start.

364
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:54,550
And I'm not shitting on
baseball cause I love baseball.

365
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,530
I just that that the fucking dog
days of summer, I can't stand like,

366
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,600
you know who the fuck wants
to go out to the ballpark?

367
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,010
It's like fucking a hundred degrees
out. You know, who does die hearts,

368
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,850
I guess I'm not a die hard baseball fan,
but I love it. I love it in uh, October.

369
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:13,900
So I needed a sport and Formula One dude,

370
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:16,330
I'm telling you like the race today was,

371
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:18,490
it was only like something
like 50 something laps.

372
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,720
You can really just sit down and they bang
it out in a couple of hours. You know,

373
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:25,720
you get to learn about other
fucking cities, you know,

374
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,570
half of them they go to you like,
oh shit, I'd like to go there.

375
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,560
It all those people hanging out,
calling it right now.

376
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,040
At some point I'm going to hit a fucking
country when they have a formula one

377
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,390
race is actually one here.
It says,

378
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:41,350
the United States says United States
Grand Prix for the life of me,

379
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,090
I think it's an Austin,
Texas,

380
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,960
which is really disappointing to me that
that's where they're going to fucking

381
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:50,590
have it. You know what I mean? Why
the fuck is it in Austin, Texas?

382
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,690
They should have that
thing in like Chicago,

383
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,200
Chicago should have a
Formula One fucking race.

384
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:59,260
That's a cool ass fucking city,
you know,

385
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,260
fucking zipping over the rivers at
one point. Only one car could make it,

386
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,540
they'd probably kill each other.
Um,

387
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,680
I don't even know what the track
looks like in Austin, but um,

388
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,220
all I know is Austin is a great city.
Once you're in it,

389
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,910
trying to get to it with that fucking
traffic is an absolute God damn nightmare.

390
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,620
So, um, anyways, I guess this is a
place here where I would actually pause,

391
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,600
right? And I would do some
sort of advertising. Um,

392
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,210
I'm just going to say this so
I can edit it in later. Uh,

393
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,950
we're going to pause here right now.
The little bit of that advertising,

394
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:36,040
where the fuck is my reads?
Come on,

395
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,750
give me the reeds gave me the reeds. Ah,
you can't. All right. But you know what?

396
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,480
It doesn't matter you guys because this
is not going to be in real time for

397
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:46,490
yourself. Oh my God. Is this podcast suck?

398
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:51,330
As bad as it sounds in my fucking
head right now. Um, you know,

399
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,040
is going to say about Baltimore. Every
time I go to the Baltic, Baltimore,

400
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,910
the Baltimore, I always think about
the wire and I was going to go,

401
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:01,210
I remember the wire and then I was going
to go boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,

402
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,830
which is for Lauren order. I can't even
remember how the fucking song went.

403
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,400
I just remember the song in the end,

404
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,020
the guy was screaming
up and as you can tell,

405
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm kind of losing my fucking voice with
the voiceover shit and screaming about

406
00:24:13,861 --> 00:24:17,040
my deck here on stage. Um, but
you know what I'm psyched about.

407
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,980
He's my fucking act as coming together
and I'm getting ready to do another

408
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:20,401
special,

409
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:23,790
I think I'm going to do it in October
and all I gotta do is just get through

410
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,820
these last three fucking episodes.
Okay.

411
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,960
Give 100% on that shit and then that's it.
Then all of a sudden it's,

412
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,160
it's old Billy fucking flank
steak. Remember when I said
I wasn't going to drink?

413
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,960
You know, I fucked up on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

414
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,100
Okay. But I was great Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday, right.

415
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,760
So when I get back, I'm going
back to not drink it. I gotta,

416
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:51,990
I gotta get back off this, but I just, I
dunno what happened, you know, I fucking,

417
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,230
uh, I don't want to happen. You
know what I mean? What happened?

418
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:57,510
I went on the fucking road.
That's what happened.

419
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,060
And I went to New York and I met up
with some fucking friends and like, Hey,

420
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:03,060
let's go to this fucking
bar. And then, you know, it's
like one of these wine bars,

421
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,710
you know, so you don't feel like you're
drinking. So I showed up, you know,

422
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,220
another buddy of mine, it's fucking
comic. I'm not going to say,

423
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:13,140
I don't want to name any names,
but this guy's fucking hilarious.

424
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:17,730
And he comes in and it was hilly verse,
he called him out.

425
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:22,390
He just goes like, cause he showed
up and uh, I know what you're saying,

426
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:23,710
but why did you go to a wine bar?

427
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:27,400
Because there were ladies there and
that's what they fucking picked, right?

428
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,870
So like,
I will fucking go there.

429
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,070
So he shows up and I immediately go,
dude,

430
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,340
it's a wine bar. I don't, cause
he wanted a beer and a shot and I,

431
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,710
his face fucking dropped in first.
He called out,

432
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,290
he goes through the level of
fucking disappointment on your face.

433
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,100
And then we find out that they
had beer and they did have a shot,

434
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:49,870
but it was just, you know, this foofy
place. So the dude goes, uh, they go,

435
00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:52,600
can't get some drink. He goes, yeah,
can I just get a, a, a bud light?

436
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,920
And the guy's like, ah,
yeah, no, we don't, we don't
have bud light. Uh, we have,

437
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,230
we have a blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, whatever the fuck it is,

438
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:03,390
some Italian beer. And he goes,
guys, like, Oh, what? And he's like,

439
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,020
have a Bob on the ball, but he
just goes, is, is, is that a beer?

440
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,070
And the guy goes, yeah. And he goes, all
right, I'll have one of those. And, uh,

441
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:12,731
I don't know what happened.

442
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:14,860
And we started doing Tequila
shots in the whole fucking thing.

443
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:18,750
Went off the rails, and I'm a fat fuck.
And I all like myself right now there.

444
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,560
I said it a fucking in a hotel, Roman
Baltimore eating French fries in bed.

445
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,020
Huh? Like some fucking, I don't know,

446
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:30,230
somebody whose dreams didn't come true.
That's who we just,

447
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:34,730
French fries in bed or maybe people who
fucking everything worked out for him

448
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:37,880
and then just so fucking bored.
They, you know, like Marlon Brando,

449
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,780
whatever the fuck his issue was. Oh,
I've won every award that exists.

450
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,360
Bring me a fucking elk.

451
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:47,340
Said he just sat in bed just non on the
fucking antlers for like 10 years and

452
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:51,900
all of a sudden, you know,
he's ready to do the fucking,

453
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,060
what is it? What the fuck? Gorilla
monsoon movie. I have bio pic. I have no,

454
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,260
I don't know how those things work.
I don't pretend to fucking know. Um,

455
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:01,981
so anyways,

456
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:06,940
we're going to pause here for a
little bit of advertising the floor.

457
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:08,670
We come back with a
Monday morning podcast.

458
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Okay. And we're back.
Um, so I figured, forget,

459
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,190
I'll take me a good fucking three
minutes to read those constantly.

460
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:21,210
Maybe five minutes or whatever. Send me
is I can get to the, I can get to the, uh,

461
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:24,590
the questions right now. Can I, I think
I can't, don't get too close to them.

462
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:29,370
Like bill second, you fucking s exhale.
It all goes off the fucking rails.

463
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,880
Um, all right, here we go.

464
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,950
All right, advice first. You know,
some kind of fucking Ireland,

465
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,440
some cutting island gave me
shit about the ticket prices.

466
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,840
I think that's a little bit too much. I
think you're funny. It's like, hey dude,

467
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,070
how about the fact I'm flying from
the other side of the fucking world?

468
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,250
Almost Santee your fucking doorstep.
That's not enough for you.

469
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,890
Who's going to pay for all that fuel?
Um, all right, here we go. Advice for,

470
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,370
for a daft Scotsman. Hey
there, you're redheaded con.

471
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,050
Uh,

472
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,050
I cannot fucking wait to go back to
Scotland are lit and all these fucking

473
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,700
places,
these miserable conscious,

474
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:13,410
some of the funniest people you'll
ever going to meet. All right. He says,

475
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:17,370
I'm 26 year old guy from near Glasgow,
Scotland.

476
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,290
Um,
for quite a while I was in a bit of a Rut,

477
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:26,310
but eventually I managed to pick myself
out of it and decided to do something

478
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:27,540
that I've always wanted to do.

479
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,650
I took a big step and decided to buy
a ticket to a festival in Chicago.

480
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,020
I was the Shit I love Chicago,

481
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,970
said I booked my flights and I'll be in
the city for a week. That's tremendous.

482
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:44,190
So basically my question is as I'll be
traveling alone and we'll be staying

483
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:44,970
alone,

484
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,970
how easy is it to just hang around and
strike up conversations with complete

485
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,600
strangers in a different country?

486
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,310
Have you ever found difficulties in
finding common ground in conversation with

487
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:58,350
people from different countries?
Also,

488
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:03,351
any full pause I should avoid when talking
to Americans so I can prevent getting

489
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:06,990
my cunt kicked in. All the
best you fat shaming, Prick.

490
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,190
Um, all right. So a lot
of questions there. Um,

491
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,860
yeah,

492
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,490
well the only time I ever traveled
is when I, I, I'm doing stand up.

493
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,150
And then after the show there's always
people that just saw you do a show.

494
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:25,010
So I've already broken the ice.
But, um, first things first,

495
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:29,420
why don't I tell you a couple of places
to go to from my little fucking places

496
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:34,100
to go, thing that I have in my fucking
phone that my wife used to make fun of.

497
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,120
She made fun and places to go and she
was laughing and then, you know what?

498
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,060
We went to one of those fucking places
and then all of sudden, you know,

499
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,750
she's just, she has total faith in it
now she tells me, hit it. All right,

500
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,620
here's what I would go.

501
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,210
All right if you like a nice fucking a
great fucking bar for music and that type

502
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,370
of thing, I'd go to the Liar's club. Um,

503
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,240
if you like cigars is a place,
big cigar pouring them,

504
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,230
check that fucking place up.
And then as far as food and all that shit,

505
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:09,700
I would just tweet about it because
a, I'm not a big fan of, of,

506
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,360
of deep dish pizza. You know what
I mean? I just don't understand it.

507
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,700
I don't understand deep dish patient
pizza the way I don't understand why white

508
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:21,970
coffee and tea have to be so fucking hot.
You know what I mean?

509
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,110
I went, so it gets to the fucking,
the tea bag all in the water maybe.

510
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,430
Is that what the fuck it is?
I just don't understand.

511
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:34,450
But you have to wait like an hour before
you can drink it without scalding your

512
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:38,350
fucking mouth. And when it comes to
deep dish pizza, it's, it's just,

513
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:41,940
it's just too fucking much,
you know?

514
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:46,020
And he can't just get a slice of it that
they bring the fucking thing over. It's,

515
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,350
it's like, hey, you want
some lasagna? Yeah, but not a
whole fucking tray, you know?

516
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,960
Um,
but you should definitely try it.

517
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,590
If you get one that actually has a
really good crust, it is pretty amazing.

518
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:02,400
But it's just like, I mean,
you can literally split one
piece with somebody else.

519
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,510
It's so fucking big. And, uh, my
wife said the funniest shit about it.

520
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:09,690
She called it an abomination.
She goes,

521
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:14,100
it's the ultimate expression
of American gluttony. She goes,

522
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:18,000
go to Italy, you won't see anything,
anything over there like it.

523
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,430
And it's true. But we went to
Italy, you know, they have like,

524
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:26,880
we have all our American versions of
their dishes, you know what I mean?

525
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,140
But there's no deep dip, deep,
deep dish pizza in Italy,

526
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,970
at least not in any place.
We went to enrollment.

527
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:37,680
It's the only place I've been to. But you
don't see it. Uh, that's what she said.

528
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:42,610
And she goes, you know why? Because
it's an abomination. Um, so anyways, uh,

529
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,040
as far as I found in that,
that Liar's club, uh, people
were fucking cool as hell.

530
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,530
If you're into the music and
shit, it's a good time. But Dude,

531
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,930
you're going to be coming
over with the fucking accent.

532
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,860
I wouldn't go to the fucking,
you know, I, you know,

533
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,270
it depends on what you
went to. I would go to, uh,

534
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,510
a place where this going to
be a bunch of beautiful women.

535
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,830
That's what I would do it. And then you
go over there and he just fucking, just,

536
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:09,400
just start talking and I think you'll
be in the fucking game and there'll be,

537
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:11,950
who'd you come over here with?
Vr Guy came over by myself.

538
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:14,980
I want to always wanted to come
to Chicago and just literally,

539
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,480
you know how hall watching,
what do you fucking Berge do?

540
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,640
Whatever the of a fuck you guys talk,
right?

541
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,920
Who the fuck you fuck you
do over here for fun? Yes.

542
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:30,230
Garrett wearing could write whatever the
fuck you going to say and they're going

543
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:34,790
to love it. They're going to love it.
Even if you ask him, hey for fucking Shag,

544
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,700
any however the fuck you say
fucking and your country,

545
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,030
it's going to seem so cool.
Them, it's so different.

546
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,570
And then also they're going to be
more adventurous because you know,

547
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,360
you're the stories leaving
with you when you go back,

548
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,990
when you fly back to Scotland.
Um,

549
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,110
how can you avoid getting
your head kicked in? Um,

550
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,950
don't do what everybody else from other
countries do is you come here and you

551
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:02,810
criticize the United States
and talk about how dumb we are,

552
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,880
how fat we are, how awful the
foreign policy is, how uh,

553
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,820
our football players are
pussies cause they wear pads.

554
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,660
Why do you call it football? All of
that dumb shit. You know what I mean?

555
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,640
It's so fucking obnoxious,

556
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,773
you know?

557
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,190
You know why it's obnoxious because they,

558
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,470
those kinds of people always come
here and they act like these.

559
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,910
There are these worldly
traveled people, you know, oh,

560
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,980
I come from here and I come from there
and we can do this and we can do that.

561
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:32,950
And it's just like, well, in
all of that fucking travel,

562
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,760
you never learned to be on
your best behavior when he
come to somebody's country

563
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:38,110
and you don't come in and insulted.

564
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,440
So you make your whole country look
like a bunch of fucking snobby cons.

565
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,320
You never learned that one.
I am.

566
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm on my best fucking behavior
when I go to a different country.

567
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,870
I'm not saying I'll go out
and get fucking hammered,

568
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,110
but like I don't go there and shit on it.

569
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,913
You know,

570
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,820
some of these places I go to,
I'm fucking talking to people.

571
00:33:57,821 --> 00:34:00,670
I know this place is nice. There was
that. Why the fuck did you come here?

572
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,520
We, I was looking, I was in
Oslo, Norway. I said, you know,

573
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,770
you guys were, thanks. Slide you guys,
but great. I'll definitely be back.

574
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:16,580
It's somebody yelled out why?
It just struck. I was like, why?

575
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:20,920
What do you mean? Why? Why the fuck
wouldn't I, it's fucking beautiful.

576
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,330
I don't know. Anyway, so I
would avoid doing that. Um,

577
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,870
and then just everything else is common
sense. You know, somebody, you know,

578
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,080
looking like a psycho, just fucking leave
him alone. But I don't know dude. I,

579
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:36,100
I mean I judge a lot of
Scotland on that movie.

580
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,690
Trainspotting or I just feel like I don't
go into any bars with is an upper deck

581
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:43,300
to it. Cause I just feel
like there's going to be that
guy up there that's going,

582
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,710
just finish his fucking pint,
just throw the glass over his head,

583
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,590
cut open some woman's face.
Like I just, you know,

584
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,260
if it's even remotely
like that over there,

585
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:55,630
I think you're going to
be fine in Chicago. Um,

586
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,190
I would definitely try to go to a cubs
game. Uh, no offense to white sox fans,

587
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:03,280
but you know, you guys all know that
you fucking stadium stinks. You know,

588
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:07,180
it stinks. It's the only time I ever
saw a stadium, a new stadium built,

589
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,480
and they admitted so quickly like, wow,
we really fucked this up. Let's try it.

590
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,840
Like it was like a botch nose job. You
know what I mean? Like your stadium is,

591
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,680
is the fucking stadium version of like,
you know,

592
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,420
when some Hollywood chick or somebody,

593
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,020
they get too much work done on their face
and people, oh my God, what happened?

594
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,480
That's what you did do with that
stadium. They're like, well,

595
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,520
let's wait till it settles. Let's see
what happens. You know? All right,

596
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,920
so there you go. But Dude, you
picked a great fucking city to go to.

597
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,540
Chicago is the shit and then you picked
a great time of the year to go there. Um,

598
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,840
I will tell you the traffic is fucking
horrific, so just get ready for that.

599
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,400
But once you're in it, it's
fucking phenomenal. Um, all right,

600
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,830
what do we go here? All
right, uh, dear Billy,

601
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:50,400
stretchy pants on your
podcast sometime back,

602
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,290
you were talking about someone getting
with someone else and one of the people

603
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,830
gaining a bunch of weight. Oh yeah.
When you start dating somebody,

604
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,730
how it's not fair to the other person
for you to then put on a bunch of fucking

605
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:07,650
weight. Um, unless you're a woman, you
having a baby that's obviously, you know,

606
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,530
I'm not a fucking animal here,
but I'm just saying, you know,

607
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,700
after you have the kid, you know,
that's, that's when you know,

608
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,390
after your wife has a kid too, things
should happen. This is what you do.

609
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,110
You get a little bassinet
for the beautiful baby and
then the second thing you

610
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:25,890
do is you get an elliptical for your wife,

611
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:27,450
but so she doesn't get mad at you.

612
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:32,250
What you do is you get her initials
engraved on the side of it in plastic.

613
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:35,640
Of course. Totally kidding. All right. Um,

614
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,730
I was already a few weeks into whipping
myself back into shape. Uh, okay.

615
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:43,950
Let me just start this over again cause
I've even forgot what the fuck he's

616
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,784
talking about.

617
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,090
On Your podcast sometimes
back you sometime back you
were talking about someone

618
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:50,940
getting with someone else and one of
the people gaining a bunch of weight.

619
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,940
I was already a few weeks into
whipping myself back into shape,

620
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:58,380
but this really helped me solidify my
will. Well, that's fucking great, man.

621
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,250
It's great.
I wish she can you help me because I,

622
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,860
you know what's sitting in a
fucking writer's room is like,

623
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,010
I eat there like the way I
eat on the road. I mean, I,

624
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:12,180
it's just fucking hard to try to eat
healthy. It's just, you're just bored.

625
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,730
You're freaking out. You're locked in
the fucking room and you're like, oh,

626
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,740
I'm going to eat some
fucking candy for no reason.

627
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,010
I'm sitting there everyday like, it's
Halloween and I'm fucking seven years old.

628
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:21,380
I got to stop.
All right.

629
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:26,010
It made me think that I should really
give my lady the respect of maintaining

630
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:30,930
something close to the body I had when
she got on this train. Uh, she loves me.

631
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:35,250
She stayed with me in spite of the
lumpy beanbag chair I have become,

632
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,210
and now I'm 15 pounds down
with a bunch more to go,

633
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,100
but I am back on my routine.

634
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:44,190
Four or five trips to the gym
at five 30 in the morning. Dude,

635
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:48,360
you're fucking killing it. That's
great. And Calorie counting as well.

636
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,100
I know exactly what to do. It's just
the time. Now my question is this,

637
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,080
how do you deal with it if you're lady
wants you to eat the same stuff she is or

638
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:03,060
wants to go to a shitty fried food
restaurant. Anyways, thanks man.

639
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,170
Hope season two of F is for family is
coming along. Well. It is. Thank you sir.

640
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,190
Can't wait to see it. And I loved
your last show in Austin. Hurry back.

641
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:12,630
Can come during the football season.

642
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,490
We had a monster fucking recruiting
class this year. Thanks you bastard.

643
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,650
Oh that's great man. You
could, longhorn should be good.

644
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,380
So the legendary a college program
there. All right. Um, all right.

645
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,790
How do you deal with, I would just say
I want to just, that's easy as easy.

646
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,020
Just sit down with her and
just say, hey listen, you know,

647
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,930
when you got with me,

648
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,150
I was however years old and I w I weighed
this much and I don't think it's fair

649
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,210
for me to have put on all
this fucking weight, you know?

650
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,880
And they'd be looking like a lumpy
beanbag chair, like you said.

651
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,620
So I'm really trying to get myself
back into shape. So I was wondering if,

652
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,120
you know, you know, if you want to eat
something that's a little, uh, unhealthy,

653
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,140
is there any way we just can go to a
place that has healthy options for me?

654
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,120
All right.
Because a,

655
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:04,360
I don't want to look bad for you
and I also don't want to die early,

656
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:06,580
so you're fucking,
you know,

657
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,500
in your forties and 50s having to put
lipstick on and get the fuck back out

658
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:14,230
there again and try to meet somebody
who works down at Sears, you know?

659
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:15,400
And I don't,
I don't want to do that to you.

660
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,700
I'd like to be here for the long haul
there. There's no fucking way she,

661
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,270
she'll give you shit about that, that,
that's a very easy thing to have happen,

662
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:25,290
you know? And then also, I think,
sorry, I'm looking at the timer.

663
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,020
I also think that she would
be happy to hear that you,

664
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,930
you weren't just doing this
for some vein reason yourself,

665
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,730
that you would actually
also doing it for her.

666
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:36,480
I think that that would be pretty
cool. Now, watch now watch.

667
00:39:36,481 --> 00:39:40,310
He'll fucking getting some big
fucking fight. You know, I,

668
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,140
you think the thing I eat bad.
She say I'm fat.

669
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,840
You know, she blows her sales manager.
All right. Read this. Okay. All right.

670
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:52,030
I'm going to read this.
Relax. Uh, what's up dickhead?

671
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,000
Let's go fucking bro and
can't wait for next season.

672
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,510
I just moved to wildly
mediocre Los Angeles.

673
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,970
Uh,
well yeah,

674
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:04,550
that's what you're going to feel like
cause you just fucking move there. Um,

675
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,700
but if you stay open minded,

676
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,090
which is really difficult
for east coast people to do.

677
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,190
I did that the first time I came to la.

678
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,420
I went to La and I tried to do Boston
New York Shit. And then when I couldn't,

679
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,380
I was like, oh, there's police spoken.
Sucks. It doesn't, it's fucking amazing.

680
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,551
Beautiful women.

681
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:25,180
Some of the best food you ever going
to have so much outdoor activity.

682
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,810
Just fucking embrace it.
Stop trying to be the fucking Boston guy.

683
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,200
You're not on a reality shelf. All right.
Take it down a few fucking notches.

684
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,550
Nobody gives a fuck in Los Angeles that
you don't like it. Everybody just thinks,

685
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:39,490
well then go back to fucking Boston.
Go back to Philly.

686
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:42,070
Wherever the fuck you're from.
If it's so fucking great.

687
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,190
Why did you accept a job
out here? All right, sorry,

688
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,870
I'm just heading you off for
the past before you come.

689
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:51,871
Another cont shitting on fucking la and
he said I worked for the UFC editing

690
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:54,130
fight highlights.
Uh,

691
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,690
thanks for keeping me entertained
with your semi literate babble babble.

692
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:02,380
Bullshit. Day after day. This is
like a classic East Coast Guy.

693
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:04,540
He really likes me and likes what I,
what I do,

694
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,510
but he just can't get himself to say
it cause his dad never hugged him.

695
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,090
So I'm not taking any of
this personally anyway.

696
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,940
My girlfriend is about to
move here to meet me. Uh,

697
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,470
she had to stay behind when I
moved because she's a teacher.

698
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,660
Needed to finish out the school
year. Uh, we get along great.

699
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:22,420
I trust her and she treats me
better than I deserve. However,

700
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,240
sometimes I can't take how
ditzy she can be. Uh, uh,

701
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,580
starting to pull some threads.

702
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:32,230
Here she is successful and very book
smart but sometimes lacks common sense.

703
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,430
I find feeling embarrassed when she says
some stupid shit in front of my friends

704
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,910
or parents. It's kind of a hard
thing to discuss with her though.

705
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:43,850
You know what Shit, what
the fuck should I do? Also,

706
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,580
I'm coming to your show at
the same theater this Monday.

707
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,680
I'm looking forward to it,
so don't blow it.

708
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,850
Well I appreciate you coming out to
that. Like I said, it was, you know,

709
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,780
a really good friend of mine
and for a great cause. Uh,

710
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,930
so thank you for doing that.
All right,

711
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,170
well here's the deal dude.

712
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,190
You either have to accept the fact that
she can be a little ditsy or you have to

713
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:09,900
come to the realization that you're dating
a fucking dope and you got to get rid

714
00:42:09,901 --> 00:42:13,320
of her. It's one of the other, um,

715
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,150
I mean, look, she doesn't sound
like she's 100% that I've dated.

716
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:19,900
People like that that were a little,
you know,

717
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,340
they were either locked in
or just sort of floating.

718
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,930
It was really weird and they
could say really like amazing.

719
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:30,090
Like spot on shit.

720
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:32,940
And then two minutes later could just
could say something like, oh my God,

721
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:35,100
what the fuck was that?
Um,

722
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,510
but I have to tell you that's kind of a,
that's kind of a big deal. They'll do,

723
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,220
you know, you can't think that the
person you're dating is a dope, you know,

724
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:47,970
you get into that situation and uh,
I dunno,

725
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,030
you start thinking about getting married,
you start thinking about having kids.

726
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,331
You're like,

727
00:42:51,331 --> 00:42:55,710
is my kid going to be half a dope or a
full on dope is used as a kid going to

728
00:42:55,711 --> 00:42:57,480
get all of that DNA from her?

729
00:42:57,481 --> 00:43:01,340
Who the fuck knows I'm all right.

730
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,390
It's kind of hard to think to
discuss with her, you know,

731
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,230
what are you gonna say to her? Can you
stop saying Dumb Shit? I mean, this,

732
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,220
there's no way to do that, you
know, I'm trying to think of,

733
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,730
that's like my wife telling me to work on
my team. I mean, I do work on my temper,

734
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:18,990
but I mean, it's Kinda
how I made up. I mean,

735
00:43:18,991 --> 00:43:21,650
if somebody ditzy, they're fucking ditzy.
That would be like my wife telling me,

736
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,100
okay, can you be a little less
pasty? It's like, ah, I can,

737
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,560
I can become red for a few days
as well.

738
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:32,630
That's about the best I could do. I don't
know what else you want from me, but uh,

739
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,280
you know, I think you,
uh, need to maybe move on.

740
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,330
I'm not saying you need to move on. Yeah.
You either accept this about her or ego.

741
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,220
You got to walk one of the Yoga.
Um, all right, here's another one.

742
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:48,630
Jesus Christ can't come and
I don't mean to the wedding.

743
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,820
Um, how's it going, Billy? Butterballs
uh, if you're reading this on Monday,

744
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,470
it's fucking sick.

745
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,510
June 20th will is my 21st birthday.
Oh,

746
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:05,470
Jesus. I don't know what's going on here.
Great gift hearing you read this. Uh,

747
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,000
well you're not going to hear it until
the fucking Monday anyways. All right.

748
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:11,970
I'm mealling mealling I'm
emailing today though,

749
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,770
is I was with this girl last
summer, some good sex, no big deal,

750
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,400
but we didn't have anything going on
during the year when we were at college.

751
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,990
Well, we're back at it this summer,
but the thing is I can't come.

752
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,020
I mean, I'm doing good. Pretty
good. Uh, p p m pumps per,

753
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,100
but I just can't finish now.
I know you're not a doctor,

754
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,850
so not going to ask you why,
but how should I go about this?

755
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:43,740
I think she's getting self conscious,
but she's a hard eight and I'm a soft six.

756
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,330
She's hot. It's not a
fault. Daddy can finish.

757
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,860
Daddy can't finish when the pressure
is on. How should I be playing this?

758
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:56,730
I can only laugh it off for so long.
I'll try not jerking off to,

759
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,750
maybe that'll help. Any advice.
Thanks for the read, man.

760
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,020
Oldfield be able to come check you
out when you come back. East Coast,

761
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,320
maybe Baltimore and Sunday. Go sox. Go
Fuck Yourself. Uh, yeah. I, you know,

762
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,120
don't rub one out. If you're watching
too much porn, maybe that's a problem.

763
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,380
Or maybe, you know, you don't want
to be in a relationship with her.

764
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,920
And that's the weird way your body's
reacting. Like you're wasting time. Um,

765
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,150
so we're not going to fuck it.

766
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:26,330
I don't know if there's a
billion psychological go
reasons, but yeah, I, yeah,

767
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,900
just don't rub one out for awhile.
You know, this is another thing too.

768
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:34,830
Women are fucking, they're very
forgiving people. If I would,

769
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,310
I wouldn't laugh it off. I would talk
to her about it and just say, listen,

770
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,300
obviously this is happening.
It's bothering me. Um,

771
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,870
I'm feeling pressure about it and I'm
also feeling like in a round about,

772
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,190
I just don't want you to be taken my issue
on like, this something you are doing,

773
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:53,220
you're not doing anything wrong.
There's something going on with me.

774
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,400
And then she'll be like, well, maybe
you should go talk to somebody about it.

775
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,360
And because you're a fucking red sox fan,

776
00:45:58,361 --> 00:46:01,710
I'm assuming you're from the Boston area,
you don't want to go to therapy.

777
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,480
And even if you do go to therapy,

778
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:06,390
it's not going to help because you
probably have enough Irish blood in you.

779
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:07,350
And they always said,

780
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,580
who is that fucking psychologist that
said the Irish are like immune to therapy.

781
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,810
Um, I dunno if you liked
this girl, I would definitely
talk to her about it. But,

782
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,150
uh, there's no reason to put any pressure
on yourself, you know what I mean?

783
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:24,920
Just don't rub one out. Don't
watch any porn. Just a, you know,

784
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,850
I dunno.
Just let it back up.

785
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,400
I don't fucking know. I'm not a doctor.
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ started.

786
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:38,990
Here we go. Here we go. Winded down.
Wind it down. All right. Heroin. Um,

787
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:42,710
I have no family, no friends. I work
in support myself. I have no kids,

788
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:46,820
no relationship. I actually enjoy
freedom and being alone to an extent.

789
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,290
I'm in my twenties. I had a lot of sex
relationships and ended up getting herpes.

790
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:52,610
Slash.
HPV.

791
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,470
I would basically rather just not tell
people and not have relationships than to

792
00:46:57,471 --> 00:47:01,310
have. Then they have to
have 35 years old. Uh,

793
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,750
didn't have to at 35 years old.

794
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:06,440
Deal with having to explain
slash tell this to women.

795
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,940
I really like heroin. Uh, what the
fuck? Jesus Christ. Buddy, what are you,

796
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:14,810
what are we doing here is, this doesn't
sound real. I really like heroin.

797
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,340
I go to work, come home and use heroin
on a daily basis. I still pay my bills.

798
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:20,180
I still work,

799
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,860
but I've traded the pleasure of sex
slash having a family slash relationships

800
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,431
for that,

801
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:30,370
of watching TV shows slash movies
while high on falling asleep,

802
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,340
then going to work the next day.
Should I change this?

803
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,220
Okay.

804
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,720
Is this a, I'll try it. You know
what, I'll, I'll treat it as real. Um,

805
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,030
should I listen to society,
stop using,

806
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:45,270
go out there and find women and tell
them about my situation and hope they do

807
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:49,410
not reject me and get
clean or if I am happy,

808
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,990
is it okay for me to just accept
the women part of my life is over,

809
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,020
eat whatever I want,

810
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,740
use whatever drug I want and fill the
time I have left on this planet watching

811
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:00,960
shows, movies, playing games,

812
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:04,950
and resigning myself to the fact that
I will be alone. Love the podcast.

813
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:08,130
Heroine gets a bad rap.
It may sound crazy,

814
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:12,870
but people can use opiates and still be
responsible. I know many people who do,

815
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,800
it's like alcohol. Both can be
physically. This is really fascinating.

816
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,380
Um, uh, or for, maybe it's a
big lie. I Dunno. It's alcohol.

817
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,140
It's like alcohol.
Both can be physically addictive.

818
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,040
Alcohol can actually kill
you with withdrawals.

819
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,360
Why heroin cannot.

820
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,280
And the deaths you hear about
heroin are from idiots overdosing.

821
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,940
Um, if we, well, what if you get
a bad batch and that something,

822
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,050
you know it's too fucking
strong. Um, I dunno.

823
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,490
I don't pretend to know.
All right.

824
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:49,320
If we reported all the deaths from
alcohol involved incidents, they're easy.

825
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,200
Well they do report all of them.
As far as I know,

826
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:53,220
it's like they're trying to hide them.

827
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,940
They are easily 100 times more
than heroin related deaths.

828
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,620
But in our society right now,

829
00:48:58,621 --> 00:49:02,130
opiates are not acceptable because too
many white middle class parents are

830
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:06,930
finding their idiot kids using them
without understanding tolerance slash

831
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,700
okay.

832
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,820
Proper dosing anyways,
love the podcasts.

833
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:16,230
I'm not leaving any contact info so I
have no way to know if you read this,

834
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,590
just thought it might be an interesting
subject for your show. It is interesting.

835
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,453
Um,

836
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,720
okay.

837
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,510
Yeah, dude, I don't pretend to
know anything about opiates.

838
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:26,630
All I do know is that the,
um,

839
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,660
I know alcohol can ruin your life,

840
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:34,440
but I don't think it's nearly
as addicting as heroin.

841
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,600
I actually have heard
that people can fucking,

842
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,440
yeah,

843
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,580
I don't know. But I think, I think
if, if, if what you're saying is true,

844
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:46,470
I think you're a rare person that can
handle that. I have no idea. Oh fuck.

845
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:47,610
Now I got to look some shit up.

846
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,160
The last thing I wanted to do
and I got to get going here.

847
00:49:50,161 --> 00:49:53,820
I got my fucking show here
and a half hour, uh oh.

848
00:49:53,821 --> 00:49:57,120
The live reads or hear
the live reads are here.

849
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,580
I guess I'll read them here then. Let me
just see something. Let me just look up.

850
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:03,443
What do I look up

851
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,120
productive while on heroin,

852
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:18,770
heroin and employment. Independent
drug morrow. Let's see.

853
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,600
Productivity and heroin addiction.

854
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:22,370
Okay.

855
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,190
What is this?
How heroin addicts in Vietnam.

856
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,223
What is this?

857
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,910
Productivity. Heroin Addiction. How
living in a cave turned me into a blogger.

858
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,460
Yeah.

859
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,040
I failed my new year's resolution.
I wish I could do better.

860
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,830
I just don't have enough willpower.
Have you ever set a goal?

861
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,740
You didn't achieve ever tried to new
year's resolution that didn't stick.

862
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,150
What separates the 0.5% from the 99
and a half percent? What makes someone,

863
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,330
some people succeed in building
new sustainable habits,

864
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:54,470
but almost everyone else fails.
How living in a cave term,

865
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,820
where the fuck's the heroin shit.

866
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,700
How heroin addicts and Vietnam and
your productivity habits are the same.

867
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,830
What everyone knows the horrible
effects of heroin addiction.

868
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,020
Once someone starts taking herring,

869
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:14,130
it's almost impossible to quit and those
who form a recurring habit will likely

870
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:14,964
never quit.

871
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,590
So why didn't heroin using Vietnam vets
relapsed when they returned to the USA.

872
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,530
A study from the Washington
school medical over medicine,

873
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,370
very few heroin use in
Vietnam, uh, veteran relapses.

874
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:32,000
Uh, what very few heroin
using veteran relapsed.

875
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,900
I relapsed when they returned to the USA
and those who did were more likely to

876
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:39,500
have been illicit drug users
before ever arriving in Vietnam.

877
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,080
These vets weren't addicted
to the chemicals in heroin.

878
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,010
They were addicted to
the experience of Howard.

879
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,720
In a specific situational
context and the same vein,

880
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,410
you think you are in control of what
you do. You think that when you fail,

881
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,940
it's a failure of your willpower.

882
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,480
But the fact is you don't even realize
the influence of the environment has on

883
00:51:56,481 --> 00:52:00,020
you. Did you know that obesity
spreads through a network of friends?

884
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,570
Happiness also spreads
throughout a social network.

885
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,480
You situation determines
your choices as much as,

886
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:08,390
or more than your own personal choices.
When willpower.

887
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:09,590
Okay.

888
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,450
So how can I use this to improve
my habit? Oh, it's Jesus Christ.

889
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,830
Join a Wally ball league. I don't even
know what the fuck that was. All right,

890
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:19,280
let me, let me look up. Let me just
read these fucking things here. Um,

891
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:22,170
you know what I might read up on
that. I probably won't. I'll try to,

892
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,320
I would never tell people
to fucking, yeah, well, hey,
it's just heroin. You know,

893
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:33,260
that seems a little crazy to me. Um,
and people always come in an alcoholic.

894
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,820
It's like the fucking pot smokers always
doing that shit. We alcohol actually,

895
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:40,390
man, there's no medicinal purposes to
fucking, I get it. I get it. But you know,

896
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,470
you guys are also, you know, your pie
in the sky fucking thing with weed.

897
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,130
Like it's like there's the key.

898
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,040
Can't get addicted to weed is another
fucking thing. Jesus Christ. Okay. Yeah.

899
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:55,660
You just really like it. That's all
you know. All right. You're unique. Oh,

900
00:52:55,661 --> 00:52:57,850
this is helix hallux.
You're unique.

901
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,820
You don't walk like everyone else
talk like everyone else is asleep like

902
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:03,700
everyone else.
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

903
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:08,650

will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until

you've ever slept on.

910
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:36,030
Alex customers report at 30% improvement
in overall sleep quality and for

911
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:40,350
couples they customize each side of
the mattress. Your mattress arrives.

912
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,100
I just pictured somebody having one like
the husband so he could bang a woman

913
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:46,620
while his wife's sleeping
and she would know, you know,

914
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:48,240
rather than than doing the red wine tests.

915
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:52,560
But one guy jumps up and down while the
red wine just sits there. Um, you know,

916
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,540
what about mattresses for those people?

917
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,130
Helix customers report at 30% improvement
in overall sleep quality and for cuffs

918
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,920
co couples,
they customize each side of the mattress.

919
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,460
Your mattress arrives at your door in

Forbes are all talking about he leaks.

926
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:32,100
here we go. But boop, boop me undies.

927
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,570
Biondi sleeping on a dirty mattress.
But it would do to me undies.

928
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:39,960
Biondi as cause you got a flat ass.

929
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,060

you flat as they cut your fucking balls
and you take to get some me undies.

Everybody needs him. Muslims, Christians,
and Jews. Oh yeah. All right. Me undies.

932
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,380
Whenever you're wearing a suit or sweats,

933
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,780
you spend almost 24 hours
a day and your underwear.

934
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,170
But instead of making a statement
like Superman's tight under tights,

935
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:02,270
under his clothes every day,

936

your underwear is probably boring me

by sustainable source modal,

938

modal fabric that's
twice as soft as cotton.

939
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,120
Nothing can describe the fit and feel
of me undies, but once you try them on,

940
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:19,800
your balls will never go back.

970
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:56,740

crazy, greedy razor corporations charge.

971
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,600
That means when you
joined dollar Shave Club,

972

fresh blade anytime you want,

977
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,220
and the blade just gently glides across
your smooth surface something or other,

978
