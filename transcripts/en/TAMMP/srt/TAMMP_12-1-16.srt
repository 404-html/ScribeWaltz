1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,420
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,680
going on.
Ah,

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,550
um, it's, uh, what the
fuck is it? It's um,

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,620
it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just
before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,180
Just checking in on you.
Ah, just checking in on you.

6
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:27,920
Just seen how your week's going. Huh?
Is it going the way you planned it?

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,610
Did you have any plants?
Think about that.

8
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:33,390
That's like some self
helps you think about that.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,540
But like when you start
your workweek deep,

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,990
do you have a plan?

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,000
I mean other than getting in your
car, kissing your wife or, or, or, or,

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,900
or a husband or, or, or, or,
or, or, or a partner or, or, or,
or, or, or, or, or, or are, are,

13
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:50,734
are, are, are, are,

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,630
and you drive down the street and,
and an end and you get yourself a coffee

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,770
and you're going to work.
But,

16
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:02,771
but do you have a plan beyond just
taking the vessel that holds your saw

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,430
into that workplace?
Do you have a plan?

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,630
Cause I'll tell you right now,
God has planned,

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,850
God has a plan for you and you and
you and each and every one of you,

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,760
but you have to listen.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,910
How can we know what our plan,
what

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,350
if we don't listen?

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,340
That right there is why I don't
go to church. The the, the use of,

24
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,090
of vocal dynamics they always get,
yeah.

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:50,820
Yeah.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,240
And they come in for the whisper,
right? That's how it works.

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,810
It's called the Sandusky.
I'm sorry,

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,900
everyone from Penn state.
I know your teams ranked.

29
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,770
I know you're thinking you're going to
fucking somehow slip and slide your way

30
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:09,500
out of the horrors of that shower and
that no asshole sports fan like me is

31
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,440
going to bring it up. Oh No. It's
going to be brought up. Jesus Christ.

32
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,370
I'm going to take all the shit I took
for some fucking air pressure. You know,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,250
you think you're going to take
down one God damn statute.

34
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:24,090
We all know you're going to put it back
up one of these days. We all know Joey.

35
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,160
Pause coming back up. Where
you gonna put it? Huh?

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,430
Were you going to put it?
Probably in the boosters room,

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,740
right when they bring all the money in,

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,330
they're all sitting there going,
it's okay Joe, you didn't know it.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,200
We all know you never took a shower
and fucking 60 years. Why am I,

40
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,480
why am I doing this? I, you
know what, I don't know why.

41
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:45,780
Cause I've got a bunch of shit to do
today and that's the first thing that came

42
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:50,370
to my head. You know why? Because
God, God has a plan for me.

43
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:55,371
He has a plan for me to go on this
podcast each and every Thursday and just

44
00:02:55,801 --> 00:03:00,430
checking on your week. That's my
mission. You what? I finished Westworld

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,460
and I have to rewatch the final episode
again because I didn't get it all right.

46
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,030
Granted I was fucking nod off like a big
headed drunk jackass on a cross country

47
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,070
flight, you know, head wakened me up.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,710
I didn't quite get it. Um, but I know
there's going to be a season two,

49
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,090
so I would think there would be,

50
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,460
I gotta I gotta figure out what the
fuck happened. Uh, I'll watch it again.

51
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:35,461
But it was really hard to watch
it because my wife wasn't in,

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,540
she wasn't into this series. So she would,
every time I would watch an episode,

53
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,780
she would come in when the song was
coming on and she would just sing along.

54
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,430
She would sing like a,

55
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,430
a robot's focking people,

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,760
people dress like cowboys
something, blah, blah, blah, blah,

57
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,310
blah, blah. Blue. What does it mean? Like,
I don't know, there's a certain, you know,

58
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,460
there's certain kinds of white
shit that Nia just can't watch.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,930
And I found that it's like pre, I
don't know what it is. It's, there's a,

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,940
I think anything pre happy days, you
know, she's just like, yeah, this was not,

61
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:14,680
you know, it's like the
Louis CK bit. Like, you know,

62
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:16,240
these weren't the good old days for us.

63
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,630
So I think when she sees white dudes
walking around in cowboy hats, yeah,

64
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:21,790
she just does not get a good warm,
fuzzy feeling.

65
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,880
Sorry. If you could bend tune
in in late to the podcast,

66
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,690
you haven't turned tuned in lately.
Um, I, I have a touch of a bola,

67
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,910
but fortunately it's just quarantined
into my trope. You know what it is,

68
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,140
is I got this cough and then I smoked
a couple of cigars and then I came back

69
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:44,590
into a house where, you know,
whenever they say the job is finished,

70
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,990
it's not finished.
They have their punch list and that's a,

71
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,510
all this shit they need to do
and then the jobs fucking done.

72
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:54,490
So they keep kicking up dust
here. And um, anyways, so, oh,

73
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,980
Billy red velvet cake is,
um,

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,920
the last few weeks was
not working out because he

75
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,240
had this little bit of a cough and I am
exaggerating the cough before and you

76
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:11,740
guys are like, Jesus shaking my head,
fuck my life. Lol. You only live once,

77
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,630
um, all over my Twitter account. I, uh,

78
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,630
yeah,
I haven't been working out or anything,

79
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:23,080
so I just got on the little fucking
scale and I in the five I lost. I type,

80
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,910
I just put it right back on,
you know what I mean?

81
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm really disappointed in myself. So, uh,
I did the half hour cardio this morning.

82
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:33,040
Do it with me. Here you go, everybody.
I'm doing a half hour cardio every day.

83
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,450
Every fucking day.

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,900
I'm getting on that fucking elliptical
and I'm going to try to lose two pounds a

85
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,280
week,
drop eight pounds,

86
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:43,930
get my fucking fat freckled ass down
to about a buck 75 sliding into the

87
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:48,700
fucking, you know why? Because God,

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,580
God wants you to be skinny.
He doesn't want you,

89
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,470
one of the seven deadly
sins is that spaghetti. Oh,

90
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,330
fatty motherfucker laying face down in
his bull shit from that movie seven.

91
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,390
Um, so anyway, so I've gotten back in,
I got my, I got the sports channels now.

92
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,810
So I've been watching my bro
ends. Is there a, you know,

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,170
get through this fucking season here,
trying to figure out what's gonna work?

94
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,810
What does it, um, we lost
it. The filthy floor.

95
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,600
You know what sucks? It was, I watched
the first two periods. It was too,

96
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:25,040
nothing flyers and a very subdued,
quiet fucking crowd.

97
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,150
Two would make me feel bad.
You know what I mean?

98
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:32,690
Usually the Bruins and flyers get
together. It's a rowdy fucking crowd,

99
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,420
I think because we're both fucking
transition. I don't, you know,

100
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,770
and you know what happened?
He looked at the standings.

101
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,950
Maybe the flyers are good this year. I
don't know. So I go out to the kitchen,

102
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:40,911
you know,

103
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:44,060
the brand new kitchen that's still is
the fucking punch lists to make myself

104
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,730
something to eat. And I swear to God it
felt like I was gone for five minutes.

105
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:51,290
I came back, it was two to two, right.
Marshawn scored. I forget who else.

106
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,110
And uh,
we went into overtime and then we lost it.

107
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,170
Sorry. No, we fucking lost it. So, and
I'm kind of keep my eye on the Celtics.

108
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,920
I know we got Sacramento next. Um, but uh,

109
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,550
you know what's so fucking dumb was
that complete non story of our center Al

110
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,420
Horford getting criticized
for four missing. Uh,

111
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,640
I think he missed a Miami
heat game because he,

112
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,410
cause you know he was with
his wife because she was
giving birth to his daughter.

113
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,660
Oh Jesus. Who has the fucking
nerve to call me during my podcast.

114
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,640
Don't you know God has a plan.

115
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,480
People,
when you walk away from your recorder,

116
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,810
always make sure you take off your
headphones. Cause if you don't,

117
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,780
you're going to yank that
fucker right across the Roman.

118
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,770
Then you're going to have all
that silence that you just heard.

119
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:51,250
Unless I took the time to edit it out,
which I probably will.

120
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,490
I'll probably do your solid and I
know what a lot of you millennials are

121
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:57,270
probably saying. Actually I don't
know what you're saying. You know,

122
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
you probably too busy having a fucking uh,

123
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,470
doing the mannequin challenge or
something else. Really important. Um,

124
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,610
why talk down to the youth bill?
Why would you do that? Huh?

125
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,380
Is it cause you're your everyday
creeping towards death? Um,

126
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,970
I know what you fucking
technological douchebags it probably,

127
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,670
why don't you just get some
wireless headphones? You know why?

128
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:23,150
Cause I think I got enough
satellites pointed at my
fucking head. How about that?

129
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,940
I've got enough signals going in there.
I can't remember shit.

130
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,230
I've had this cough for two weeks. He
know when I'm blaming wireless headphones.

131
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,440
You hear that echo in my office. That's
cause I cleaned the fucker up a Cli,

132
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,940
this fucker and I got
rid of a bunch of shit.

133
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,070
I organized a bunch of stuff.

134
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,140
I shredded a bunch of shit and I'm
feeling good about it. I know we're all,

135
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:52,370
my stuff is, I'm, I'm selling
the Prius and you're, it's funny,

136
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:56,220
I have the title to every God Damn
fucking car I've ever had except for one.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,790
You know, my first one,
but I, I had an 88,

138
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,120
I had an 88 fucking a Honda accord
LX that I bought in like 1996,

139
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,700
five speed.
I fucking love that car.

140
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,600
And I had it for like four or
five years before I sold it.

141
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,290
When I moved back to New York. And,
uh, I found a copy of that title.

142
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,090
I found every fucking God damn title
that I needed except for the fucking,

143
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,840
the one for the car that I'm selling.
So now I had to send it away.

144
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,850
I got to send away for it, for
the, uh, to the fucking DMV.

145
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,850
So I got to do that bullshit today
and do it. I get to taste something.

146
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,450
It's laugh all you want
about the Toyota Prius,

147
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,370
say as much homophobic stuff as you
want at people who drive Toyota.

148
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,020
Paresis not only is that a great God
damn car, it's got great resale value.

149
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,830
People want that fucking car.
You know Tony,

150
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,010
that gas smells laugh all you want. Say
it looks like a doorstop. Say it's gay,

151
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:01,460
it's soulless. She got no balls. You know,

152
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,700
I don't understand people that
identify themselves with their car.

153
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,580
I understand liking cars. I
love cars. You know what I mean?

154
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:11,630
But I don't like look at something that
another man built an act like I had

155
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:13,910
something to do with it.
Like a lot of these other cons.

156
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,970
Now it's one thing if you fucking,
you know, you, you, you know whatever.

157
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:20,750
You go down to the God damn junkyard like
the gas monkey guys and your build it

158
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:23,840
from fucking scratch. Then you
can have some pride. All right?

159
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,580
But if you're that fucking huckleberry
that walks out of their lot and then buys

160
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:32,480
it for four to five grand more than
what you should have fucking paid for,

161
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:37,100
then you walk around leaning against it
as you drink an astrologer beer, right?

162
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,030
Standing there like you won a war.
I don't understand that aspect of it.

163
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,620
Which brings me back to the Toyota
Prius. All right. The Toyota Prius.

164
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,610
Like most of you, I did not
build that car. Oh right. So

165
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,270
why are you trying to put
that on to my personality?

166
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:56,030
You know it takes a strong
man to drive a Prius.

167
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,293
Nia.

168
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,320
Yeah,
you up?

169
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,700
What do you mean? How can you not be? You
are awake earlier when I talked to you.

170
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,410
Okay.

171
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,070
No, pull that shit. You already ruined
my day with all the jobs you have for me.

172
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,650
Can you please come up here
and sing your Westworld Song?

173
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,140
Okay,

174
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,170
can you do that? Boop, boop,
boop, boop, boop, booboo.

175
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,260
What are you so grumpy about?
The God damn door open.

176
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:33,920
You're screaming at the top of your lungs.
It's like, what are you doing to me?

177
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,880
What do you want? I'm making
money. What can you do a quieter?

178
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,730
Hey, let me hear the Oh, shut up. You've
already awake. That's your big complaint.

179
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,280
That's your big complaint in life. What
are you doing any other places? Well,

180
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,130
sit here. Well, are you moving

181
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,160
on my shit? Come on man. You
got to sing the song. What?

182
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:58,810
Are you pregnant or something?
Yeah,

183
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,190
I just came up the stairs and I'm
out of breath. Do you want from me?

184
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,980
I'd like a little sunshine today.

185
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,710
Do you want another microphone or
what you want to be on the podcast?

186
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,360
Yeah,

187
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,900
no, Jesus. I got to hit pause.
Liver. Catch your breath. All right.

188
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,810
What back? Hell, Nia.

189
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,570
I want you to show called Westworld.
Please don't flashed me. Huh?

190
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm not flashing. Sorry.
I got my bathrobe.

191
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,660
Sorry.
Like Sharon Stone right now.

192
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,410
It's a good stay. Oh, there's the,

193
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,020
there's the Photoshop
for the fucking week.

194
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,990
You're on your red sox row with
nothing on underneath it. Yeah.

195
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,380
Can you have a little
consideration for the listeners?

196
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,950
They don't want to think about
that. Jesus Christ, they worked out.

197
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm a fuck a guy. You know, you
take a shower, you put on a robe,

198
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,450
you have a couple of fucking eggs.

199
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,000
What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
get all this shit done before you fucking

200
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,140
all the crap that you decided in your
head that I was doing today without

201
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:12,280
checking with my schedule.
Yeah, yeah, I did that.

202
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,780
Yes you did. Okay. All right.

203
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,590
Well no one the Westworld song.

204
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,753
Okay.

205
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,390
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo robots.

206
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,990
Fucking people.
People dressed as cowboys.

207
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,560
That's as far as I got fucking ruin the
whole song every time I went to go watch

208
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,300
it. Now let me ask you this, you kind of,

209
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,690
I noticed like there's certain types of
fucking white movies you don't like and

210
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:47,380
cowboys is one of them. Anytime the
cowboys you fucking tune out early.

211
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,870
I'm just not particularly interested
in certain areas of white history.

212
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,930
That's what I'm saying that I called that
earliest a certain things I'm just not

213
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
particularly interested in.
I talked to him.

214
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:02,220
You don't see a lot of black
cowboys in those movies. It's weird.

215
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,230
Where were the black people there that,
let's see.

216
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,500
Well it depends on when it
was. It was like the 1880s
you mean they had, you know,

217
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,950
did you guys have your own stage coaches
at that point? Oh yeah. Definitely.

218
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,210
Had our own stage air shocks on
him and shit on businesses. Yep.

219
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,600
I thought you did initially
and you started kicking the
shit out of white people

220
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:23,860
cause then it, then they
went, whoa, Whoa, Hey Z.

221
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:28,260
Hey z that happen right after slavery.
Now there wasn't then you guys,

222
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,100
a bunch of you got elected and
shit and then acted to what? Well,

223
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:36,150
cause you had numbers. Numbers for what?
What are you talking about right now?

224
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,250
I can't remember if this was a video
game, if this was actually okay.

225
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,360
No, like right after you guys got
free or your sense of history is just,

226
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,943
it's amazing.

227
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,340
I thought like you guys got
fried and then like you started

228
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,920
succeeding and then all the broke
ass white people around you lie. Why?

229
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,640
Why you don't man. And that's when
they came up with the Klan. Maybe.

230
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,460
Maybe too many of these Tarantino
movies where he fucks with history.

231
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,530
I don't know what's going
on, but I thought, I thought
you were doing it right.

232
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:10,070
None of this, none of this is
correct. I'm not a historian,

233
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:14,390
but I didn't the clumps do something
around then to the whole, the clumps.

234
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,070
Who are the clumps? Eddie Murphy and
fucking knows, oh, he's just being silly.

235
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,390
Silly. All right, whatever.

236
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,530
So Nia, what? What exactly are a that
that that song was a little disappointing,

237
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:27,600
but I don't really have much.
What was I saying?

238
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:30,420
I was like Anthony Hopkins playing God.

239
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,300
Yeah, you'd ruin the whole fee.
Every time I would go to watch it,

240
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,830
you'd stick your head in the room,

241
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,390
Jeffery. Right? They get
there and he knew them.

242
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,830
Hbo is a bunch of perverts.
They always have these shows.

243
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:48,630
Everybody's just fucking naked. Ahs.
Westworld, three kings, one of the,

244
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,580
fuck. Hey, we're all in the castle. Look
out for the Dragon. Game of Thrones,

245
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:56,820
game of Thrones, eight year old
king. Hey, we're, hey, we're all,

246
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,160
I don't get how an eight
year old guy again.

247
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,760
How does an eight year old king
fucking sentence someone to death.

248
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,520
I never watched you just said, what'd
you say? You Little Shit. I have no idea.

249
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:09,750
What tip you over in that giant fucking
chair. What are you gonna do about it?

250
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,250
A little evil fucker. Dude. That kid
needed the living shit kicked out of him.

251
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,013
Hmm.

252
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah,
I didn't watch a lot of episodes,

253
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:22,100
but if ever I could throw an eight
year old off a building or a castle,

254
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,490
definitely I'd want them to live to
this theories. I, I have no idea.

255
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,351
I saw one of them,

256
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:32,890
he pulled a guy's fucking tongue out
cause he didn't like the song he was

257
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,724
playing.

258
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,180
Yeah. There's like too much like
incest and dragons and shit.

259
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,430
I'm just that, that kind of genre. I'm
not really into, although I did love game.

260
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,270
No, not cancer. Um, uh, Lord of the
rings. That was an awesome movie.

261
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,360
But I don't know what the part of white
history does that take place. It doesn't,

262
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,550
it's make believe it's not real.

263
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,250
I like fan like some fantasy stuff,
but I don't like there's no middle earth.

264
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,200
I don't think so.

265
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,410
If middleware it had to vote,
which way would they go? Nia?

266
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,280
That's a good question.
I don't know.

267
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,000
You'd have to talk to some
like tolken nerds for that.

268
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,370
They might be able to tell you if they're
more liberal or conservative and this

269
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,140
fantasy in a nerds,
Chris Hardwick from the Nerdist,

270
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,320
he's doing a fucking game show that I'm
calling it right now is going to be the

271
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:31,590
biggest hit game show since.
Who wants to be a millionaire?

272
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,040
It's called the wall.
I don't know what it is,

273
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,520
but it's fucking broke ass people who
could possibly win 12 million bucks in the

274
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:46,290
fact that so many people are upside down
in their houses and the look of fucking

275
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,410
hope on these people's faces.
It's the APP

276
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,080
like

277
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,940
literally almost breaking down crying
like you never see that on the prices,

278
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,380
right? You don't see that
on the wheel of fortune.

279
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:01,020
You certainly don't see it on jeopardy,

280
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,130
but this wall thing,
they got these fucking people like,

281
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,180
like these people are so excited to win
the fucking prize in the trailer that

282
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:14,610
they're going to need some sort of
counseling if they lose, if they blow it.

283
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,160
Right. Do they ever do that
shit anymore on game shows?

284
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:20,400
Remember back in the day when you could
fucking bully people and tease him where

285
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:24,580
it's like, do you want to take
that money in my pocket now? I do,

286
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,540
I number tell them. And they'd be
like, and people always just like,

287
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,320
fuck you money for it.
Right then.

288
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,920
Then they'd will listen to the
crowd and there'd be 700 bucks,

289
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,990
which could buy you like a fucking,
you know,

290
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,740
I don't know why they probably buy a
mercury monarch back then or some shit and

291
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,090
nice down payment on one.
Anyways,

292
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,290
you'd put it back into the
guys Ron Burgundy sport coat
and then they would open

293
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,760
up the door and half the time it'd be
like a fucking donkey or a yak or some

294
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:54,930
shit. And they go dunk on
the tone back and do that on,

295
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,990
let's make a deal with Wayne
Brady or do they still do that?

296
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,750
Still have that show? Yeah, he's
the host of it. I've only, yeah,

297
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:03,090
but this is the thing. But they all
dress, they're all dressed up though.

298
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,680
So that takes the shame away from it
because you can hide in your costume back

299
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,890
in the day you stood there and you looked
like what you look like and then the

300
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,170
next day you were walking down the
street, you're like, oh my God,

301
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,770
you're that guy that could have fucking
one seven or eight minute, wait a minute.

302
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,850
I didn't.
I when we were in that,

303
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,890
that rental home with the Campbell that
only had an oldies television for some

304
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,890
strange reason,
I saw an episode of let's make a deal.

305
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,280
And there was a couple that was dressed
up as raggedy Ann and rack the, yeah, no,

306
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:32,070
no, absolutely. And it was like
in the 70s that show they did.

307
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,050
But I'm saying that was all,

308
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,900
there was all these other game shows
where people didn't dress up and there was

309
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:41,901
always the booby prize is what
they called it and it was not tiddy

310
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,980
alright, wanting something fucking nuts.
This is a complete non fucking story.

311
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,670
I started to talk about it. And then
of course they'll fucking went away.

312
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,160
And the God damn cables out,
not the cable,

313
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,800
the fucking Goddamn Internet,

314
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,430
like press the reset button on
the right, the router. So this,

315
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,640
this Guy Al Horford who
plays for the Celtics,

316
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:08,170
he used to play for the
Atlanta for the sellies.

317
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,450
He used to play for the Atlanta Hawks.
This year we were making a big, uh,

318
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,500
we want to try to get Kevin
Durant and then we couldn't.

319
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,560
So then evidently all the money that
we were going to give him to rant,

320
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,940
we gave three quarters of it to this
Guy Al Horford give him like 130 fucking

321
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:24,750
million dollars over four years
or something crazy like that. Um,

322
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,450
maybe a little less than that came
out to about 28 million years.

323
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:31,550
So listen to this shit. So this
fucking guy, his wife has a kid, right?

324
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,581
It has a daughter.

325
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:37,581
So he misses a game and some fans
bitched about it on like a social media.

326
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:43,260
And it actually became like a story he
thought out of game because he wanted to

327
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,800
go to his daughter's birthday party and
then a couple of Douche bags are like,

328
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,970
oh the fog to pay

329
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,910
you all the morning put ball Lou.

330
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,710
And then the media picked up
on it and then he actually,

331
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:58,330
he actually had the comment on Twitter
nerds and it was like one sports show

332
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:00,890
that brought it up are his priorities.

333
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,130
What are you going to do
in here if I don't show up?

334
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,700
You know if I'm at the Rose Bowl
hammered and you give birth or um,

335
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,330
we've already, this guy don't
even joke about it hammered.

336
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:20,570
We've already discussed the plan for
the Rose Bowl. Can I tell you something?

337
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,700
Even if I walked into delivery
room blind drunk, you can't,

338
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,730
you're still going to be totally fine
because everybody doing all the heavy

339
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:33,580
lifting is there. Like I,
I shouldn't even be there.

340
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,290
I don't understand why you keep trying
to like evade any kind of like role of

341
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,430
being like my support and comfort
Mike. My emotional support. Yeah.

342
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,070
You don't even stand in the room
when I get my teeth cleaned.

343
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,970
That's a little bit different
than you think. Yeah.

344
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,610
What if they want removing a tooth?

345
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:55,690
Would you stand there and hold my
fucking hand? No. For God damn sure.

346
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,180
That is not the same thing.
Why are you even bringing that up?

347
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:01,930
Because it's fucking bullshit
that the guy has to be in there.

348
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,930
And every guy I talked to, nine out
of 10 of them go, yeah, it's bullshit.

349
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,520
Just stay north to the fucking blanket.
And it keeps them happy.

350
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,310
You just weren't emotionally support me.

351
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:16,060
And when we went to the class the other
day and you watch the birthing story,

352
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:21,190
you leaned over to me and you were like,
oh, I understand now I understand why. No,

353
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:23,650
when he was walking with her,
went walking with her in the halls,

354
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:26,050
I understood that being in
there for the procedure,

355
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,520
I completely don't understand.

356
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,570
And I just think that that is one of
those things that it's just one of those

357
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,190
does that fucking hat thing
that you guys do and rub right.

358
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:39,460
Rub My back and be like,
you got this. You're good.

359
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:43,170
Just breathe like you're
okay. Yeah. All that kind of,

360
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,530
it's just like every time I walk out the
fucking door and I got all this shit to

361
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:51,160
do. You always throw a couple more
things. Hey, go get the dry cleaning.

362
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,520
Can you go do this? And he'd go do that
and yet you're dumping your fucking,

363
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,130
you'd taken the it off of your pile.
You take the dog to the vet actually.

364
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,463
Okay.

365
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:08,070
I'm not taking the dog to the vet.
You're taking the dog to the vet. Okay.

366
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,780
Yeah. I'm moving all that other
shit down there. [inaudible]

367
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,440
you're going to have some help.
You're not the only, I mean,

368
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,250
you know my brother is because you're
on the podcast that you're coming with

369
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:22,890
this,
this fucking arrogant tone I don't know,

370
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:25,860
is because of you're on the podcast
and you're coming at me with this extra

371
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:29,010
fucking Douchey vibe.
I always have this vibe.

372
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:35,280
Fair enough. Fair enough. Fair
enough. I got some ads to read.

373
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,530
Oh, did you think, um, oh
frame was it frame grab,

374
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,920
frame grab. Is that, is that
the right, is that the way to

375
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,670
sand?
No,

376
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,670
I knew who they were until you just said
is these people that advertise on our

377
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:56,240
podcast, they send us a couple of frame
things, whose stuff was very nice of them.

378
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,050
Oh, nice. What the fuck is their name?

379
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,600
Frame, Greeks. Frame. Frame used.

380
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,220
I can frame it versus framer.

381
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,250
What is it? Uh, I know where
I can go to figure out. Oh,

382
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,930
well you go figure it out. I'm going
to, I'm going to read some advertising.

00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:23,030
But like I am, I, you know,
I'm a comedian. Yeah. I don't,

563
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,410
I don't do well in the group dynamic
at seen how bad I wanted to say.

564
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:30,170
My name was Russel. This lie. Yeah.

565
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:33,110
I wanted to lie and I just wanted
to lie about what we were having.

566
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:35,240
I just wanted to lie. One of the
lie through all of it's nothing,

567
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:40,140
you know folk and just show me where
she's going to fucking have it.

568
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,850
I sat there for 90 minutes people,
all I have to do is fucking pull up,

569
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,850
drop her off,
go to the fifth floor,

570
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,300
make a right and I dial
four numbers and I'm done.

571
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,000
And I had to sit there for 90 minutes.

572
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,650
One hour was her talking and then 30
minute, he's a great speaker though.

573
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,430
She was and she was adorable and she
was a great mom and I loved her and they

574
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:10,110
gave all the dads diaper bags at
the end, which was very, very cool.

575
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:10,944
I thought.

576
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,420
But the last day always talked to us
like we're dopes the last 30 minutes we

577
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:16,410
actually watched guys,

578
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:19,110
I mean you're going to be standing there
with your fucking head up your ass.

579
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,490
I'd so want to sit there and be like,

580
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:24,610
you realize men built this hospital and
all major medicine was because of men.

581
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,230
I'm just saying they took every fucking
thing when it comes to the male and

582
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:31,850
female dynamic, when they talk about
the guy, if there's a woman running it,

583
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,920
the shit that they say, they always
talk to us like we're fucking stupid.

584
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:39,330
The exact fucking thing that all these
broads who are feminists say they don't

585
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,010
want done to them.

586
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,280
It happens all the time to us all
the fucking time and look at you.

587
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,350
You could care less the same way.

588
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:50,430
I don't give a shit that you make a
dollar less than hour than I do to go down

589
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:53,520
to the Laverne and Shirley plant and
put little caps on those beer bottles.

590
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,280
Shimmy all shemozzle. What does that
mean in Yiddish? Oh, I don't know.

591
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,560
Is that, is it Yiddish? Yeah. I
love Yiddish. Shamil is a guy,

592
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,130
he's the kind of guy who goes out to
a restaurant. He spills some soup.

593
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,820
Sh schmozzle I think that's how you
say it. He's the guy he spills it on

594
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,470
under. That is right. It is right and
you want to both. You want to bet. Sure.

595
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,590
You want to know how much you want. In
fact, Bill Soup. I swear to God, Bro.

596
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,280
Some fucking clothes. I so I'm
standing up now. No, but that,

597
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,630
that robe just and not be
contained. Contain what? Uh,

598
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,460
how much you want to bet?
I don't know. 10 Bucks.

599
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,220
All right. All right.
Let's look it up right now.

600
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,940
We're talking about the baby lojack third
30 minutes of it as we walked around

601
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:46,270
the hospital. Oh yeah. They got
these little, these little fucking,

602
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:50,320
he showed us some newborns and
it was so cute. But they have a,

603
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:55,150
they have a security in place these
days for babies. I did not know.

604
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,270
They had a little ankle
bracelet on the thing like it,

605
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,230
like it was on house arrest just in
case somebody came into the hospital and

606
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:05,250
started stealing babies, which I've
never fucking heard of that ever. That.

607
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,520
It's slowly getting, you used to having
that thing now it's just on their ankle.

608
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,350
Oh, booed. You do boop, boop, boop.

609
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,940
And then eventually it's fucking in
them telling you to get off. That's all.

610
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,850
When the baby steps baby steps,

611
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:23,050
you baby step your way into something
that they have an id tag on one ankle and

612
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,280
then they have a little

613
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,183
cool

614
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,690
ankle bracelet on the other
to keep track of them.

615
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,170

617
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:38,890

mean, you're awfully confident,

621
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,560

Shamil schmozzle are to Yiddish
terms off to use and comical,

627
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:18,860
but sometimes biting
sense of humor. Uh, uh,

628
00:39:18,861 --> 00:39:21,350
Shamiel is somebody who opt in,
spills his soup,

629

the fucking robe. It's closed.

634
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,790
Uh, you'd beat me to the punch. I
was going to say I'd give you a $10.

635
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:46,340
I'll be like, you keep your $10
and have to do those dumb ass jobs.

636

memorial podcasts would be Monday.

640
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,040
Oh. Speaking of that, speaking of
a, you know, I'm in my forties.

641
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,580
I have a lot of friends
that are no longer here.

642
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,770
I got a couple of benefits
to promote peak common. Um,

643
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,950
this Tuesday, great friend of mine
unfortunately passed away, uh,

644
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,940
uh, about a month ago and, uh,
we're having a benefit for him.

645
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,980
Eight o'clock at the laugh factory.

646
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:34,710
I'm going to be doing a bunch of
time trying on all this new stuff.

647
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:39,330
We're going to have a great time.
And um, he really was, you know,

648
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,890
92 to 99. He was just somebody I saw
like practically almost every day,

649
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:47,070
and we had so many great gigs before he
went into writing and all that type of

650
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:51,200
stuff. So it's an honor to do
something in his memory, um,

651
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,350
for a, for his is wonderful kids. Um,

652
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,390
and then we have to
Patrice O'Neal benefit.

653
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,100
Do you know yesterday was the five year
anniversary? Can you believe that? Wow.

654
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,160
I can't believe I haven't talked
to him in five years. That's crazy.

655
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm been trashed by him.
Heard him laughing. Oh yeah.

656
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:11,070
And think of everything that happened.
I remember when,

657
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:15,750
when he speaking of sent Dusky right
after he died was when all of that shit

658
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:17,190
came out.
And I just remember

659
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,260
just trying to imagine what he would have
been talking about and I know that his

660
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:24,930
angle,
somehow he would've made,

661
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,220
he would have made that absolutely
hilarious. Um, but anyways, uh,

662
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,150
the next benefit is, um,
Tuesday, February 21st,

663

for your husband, um,

666
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,520
it's going to be Leslie
Jones. Gary Gulman, Dan Soder,

667
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,510
Jim Norton, Rich Vos, Bobby Kelly, myself,

668
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,620
Keith Robinson.

669
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,980
I think I got everybody know he's trying
to have an eight or nine people. Um,

670
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,940
it's such a,

671
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,060
Oh, I'm so bummed I'm going to miss
that. I'm going to miss a Leslie Jones.

672
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,970
She's going to that I love to see here.
Do you stand up?

673
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,410
I'd better not be going on after.
Uh,

674
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,220
can I just say being in the Green
Room at tough crowd with Colin Quinn,

675
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,590
with Patrice,
like I dunno,

676
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,560
like two times a week is
probably the most like fun.

677
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,800
I lacked every single day on that job
and he was definitely him. Geraldo,

678
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,910
you know, we're such like a big
part of that. And like, I dunno,

679
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,150
it's just having Patrice around
saying the most offensive,

680
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,490
like a horrible, horrible things
that you can say as a man to a woman.

681
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,870
But they were always funny. Like I can't
deny the fact that like, I'd be like,

682
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:49,290
fuck you, but I would be so funny.
At the same time. It's like,

683
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:52,230
that's the infuriating thing
about comedians. It's like,

684
00:42:52,231 --> 00:42:55,200
it's like you guys say the most
fucked up shit, but it's so funny.

685
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:00,440
So it's hard to stay mad at you. So
we're just fucking around. I know. No,

686
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,170
and it's all, it's all like whatever.
You shouldn't be laughing at this,

687
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:04,830
but it's so,

688
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:04,981
well,

689
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:08,250
you want to hear a classic come comedians
story real cause it David tell story.

690
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:08,970
Hmm.

691
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,970
So we're at fucking standup New York and
there was a little person in the room,

692
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:16,770
right?
I'm a little person in the comedy club.

693
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,160
I think I kind of just fucked the
whole thing up. Right. Was there.

694
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:23,520
So the fucking club owner was all like,
you know, okay, there's a, you know,

695
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,720
it's a little person is, you
know, at the show tonight,

696
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,020
let's not make any joke with Bob Bland,
so everybody's not doing jokes and stuff,

697
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:34,890
blah, blah, blah, blah. And he
says it's to Dave [inaudible].
Dave just goes, AH, okay.

698
00:43:34,891 --> 00:43:38,010
Yeah. Right. And he walks right up on
stage in a me first thing in his mouth.

699
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:40,910
He just goes, I understand. We
have a little man in the room.

700
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,870
Yeah. Whole place labs.
The dude laughed. Sorry.

701
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:46,100
Sorry,

702
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,530
just went red line that he fucking laughed
any fucking set all of this shit and

703
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:55,450
the guy loved it and had a great
fucking time. Yeah. And I, I dunno man,

704
00:43:55,451 --> 00:43:57,730
I was just one of those
things where I moved.

705
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,800
I was brand new when I saw him do that.

706
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:04,801
Like to meet up to just disobey an
order from a New York City club owner.

707
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:07,930
I was like, oh my God. And
he's still going to get spots.

708
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,990
If I went a minute over where I was
on the, on the ladder at that point,

709
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:13,820
if I went over like one fucking minute.
Um,

710
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,790
David tell at a bunch of those that
he did the gator growl one time,

711
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,260
which is he went down to the swamp,

712
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:24,820
which is like this fucking with
the gators play football and um,

713
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,890
you were supposed to work squeaky clean.
The uh,

714
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,370
Dean didn't want you to
fucking say anything dirty.

715
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,330
Brewer told me this story.

716
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:34,890
This is another one I'm going to
fuck up and cough my way through.

717
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,700
Said everybody works squeaky clean.

718
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,910
When he was sitting there wondering
how David Tell was going to handle it.

719
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,420
And Dave came out and just did the most
filthiest fucking joke from his act

720
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,440
right up front and then
looked right over at the,

721
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,370
at the whole board of the things
that he goes, fuck you Dane.

722
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,550
This one's for this students.
And the whole place went fucking nuts.

723
00:44:56,551 --> 00:45:00,900
And then he murdered for like a half
hour and then I coughed myself to death.

724
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,340
All right. I gotta put some
clothes. Oh, Billy balled out.

725
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,020
Hopefully Paul said you cough, your
robe opens. It's a little bit more.

726
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,880
Well, you know what, Nia, you got to
tease the crowd a little. All right.

727
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:19,140
That's the podcast for Thursday.
Have a great weekend. Your comments.

728
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,080
Um,
and I'll talk to you on Monday there.

729
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,053
MMM.

730
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,890
Anyways, new Pope a Boston. Billy loved
the podcast. Keep up the good work.

731
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:48,450
Thank you. What do you make of all
this news about the pope retiring?

732
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,650
Oh Geez. Geez. Personally I'm not that
religious and don't really care that much.

733
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,980
Maybe if they elected a new pope that
was young. Well that was a young,

734
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:59,850
some young hot lady in her
twenties I would give a shit.

735
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,820
What do you think bill?
Is there more to the story than that?

736
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:05,610
They're not telling us where
his age and health issues.

737
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:10,120
The only reason he retired is the
church covering anything up. Um,

738
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,530
I'll come on do it. Are they covering
anything up? They fucking have been.

739
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,850
Certain percentage of them have
been covering up other fucking kids.

740
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,700
Okay.

741
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,470
For a long time, you know, during
World War Two there was a, you know,

742
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:29,200
they got in bed with the Nazis.
I mean,

743
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:33,130
it really is one of the worst organization
as far as some of the shit that

744
00:46:33,131 --> 00:46:35,740
they've done,
you know,

745
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,720
but people are so wrapped into not pissing
off the invisible guy in wanting to

746
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:44,230
go to the happy place and get to eat
marshmallows for the rest of you fall

747
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:48,870
fucking eternity. That they are
actually, it's really, it's,

748
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:50,050
it's disturbing.

749
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,580
Okay.

750
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,710
That people can still be part of
that religion. You know what I mean?

751
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,520
I don't understand how, you know, the
stuff that they've done. So, uh, yeah,

752
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:03,540
I would say, yeah, there's probably
something going on. I don't know.

753
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,800
Maybe he said something
like, Hey, you know, ah,

754
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,270
maybe we should apologize for,
uh,

755
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,150
having that clam bake with Adolf Hitler.

756
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:17,220
She'll be a maybe clear the air
with that one. Hey, what do you say?

757
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,230
Oh,

758
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:23,230
we actually don't help to pay for the
lawyers of the people in our organization

759
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:27,900
who put their dicks in the acids of kids.
You know,

760
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,050
maybe he said something like that. I
have no idea. Anyways, he said also,

761
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:35,680
what are some, some of the ways that they
could make the church more interesting?

762
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:38,650
For example,
maybe let broads become priests.

763
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,860
I bet more people would pay attention.

764
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,700
Or how about letting people sit in lazy
boys instead of sitting and kneeling and

765
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:49,870
those terrible rock hard benches
they call pews. I know, it's so dumb.

766
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:54,280
The whole thing is to get you like
you're not worthy. You're not worthy.

767
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:58,630
You're not worthy. Get on your
fucking knees and it's in, it's all,

768
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,160
it's all made up by human
beings taking a guess and,

769
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:09,040
and other adults because they get into
it as kids. They, they, I don't know why.

770
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:10,901
I actually know why.

771
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:14,770
Cause I believe that there was like a
spirituality and I believe that you feel

772
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:16,000
good when you do good things.

773
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:21,001
And I just think that you can't corral
that nobody owns it and you can't put a

774
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,060
fucking like,

775
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,250
okay,

776
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,240
I think that all churches should just
be philosophies rather than this,

777
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,930
this hardened way of looking at things.
Um,

778
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,420
just the amount of death
that it has caused. I don't,

779
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,760
I'm not saying anything fucking know. You
guys know how I feel on this shit. Um,

780
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,060
finally, how about we live in up the
music a bit and add some newer sounds.

781
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,980
Maybe a little guitar and drums.
Well,

782
00:48:43,981 --> 00:48:46,050
what you need to do is
go to a Baptist church,

783
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:51,270
go to a church where you don't see any
white people going in there. Um, that,

784
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:54,240
that would be a good one to start
with. And I bet you're amazing. You'll,

785
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:57,600
you'll hear people who are actually in
those churches probably sing bay better

786
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,270
than half the people who won
grammys that year. I mean,

787
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,950
how many times you've seen some emaciated
whore sticking her finger in a year.

788
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,840
Lao who trying to act like they
know how to sing and what do they,

789
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:08,610
what's behind them all the fucking time.

790
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,230
It's always like fucking three black
chicks or two black chicks to some black

791
00:49:13,231 --> 00:49:15,870
dude. I mean, that's where the music
is. That's where it's coming from.

792
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,610
If that's what you want,
just fucking go there.

793
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,160
Okay.

794
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,470
They're not going to give a shit.
Right. They might look at you weird,

795
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:24,020
but after a while, once they see you
feel the music, you should be fine.

796
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,610
You should be fine. The
rest of the Shit, I dunno.

797
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,630
I think that they should
maybe update the stories

798
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,670
every once in a while.

799
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,290
Okay.

800
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:39,120
Maybe, uh, just make up some new shit.
Just say, Oh, you know what, God,

801
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:43,770
God came back again and the
burning Bush said, uh, you know,

802
00:49:43,771 --> 00:49:48,570
let he who never a illegally
downloaded the song.

803
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:50,730
Just something to fucking update it.
I don't know what to tell you.

804
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,403
You know what I mean?

805
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,403
I don't know.

806
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,810
Updated, I guess. You know, there are
some sort of, some of those new age,

807
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:03,580
the new age ones are just to scary because
then somehow somebody always ends up

808
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:05,260
saying there, Jesus, and
the next thing you know,

809
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:08,950
you're surrounded by the FBI and
there's tank shooting flames at yet,

810
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,520
or you're waiting for some aliens to come.
And next thing you know,

811
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:17,080
everybody's drinking some
poison and you're dying of
fucking bunk bed, you know,

812
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:22,081
or in the middle of the jungle with some
sweaty fucking Conga player or whatever

813
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:23,830
the fucking that guy's name was.

814
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:25,620
Yeah.

815
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,560
You know,
I think you're is,

816
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:31,580
when it comes to us spirituality and
that type of shit, I think you're really,

817
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:35,130
you're better off on your own.
Um,

818
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,840
I think, you know, I think generally
speaking, if you're not a psycho,

819
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:42,850
you kind of know how to
be a decent human being.

820
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:47,830
I'm not saying that you're always
succeed in it. I certainly don't, but,

821
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:52,490
um,
I don't know how the fuck do I put it.

822
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,280
I would rather sit at a bar about six,

823
00:50:57,281 --> 00:51:02,281
seven beers in and talk to somebody else
who is in the same mind frame and talk

824
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:07,441
about life than I would to actually go
to a church and listen to some guy up

825
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:12,240
there going, Eh, any did shop
day Gaddy did shop thing.

826
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:16,330
Aus, hey did it for
you. He died painfully.

827
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:20,920
I hope you appreciated.
Then I'll lay low yarrow way.

828
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:24,980
We are,
you're not fucking worthy.

829
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:29,270
We want you to remember this.
Your a of Shit.

830
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,160
You better hope he's not mad at you.
I lay Lou.

831
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:39,140
Yeah. Wow. Lailu yeah, I mean who the
fuck wants to sit there through that?

832
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,420
I mean there's still telling stories
about lepers. Can we fucking update it?

833
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,103
You know,

834
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,980
the world was flat.

835
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,040
Now the world is flat and there was some
lappers and a guy at a big boat stuck

836
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:03,920
some animals on,
what am I singing?

837
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,130
I don't even know.
I shouldn't have listened to my mother.

838
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,210
I caught you end up in that,
okay, here's a job where you,

839
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,540
you're not going to be able to
ever fuck another woman again,

840
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,273
you know?

841
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,030
Yeah. Well do I get a wife
now? You don't get that.

842
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,350
You're going to sit in his dorm room with
a bunch of other guys. None of you are.

843
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:30,500
Begin I going to get any pussy whatsoever.

844
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,180
Okay?

845
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,930
Okay. There you go. There's a natural
check. The whole thing is just like,

846
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,950
as far as the Catholic way,
it's just like just flogging yourself.

847
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,450
Do you understand how fucked up?
But you got one fucking life.

848
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,710
You should be out having the time of
your life, you know, not hurting anybody,

849
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:49,550
but having the time,

850
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:52,580
you life and enjoying it because you
fucking deserve it because you were lucky

851
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:55,700
enough to be born a human being
and not a fucking house fly.

852
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,700
What if reincarnation is true? All right?
And you're gonna fucking come back is,

853
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:03,830
is uh, uh, I don't know. Something a snaky

854
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,330
what? Those little fucking
lizards sitting at Darton around.

855
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,750
Even if you don't get eaten by a snake,
you only live like 14 days.

856
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,490
You can fucking drive a car,
you know,

857
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,240
gave you never see a
lizard doing that shit.

858
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,503
Good

859
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,113
sleep.

860
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,120
Scottish, Cardinal. Oh, Brian.

861
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,070
Cardinal O'brien apologizes for
my sexual conduct. You know,

862
00:54:12,071 --> 00:54:15,460
I'm getting sick of people apologizing
for shit and they dance around.

863
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:16,940
Okay.

864
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,110
This guy basically to use my new word,
he buggered some kids.

865
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,213
All right?

866
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,130
He took out his holy Cock Oleo
and stuck it in their fucking uh,

867
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,940
uh, uh, what the fuck
was Jesus born in a shed?

868
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,110
What do they always call it?

869
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:34,580
Okay.

870
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,010
You know, at are always around
Christmas. I remember what it's called.

871
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:39,650
What was he boys born in a barn,
but they give it some biblical,

872
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,670
what's the name for a Biblical
Barn? I don't give a fuck. Anyways,

873
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:47,630
it says a Scottish cardinal who had
earlier earlier challenged allegations of

874
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:49,550
his sexual impropriety,

875
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:55,370
claims that once again claims at once
again shine an international spotlight and

876
00:54:55,371 --> 00:55:00,371
the alleged alleged sexual abuse evolving
row involving Roman Catholic clergy

877
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,920
reverse course Sunday.
And the guy, I apologize,

878
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:07,820
this is how he apologizes for Bass.
I for as far as I can tell,

879
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:09,800
fucking children in the ass.

880
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:11,370
Yeah.

881
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:11,941
He said,

882
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:16,941
I wish to take this opportunity to
admit that there have been times that my

883
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:21,951
sexual conduct has fallen below the
standards expected of me as a priest.

884
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,480
Archbishop.
And cardinal

885
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:27,880
in recent days,

886
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:32,680
certain allegations which have been made
against me have become public initially.

887
00:55:32,681 --> 00:55:37,681
There are anonymous and nonspecific
nature led me to contest them to those I

888
00:55:38,021 --> 00:55:38,890
have offended.

889
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:44,050
I apologize and ask forgiveness to those.

890
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,360
I've offended.
You know,

891
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,480
I've been lucky enough in my life to
have never been unwantedly fucking banged

892
00:55:52,331 --> 00:55:56,770
in the ass by a fucking priest.
But I don't,

893
00:55:56,771 --> 00:56:01,771
I think I can be empathetic enough
and say that if this was happening,

894
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:04,600
at no point would I be turning
around going, you know,

895
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:08,830
that's what you're doing is
really offensive. I find this,

896
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,010
you know what the fuck.
When you apologize,

897
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:15,110
you should have to say
what the fuck you did.

898
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,640
And if you're going to talk like this,

899
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:21,641
there should be somebody obnoxiously
yelling off the mic like what you did like

900
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:24,220
during this should have been like,

901
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,810
I wish to take each opportunity to
admit that there have been times that my

902
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:33,811
sexual conduct has fallen below the
standards expected of me as a priest.

903
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,930
Yeah. And it's a fucking human being.
You're not supposed to fuck kids.

904
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,970
And regent days,

905
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,480
certain allegations fucking of children
which have been made against me have

906
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,720
become public Bob flock and tie.

907
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:53,080
Initially there are anonymous and
nonspecific nature led me to contest them.

908
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:57,060
How many different ways to play it?
You talk,

909
00:56:57,061 --> 00:57:01,500
you're fucking dead to put in
their ass. You get the point. Um,

910
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,130
good lord to those.
I have offended to those you're raped.

911
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,030
You're a fucking rapist.
And like,

912
00:57:09,031 --> 00:57:12,730
like how like he tries to tie
in the fact that he's a priest

913
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:19,450
like below the standards expected
of me as a priest, Archbishop,

914
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,700
archbishop and Cardinal.

915
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,860
Okay.

916
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,400
So like
what if you,

917
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:31,810
if you were a pope that was okay or
was it because you never became a pope?

918
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,610
So these guys basically been dental and
kids ever since he got into that fucking

919
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:39,310
hurt. How is that thing still
in business is just fucking do,

920
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,360
hey,
what's going on?

921
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:15,060
It's the Monday morning podcasts that
I'm actually doing this week on a Sunday

922
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,700
just because tomorrow, um, I
have to uh, have to be on set.

923
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:25,050
Yeah, look at me. Big Time.
Hollywood guy. Sorry people,

924
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:28,680
I don't have time for you
tomorrow. I have to be on set. Oh,

925
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:33,390
you like that for us.
I'm actually shooting.

926
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:36,840
I'm shooting something tomorrow, so I
got to do that tomorrow. There you go.

927
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:39,330
You like, you like how I worked at
in, you guys didn't even ask me.

928
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,240
I didn't have to tell you.
I'm one of those guys.

929
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,930
I arrogantly work my resume
into every sort of conversation.

930
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,950
You think it's going to rain tomorrow?
Well, you know, when I was taping,

931
00:58:49,951 --> 00:58:54,290
I love the 80s. They were telling me
that tomorrow it's supposed to, you know,

932
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,133
people do that.

933
00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:00,030
Then you want to fucking do something
violent or maybe, maybe not.

934
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,670
Maybe not.
Maybe people aren't like me.

935
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,020
It makes you realize what a
fucking angry asshole I am. Um,

936
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:11,580
on a whole nother level. This past
month, I just, uh, I'm just really,

937
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:16,020
uh,
difficult to be around and um,

938
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,180
that's it. Say, yeah, it's a fucking,

939
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,730
it's a pretty hardcore
moment to have with yourself.

940
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,720
Stay yourself in the mirror
and to be like, dude,

941
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:27,680
if I could somehow walk out of
this fucking situation, I would.

942
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,650
And I was supposed to be here with you.
So, um, anyways, I hope everybody had an,

943
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:38,360
uh, a nice, happy thanksgiving.
I hope you had a good time.

944
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:43,340
And, uh, I had a great one and
a I fucked up last week though.

945
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,760
I was, I was, I had done
basically like, you know,

946
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:50,090
seven attempts at this podcast and uh,
you know,

947
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:54,050
trying to make sure I was thanking
everybody and I totally fucked up on the

948
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:58,310
seventh take and I forgot to
thank uh, Michael Hanes, the uh,

949
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:03,260
the announcer for the Colorado avalanche.
A Guy I met on the road,

950
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,480
whoever dental, he likes my comedy and
found out I was a hockey fan. So the,

951
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,950
he the fuck it avalanche.

952
01:00:09,951 --> 01:00:13,700
We're playing the kings hooked me up
with some tickets and interviewed me in

953
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:16,010
between periods,
you know,

954
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:19,790
like I was fucking Diane Cannon
at a Laker game. You know,

955
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,300
it's sort of a drop off
with celebrity when he got,

956
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:28,070
when you go to the La King game, you
know you go to La Laker game, you know,

957
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,560
who are you going to get? You know you
got Jack Nicholson fucking Willsmith,

958
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,880
all those guys.
Even if he go to a clippers game,

959
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:39,170
Billy crystal sits court side along with
that black dude from a different world

960
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:42,770
where that guy with the glasses,
the round John Lennon glasses.

961
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:47,120
But when you go to a kings game,
now that John Candy died,

962
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,200
actually when did he die? He died a
long time ago. But ever since he died,

963
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,920
the kicks, I like that.
That's like, it's classic La.

964
01:00:54,921 --> 01:00:58,220
When Gretzky showed up then all and all
the fucking people came out, you know,

965
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,050
and then he leaves and John Candy dies.
That was sort of a combo,

966
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,010
you know, boom, boom. And
everyone's like, fucking, I'm
not going to go there. So now,

967
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,890
what am I trying to say here?

968
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,430
I'm trying to say that if they Yanka
celebrity out of the fucking stands at a

969
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:15,740
kings game,
you're going to get somebody at my level,

970
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,160
basically a non celebrity who hasn't had
the decency to at least become fat or

971
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:24,380
an an addict.
So you could enjoy me on a reality show.

972
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:26,720
I am a responsible,

973
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:32,180
semi noticeable human being
who pays his bills on time.

974
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,400
And if that isn't compelling, I don't
know what it is. Actually, you know some,

975
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:40,820
I went to La Kings game one time a long
time ago back at the La Forum and I saw,

976
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,930
uh, I saw, why am I
thinking Mike Adam Lee,

977
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,790
it's not Mike anime.

978
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,800
That was the host of NFL
81 with Bryant Gumbel.

979
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,050
I'm totally going.
Who's the fucking guy who did a he?

980
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,650
Jesus Christ. He was the announcer
when, ah, the miracle on ice.

981
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:07,070
Uh, Michael Al Michaels, Jesus Christ,

982
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:09,170
they go al Michaels was there,
big fan of hockey.

983
01:02:09,171 --> 01:02:12,000
I saw him and I really wanted to
say something to him, but he had,

984
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,050
I could see the wrinkles in his
forehead that he was like, I know,

985
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,860
I know you like me, but please I'm here
with my kid. And I was like, all right.

986
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:22,740
And we set it all with the wrinkles in
our foreheads. Pretty amazing moment.

987
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:25,890
You know, I've always had that kind
of connection with people to be know,

988
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,430
like communicate through the
third eye. Um, all right.

989
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,070
If you knew to my podcasts
where the fucking event,

990
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,220
I've been doing them for
over a year, you know? No,

991
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:38,640
now what you jumping on the bandwagon
because I'm finally over 20 listeners,

992
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,043
you know,

993
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:44,910
because I actually got a compliment today
from somebody in a jolly old England.

994
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,350
I got something in England. Listen
to this shit. He liked that.

995
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,490
I'm on two different continents,
so it's not numbers,

996
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:56,790
it's not the amount of people you
have listening to your podcast.

997
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,600
It's the amount of, of uh, of
countries. All right, look at me.

998
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:05,190
I'm going global just like everybody else,
just like everybody else.

999
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:07,200
So, uh, so anyways, um,

1000
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:10,260
could I really do the podcast and I'll
talk about the guy who got trampled at

1001
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:11,910
Walmart.
I mean,

1002
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:18,300
if it's just fucking unbelievable,
I just don't, I, you know,

1003
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:22,170
how bad is the fucking economy that,
you know,

1004
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:27,171
some guy opening the door to a
fucking store that sells garbage cans,

1005
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:33,600
shack it's,
and fucking rakes gets trampled to death.

1006
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:37,260
What the fuck were those people
running for? I Dunno. I like,

1007
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:40,440
are they trying to say people broke down
the door? I really don't think they did.

1008
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:44,790
I think that they were being pressed
up against it. If you're first in line,

1009
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:48,000
why are you going to break down the
door? You know, think about that analogy.

1010
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,180
You want to be extra first.
That doesn't make any sense.

1011
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:55,460
And people were pushing from behind.
They basically created a,

1012
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:58,170
they had general seating
like the who in Cincinnati.

1013
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,520
He can't fucking do that shit.
And for years, right? Every,
every year at Christmas,

1014
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:04,230
you see the doors,
they burst open.

1015
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,920
There's always a big black girl loses
her fucking wig when she falls on the

1016
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:08,754
ground.

1017
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:14,280
And it always a dirty white dude with
the wranglers and one of his pant legs

1018
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:18,630
gets ripped off as he tries to come
in through the, the overnight mailbox.

1019
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,860
You know, it was inevitable.
It was fucking inevitable.

1020
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:26,190
What of God damn way to go.
That's I absolutely fucking tragic.

1021
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,640
And I don't even know why I brought
it up. I just, I can't get over it.

1022
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:33,450
I can't get over that.
Somebody died doing that.

1023
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:38,730
You know
how you supposed to die at Walmart?

1024
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,750
You know, I dunno. Maybe
you stocking the shelves.

1025
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,690
He just come fucking slamming
down on that linoleum floor.

1026
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:53,190
Even then coma benefit,
you know,

1027
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:56,880
you get to meet the local sports hero.
You know,

1028
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,890
you're out on long island.
Bill Guerin comes in and signs of fucking

1029
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,060
island, his jersey, his just
fucking, and you know, you know,

1030
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:10,770
you're not supposed to die a
Walmart. That's just, that's
like a really, I dunno.

1031
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:14,760
What do you guys think about that?
Do you think Walmart is at fault there?

1032
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,580
Keep me for years. You know, I don't,
I don't know who's at fault there.

1033
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,550
I mean Walmart, you know,
they come into the town,

1034
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,450
they basically fucking fuck over
every small business there. Now,

1035
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:27,370
I bet all those people
with small business owners,

1036
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,960
they don't have any fucking money now.

1037
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:33,220
So now they're pressed up against the
glass. Oh my God, I need to get a rake.

1038
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,030
It's fucking nine. Open the doors. I mean,

1039
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:44,530
they literally created that fucking thing.
Jesus Christ went,

1040
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:47,260
why don't I read before I do these?
I really build.

1041
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:51,130
And they literally created what in your
head. You fucking moron. All right,

1042
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:54,280
let's get to the podcast questions. Like
I said, if you're new to my podcast,

1043
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:57,910
people send me questions. Uh,
they send me comments. They, uh,

1044
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:00,970
they tried to educate me on
certain things and I them,

1045
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:05,170
but it doesn't happen so much
that way because I'm a moron.

1046
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:07,930
So let's get to the first question
of the week. Question number one.

1047
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,470
Boy Did I even think Michael
has. Yeah. So Michael,

1048
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:15,070
thank you very much for putting me on
in between periods, man. That was a, uh,

1049
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,040
it was unbelievable. And,
uh, they actually let me,

1050
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:22,840
had given Peter McNabb let me hang out
as the game started and I really realized

1051
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:25,450
how hard it is to tell stories
as you're watching the game.

1052
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,740
Like I couldn't even focus and
I actually talked over a goal.

1053
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:33,040
I was elite in the middle of telling a
story during a breakaway and I didn't

1054
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,890
even,
I'm so into trying to be funny on TV.

1055
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,910
I didn't notice that it was like a fucking
two on one and then the guy scored.

1056
01:06:39,911 --> 01:06:44,350
So I had to cut my story short by
saying, oops. I was like, yeah.

1057
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,800
Then my dad was crazy. Oops.
That's what I literally said. Oops.

1058
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:52,801
On national television at that point
I wanted to crawl out the studio,

1059
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,390
but it was still awesome.
Anyways. All right, here we go.

1060
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:59,170
Podcast questions of the week.
Question number one, Bill,

1061
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:04,260
have you ever been confronted by midgets
about your bit midgets or done it in

1062
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:09,790
front of midgets? Um,
actually, uh, I had a, uh,

1063
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,940
I had a small person,
whatever you supposed to call them,

1064
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,140
send me an email.
And the bit was basically,

1065
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:21,130
I don't understand why the word
midget is offensive, you know,

1066
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:25,810
it's not like Mitch, it's foot dragged
here from another country, you know,

1067
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,030
packed into a boat,
you know,

1068
01:07:28,031 --> 01:07:32,530
the whole Amistad thing and then
fucking forced to uh, you know,

1069
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,740
have them in 38 of their friends crawl
out of a car in the middle of a circus.

1070
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:39,070
You know, I did jokes like that, you
know, I don't understand. You know,

1071
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,040
it's just a word that's a table.
That's the lamp and you're a midget.

1072
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:46,060
That's how the joke went. Plus Niche. It
sounds tough. Fucking midget, you know.

1073
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:50,380
But then this guy actually a little
person actually wrote me and said,

1074
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:54,490
actually midget is offensive because
it came, I get somebody on Barnum,

1075
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:59,020
Bailey came up with it and it, it's
actually a form of the word and Mitch,

1076
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,480
which I guess is some sort of little bug.

1077
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:06,950
So it somehow came out of that.
So you basically say, Mitch,

1078
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:08,350
you just saying that
they're just a little,

1079
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,840
little bug that you could just step on.

1080
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,200
I'm going to be tier one of their legs
off and watch them run around in a circle.

1081
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:17,900
So yeah, it is offensive. So
I have been confronted, um,

1082
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,420
you know, some left last night, somebody
did a joke about a dwarf and there was a,

1083
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:27,770
I think a little person in the
crowd and, uh, I looked over at him,

1084
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:31,220
so their face, you know,
sorta crinkle up a little bit.

1085
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:33,140
Like even on a holiday weekend,

1086
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:36,560
I have to deal with this and
I felt a little bad for him.

1087
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,250
I try not to look at the crowd
when I talk because uh, you know,

1088
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:44,300
I got a lot of shit that could bug
people. Can I answer that? Okay.

1089
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:47,120
Question number two, Bill. I
want to be a standup comedian.

1090
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,950
Do you want to be a standup comedian?
Sure. We all do. We hear it. The Vri.

1091
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,140
Um, okay. Dave said on insight,

1092
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,210
I'm assuming this is Chappelle
sent on inside the actor's studio,

1093
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:03,410
that if you want to be a standup comedian,
you have to take acting lessons.

1094
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,280
Did you take acting
lessons? Uh, yes, I have.

1095
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,360
Although you would never know it if you
ever saw me act. Thank you. Um, yeah,

1096
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:14,490
I've taken acting lessons and uh,

1097
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:19,880
I haven't taken them in a while, but, um,

1098
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:25,610
I dunno why. I Dunno why I stopped taking
acting lessons. Why did I, you know, why?

1099
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:26,960
Cause I hated the classes.

1100
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,480
They were too fucking long
and then I was always, um,

1101
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:37,670
I dunno, I would, it was always
like that one person who, who, uh,

1102
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:42,080
who sucks so bad that it made
me want to quit the class.

1103
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,580
You know, we used to call them bathroom,
bathroom break guy. Like, you know,

1104
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,490
like when they went up to do this scene,
you went to go take a bathroom break.

1105
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:52,730
But I would tell you this, if you
want to become a comedian, I mean,

1106
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:55,730
I don't know if acting
helps you stand up or not,

1107
01:09:55,731 --> 01:09:58,740
but I know it definitely helps you
when you get to the next level of this

1108
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,050
business when you have to shoot
something like I do tomorrow,

1109
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,620
that a, if you've taken acting
lessons that you had, you know,

1110
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:11,150
you actually know how to do it. So, um,
I mean if you wanted to be a comedian,

1111
01:10:11,151 --> 01:10:12,980
just write five minutes
of shit you think's funny.

1112
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:18,260
Sign up for an open mic when they call
your name, go up there. Um, you know,

1113
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,280
you'll be fine. You don't have
to recite Shakespeare, but, um,

1114
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:24,140
as you get going along,
I would definitely take acting classes,

1115
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,140
improv classes for as much
as comedians make fun of it.

1116
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,000
Improv class has really helped
you. Uh, I think enacting,

1117
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,330
because you're literally
improving with other,

1118
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,910
another person in stand up is so solitary.

1119
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:40,970
You're just standing on
stage in and with the crowd,

1120
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:43,970
but it's still all you and you don't
really have to wait for someone else.

1121
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,820
I could go on forever about
this shit. So yeah, right.

1122
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:49,960
Five minutes of Shit you
think's funny and um,

1123
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:54,110
sign up for an open mic and then, you
know, once you get that thing going, take,

1124
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,033
take anything.

1125
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,270
Sketch a sketch class as
many things as you can learn.

1126
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,940
I would, you know, I mean,

1127
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:05,060
the amount of times I kicked myself
for not learning how to tap dance.

1128
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,640
I mean I just can't tell. No, Kim.

1129
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,680
I was just thinking back to the Vaudeville
days when you had to be a triple

1130
01:11:09,681 --> 01:11:14,130
threat. Funny. Be able to dance and
sing before it became, you know,

1131
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,240
it's like the NFL. You just,
I just play on special teams.

1132
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,280
You know I'm the long snapper.

1133
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,720
You ever feel like football teams back
in the 20s they had like eight guys on

1134
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:27,510
him. All right. Question number
three. All right, Bill. Tonight,

1135
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:31,440
me and my friends were having an art.
We're having an argument about ac DC.

1136
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:35,430
He was saying how Angus young is hands
down the coolest motherfucking guitar

1137
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:38,310
player of all time.
While I agree with that,

1138
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:42,000
I just think it's time for him to
lose the schoolboy outfit. I mean,

1139
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:45,810
isn't a dude like approaching
60 believe it or not,

1140
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:47,910
Angus is only 53 years old.

1141
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:53,220
He made it when he was like 19 or 20 he
was born in 1955 Malcolm young was born

1142
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:56,400
in 1953 and bond Scott I believe,

1143
01:11:56,401 --> 01:12:00,930
was born in 1946 okay.
I just established that I'm a geek.

1144
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:04,260
Now let's get back to ACDC. You
know what, I got to agree with you.

1145
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,000
I think a actually read an article
recently where he was talking about,

1146
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,170
Angus was talking about having to put
on that schoolboy outfit and he said,

1147
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:17,790
and quote unquote, I have
to become that guy. But um,

1148
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:23,160
I dunno, that's a very like I
would totally, I don't know.

1149
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:27,000
What would it look like if Angus
actually puts some jeans on and started

1150
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:30,060
bouncing around the stage like that?
It would definitely take a minute.

1151
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,240
But you're really fucking with,
uh,

1152
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:38,340
the whole formula and ACDC
formula has never wavered.

1153
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,680
They're like,
we're singing about balls,

1154
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:45,681
the devil and Pussy and drinking and
they have not veered away from that for

1155
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:50,670
over 33 years.
So I mean,

1156
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:54,120
I don't know if you put pants on,
is the whole house of cards come down?

1157
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,670
I think it would take a minute,
but I wouldn't have a problem.

1158
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,010
I wouldn't have a
problem you put pants on.

1159
01:12:59,011 --> 01:13:02,250
I really would not have a problem with it.
Um,

1160
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:04,530
you know what they should do?

1161
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:08,010
They should do an ACDC unplugged
where they still play electric.

1162
01:13:08,011 --> 01:13:12,810
But Angus gets to sit down and around
with all the other band members kind of

1163
01:13:12,811 --> 01:13:17,590
like on Elvis has come back special where
it was still like electric. Well, so,

1164
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:22,620
ah, Mama, remember that one?
All right. Um, all right,

1165
01:13:22,621 --> 01:13:26,610
question number four. So not even answer
that, do I think it's time to like,

1166
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,900
I wouldn't bother me,

1167
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:31,940
but I can definitely see why he
continues to wear that outfit because a,

1168
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:36,270
I wouldn't want to fuck with that formula.
So podcast question number four.

1169
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,950
Hey Bill, I signed up
for your email list. Uh,

1170
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:45,790
thanks for the confirmation email.
Very corporate like, yeah, fuck you.

1171
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:48,660
Like I got a guy running my website a
little bit. What do you want from me?

1172
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:53,820
You know, we, we basically have, you
know, my email list on my website.

1173
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,970
Basically what happens is
people who have an AOL email,

1174
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:01,290
if two of them mark you as spam,
you get kicked off the Internet.

1175
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,230
So I'm trying to get rid of all the,
all people who don't want me.

1176
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:08,910
That's why I sent that out. Okay.
And that's why we confirmed it. Okay.

1177
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:13,000
Anyways, he says, I'm 19 and
I haven't sex since 2006.

1178
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:16,510
Jesus Christ. Where's this
going? When I was 16 years old,

1179
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,761
well first of all,

1180
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:22,090
I'm not sympathetic because I didn't
lose my virginity until I was fucking 19.

1181
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,260
Um, I dunno what the Hell's going on. Uh,

1182
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:30,400
and I wanted to know how long your longest
dry streak was and how you ended it.

1183
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:34,690
Well, I just ruined the joke the first 19
years of my life. Uh, how did I end it?

1184
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:39,691
I met some chick who sang in a band who
was fucking about 37 years old and I

1185
01:14:40,151 --> 01:14:44,580
think you can fill in
the blanks. Um, okay.

1186
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:46,960
Well I don't want you saying once,
once I was in the game,

1187
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:50,770
what's the longest I went?
Uh,

1188
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,870
I think the first fucking year and a half,
maybe two years of my comedy career.

1189
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:01,900
I swear to God, I was finishing college.

1190
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:06,130
I was living at home with my parents and
I was doing standup at night. I mean,

1191
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:10,510
I barely had time to rub one out.
Not to mention, I had like, you know,

1192
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:13,360
people say I had,
I have no game with women.

1193
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:18,930
If you know in technically there's
no way to be lower than ground zero.

1194
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:24,460
Somehow I was, I was below,
I was below ground zero.

1195
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:27,130
Have no game with women to the point like,

1196
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:31,840
do you ever hear the end of whole lot of
love when Robert Plant's sings the echo

1197
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:35,830
of what he's about ready to sing comes
first to indicate that he's in hell.

1198
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,840
That's like when I would hit on girls,

1199
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:41,230
the echo of the awful line that I was
going to say to them that that would come

1200
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:41,891
out first.

1201
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:46,060
And then my awful said they were already
walking away before I opened my mouth.

1202
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:49,930
So probably about two years. So what
are you on your about two years? Yeah,

1203
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:52,840
but dude, you know some, I know
another comic he got laid at like 14.

1204
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:56,200
He didn't get laid again
until he was like 18. Um,

1205
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:01,410
don't worry about it. You know, how
can you get out of it? It's just,

1206
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:05,320
it's a numbers game. Just, you know
what, rub one out before you go out.

1207
01:16:05,321 --> 01:16:06,640
So that takes the pressure off.

1208
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:11,110
Now you don't give a shit and then just
go out there and start saying the shit

1209
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:14,560
that your brain is telling you.
Not to say like,

1210
01:16:14,561 --> 01:16:16,120
don't say that that will offender.

1211
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:18,490
That's the kind of shit you
need to start saying. I mean,

1212
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:23,170
I don't mean walk up to
her and just be like, Hey,

1213
01:16:23,171 --> 01:16:24,720
what's up?
You fucking can't.

1214
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:30,670
I'm not saying say that. I'm just
saying that. You know what I mean?

1215
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:36,490
I can't even think of a fucking example.
Just, I dunno. He just, you know,

1216
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:40,030
and you start steering the conversation
towards sex and when she acts like she's

1217
01:16:40,031 --> 01:16:44,400
offended, just tell her that she's
not offended. You know? You know,

1218
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:46,600
you just do that shit.
You just keep it.

1219
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,730
It's one of those things
you just have to learn.

1220
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,160
You have to learn what your
style of being an asshole is.

1221
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,920
This is if you're going
to try to get laid,

1222
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:57,400
if you want to meet the woman of your
dreams, don't do that. Then you have to,

1223
01:16:57,401 --> 01:17:00,810
I guess listen to your heart. And I have
no idea why. It just made me feel creepy.

1224
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,070
Um, which is probably why
not married. Okay. Um, all
right, let's move along. Okay.

1225
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:09,920
Question number five. Thank
you. Thank you. Thank you.

1226
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:14,240
In large capital letters, they're
like, I forgot the word capital,

1227
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:17,480
so I had to say large so I could buy
time in my brain to come up with capital

1228
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:21,620
capital's okay. Um, I'm so tired of
people trashing conspiracy theory.

1229
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:24,950
All this was last week.
Why defendant can sips conspiracy theory.

1230
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:27,800
I'm so tired of people trashing
conspiracy theory without looking into it.

1231
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,170
I'm not saying that all
of the theories are valid,

1232
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:34,640
but I also think people have a tendency
to be, to be questionless sheep.

1233
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,480
I just want to say thank you for telling
those fucks to think for themselves a

1234
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:42,410
bit. Um, yeah, I mean, I
wasn't going in that hardcore.
Yeah. But I definitely think,

1235
01:17:42,411 --> 01:17:46,820
yeah, people just, yeah, if it's on
TV, it's true. If it's on the Internet,

1236
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:50,720
then if that's the Internet's were all
the lies are, that's kind of like racism.

1237
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,420
Like all the racist white
people are just in the south,

1238
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:57,830
but everybody in Connecticut is cool.
You know, those, that type of mindset.

1239
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:01,730
Anyways, here's this question. Why aren't
you coming to Chicago anytime soon?

1240
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:06,090
Make it happen is all I'm
saying. Jesus Christ. All right.

1241
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,360
I'm very demanding.
Um,

1242
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:12,530
while I was there in March when me and
I don't know where the hell you are,

1243
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,430
there's a lot of cities out there.
I try to come through about once a year.

1244
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:21,160
Chicago is definitely on my, uh, I
felt like a politician right now. Yeah,

1245
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,880
we're definitely looking into that and uh,

1246
01:18:23,881 --> 01:18:26,330
it's definitely on the agenda
and when the time is right,

1247
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:30,740
we're going to handle the situation
in Chicago Nets. Next question please.

1248
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:35,390
All right Phil, how many emails do you
get with the word dude in the subject?

1249
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:40,250
Probably a shit ton. Here's another
one. Deal with it. You know,

1250
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:43,520
so I think people are starting to feed
off my attitude where you guys are being

1251
01:18:43,521 --> 01:18:46,670
assholes to me for no reason.
Kind of like how I'm assholes to people.

1252
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,070
The West me questions for
no reason. All right, Bill.

1253
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:52,040
I was making my breakfast
and my 900 square foot,

1254
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,130
$450,000 condo this morning,

1255
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,470
attempting to determine what,

1256
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:02,060
which optane of gasoline I was
going to use to burn down my bank.

1257
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:07,940
Okay. And then finally,
this bailout ass raping,

1258
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,450
uh, really clicked. I mean,

1259
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,970
I knew we were getting bent over
the table on this whole deal,

1260
01:19:13,971 --> 01:19:18,650
but not in such an obvious manner. Our
government is taking our money via taxes,

1261
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:23,250
getting it to bank so they can loan us
our own money back and interest that

1262
01:19:23,251 --> 01:19:27,650
fucking taking our money so they can
loan it back to us for more money.

1263
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:33,020
And the cop mitigating ass
clowns in Washington are
all voting yes on this shit.

1264
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:36,690
How the fuck did this happen?
Um,

1265
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,490
I mean, I don't know,
I'm not in the Senate,

1266
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:42,770
but I would imagine that
if you print the money,

1267
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:44,840
you have enough money
to pay off politicians.

1268
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:50,340
So they basically do whatever the
banks want them to do. I mean, I dunno,

1269
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,220
it's,
it's brutal.

1270
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:57,110
I'm trying to get out from underneath
the house of Rothschild trying to get out

1271
01:19:57,111 --> 01:20:01,340
from underneath the red shield.
That's what I'm doing. Um,

1272
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:05,000
yeah. I don't know what to
tell you do. How do they do it?

1273
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:09,570
Because they're the guys run and
shit. And uh, if you can just print,

1274
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:13,020
what would you do if you
could print money, you know,

1275
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:16,710
and everybody accepted the money
that you are printing. I mean I

1276
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:22,590
could you handle that level of
power. I I couldn't, you know,

1277
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:24,960
and what if your job depending on,
you know,

1278
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,530
dependent on doing what
those guys wanted you to do.

1279
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:33,000
I mean they were right above you.
I guess you would do it right.

1280
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,930
I have no idea. You know
what's fascinating? That's
like I said, like those,

1281
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:41,490
that's like one of those will Smith
summer blockbuster movie kind of plots.

1282
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:43,350
I don't know why they're voting yes on it.

1283
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,620
I think some are voting yes on it because
they want to keep their positions.

1284
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:49,290
I don't think other people are voting
yes on it cause they don't really

1285
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:52,680
understand it. Kind of like
make like you just think, well,

1286
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,550
if we own the old billion dollars,
why don't they just print $1 billion?

1287
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:01,050
Just pay it off.
And the reason is because

1288
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,880
I guess you still owe the money to
the bank because the Federal Reserve

1289
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,250
Princeton and you've got to pay
interest on the billion dollars.

1290
01:21:10,251 --> 01:21:14,430
So you'd never get out of debt.
I Dunno,

1291
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,330
I can't even fucking explain it anymore.
Probably sound like a moron, which I am.

1292
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,980
I've been really meaning to read that
book the case against the Federal Reserve.

1293
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,230
I really have been. All right.
Question number seven. Hey,

1294
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,740
just wondering if you have a version
of the aristocrats joke and what you

1295
01:21:28,741 --> 01:21:33,290
thought of that documentary Jillette
made of it. Um, I don't think Penn,

1296
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,830
I don't think Penn Jillette
made that documentary. I was a,

1297
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:43,560
I'm like, God, I just went blank on his
name. It's another comedian who made that.

1298
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:48,270
Maybe I can Google it, um, on,

1299
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:49,420
anyways,
it's like Google this.

1300
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:54,330
I am DB it Paul Paul
Provenza, he's a guy. Made it.

1301
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:58,740
Paul Provenza directed that. Um, anyways,

1302
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,290
let me get back to the questions
here. Was, I have an incoming call.

1303
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:04,720
I gotta wrap this podcast up here.
All right. What did I think about a,

1304
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:09,030
do I have a version? Do I have a version
of the aristocrats jokes? No, I don't.

1305
01:22:09,031 --> 01:22:12,750
And I never heard of that
joke until I saw the, uh,

1306
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:14,490
the documentary on it.

1307
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,350
I bet in a lot of green rooms and in
16 years coming up on 17 years of doing

1308
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:23,940
stand up, I've never, I never
even heard the joke. So,

1309
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:26,160
uh,
but I thought I liked the movie.

1310
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:30,000
I thought it was funny and Bob Saget was
my favorite because he seemed to be the

1311
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:30,834
guy,

1312
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:35,850
like he was improving so much that he was
making himself laugh at all the filthy

1313
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:40,290
shift that he was coming
up with. Um, and yeah,

1314
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,510
if you haven't seen it, I would definitely
run it cause I think it's a funny,

1315
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,300
funny documentary. There you go. And
it's Paul Provenza not pendula. Alright.

1316
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,060
And I don't even look that up, but I,
I'm pretty sure that's true. All right.

1317
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:51,541
Question.

1318
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:54,900
Are you drinking again so that I can buy
you a bear when you come to Tampa? Yes,

1319
01:22:54,901 --> 01:22:59,100
I am. I am drinking again. Um,
that's the name of my neck. Stand up.

1320
01:22:59,101 --> 01:23:02,130
Special Bill Berg drinking again.
I'm going to come on stage,

1321
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:04,740
completely shit faced and
just fucking berate people.

1322
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,710
I'm glad to see that you're
finally coming by the way.

1323
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:13,300
And what better time than January.
Well, what happens in Tampa in January?

1324
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,070
I guess I'm getting out of the winter.
Um, all right. Overrated. Underrated.

1325
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:21,430
Before I wrap up this podcast,
overrate it, Barack Obama. Seriously,

1326
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:24,790
the guy was senator for two years
and he hasn't even taken office yet.

1327
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,210
And people think he's the second coming.
I'm not hating on the man,

1328
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:31,060
but I'm not ready to worship him yet.
Um,

1329
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,970
well I think a lot of it has
to do with, uh, you know,

1330
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:38,530
just the last eight years
have been a little rough
without getting too political,

1331
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:40,480
you know,
I mean,

1332
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:43,600
George Bush literally should have been
doing speeches with a flashlight under

1333
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:44,140
his chin.

1334
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:47,500
He was so busy scaring the shit out of
people for the last eight fucking years.

1335
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:52,210
I think it's just going to be a
relief to have somebody come in. Uh,

1336
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:56,980
you know, Jesus Christ, just somebody
different, somebody different.

1337
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:00,430
But yeah, I mean of the elders, you
know, just feel good thing. Yeah.

1338
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:01,690
We elected a black guy.

1339
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:06,640
That means we're not as ugly
a country as we were before.

1340
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,170
You know, I don't know. I
think everybody's life is
in the shitter and that,

1341
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:14,950
just hoping that somebody
can do something. But I
definitely agree with you.

1342
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:18,520
If you're waiting for one guy to take
that office and to turn your life around

1343
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:22,420
you, uh, you know, it's kind of
like when I get in this business,

1344
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:24,340
you get a manager and an
agent, you're like, well,

1345
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,520
I guess I don't need to do any more work.
They just going to bring shit to me.

1346
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,180
It doesn't work that way. All
right. Underrated. Playoff hockey.

1347
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:32,920
Every round is so fucking intense.

1348
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:37,240
And the fact that they play a seven game
series makes the drama in the bad blood

1349
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:40,090
continue for one game to the next.
Uh,

1350
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:44,890
I would definitely say that I think
the NHL package is a underrated.

1351
01:24:44,891 --> 01:24:49,030
I have that. Here's the last one and
then I'm wrapping this up for this week.

1352
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,050
Um, overrated. I love this
one. This is such a great one.

1353
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,530
Overrated first impressions.
Uh,

1354
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,020
my first impressions are wrong.
Most of the time,

1355
01:24:59,021 --> 01:25:03,180
society needs to drop the significance
of first impression. There go,

1356
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:07,750
there goes me generalizing. Maybe.
Um, I just have horrible judgment.

1357
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,150
Now you don't, I think that's great. Yeah.

1358
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:14,110
My first impressions are mostly wrong
and people's first impressions of me,

1359
01:25:14,111 --> 01:25:16,330
a lot of times the wrong,
um,

1360
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:21,820
I think they are my girlfriend staring
at me right now. Like bullshit. You know,

1361
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:26,170
I fuck you. It's true. This is the
deal. You know what? This is what,

1362
01:25:26,171 --> 01:25:30,970
this is what I found.
If you're a quiet person and you meet an,

1363
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,300
an a, uh, an insecure person,

1364
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,750
they misinterpret your quietness for
arrogance and they start thinking,

1365
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:40,690
this guy thinks he's fucking better than
me. Then they think you're a Douche bag.

1366
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,280
That's what people used to think of me
before I became a loud mouth asshole and

1367
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:48,890
removed all doubt that I am an
arrogant cunt. But a lot of shy,

1368
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:54,130
a lot of people considered arrogant
are, are not arrogant. They're fucking,

1369
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:56,890
you know,
that doing what I'm doing,

1370
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,830
they're being quiet because
they're questioning everything
they did in the last

1371
01:25:59,831 --> 01:26:03,560
17 minutes.
I don't know if that makes sense,

1372
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:05,750
but I definitely think that's
true because I, you know,

1373
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,950
there's a number of people I thought
were dicks when I first met him and it

1374
01:26:09,951 --> 01:26:11,360
turned out that I was the Dick.

1375
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:14,300
And then there's been other
people I've been like, you know,

1376
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,540
this guy's a cool fucking guy.
He's a real cool guy.

1377
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:21,980
And then they turn out to be a
complete psycho. So, uh, I dunno,

1378
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,230
I don't know what to tell you what,
that,

1379
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:27,200
that's like that thing where he went
for every saying there's another saying

1380
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:30,470
that can fucking cancel it out.
Penny saved is a penny earned.

1381
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:32,960
You've got to spend money to make money,
walk softly,

1382
01:26:32,961 --> 01:26:36,380
carry a big stick greasy wheel.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

1383
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,250
You know what I mean? Does that even
make sense? I don't fucking know.

1384
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:44,150
Cause, yeah, your first impressions,
you know, your mind might be wrong,

1385
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:47,720
but then you gotta go with your gut,
you know,

1386
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:49,870
that got that says,
uh,

1387
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,870
I shouldn't turn this trek because I
think this person's going to snap my neck.

1388
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,810
You know,
it's the prostitute that listens to that.

1389
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:00,560
They're the ones they get to continue
living the dream of sucking cock until

1390
01:27:00,561 --> 01:27:02,440
they're 55,
you know,

1391
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:06,770
and finally having enough money to get
out from underneath their pimp to go to

1392
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:09,260
night school. Those are the ones
because they listen to that gut.

1393
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:12,030
But I got to admit, yeah, I would
have to go with you on the first, uh,

1394
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:12,711
that I mentioned.

1395
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:17,540
I bought a Credenza and you believe
that most adult thing I ever did,

1396
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,540
I like looking at him pretending like I
have some sort of official business to

1397
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:25,100
do. Um, okay. That's it.
And uh, other than that,

1398
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,440
um,
well I got,

1399
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:31,820
I got Carolyn Carolyn's coming up this
week. I got a brand new hour for you.

1400
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:35,900
So all you bastards who are
still full of Turkey, um,

1401
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,690
hit the fucking treadmill and come
down to the club. I got a brand new,

1402
01:27:38,691 --> 01:27:42,590
our shit that I'm really proud of and I'm
putting it together and hopefully I'll

1403
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:47,591
be taping another special next year so
I can get on this doing a special every

1404
01:27:47,691 --> 01:27:49,100
two,
two and a half years.

1405
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,610
So why can have some sort of body
of work at the end of this shit?

1406
01:27:52,611 --> 01:27:56,270
But I will not take any
special before its time.

1407
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:00,110
What, what fucking, what,
what a, what? Advertise.

1408
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:03,780
And we will serve no wine
before it's time. No,

1409
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:08,750
fuck was that, I can't
remember. Anyways, that's it.
Everybody have a good week. And,

1410
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:10,820
uh,
keep the podcast questions coming.

1411
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:15,170
And people keep asking me if I'm going
to be on Facebook. Um, I like my space.

1412
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,550
You know what I mean? I, you know, I like,
I gotta be loyal somewhere in my life.

1413
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:23,870
I'm sticking it out with these
fucking guys. And, uh, you know,

1414
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:26,220
I'm going to go through a couple
of rough years with my space when,

1415
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:28,280
when we look in, like, I'm
still wearing bell bottoms,

1416
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,950
but eventually it's going
to come back in style again.

1417
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:35,900
And you guys can all be like, oh yeah
man, I'm fucking back on my space again.

1418
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:39,080
And I'd be like, Oh yeah man.
Well I never fucking left.

1419
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:43,040
So that means I'm cooler than you and
that'll make me feel good for six minutes

1420
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:45,620
before it become miserable again.
All right everybody,

1421
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:48,800
thank you so much for listening to the
podcast. I hope you all have a great week.

1422
01:28:48,801 --> 01:28:52,340
Thanks again to Michael Hanes for
letting me sit in on the ass game. Sorry,

1423
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:56,540
I didn't think last week I fucking
space cause I'm a moron. And uh,

1424
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:57,560
how about those broken?

1425
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,620
Any hockey fans out there
hiding Canadian out there?

1426
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:04,530
How can we not talking to any shit?
You like those two watts as you took it,

1427
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:08,250
the hands of the points this month.
And Are you singing jackasses?

1428
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:12,920
Goddammit. The fucking, you
gotta respect the Canadian.

1429
01:29:12,921 --> 01:29:15,760
So I saw him the other night coming
back against the buffalo Sabres.

1430
01:29:15,761 --> 01:29:20,370
So sons of bitches, those fucking people
start singing. It's like gladiator.

1431
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,230
And all of a sudden though,
does,

1432
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,110
if they start skating faster and then
you just know they're going to score that

1433
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:29,370
goal to fucking tie it up every God damn
time. It's like watching Derek Jeter,

1434
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:33,690
guy on his tie and runs on second, you
know he's going to slap, it's a right.

1435
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:36,780
He's going to go the other way with it.
He's going to hit a double,

1436
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:40,020
you know he's actually going to do okay
for all you fucking American League

1437
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:43,740
pitchers. He's going to look
for fast ball. The first
pitch, that's what he does,

1438
01:29:43,741 --> 01:29:46,890
and he tries to pull it every
fucking time. In that situation,

1439
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,170
that's what he looks for.
Okay?

1440
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,390
But then if you give it to them
out over the plate, he'll kill.

1441
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:54,540
Take what he gives you and then he
slaps it to right field. All right,

1442
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:58,890
so why don't you throw a high fucking
inside fastball that the bottom drops out

1443
01:29:58,891 --> 01:30:02,280
of and at least get strike one on
the fuck. Can you please do that?

1444
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:08,370
Okay. Sorry. It's got a little
upset there. I actually,
you know, next time I go,

1445
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:09,480
I know when I'm in New York,

1446
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:14,120
if you're a Yankee fan and he'd
come out to my Caroline show, uh,

1447
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:19,160
if you want to see my impression of
Derek Jeter at taking a strike right down

1448
01:30:20,221 --> 01:30:24,200
the center of the plate, if you
want me to do that impression, um,

1449
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:27,990
just yell out there in the show. I'm
actually encouraging people to heckle me.

1450
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:30,210
What am I doing? Or
whatever. After the show,

1451
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,050
I'll give you my
impression of Derek Jeter.

1452
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:39,170
Add Bat standing there that does not
move off the shoulder and it's a strike

1453
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,770
right down the center of the plate.
Without a fucking doubt, it is a strike.

1454
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,770
A goddamn moron could call it a strike.

1455
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,800
I will do my impression of
his body language taking
strike right down the plate.

1456
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:54,690
How many different times you're going
to explain it. All right, I'm done.

1457
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:55,733
Have a great day.

1458
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:09,350
