1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,530
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:08,360
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, September 11th,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,010
2017 what's going on? How are Ya?
How's it going? How's it going?

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,700
Um, more hurricanes, more hurricanes.

5
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:20,060
And this is the 70th anniversary of
the attacks on the World Trade Center.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,503
Okay.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,140
The Pentagon and then the one that went
down to Pennsylvania, you know, I mean,

8
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,030
Jesus Christ,
what is going on this week?

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,500
It's just all gloom and
frigging do you know,

10
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:36,700
I was sitting there watching the
news, the news with Nia, right?

11
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:41,620
And they're showing highlights of this.
Um, was it hurricane Irma is what it is.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,770
Jim or safe was coming into fucking Miami.
Right?

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,850
And there's some fucking white dude
out there of course being like, well,

14
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:52,270
you know, it's no come down
real hard. They show like
five white people out there.

15
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:55,450
And Nia literally said to me, she
goes, what is wrong with white people?

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,220
Okay,

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,040
Eh, the lab. I was like, you
know, we, for the most part,

18
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:06,300
we grew up in called the sex. There's
no excitement. There's no drive.

19
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,670
Bys is no, uh, you know,

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,100
cops beat me up for no reason. Generally
speaking, you know, it's gonna hey,

21
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:17,820
knock it off over there. Straight
up. I know your father. You know,

22
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,410
it's Kinda like that.
So I guess, you know,

23
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:22,890
a hurricane comes around you where you
need a story. Shit, you need a story.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,040
I have no idea why I came up with a hacky
eighties joke though about fucking the

25
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,420
hurricanes. It's, it's, it's,

26
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,930
why don't they have all the
people's Dan with a report?

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,050
Because the report has never died.

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,110
They're always standing in the fucking
middle of the shit. I don't know how,

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,740
I don't know how these news agencies
know exactly where to fucking stand,

30
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:48,570
but somehow they stand just enough in
the shit. I don't buy it. I don't buy it.

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,820
Um,
she has one of them died yet,

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,493
you know,

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,890
out of fuck. I mean, how the
fuck did that, you know, Jesus
bells spit it out. Sorry.

34
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:01,230
I flew today. Once I fall, I'm already
dumb. But once I fly it just, you know,

35
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:06,120
breathing that fucking
pressurized air up there. Um,

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,080
I mean, it's fucking inevitable. If you
stand out inside in a fucking hurricane,

37
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,510
someone's going to fall on top of it.
It's bad enough.

38
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,690
Like I love when they sit there and they
tell these people, you need to evacuate.

39
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:20,890
You got to get out of the, and it's
like, and go where? To my summer home.

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,360
Don't you remember the fucking bags left
half this country upside down in their

41
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:29,460
fucking house.
It's fucking unreal.

42
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,610
I don't understand like where these
people are supposed to go. Like where,

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,480
where do they go?

44
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:36,270
Everybody just goes north and sits
in a fucking waffle house for three,

45
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,960
four days. All the hotels get bought up.
And if you don't have money, what do you,

46
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,320
what? What are you supposed to do? Um,

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,780
anyways, at least it was knocked
down to a, to a category three men.

48
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,630
I read some fucking, you know,
it's some horrible shit about, uh,

49
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,760
Houston that's still going on now is
all mold and it's all in here. You know,

50
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,650
you don't need to listen to this.
You see it all fucking day.

51
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:03,040
This is all just gloom and doom,
all fucking misery here. So, um,

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,810
why don't I go to something positive?
I actually a friend of the podcast,

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,750
one of the great traumas of all time,
Steven Atla, uh, he sent me this thing.

54
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,490
He's got a, uh, they're doing
something for Ronnie James Dio. Um,

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,870
on October 6th,

56
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,640

bowling tournament. All right.

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,960
Oh fuck. I'm not going to be able to
read this. I can't. Okay, here we go. Oh.

59
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,410
Gotta love that. You can enlarge. Wish
I could do this to the world, man.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,220
I have to get glasses. Why won't I just
give into the fact that I need glasses?

61
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,040
All right. October six, 2017,

62
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,090
6:30 PM celebrity bowling tournament.
Both for Ronnie.

63
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,910
Oh, for God's sake. Steven,
where's it going to be at?
Oh, it pins bowling center.

64
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,100
One, two, six five five
Ventura Boulevard, studio city,

65
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,310
California nine one six
oh four go down there.

66
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:04,390
It's for a great cause and a, you
know, have you self a white Russian,

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,270
you know, and tell Donnie
to shut the fuck up. Okay.

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,100
And it'd be down there for a
great cause. Alrighty. They go,

69
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,160
I'll have put up a link.

70
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm going to post the whole a
flyer on the Monday morning.

71
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,280
Thingamajig there's another guy got
the TV on there and I'm on my Twitter

72
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,440
account.
There's a guy standing out there,

73
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,470
Jesus Christ standing out
there in the fucking rain.

74
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,710
Like the video al Roker is out there.

75
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,530
Okay.

76
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,560
How many hurricanes is that poor bastard
stood down and now it's going up to

77
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:41,490
Tampa and then it looks like it's going
to go right over the Florida gators

78
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:46,190
football stadium
somehow die around fucking Macon,

79
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:48,560
Georgia. And is that what they
said? Is that the trajectory?

80
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,180
I don't know what. Um, anyways, um,

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,240
so I was in a miss shippy
flew into fucking miss share
pay on Thursday night and

82
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:03,510
I missed the entire New
England patriots game.

83
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,570
And from what I've heard as a patriots
fan was probably better to just landed,

84
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,570
find out that they got the
shit kicked out of them.

85
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,960
Really just kind of in the
fourth quarter though. I mean,

86
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,410
it was kind of a shootout with no
fucking defense as far as I could tell.

87
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,020
The chiefs are all excited doing fucking
cartwheels cause they let up fucking 27

88
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,420
points. I don't know what
they're so fucking excited about,

89
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,930
but I will tell you as a patriots fan,
I'm pretty fucking happy.

90
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,980
Now I'm going to tell you
why I want to tell you why,

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,960
because I don't like the fucking worst
thing ever is when before you even start

92
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,650
the season, those fucking
hacks on this sports shows go.

93
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,720
You know they talk about
your team like they go right?

94
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,210
They start doing that shit. So before
the fucking season, our restarts,

95
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:50,160
you already got that
fucking monkey on your back.

96
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,440
Every fucking fat Douche who never got
picked in gym class coming in with his

97
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,520
fucking loafers and his
sweaters in India locker room,

98
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,950
just trying to rip the team apart
and just adding just distraction.

99
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,330
So right out of the gate we fucking lose.
All of that is gone.

100
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,050
And then immediately they go,
oh wait a minute, wait a minute.

101
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,970
Remember when you say in Tom Brady is
the after his last game was the greatest

102
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,530
without a doubt of all time.

103
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,770
Now with the exact same people one
fucking game later saying he's too old.

104
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,180
So I'm loving that. I'm loving
all of that. What would you know,

105
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:33,050
I would actually love if
we lost next week too,

106
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:36,650
but then they would have all this, you
know what's cause a toddler hit the panic,

107
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,940
blah blah blah. You'd have to
deal with that. So I'm hoping,

108
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,160
you know they were in the next three,
four they lose another one,

109
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:47,060
four and two and then they're five
just nobody's paying attention. No,

110
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,240
they treat us like the Indianapolis
Colts man when they were 13 and oh and

111
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,160
nobody said Shit for
whatever fucking reason,

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,400
which is really a reoccurring
thing with the Indianapolis Colts.

113
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,830
No matter what they do.
Hearing aids in the fucking helmets,

114
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,760
fucking pumping crowd noise in tank
and the final third of a season to get

115
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:06,320
Andrew luck steel and the
Patriots' offense fucking
being on the rules committee,

116
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:11,180
changing the rules of passing and
on and on and fucking on. Right.

117
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,140
Go on 13 and oh,
nobody's saying shit.

118
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,300
Oh they're just a bunch
of country boys out there.

119
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,450
We won't pay attention to them.
I love it. I love that we, uh,

120
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,890
I mean I hate our fucking defense,

121
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:25,700
but I haven't liked our defense
since we won our first three. Um,

122
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,520
I think ever since then we've
always been like a, you know,

123
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,790
well we're going to score,
you already going to score
35, we're going to score 38.

124
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,700
I always just, I just Kinda feel like
we've been like that for too long.

125
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,770
And occasionally we've broadened,

126
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,030
we brought in a shutdown
corner like a Revus um,

127
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,350
oh they take whatever the fuck his name
was who was here for like a year or two.

128
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:47,630
He was fucking great. But then all
of a sudden they're like, yeah,

129
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:51,860
okay now I want to get paid.
They like, yeah, Nah, Nah.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,410
So, um, anyways, yeah. So I just,

131
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,120
I watched a little bit of the highlights.
I mean

132
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,260
when you give up an 85 yard
touchdown in your corner,

133
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,500
like fucking lets the guy go by him cause
he thinks that he's got help over the

134
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,300
top and the guy just isn't there.
I mean,

135
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,570
I really don't think that's the chiefs
kicking our ass as much as that's

136
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,183
mmm.

137
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,110
Just horrible defense.
You know what I mean?

138
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,710
I would say though that that guy
running for like 6,000 yards against us,

139
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,270
it's definitely a concern.
But you know,

140
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,870
what are we supposed to win it
every fucking year? You know?

141
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,150
I'm all right with it. I love it. I
love it. So there we go. So now what?

142
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:34,230
Now what we go 11 and five.
They'll fix it, but I don't know.

143
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,540
You know,
we don't,

144
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,280
we always fucking have guys and then they
make the pro bowl and then they asked

145
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,920
for more money. Then we let him go and
then we got to build it back up again.

146
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:46,090
So we'll see. It is definitely towards
the end of Tom Brady's career. You know,

147
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,550
I don't know how it could
have gone any fucking better.

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,250
MMM.

149
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,970
You know, what are you going
to tell me what the you do?

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
You know why so many people
out about that? Aside

151
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,040
from the fact that they hate the
patriots, it's, that's how people,

152
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,890
that's how most people live their lives.
You know,

153
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:05,050
they take one loss and
they just pack it in.

154
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,023
Oh,

155
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,110
and I'm including a lot of
patriots fans, you know, those ag,

156
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:13,790
but she can never listen
to those sports shows.

157
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,820
Cause even like the people who call in,
you know,

158
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,710
they always use words like concerned,

159
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,220
Oh dre, right now I'm really concerned
about our past DeepBench on dirt Jones

160
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,080
are you, what are you concerned
about as if you're like, you're,

161
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:32,330
you're a part of the coaching
staff and if it doesn't work,

162
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:33,320
you're going to get fired.

163
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:35,900
You're gonna have to put your
house up for sale and reload,

164
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,040
relocate your kids once again.
What exactly are you concerned about?

165
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,960
Um, but congratulations to
the chiefs. I've actually,
I've always liked the chiefs.

166
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,360
Um, I used to always watch the Superbowl
highlights and that one with tanks,

167
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,620
tramp, you know, 64 talks, power trap. It
was always like the one of the great ones.

168
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,990
She's just sitting there
laughing his fucking balls off.

169
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:56,990
And everybody loved that back then.
But now if they had that audio,

170
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,640
he'd have to issue an apology to the
Minnesota Vikings and bud grant in the

171
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:05,510
family and all that
bullshit. But um, so anyways,

172
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,570
I was flying back from Alabama and uh,

173
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:11,920
so the only football games I was
able to catch, I watched the uh,

174
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,240
Green Bay Seattle game, which I
know Seattle fans, hey, cause they,

175
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,620
they definitely seem like they were
getting the short end of the stick.

176
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:23,300
Certainly on that phantom punching
a injection, which I didn't see.

177
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:28,130
I just saw the replay of it. Of course
it happened on a fucking pick six.

178
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,880
Always fun to watch Pete Carroll
loop blow a fucking gasket.

179
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,060
But that guy is a great coach and that's,
that's a great defense.

180
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:39,830
You know what I mean? The fucking legion
to do, you know, legion of boom, sorry,

181
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,720
boom.
Right in your ass with the steroids.

182
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,370
Okay.

183
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,850
Fuck all you guys. If you're going to
bring up every fucking God damn time,

184
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,050
Jesus Christ, we bend a card in fucking
New England. I'm fucking trashed.

185
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:55,641
And everybody,

186
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:59,510
I am doing research on all your fucking
teams and I'm going to do what you guys

187
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,510
do every fucking time. You give me
shit about my, I'm fucking fine.

188
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,020
I'm going to fucking look in
the corners of your franchise.

189
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,920
Jesus Christ's like 30% of
that fucking team tested pause,

190
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,240
defense tested positive for fucking
steroids and this still just talking about

191
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,880
how great they are.
Unbelievable.

192
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:21,290
That's another colts won that gout caught
the fucking allegedly deflated ball,

193
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,950
which was never fucking proven.

194
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,333
MMM.

195
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,150
It's never fucking proven yet.
Tom Still got fucking suspended.

196
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,810
Everybody's basically paying the price
for the under suspension of Ray Rice.

197
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:35,970
I think when they go into Roger Goodell,
um,

198
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,450
how site would see that the
Patriots lost after the, uh,

199
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,500
those barstool guys had that hilarious t
shirt to him, just like a fucking clown.

200
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,680
Is there anything better than just
call and say he's a fucking clown?

201
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
All your accomplishments just go right
out the window. They're fucking guy.

202
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:56,470
Roger Goodell makes $30 million a year,
$30 million a year,

203
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:59,080
and you can catch a walk into his car
and you're going to tell you you're a

204
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:04,030
fucking clown. I'm telling you, as much
as he has $30 million puppy, seven,

205
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:06,400
16, after taxes, it bugs him.

206
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,190
He's going to be thinking about it
when he's drinking his little donkeys,

207
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:13,210
coffee in the morning. Fuck is that
guy to call me clown talking himself.

208
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,530
You know, when he's putting his suit on
and he's got the jacket, tie and shirt,

209
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,140
he looks like one of those guys.
He gets everything on.

210
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,990
He puts the pants on last Clooney
already has his shoes on with the fucking

211
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:23,890
socks in the sock.

212
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,980
Garters you're going and talking to
himself as he's adjusting the nut in the

213
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:31,950
fucking, the night right there and
then in the mirror. Um, so anyways,

214
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,550
so I watched that game
and uh, the defenses, uh,

215
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,950
look to obviously great and those
fucking games. And uh, and now I got the,

216
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,590
I got the cowboys and giants
in the background. Um,

217
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,250
I did watch the Moto GP race. I
just watched the uh, the big boys.

218
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:51,580
I didn't get to watch a moto GP,
three or two,

219
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:55,780
but what a fucking race about mark mark
has just saying, you know, Davinci also,

220
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:58,470
it's just like, hey man, I'm going to
take, I'm going to take the bucket points.

221
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,660
Mark Marquez is like,
fuck that. Fuck that.

222
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,150
I'm going for the victory for you
guys at all. Watch motorcycle racing.

223
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:08,380
It was raining out and they still race.
They don't quite go as fast,

224
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:13,381
but they were going like over 150 miles
an hour in the fucking rain on each

225
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:17,880
other's asses. And this guy, what the
fuck was his name? He started the race.

226
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,250
He fucking shot right up
the side in the first place.

227
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:24,010
What the Fuck is be able to pee? I can't,
I don't know. I'm new to this sport.

228
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:28,270
I don't know all their names.
So anyways, now it did.

229
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,810
It was that guy a bill.

230
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,720
Why don't you just look this shit up so
he can tighten? You know what happened?

231
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:38,920
He just can't remember the fucking names.
What was the guy's name? Larry Legend.

232
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:42,010
Is that the guy who fucking shut up
and first before he fucking wiped out,

233
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:45,160
there's more goddamn
accidents today or yesterday,

234
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,740
I should say when they were
racing. And uh, anyways,

235
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,370
everything that Formula
One needs moto GP has,

236
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,900
it was a race right down to the end. And
fucking Mark Marquez said, fuck this,

237
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,970
I'm going for the points.
Because if he got the 25,

238
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,320
he was going to be tied with Da.
Oh.

239
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:03,940
So he passed them on the fucking last
lap or second to last lap and then held

240
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:08,710
them off. Um, you know, there was
some film Nicholson Shit, you know,

241
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm not going to fucking, you know, just
try and get back out on the fairway.

242
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:12,910
I'm going to try to put it in the hall,

243
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,390
then I'm going to four point and
walk away with sweaty tits. I mean,

244
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,580
that's what this man did,
but basically on a motorcycle.

245
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,460
So that was very enjoyable.
Uh, but let's get down.

246
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,490
Let's talk about going down south now
that the Patriot season is evidently over

247
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:31,960
and Tom Brady is a over
the hill. Um, you know,

248
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,140
the Atlanta Falcons won today
in the New England patriots.

249
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,320
Lost the exact opposite thing
that happened the last time. Um,

250
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,170
so there you go. I don't know what that
means. I'm sure Atlanta Falcon fans,

251
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:47,560
if they could switch, you
know, the results with the
Patriots, I think they would,

252
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,710
you know, but evidently the fucking
football sky is falling. Um,

253
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,960
you know what I fucking
hate about fantasy football?

254
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,390
That is literally taken over like um,

255
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,750
they used to have like in the
sports pages, he used to just have,

256
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,310
they would have like the leaders,
it was sunny.

257
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,930
It was really easy to find the leaders.

258
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,910
You could collect football cards and shit.

259
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,160
I used to know so much
more about the game.

260
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,960
I don't know anybody's
fucking name anymore.

261
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,730
Anytime you go to any sort of website
where they have like fantasy, they the,

262
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,760
when you want to look at stats,
it's all this fantasy football shit.

263
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,970
Get this guy on your team.

264
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,600
Peyton Manning's fucking
advertising that stuff.

265
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,840
Okay.

266
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,130
I Dunno. Should I just give in,
should it just give, I don't want it.

267
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:30,120
I don't want to do that shit.

268
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,090
I don't want to have somebody
on a team that I actually,

269
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,710
I don't really hate any
other team in the NFL.

270
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:37,770
Do I hit anything I hate
gym or say that's it.

271
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,490
That's the only person I don't like.
You know,

272
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,140
there's certain people that act like
fucking idiots in the league that I don't

273
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:46,530
particularly care for, but that
I don't hate the team. You know?

274
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,060
Here's another classic.

275
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:51,210
The cowboys are probably going to beat
the giants cause this is what the cowboys

276
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:54,060
and giants to the cowboys win in
the beginning part of the year.

277
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,640
And then the giants always
fucking losing in the end.

278
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,370
They come back around and they do
the same thing down in New York.

279
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,620
So time to move on from Ely,

280
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,900
he only steps up in every fucking big
moment in January his entire career.

281
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,670
I think it's time to get rid of him
because he fucked up in September.

282
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,163
Um,

283
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,350
yeah.

284
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,790
You know, I didn't even want
me to look this shit up.

285
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,460
Did that as Zq Elliot
guy play seems to me.

286
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,040
What's weird is they threw out
his case in the real world.

287
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:25,490
Yeah.

288
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,020
But it's like in the NFL,
you need less burden of proof.

289
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,423
Okay.

290
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,260
Elliot cowboys,
is that his fucking name?

291
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,630
Uh,

292
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,440
Elliot cowboys to play.
Is he playing judge grants?

293
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:46,830
Temporary restraining order requests
for Dallas cowboys running back probably

294
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:50,760
from that cycle. What would the
person of seeming like a psycho.

295
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,260
Okay. Is He, cause he goes,
I'll, it really makes you,
I've been out of the loop.

296
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,750
All right, so he played,
that's good. That's good.

297
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,780
Cause the clown was going to over suspend
them. The ALGA, that's the NFL is back.

298
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,490
And so at the 15 reasons
it's a complete disaster.

299
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,020
Hey, y'all bought those Los Angeles Rams
coming back wearing the lumbar Lundy.

300
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:16,320
Fucking blue and white.
The fearsome foursome.

301
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,840
Merlin Olsen. Rosey Greer. Was it
Lamar Lundy? I always forget him.

302
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,910
And then uh, what's his face there?
Ah, I can never name all four of them.

303
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,080
I always end up forgetting one.

304
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,800
I always remember Merlin Olsen
Rosey Greer out Jesus Christ.

305
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,140
The coolest one of them are Deacon
Jones and it was at Lamar, Lamar,

306
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,650
Lamar,
Lamar Lundy.

307
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,920
Is this even a podcast? Is this, you guys
listen to me fucking yeah, there you go.

308
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:48,170
Right. Lamar Lundy, was he a stealer
or was he a Ram? He was a Ram Lamar.

309
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,980
Lauren Graham's fearsome. I right. I got

310
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,920
it. All right. So anyways, let's get,
let's, let's, I'm not watching TV anymore.

311
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,060
Now I'm focused.

312
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,270
Yeah.

313
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,820
Now I'm focused. Oh,
is Eli driving him in?

314
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,450
What's he got his second and eight,
eight oh nine to go in the third quarter.

315
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,530
Eli calling a fucking
audible over the metal,

316
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:11,980
foreign affairs down,
moving the ball.

317
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,040
Cowboys fans are all going to be fucked
saying you need to fucking bench fucking

318
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,430
quarterback and bring back Roger
Stolle back. Um, so we did the, uh,

319
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:25,870
the Horseshoe Casino in Mississippi.
I had so much fucking fun doing that.

320
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,163
MMM.

321
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,490
Although it was just a part of the south
man that was just deep, deep, deep,

322
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,180
deep south, deep south.
Hang a fucking right.

323
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,790
Don't stop.
And Alabama keep going.

324
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,140
Stop right before you get
the fucking wheezing. Know.

325
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,660
And um, it was just, I dunno,

326
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,190
the pace of the people down there was
driving me fucking nuts. You know,

327
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,660
I ordered room service twice.

328
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:56,390
I kept ordering water and they
just wouldn't bring it up to me.

329
00:18:56,391 --> 00:19:00,510
So the second time I said,
did you, where's the glutton?
Is there a glass of water?

330
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,430
And she's like, well, now I'm try.

331
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,290
Yeah.

332
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,260
And I'm like, and, and
that's what's on the tray.

333
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,490
It's just fucking walks out.
There's no, Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,640
I'll go get you some.
It's like it wasn't on the tray.

335
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,760
So then I go to use it like
nothing fucking worked.

336
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,720
I go to use the fucking irony board.
The ironing board was fucked up.

337
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,260
I was trying to make it stand up.
It wouldn't stand up.

338
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:29,970
I had to bend the piece back.
It wouldn't.

339
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:33,630
And then I finally just had a fucking
meltdown and I'm admitting this to the

340
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:38,280
casino. I jumped up and down on it
and then I pulled the shark nose back.

341
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,210
I felt bad afterwards and I tried to
bend it back, but it's all fucked up.

342
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:46,560
If you wonder why it's fucked up, I
finished it off. It was already fucked up.

343
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,250
So if you want to send me
a bill, I apologize. Um,

344
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,250
and then the next day meet Dean and Bart.

345
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:57,000
Nick drove over and to
Tuscaloosa to go on.

346
00:19:57,001 --> 00:20:01,980
We went to go see Alabama
versus Fresno state. Uh,

347
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,580
we had a great fucking time.
Um, we met some people there,

348
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,780
some friends of mine and a,
they hooked us up. We were,

349
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:11,790
and I think this fucking
skybox no sunburn. You know,

350
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:16,350
it was a cupcake game. Who's kidding? Who
Against Fresno state. It was a day game.

351
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,960
It's like I went,
but I have to go back there again.

352
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:21,600
I want to go there and night game
when they play like Texas a and M,

353
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:24,450
Mississippi or fucking,
you know,

354
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:28,140
anybody like Lsu or some shit like that.

355
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,870
I want to go back for that and I want to
sit in the fucking crowd the next time.

356
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,950
Um, this was like, it was too nice.
It was awesome. I had a great time,

357
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,610
but it was like a, I didn't, I didn't
get to feel the crowd a little bit,

358
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,550
which was perfect because I had a
show that night, so I didn't drink.

359
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:44,340
I'm still not drinking and I didn't
get a sunburn. So it worked out for me,

360
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:48,100
but I feel like I kind of
went to a preseason game. Um,

361
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,080
so we're walking out of
there and fucking Joe Barton.

362
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:56,860
It's somehow found the one
Russian guy in Alabama.

363
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,100
Then shit escalated quickly.

364
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,590
Okay.

365
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,290
You know, bardic walks up
to the guy, the guy, uh,

366
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,410
I don't know how they got
into a conversation. The
Guy said he was, somehow,

367
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:10,520
he said he, he always heard his talk
and he mentioned, said something to us,

368
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,740
we're waiting for the elevator.
And the guy said that he was Russian,

369
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,480
so bar next to a huge penguins
fan. And he goes, yeah,

370
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,970
oh, he's that guy. You're a
Russian. He goes, hey, you know,

371
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,340
you'd say Gino Mulkin Malkin right? Hey,
you're like Malcolm. The guy's like, yeah,

372
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,520
Nah, Nah. He's like, I like go.
He's like, I let go vet skit.

373
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
You like a back shit. And then he gets
right in the guy's face and he goes,

374
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:37,350
zero cops, zero cops. He's
like a vege kidney goes

375
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,960
doing the choking thing.
Right.

376
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,470
Joe had had a couple of SAS
Barilla's who's kidding who, right?

377
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,330
So they fucking start going
back and forth. And the e
Joe keeps giving him shit.

378
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,450
The guy's going, oh, come
on man. It's a team game.

379
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,720
Cops. And how can you
like Xero Cups? Xero cuff.

380
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,700
It keeps it active.

381
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,380
The guy's choking on a fucking
Dick in the Russian guys get mad.

382
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,020
Joe's fucking around.
He's not seeing it.

383
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,370
And the fucking elevator can not come
fast enough because it looks like it's

384
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:13,460
going to escalate into a fight,
which, you know, Joe Barton,

385
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:17,620
nick and this Russian guy was actually
taller than Joe, but he was skinnier.

386
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,970
But you know, you sell so Russian, you
know what I mean? So you know, you know,

387
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,570
it's fucking people. They be, they be,

388
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,890
they fucking bitch slapped Hitler
all the way back to fucking Berlin.

389
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,390
You know, let people out
of prisons and say, Hey,

390
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,710
remember we throw you in there for,

391
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:35,260
why don't you come out and go do
that to people who look like this?

392
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,930
And that's what they did. Half of
them weren't bare feet. I mean,

393
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:40,690
I know it's a legend at this point, but
it's just, it's pretty much fucking true.

394
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,810
So now I'm concerned because
they're both Joe's like whatever,

395
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:49,750
six for this guy's like six, five. And
I kept going, Joe, hey man. Hey Joe,

396
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,593
take it easy.

397
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,550
Go ahead guys.
That

398
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,380
he just kept doing it and
then he's laughing at the guy

399
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,300
and I don't know what, he
just wasn't seeing the guy
getting mad. So the guy goes,

400
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,280
hey, why don't we go around the
corner? And Joe's like, Hey,

401
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,560
let's go around the corner and they
walk around the corner. I'm like,

402
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,670
are they going to go fight?

403
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,810
And then there was this awkward little
moment between him and me and dean is

404
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:15,040
stone sober? Like what the fuck? So
finally I just go to my buddy goes,

405
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,530
there's some stairs we can take because
the elevator was taking forever.

406
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,660
And he goes, uh, yeah. He go,
yeah, we can take the stairs.

407
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:21,850
So we go to take the stairs
and we're going to walk out.

408
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:24,760
And the Russians guys like
I were to take the status to

409
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,630
now they're walking down the stairs and
it's just like, I couldn't separate them.

410
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,720
I couldn't get them separated. And, uh,

411
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,020
I dunno what happened by the end of it.
They were,

412
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:42,570
they were like best of friends ready
to go drink some fucking vodka. Um,

413
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,620
we actually left the game,
uh,

414
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,890
halfway through the fourth quarter
because we had to go do our show,

415
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:52,100
but we wanted to go around
and get a picture in front
of the bear Bryant Statue.

416
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,830
And uh, we actually got one in
front of the Nick Saban one.

417
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:56,270
There's one other guy that nobody,

418
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,640
everybody always forgets he's
only won one championship,

419
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:03,260
but it was pretty fucking amazing to uh,
to go there. I'm telling you, if you,

420
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:06,190
if you get a fucking chance, man,
everybody wants to go to the ballparks.

421
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,490
All the baseball parks,
they go to a fucking Lambeau
field and that type of shit,

422
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:14,870
which I understand, but you know, all you

00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,740
Boston don't sleep on going a big time.
College football man.

425
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:26,390
I'm telling you sec, big 10, you got
to go to the University of Michigan.

426
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,720
You got to go to horseshoe and our house
stay. You got to go to one of them.

427
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:33,800
You just have to experience
100,000 fucking people going
absolutely fucking nuts.

428
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,490
Pick a good rivalry game. Go on
fucking stubhub, pay through the nose,

429
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:38,870
go out there and get fucking hammered.

430
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:43,160
Go to the game and then please tell me
what you see in the NFL because I don't

431
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,680
think it,
the NFL can near nearly touches

432
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,520
excitement.
Although having said that,

433
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,090
how great is it that it's fucking
football season and this is what always

434
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:55,690
happened. Football season goes by
like the summer, you know what I mean?

435
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:58,450
Like every year in the summer, I'm
okay, it's May, we're going into May.

436
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,490
I'm really gonna pay attention and
try to enjoy and remember like, hey,

437
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,850
it's this summer. We're in the
summer. Let's fucking enjoy this shit.

438
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,720
I still feel that way.

439
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:12,070
Even though I live out in la where it's
summer all the fucking time, right? Um,

440
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,050
and every, every fucking year old
son, it's just like September, right?

441
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:20,020
And football seasons to same
thing. You're like, oh my God,

442
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,940
fucking football season.
It's fucking great.

443
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:23,560
Then all of a sudden it's
like it's the playoffs.

444
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,770
And you're so focused on the playoffs
playoffs that all of a sudden like

445
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,500
it's that week between the championship
game in the Super Bowl and you're like,

446
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,370
what the fuck happened?

447
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,660
You so busy putting money on the games
and betting on the fucking games.

448
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:43,450
You don't realize not only is
there only one, two teams left,

449
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:47,470
there's only one game left
and then then we're fucked.

450
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,770
Then we'll fuck too. Then the panic
starts to set and then you think,

451
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:53,470
well at least I got march madness,
right.

452
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,300
At least it got march madness and then
I got the the hockey and the basketball

453
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:01,810
playoffs and then there's just a,
it's just, you know what it really is.

454
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:02,644
It's just July.

455
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,970
It's that one panic of
July and into August.

456
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,770
The dog days of baseball

457
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,990
that you have to fucking deal with. That's
how I ended up getting into fucking,

458
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,100
I think Formula One and all
that shit just to cover that.

459
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,520
Then I totally got into it.
I don't know.

460
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:19,340
I feel like I've been talking in
circles for like fucking 25 minutes.

461
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,050
What is this? How many?
How many awful minutes?

462
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:25,280
This has been 26 see that comedian
long enough. You can, you can,

463
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,080
you could sense time.

464
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,620
I had this feeling that had been
bombing for 26 fucking minutes.

465
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:34,370
So a congratulations to everybody's team
who won this week cleaning the chiefs,

466
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,190
not a cunt and a everybody laws day.
It's only feed them.

467
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,210
Yeah,
it's just one week fucking relax.

468
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,720
25 days and no booze.

469
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,310
25 days of knows boobs. I'll tell
you how well I'm doing with no boots.

470
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,270
When I went out,

471
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:55,770
I went to the duty free and I saw
that Macallan McCallum rare cask

472
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,270
black, which I had never
heard of. And I'm like,

473
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,740
I am fucking buying that when I get,

474
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,440
when I come back off the plane
and when I got off the plane I,

475
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,274
you know,

476
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,460
I think I flew delta out
United on the way back.

477
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,210
So it wasn't there but I was
going to buy it. You know,

478
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,040
I'm sitting there talking to myself like,
am I done?

479
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,070
Like I was actually
thinking on the plane today,

480
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,590
like I might be done for good.

481
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,640
And then I came home and I ordered
these whiskey glasses and I'm like,

482
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,010
well that's not a good sign. Like if
you just say, I'm done with heroin.

483
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:32,980
And then you go to Amazon or you
go to like syringe.net, you know,

484
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,320
and you just order a bunch of fucking
drug paraphernalia,

485
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,780
I guess as long as you don't buy the
drugs. Right. I just gay officer,

486
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:44,150
I collect crack pipes.
Okay.

487
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,120
Okay.

488
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,040
Can I ask them?
Can I have my license back please?

489
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,180
You're not gonna find
any residue in there.

490
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,600
Um, so anyway, I was actually
thinking on the plane. I'm like,

491
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,560
am I, what if I just next
year I turned 50 right?

492
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:05,460
And I'm just done with the booze and
then I just become like this yoga

493
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,280
[inaudible] guy. I just go
stink. Right? Gordon Sumner,

494
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,120
I become that fucking guy.
You know,

495
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,440
I look good for my age.

496
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,010
If I actually fucking did that through
my fifties I would look fucking

497
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,420
unbelievable.

498
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,340
It's 64 60 year old,
you know?

499
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,430
And you figured by then you know how
good tanning beds are going to be,

500
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:33,470
how good the hair plugs are going to be,
you know,

501
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,410
and I bet I'll be microchipped by then,

502
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:40,230
which I can also have
like the added Viagara uh,

503
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,290
option to it.
You know what I mean?

504
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,670
I think I can stay in the game for
another 10 years after that. I don't know.

505
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:50,540
What do you guys think? Have you
guys thought about the future? You,

506
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,500
the microchipped you full
head of hair and ABS.

507

566
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,540

I keep taking pictures,

567
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,810
uploading them to my computers and then
sticking them on the hard drives and

568
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:41,240
ended up in the back of my closet and
then I sit there and wonder what the fuck

569
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:44,150
happened to him. And I wished

go to the post office again.
All righty there.

609
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:02,420
That has done that has done so.
I'm actually toying with that idea.

610
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,460
You know,
no booze done,

611
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,060
done. I don't know if I can, I don't know.

612
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,700
I understand why alcoholics like they
take it one day at a time cause she cause

613
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,150
just sitting there like, I'm never
going to do this. Not just today.

614
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,090
I'm just not going to do it today.
Just not gonna do it today.

615
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,190
You know, sometimes you've
got to do it though, right?

616
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,010
You know

617
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,740
your wife's talking to you and you're
sitting there looking at her smiling and

618
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:33,574
nodding.

619
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:33,960
Okay.

620
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,120
She's thinking,
Oh I love what he looks at me that way

621
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,040
he still

622
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,450
loves me.
I can see it in his eye.

623
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,340
And you're actually thinking about
that bottle of booze that you bought.

624
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,990
How are you going to go out in the
garage like a fucking degenerate?

625
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,800
Sit some dirty chair. You
don't give a shit, right?

626
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,280
Pour that glass.
You set the bottle down.

627
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,370
It touches the floor.
You hear it echoing in your garage.

628
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,490
You know that garage that's yours,
right?

629
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,210
That garage that you made the decision,
you weren't going to be like these.

630
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,920
Most of these guys who let their
wives not only take over the house,

631
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:12,930
but also the garage, right? And they
just fill it up with all this shit.

632
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,650
You can't even get the fucking
car in their garage is yours.

633
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,250
He put up the DART board.
You get the Keg rater.

634
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,910
That sets you little fucking tree fort.
You know

635
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,870
mean. Who's kidding? You're
a guy. You're still a child.

636
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:30,510
Just because you can grow a beard
doesn't mean you're mature. All right.

637
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,310
What'd you look at all these stars
doing these fucking commercials now?

638
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,540
Jesus fucking Christ.

639
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,840
Can you leave something on the
bone for the struggling actor?

640
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,400
Can't you just do a fucking ad
over in Guam like you used to?

641
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,790
Um, anyways, well, well,

642
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,650
well Dre, I want to Redo my
fucking garage again. Oh God,

643
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:58,350
I gotta I gotta add something else in
there. I gotta add a fucking, you know,

644
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:01,920
now that I never had my truck in
there, you know, I put it in storage,

645
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,610
so I kind of flip flop and everything
like that with the new car and then the

646
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:09,330
old car. I haven't driven my truck in
like two weeks, man. I miss it. Uh,

647
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,860
I gotta do that Sunday. I got to have the
garage with the fucking room above it.

648
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,310
You just have to have it.
That's what it is, you know?

649
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,600
And then what'd you do?

650
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,450
You have a fucking prenuptial
agreement that if we get divorced,

651
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,200
I get the garage and the room above
it and you can not fucking evict me.

652
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,930
That will be mine and you will get
the fucking house. But you know,

653
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:30,810
something fucking,
they'll just people.

654
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:34,210
But I just still feel safe
with him being out there.

655
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,100
They'd cry their way into getting that to,
you know,

656
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,350
I swear to God,
I wonder if anybody,

657
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:47,140
like when a hurricane's coming in,
if they're in an unhappy marriage,

658
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:51,040
like what's going through their mind?
You just sitting there with your wife,

659
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,810
you know,
she doesn't know that you bought a boat.

660
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,630
They get tied to the back of the house,
a little fucking row boat. You know,

661
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,820
she can't see it.

662
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,870
You convince her to try to ride out the
storm and then when the water comes in

663
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:06,250
you like say you're later. Oh
Jesus, Bill. Um, all right,

664
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,190
let's get to the fucking questions
this week. I apologize. What do I,

665
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,870
you know what? I don't apologize. I don't
apologize for fucking making up shit.

666
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,210
I'm making up Shit, man. What the
fuck he want from me? All right, boo

667
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,880
lineups,
booze lineups.

668
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,510
Did I talk about everything I want to
talk about first before I get into this

669
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:31,500
shit? Let's see here.
Steven Adler. Ronnie James,

670
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:36,040
Alabama versus Fresno state.
Mississippi Horseshoe or ironing

671
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,470
board. Oh yeah. When I was waiting
for the fucking car to come around,

672
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:39,880
I was standing out in
front of the hotel going,

673
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:42,370
I'm never coming to this fucking
state again. I was so fucking,

674
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,460
everything was going so goddamn slow.
But you know,

675
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:48,160
once I got over my five
second temper Tantrum,

676
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,870
I realize that I actually
had a great time there.

677
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,510
So I'm going to come back
next time I'm coming back.

678
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,180
It's either when ole miss or
Mississippi state has a game.

679
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:58,390
I'm going to a fucking game
that and helped to play in
Alabama or some shit like

680
00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:01,660
that. Um, Joe finds a
Russian, I talked about that.

681
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:06,661
No boots 25 days or Billy fucking red
velvet cakes was going to take a month

682
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:08,710
off. Now all of a sudden
he thinks he's the next.

683
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:11,560
He's the second comment is stink,
you know,

684
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,870
staying held onto their hair.

685
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,630
He was losing the roof and then all
of a sudden he started doing yoga.

686
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,200
He started standing on his fucking head
and all that blood went to the top of

687
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:22,840
his head, started feeding the
roots and that's what happened.

688
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:26,200
Maybe might not come back.
Fantasy football is taken over.

689
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:28,330
Trading cards and all that shit.
I talked about that.

690
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:33,280
Well I guess it's time to
get on the fucking with the,
uh, the booze lineups here.

691
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,390
All right. This guy's booze lineup.
Hey, Billy bollard shops. Uh,

692
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:42,390
I'm a listener from a
listener from the UK. I uh,

693
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,310
by the way, it's 16 to three. Well,
you guys already know this shit.

694
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,810
Dallas playing some good defense.
I'm a listener from the UK.

695
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:53,950
I managed to get to your
show in Manchester and it
was brilliant. Thank you.

696
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,590
That was nervous about that show.
You know,

697
00:39:56,591 --> 00:40:00,430
all I knew it was this fucking soccer
hoodlums from the 80s. You know,

698
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,400
the fucking neo Nazis falling around
man United. That's all I knew.

699
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,040
I read among the thugs and to
me that was Manchester. Um,

700
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,810
he said I wanted to send you my team of
drinks, but I don't watch baseball. Oh,

701
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:15,430
you're batting lineup. Okay. I tried
when I was in New York to watch baseball,

702
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:19,460
but I found it boring. Same with
football. Fucking boring. Uh,

703
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:23,530
he means soccer here I guess cause he
says I only watched for that for the World

704
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,840
Cup.
I mainly watch rugby league.

705
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,080
You Watch set seven nation league where
if you come in last she get the wooden

706
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:30,830
spoon.
Um,

707
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,050
NFL for the Seahawks cricket and
I'm a big fan of effluent. Dude.

708
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:38,230
If you can sit through fucking cricket,
you can get through a baseball game.

709
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,670
I mean that's the same thing except
cricket last for fucking five days.

710
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,740
Um, I decided to send you my list
of drinks as the Formula One teams.

711
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,130
I don't really drink that many neat
spirits or whiskey. Soy included.

712
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,850
Everything else I drink when I
want to get pissed. All right.

713
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,070
Leading off he's gotten,
Mercedes is Mercedes Benz team for those.

714
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,770
You don't want you f one, they're like
the fucking cream of the crop. Uh,

715
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,900
we really should have batting cleanup,

716
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,340
but I get this,
you're going to do this more like,

717
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,610
you know how they rank football teams
the best to the worst. All right,

718
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,540
a IPA beers. Yeah. I'm one of those guys,

719
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,770
but I know piss people off talking
about it. My pole position. Drink.

720
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:24,910
Quite happy to drink these beers
all night. Drink iph all night.

721
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,120
Jesus Christ. It's like
drinking a Thanksgiving
dinner. Each pint is so fucking

722
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,990
I hate. There's so fucking I,
you know, every once in a while,

723
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:40,370
if I just want to have one beer,
but I know I'm going to drink 30,

724
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,700
I'll have an IPA because by the time
I'm done with it, I'm just like,

725
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,550
Jesus Christ had enough
and I put the fucking hops.

726
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,380
Good Lord. It's like overacting could bug
in your eyes out of your fucking head.

727
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:53,861
I get it.

728
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:58,090
Beer supposed to have hops as long as
you don't drink any of those stupid beers

729
00:41:58,091 --> 00:42:02,520
that have those, those aggressive
for no reason. Names, you know,

730
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,740
angry fuck face. Kick your mother and
the cut beer whenever they lay him.

731
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,490
Angry Ale. All right. Is second
batter would be for the Ferrari team.

732
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,380
Jack Daniels Black label old number seven,
whatever you want to call it.

733
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,290
Uh, been around for these
all these years and it's,

734
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:25,090
and it is as popular as it's always been.
Usually drink it with the coke.

735
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:28,510
Rarely neat. Oh Jesus. This
guy's not even a AAA here.

736
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,240
Batting third,
red bull.

737
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,520
Mount Gay with mount gay a clips rum.
All right.

738
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,630
If you were in your twenties,
I forgive you for this lineup.

739
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:45,631
I've been drinking it with ginger
beer since these guys were he jaguar,

740
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,230
all the red box side, the red bull
team. I'm a fucking idiot. Some, sorry.

741
00:42:50,231 --> 00:42:54,100
I thought you were drinking red bulls
in mount gay eclipse rum. I was like,

742
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:57,910
what the fuck? Oh, sorry.
I apologize. All right.

743
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:02,410
For Sindia team is there's a brown
liquor vodka. Never heard of that.

744
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:03,910
Usually with apple juice.

745
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,340
Do I give me honestly you drink like
a woman you see with apple juice and a

746
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:12,980
little umbrella in there and I saw this
spin around a couple of times and I like

747
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,510
fatness.
I'm new to good vodka like a few Brits.

748
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,360
I was drinking a paint stripper.

749
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:23,990
Vod paint Stryper vodka
and red bull from 17. Um,

750
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:29,020
all right. The Williams.
Stella up our toys logger.

751
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,880
It's okay.
William's team is to Stella are toast.

752
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,700
I don't know how to say half the shit.
The old dependable. I never heard of it,

753
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,860
but doesn't win many races anymore.

754
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,360
Still nothing beats turning up at a
mate's house with a crate of Stella for a

755
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,170
day of drinking.
Toro Rosso team would be sailor Jerry rum.

756
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:48,280
This guy's a rum drinker.

757
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,450
When I started drinking rum and move
to the red bull team not long after.

758
00:43:52,451 --> 00:43:55,690
All right, Molly, she didn't mix
that with anything. The highest,

759
00:43:55,691 --> 00:43:59,620
the American Formula One. Jack Daniel's
single barrel one for the Americans.

760
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:02,620
There you go. The only whiskey I really
drink. Neat. Good man. There's hope for,

761
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:07,060
you know that poor ass team a bitter,
uh,

762
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,750
the classic British British drink,
which is not served warm.

763
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:14,520
It's served at cellular cellar
temperature. I don't even,

764
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,300
what bitter is Mclaren Jaeger Meister?
Not as good as it used to be,

765
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:21,490
but I have some great
nights drinking this stuff.

766
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,310
How the fuck anybody drinks more than
one of those is beyond me. Uh, the,

767
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,460
the SABA team, I don't even know who that
is. Bringing up the rear. It's cider.

768
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,260
Yeah.

769
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,070
Not even close

770
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,820
to a go to drink, but I'm glad
it's there. I fucking hate cider.

771
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,330
A lot of the podcastsF is for family and
all the specialists come back to the UK

772
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:42,270
soon. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.
I'll definitely be back there.

773
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:45,180
Thank you for your booze lineup.
Um,

774
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,080
there was actually a couple of
interesting things in there. Okay.

775
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,050
That's a brow vodka.
I never heard of that.

776
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:52,660
Yeah,

777
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,210
but you know, I'm going to do yoga
and pilates for the rest of my life.

778
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,670
I'm going to age like sting. Granted he
started doing that Shit in his thirties.

779
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,020
All right, number two. All right.

780
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,510
Uh,
um,

781
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,270
question number two or whatever
the fuck I'm doing this week.

782
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:11,110
A rhinestone stone ball bag. Billy, uh,

783
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,300
love the podcast and love when you rip
into the more on simply for being morons.

784
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,450
Keep it up.
That's why I trashed myself so much.

785
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:21,430
I wanted to throw down a booze lineup,
but for hockey. All right, here we go.

786
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:24,160
We're going for more booze line am I
feel like this is getting old people.

787
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,980
I'm going to read this last one that's
going to be it for the booze lineups and

788
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,960
every once in a while we'll do it. Uh,
we need some more overrated, underrated,

789
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,950
uh,
center.

790
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:37,900
The Cindy crabby position,
Miller genuine draft.

791
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,140
I hate that beer. God bless
you. Somebody's got to drink it.

792
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:44,880
You pay a little too much for him,
but he's your franchise player. See,

793
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:49,570
you have no choice.
Left wing is Weiser's black labels,

794
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:52,390
smooth dangles and sets everyone else up.

795
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,700
Right wing is Santiago
16 year Cuban run rum.

796
00:45:57,731 --> 00:45:58,720
Foreign player.

797
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:02,080
Other teams are afraid to sign
that plays his ass off every night,

798
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:06,820
but take some stupid penalties, man.
Number One, Jack Daniel, safe, gritty,

799
00:46:06,821 --> 00:46:10,090
defensive minded and,
and you didn't break the cap.

800
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:14,050
Hit Forum demand two cores
light never misses a game,

801
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:15,310
jumps up in the zone,

802
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,520
but on the wrong end of the odd man
rushes to often goalie is crown royal

803
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:25,240
hometown boy that gives you 65 starts
this season and always gives you a chance.

804
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,090
Bartok would love that lineup.
I don't know about Miller genuine draft,

805
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:30,680
but he'd love that you've
finished with crown royal. Uh,

806
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,380
thanks and go fuck yourself.
All right.

807
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,680
Okay,

808
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,500
now we're on, now we're onto
some fucking questions here. Uh,

809
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:43,520
all right. The fuck are
we, uh, Bill [inaudible].

810
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,760
What is this? This is more
fucking football. I can't do this.

811
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,950
There's too many boobs lists here.
What's this going to get?

812
00:46:51,951 --> 00:46:55,820
Boring because it requires me to really
read out loud. I'm not good at all right.

813
00:46:55,821 --> 00:46:57,470
Fingerprinting students.

814
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,870
What in the fuck is happening
to this world? Hey Billy Bo.

815
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:03,960
Baggins I'll try to keep this short.

816
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:06,630
I just started college
and in the dining halls,

817
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:10,140
they now only use fingerprint
scanners to let you in.

818
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:14,840
Cooking is not allowed in the dorms,
so if you want to eat,

819
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,920
you have to give them your fingerprints.
I'm not one of those.

820
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:22,820
I got shipped slash free tee shirt people.
But what else can I do?

821
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,170
You have thoughts would be appreciated.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Well,

822
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:30,640
millennials,
I think it's time you fucking rebel.

823
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:32,350
You got to rebel against something here.

824
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,193
Yeah,

825
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,740
I'll go to subway.

826
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,030
Okay.

827
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,000
Why do they need your fucking fingerprints
and what are they going to do with

828
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:44,220
them? Even if they're not
going to do anything with them,

829
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:45,930
they're going to hack into your system.

830
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,060
Somebody's going to hack into the
system that's so fucking nuts.

831
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,670
That is legit.
I honestly have to look up like how,

832
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,640
how are co,

833
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,930
how do people justify taking your fucking
fingerprints to give you a fucking

834
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:03,860
slice of pizza?

835
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,860
Okay.

836
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,860
How do colleges justify
taking students fingerprints?

837
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,160
I love all the mainstream
fucking pussy ass.

838
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:22,990
Fucking corporate media never talks about
this shit. They just sell people loud.

839
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,090
Did just such fall these fucking idiots
screaming about Trump and Hillary and

840
00:48:28,091 --> 00:48:30,760
this is what they're doing to
citizens of this fucking country.

841
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,560
It's fucking unbelievable.

842
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,940
Can I refuse to have my child
fingerprinted at school?

843
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,020
Background of fingerprinting. I got to
uh, Jesus. I almost lied to you guys.

844
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:44,970
I got to read up on this. Like,
I'm actually going to do this.

845
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,900
Should schools fingerprint your kids?

846
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,960
Isn't that of, what is this for? Let
me guess. It's for our own protection.

847
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,393
Okay.

848
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,810
All they do is make gift bags for people
that know how to go on the Internet and

849
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:04,330
steal shit.
Here it is.

850
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:07,360
Here's the fucking social security
number with the fingerprints,

851
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,200
the home address, all the relatives
and all in a nice, neat, nice,

852
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:15,460
neat little fucking bag.
I,

853
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,400
I can't fucking believe that this,
these fucking jerk offs,

854
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,840
these fucking jerk offs. Anybody Watches
Fox and CNN is a fucking jerk off.

855
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,990
When was the last time they held the
feet of the fucking car instead of doing

856
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:32,300
all of this shit at the end, the fire.
When the fuck are they ever done that?

857
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,390
Okay.

858
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,780
If they ever really gone off
the pharmaceutical companies
for starting a heroin

859
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:40,320
epidemic and they ever really gone
after Monsanto for fucking with the food

860
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:41,130
supply.

861
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,130
Have they ever really gone after bankers
for what the fuck they were allowed to

862
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:46,000
get away with 10 fucking years ago?

863
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,250
Yeah.

864
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,840
Jesus fucking Christ.

865
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,440
You get one off colored fucking joke.

866
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:55,670
They cover that more than these fucking
insurance companies are probably gonna

867
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,130
fuck everybody over. Ah, now I'm upset.

868
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:00,863
Yeah.

869
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,560
You know what I would do, sir? I would
fucking somehow go out of my own pocket.

870
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:11,561
Then I would fucking eat down the street
for fucking cheap the best I could.

871
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,220
That's why you can still bring snacks.
You can't cook.

872
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,550
You can still have a fridge, right?
I need a bowl of fucking cereal.

873
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:21,660
I would eat a fucking
bowl of cereal three days,

874
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:25,070
three times a fucking day before
I'd get those fucking cunts.

875
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,510
You goddamn fingerprints.
First of all, you,

876
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,040
all you're going to do is
come out of college. You,

877
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:33,590
you're going to be all these student
loans and what sort of job is even to be

878
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:37,460
there? You've got to give
me a fingerprints to fuck
these people. Fuck up.

879
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:45,720
You know? I Dunno. You're not even
allowed to fucking protest anymore.

880
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,120
You'd have to go to a certain section.

881
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:50,420
You'd have to get a
fucking permit to protest.

882
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,570
Do I guarantee fucking t you?

883
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,130
I guarantee you the reason why they're
taking your fingerprints is an added

884
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:00,370
revenue stream and they're
going, they, you know, they're,

885
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:02,570
they're going to fucking
sell them to somebody else.

886
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,050
All of those fucking people that
take your fucking information.

887
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:09,200
How we getting weed seed safe. It's
secure, it isn't safe and secure.

888
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,580
What they've done now is they've made
it a lot easier for these people that go

889
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:18,581
in and steal shit rather than having
to having to break into you personally.

890
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:21,290
They just break into a company and
they get like a flu or whatever,

891
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:25,750
a couple thousand people
a whack.

892
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,520
And then what kills me is after
these cons, take your information,

893
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,490
their system gets hacked into and you can,
you sue them

894
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,660
for putting your shit up there.
Say it's fucking unreal.

895
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,130
Anyways, I just recently had, you know,

896
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:46,430
a TV network that I worked
for sent me a fucking letter.

897
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,890
She go in there and go read
it and say, uh, you know,

898
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,380
unfortunately someone broke
into our system and uh, the,

899
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,690
a lot of personal information
was x might've been exposed.

900
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,360
So all they're required to do after.
It's like,

901
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,220
why did you keep all that information?

902
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,870
We need to go back to paper
and file cabinets. People.

903
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,560
I'm telling you make these fucking
pieces of shit put on blue cat burglar

904
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:13,340
outfits have the flashlight in their mouth
is they try to pick the lock to go in.

905
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,170
I'm sorry, I really just lost my
shit there, but I feel like my,

906
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,600
I know even though I didn't have
all the information I needed to,

907
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,090
to make a logical argument,
I I feel like I am right.

908
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:26,990
I'm sniffing around something there.
All right. Alcoholics anonymous.

909
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:32,750
Hey Bill. I was in Aa for roughly two
years. If you're thinking about attending,

910
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,500
I would suggest you visit a
library and get the AA big book.

911
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:41,300
Sometimes they have a copy
available. I would read it. Okay.

912
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:44,450
Now you just asked me to do two things
that are really difficult for me. One,

913
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:49,070
going to a library and to finding a
book and then actually three reading it.

914
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,100
Um, what else you want
me to dunk a basketball?

915
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,300
You're really getting outside
the realm of what I do here. Uh,

916
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,490
then I would also read the
orange papers and online website,

917
00:53:01,491 --> 00:53:04,070
which attempts to debunk
the AA philosophy,

918
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,730
attend a few meetings and get
a feel for it. But honestly,

919
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,400
I don't think you're an alcoholic
from listening to your podcast.

920
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:14,990
I just think you're a piss head. Uh,
you can put a cork in the bottle.

921
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:18,680
I hear you sometimes beating yourself up
when you've had three large pores. Oh,

922
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:23,310
Jesus. Relaxed. That's not
alcoholism. I love this guy. Uh,

923
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,830
sure.
You're probably not a good drinker,

924
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:30,690
but it's all on a spectrum and you seem
to be doing fine when you start drinking,

925
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:34,290
cleaning gel mixed with fruit
juice because it has alcohol in it.

926
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,780
Then we can talk.
I've heard it all in Aa and,

927
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,450
and you don't qualify for the club
in my humble opinion. Take it easy.

928
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:47,220
You're bald. Fuck. All right, well
thank you for the kind words, sir. Um,

929
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,160
no, but it's also, it's not good for you.

930
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,870
I can tell you it's not the level that
I was drinking was not good for you. Uh,

931
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,430
but I announced them think Aa is bad. If
it works for you, then I think it's good.

932
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:00,570
If it doesn't work for you,

933
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,790
I don't think you then have
to go out in deep bunk it.

934
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,440
What kind of a cut does that like alcohol
and non alcoholic anonymous has helped

935
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:10,980
so many fucking people.
Let me look at the orange papers.

936
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,380
Who fucks the asshole?

937
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,290
Who to say everybody just always
has to rain on somebody's parade.

938
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,550
Orange papers here.
I just realized something.

939
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:24,410
We might be fucking riding
out this hurricane down in
Florida listening to this

940
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:28,280
podcast. If you still have power, if you
get a generator and I just said rain.

941
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,180
Rain on your fucking parade. Sorry. Um,

942
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,910
where do the orange papers? Orange
papers. I spilled orange. Wrong.

943
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,800
I put two n's in there. I Dunno why
I said O r n a n g orange papers.

944
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,450
Aa.
Here we go.

945
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,220
Orange papers.
Recovering from recovery,

946
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,700
anti gay sites such as orange papers.

947
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:56,580
All right,

948
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,370
now this is just going to be another
website that just hijacked the whole

949
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:03,660
fucking thing so I can't get to it.
Where are the original orange papers?

950
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:08,070
Original. Original please,
please. Can I get the original?

951
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,543
I can't find it.

952
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,170
I cannot fucking find her. What
the fuck? Come on bed. Alright.

953
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,330
It just clicked on this page and I
see a big picture of a monkey leaving.

954
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:26,220
Aa staying sober. All right, here we go.

955
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:29,880
For the suffering alcoholic
and those unhappy in Aa.

956
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,540
Yeah.

957
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,400
All right. Let's see what
they pitch. Your body here

958
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:40,320
for the suffering alcoholic and those
unhappy and Aa alcoholics anonymous has

959
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:43,350
over 2 million participants globally.
That's it.

960
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:48,000
It is a friendly and welcoming
organization with many
caring, helpful members.

961
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,360
AAA offers companionship,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

962
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:53,520
If you think you have a drinking
problem and haven't tried Aa,

963
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:57,230
stop reading this essay and
go to a meeting. However,

964
00:55:57,231 --> 00:55:58,850
a growing number of
options of slowly we can.

965
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:02,490
I want to fucking read all of this shit.
All right. I'll take your word for it.

966
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,010
Evidently
we get Eli stepping up in the pocket.

967
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,740
What's the score?
Yeah.

968
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,830
16 to three, seven minutes to
go. Did he just throw a pic?

969
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:23,840
Who knows?
Alright.

970
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:29,150
Wife working out with X.
Oh, Jesus. Fucking Christ.

971
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,730
If I saw that at the beginning of a
fucking porno, I'd be like, oh my God,

972
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:38,270
can we come up with a fucking
less cliched scenario?

973
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:42,963
Okay.

974
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:47,660
Oh, okay. Hey there, Billy red sack.
Love your podcast. Love F is for family.

975
00:56:47,661 --> 00:56:52,160
Can't wait for season three. I wanted your
advice on something. Here's the story.

976
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:57,050
I got married about a year ago and me and
my lovely wife moved to La right after

977
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:59,510
the wedding because she had
a great job opportunity.

978
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,980
She had lived in La a few years ago prior
to meeting me and when she was living

979
00:57:03,981 --> 00:57:07,910
here, she had a fling with some
douchey if private fitness trainer,

980
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,800
both of them viewed marriage as a stupid
concept and they made a pact that when

981
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,180
they'll get married to other people,
they'd meet up and fuck,

982
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,650
I don't believe a fucking word of this.

983
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,560
I don't believe a fucking word of this.
This is too stupid.

984
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:29,603
They made a pack.

985
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,810
When when they'll get
married to other people,

986
00:57:33,811 --> 00:57:36,510
they'd meet up and fuck.
I mean,

987
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:41,210
it definitely sounds like
an la conversation in a gym.
I'll continue reading. Uh,

988
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,050
so as soon as she changed her relationship
status status to married on Facebook,

989
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:48,600
that guy sent her a bunch of messages,

990
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:52,080
which was sexual and pretty much offense.
Oh.

991
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:56,460
Offered to take her up on
the agreement and fuck.

992
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,700
She didn't respond,
but she did tell me about it,

993
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:05,090
but I didn't lose my shit in
remained calm in the last few weeks.

994
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:09,340
She told me she's looking for a way to
get in shape and she said that the Douche

995
00:58:09,341 --> 00:58:13,320
she had offered her private workout
sessions in exchange for a help and his

996
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:15,330
business,
she's an accountant.

997
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:21,410
She said that because private workout
sessions are expensive and he's very good

998
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:25,110
at what he does. This is a great
opportunity that would save us some money.

999
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,180
She said she made it clear to him that
she's happily married and nothing is

1000
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:36,370
going to happen,
and he understood completely.

1001
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,810
She asked me if it bothers me and I
not wanting to look like the insecure,

1002
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:44,200
jealous type. Oh my God, you fucking dude.

1003
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:47,040
I'm telling you these fucking
women are in guys heads.

1004
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:48,480
Yeah.

1005
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,090
All of this bullshit that
you've seen on fucking TV.

1006
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,600
All of these fucking women fucking
playing the victim all the time.

1007
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:59,601
All of this fucking coverage of just what
guys do to women has now every fucking

1008
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:03,120
guy has his balls in
his fucking back pocket.

1009
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,880
And it's just like,
well,

1010
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:09,690
I don't want to be the guy that fucking
makes you uncomfortable if she fucking

1011
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:14,130
tolerate this from you,
you don't want to look into,

1012
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:18,310
that's not being insecure, sir.
That's common fucking sense.

1013
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,190
So he honestly,
honey,

1014
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,180
I trust you.

1015
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:28,040
I want what's best for you
and tried actually to do that.

1016
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:33,770
My question is, do you think
she's trustworthy? Possible,
but that guy isn't. Hmm.

1017
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,380
And that guy's just drawn her
in cause he wants to fucker.

1018
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,690
Um, she does have a history
of cheating on her exes,

1019
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,950
but so do I. We both been happily
married in our sex life is great,

1020
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,430
but still the doubt and insecurity
about that. This issue exists.

1021
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,240
Love to hear your take on this. Can't
wait for the new hour special. Thanks.

1022
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:59,560
And Go fuck yourself
buddy, buddy. Yeah, no, no,

1023
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:04,750
no fucking way. No fucking
way. Work some extra hours,

1024
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,693
you know,

1025
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,970
I would actually be willing to believe
that she's gone over there thinking she's

1026
01:00:12,971 --> 01:00:15,190
not going to do anything,
but that guy's going to seducer.

1027
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:20,200
That's what's going to happen. They
already banged. They're already, you know,

1028
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,880
physically like,
you know,

1029
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,150
yeah.

1030
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,400
You know,
the boundaries are not going to be there.

1031
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:31,060
And I'm telling you that that's not
a good situation and you're not in,

1032
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,040
you're not insecure at all.

1033
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:35,843
You know?

1034
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:40,030
And so what if you are,
that's a legitimate,

1035
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,150
that's a legitimate feeling,
that full fucking thing.

1036
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:46,120
Let's let those stupid fucking tee shirts.
I saw this,

1037
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:48,760
there's some woman was wearing this
fucking tee shirt that I told you about.

1038
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:50,590
That one was back in the summertime.
It said something like,

1039
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:52,803
yeah,

1040
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:57,050
a real man is excited by a strong woman.
A boy is like whatever,

1041
01:00:57,051 --> 01:01:01,130
intimidated or something like that. It's
just some musical. Oh, I want to be,

1042
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,340
I want to be considered a strong man.
I want a cookie.

1043
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,040
Okay.

1044
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,560
I was reading that rolling
stone where they had the, the,

1045
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:11,220
the actress that was playing,
uh,

1046
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,580
played wonder woman and I was all excited
to read the article in the first quote

1047
01:01:15,581 --> 01:01:19,540
that they had. They said, are you a
feminist? She goes, yes, I'm a feminist.

1048
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:22,960
Everyone should be a feminist because
if you're not a feminist and you were

1049
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,990
sexist,
right?

1050
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,750
Yeah.

1051
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,000
And I like bursting out
laughing thinking like, well,

1052
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,060
it all depends on what your definition is.
Yeah.

1053
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:35,880
That's what's funny about these Hollywood
people out here. I swear to God,

1054
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:39,960
they sound just like the Fox News, right?
People, they're the exact, you know,

1055
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,670
Zara is zero tolerance seal think
Savannah I do. If you do not,

1056
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,990
then you are this,
um,

1057
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:52,850
like there's no clear cut definition of
feminism any more than there is of like

1058
01:01:53,851 --> 01:01:58,740
what makes, you know that's real rock
music and in some ways always like Dutch,

1059
01:01:58,741 --> 01:02:03,510
not rock dishes. Rob Dad's bullshit.
It's the same thing with like family.

1060
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:08,220
Like everyone was a feminist the
way my wife is, which, you know,

1061
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,000
in all fairness, this actress
that played wonder woman could be,

1062
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,460
I don't fucking know. But just to say
like that is just such a, I mean, granted,

1063
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,600
it's a fucking interview.

1064
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,200
They're trying to get people fucking
worked up to read the fucking thing.

1065
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,160
Maybe it was taken out of context.
Maybe she said other shit,

1066
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:30,630
but just the way that's presented, you
know, rolling stone is just fucking,

1067
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:34,440
it's soft Boldo it's just fucking is
sufferable the way they handled Obama with

1068
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:37,380
like kid gloves and if you,
if you're a fucking Republican,

1069
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,970
they stick your head in the fire.

1070
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,850
Now I'm not saying they shouldn't stick
these Republicans had in the fire.

1071
01:02:41,851 --> 01:02:42,684
I mean,

1072
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:43,850
okay.

1073
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,560
They're the fucking,
you know, the, the, the,

1074
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:46,660
okay.

1075
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,790
They're bought and paid for it.
That level. Right. Am I nuts?

1076
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,910
And I also thought Obama was too,

1077
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,680
judging by the $69 million with
the tour dates he has coming up,

1078
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,470
given speeches to all
these fucking rich people.

1079
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,360
Guy Just bought a $10 million
fucking house is fucking unreal.

1080
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,070
And they don't say shit.
All they do is show him playing,

1081
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:10,600
highlight and fucking going
kayaking and parasailing.

1082
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,420
Cool.
I can't believe how cool he is.

1083
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,793
MMM.

1084
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,800
Anyways. By the way, rolling stone
is trumped the worst president ever.

1085
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:24,820
I haven't noticed. He, it's not like you
up and fucking written it. It's just like,

1086
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:27,970
I don't even read the fucking article.
It's like I understood your point of view.

1087
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,770
The first 90 articles, there's so much
other shit you can be writing about.

1088
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,633
You know what I mean?

1089
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,400
Okay,

1090
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,590
good fucking Lord.
Like my,

1091
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:40,650
why can't you make fun of like extreme
liberals every once in a while?

1092
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:45,090
Throw me a fucking curb ball,
something. Ah, Jesus Christ,

1093
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:50,040
I fucking need to go buy some fucking
tampons here. I'm sorry. You know what,

1094
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:50,671
when it happened,

1095
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:53,700
you know what the funny stopped was the
fingerprint of these fucking poor kids,

1096
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:56,490
these poor kids are going to college.
So getting it all in fucking debt.

1097
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,753
All right.

1098
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:03,270
And these colleges are acting like they've
adapted to how quickly the real world

1099
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:05,070
is changing and I don't think they are.

1100
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:07,290
And that's why these kids are coming out
and it's like they're coming out with

1101
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:08,640
degrees in like fucking,

1102
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,650
I don't know what the fucking
a churning butter essentially,

1103
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,390
and then they can't find a fucking job.

1104
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,030
Okay.

1105
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:19,930
Yeah, I don't know. I remember like,

1106
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:22,270
we always reading up about all
these fucking amazing musicians.

1107
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,700
They would go to Berkeley and they would,

1108
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:27,340
they would never complete the guys that
went out and seeing the guys that went

1109
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:31,240
out and did shit. They never
finished. Like, they will like this,

1110
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:36,250
this whole being here. I got
what I needed. Now I gotta
get the Fuck Outta here.

1111
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,670
And, um, I'm not saying
drop out of college,

1112
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:44,020
but I really feel like if that voice
is screaming in your head and you,

1113
01:04:44,021 --> 01:04:48,640
you fucking have some good ideas, why
take on the last year a debt, the last,

1114
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:50,620
you know why?
Because your parents want you to,

1115
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,460
um,
I dunno

1116
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:57,570
what, because Bill Gates dropped out.
If you drop out, I'm just saying,

1117
01:04:58,890 --> 01:04:59,723
you know

1118
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,780
what the fuck I ended up doing.

1119
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:04,480
I didn't need to go to college and all
those fucking village student loan,

1120
01:05:04,481 --> 01:05:05,314
all a dead.

1121
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,940
And I left and I immediately went down
to a comedy club and started doing shit

1122
01:05:09,941 --> 01:05:10,774
jokes.

1123
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,040
Um,
anyways,

1124
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,720
we got to end on something positive
here. Uh, please go to that. Steven.

1125
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,150
Al The Ronnie James Think,
uh,

1126
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,170
I'm going to post that the
bowl for Ronnie. Ronnie James.

1127
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,080
What a fucking voice and what a great
guy too, man. I never met the guy,

1128
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:35,500
but like ball his interviews, he couldn't
have been more down to earth. Uh,

1129
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:40,120
once again, it's going to be at pins, P I
n Z bowling center, one, two, six, five,

1130
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:42,970
five Ventura Boulevard. Uh, it's
gonna be a bunch of rock stars.

1131
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,560
They're a bunch of comedians.
All Bolan raising money for a,

1132
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,120
I don't even know what the, what is the
cause here? Why No, Ronnie died of cancer.

1133
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:56,770
So I imagine it's that right?
Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie James Dio.

1134
01:05:56,771 --> 01:06:01,770
Stand up and shout a cancer fund.
There you go.

1135
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:04,790
Stand up and shout. Right. Um,

1136
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,280
so there's something positive for you and
I believe it's October 6th. All right.

1137
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:12,820
I will be tweeting that out and I am
trying to get back onto Instagram.

1138
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:14,710
I haven't posted on Instagram and forever.

1139
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:18,940
I think I have to create an entirely new
account because I keep saying I forgot

1140
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,710
my password.
Please email it to me.

1141
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,530
And they haven't been able
or I haven't been able,

1142
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:27,910
I can't find the fucking thing. Um, so
that's it. That's a podcast for this week.

1143
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:32,470
Congratulations to everybody. One week,
one, congratulations all football fans.

1144
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:38,320
That is football season. Uh, my favorite
fucking thing happened this weekend,

1145
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:40,060
by the way,
when I was in the Alabama theater,

1146
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,690
there was this fucking guy in the front
row and he had his middle age too.

1147
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:46,750
We had his cell phone on it's
middle aged guy and I'm like, dude,

1148
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:50,290
he recording the show. You
recording the show? And he
kind of was like, no. He goes,

1149
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,190
he goes up looking at the scores
because it was Saturday night.

1150
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:57,760
He wanted to see how the other SCC teams
were doing. And I go, well, what's what,

1151
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:59,890
what are you watching?
He was watching the Georgia game.

1152
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,710
I go with your Alabama to fuck.
Do give a shit about Georgia for.

1153
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,190
He goes there in the SCC and I go,
they're not, I couldn't catch you.

1154
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,360
They got that decent quarterback
though. I don't know. They're,

1155
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:12,040
the crowd kind of dies down
and this guy in the back goes,

1156
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:16,750
he says to the guy with the phone, he
just goes, excuse me sir, sir? He goes,

1157
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:21,700
what'd he say? Oh, fuck it. I'm
going to put you the joke. Auburn,

1158
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:25,630
Clemson, whoever the fuck
Auburn was playing, it was like,

1159
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:30,130
I wasn't even there anymore. He
just asked for a score. Oh God.

1160
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:33,120
What a fucking great setup or would
have been such a killer story if I could

1161
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:33,954
have fucking remembered.

1162
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:35,790
Okay.

1163
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:40,740
Auburn score. What do we
got here? That's right.

1164
01:07:40,741 --> 01:07:45,390
They played Clemson. Yeah, he got,
excuse me sir. Auburn. Clemson.

1165
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,750
That's all he had to say.
The guys just write it on his phone,

1166
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:53,430
looking to give them the
fucking score. Um, I dunno.

1167
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,010
It's a great fucking place. Don't
sleep on the south. All right.

1168
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,390
If you really think about it, your
states just as racist. Okay, that's it.

1169
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,720
Go fuck yourselves.
I don't know what else to tell y'all.

1170
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:09,110
Check in on you on Thursday.
I hope. Um, you know,

1171
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,150
my hope is, is a little damaged
in Florida as humanly possible,

1172
01:08:12,151 --> 01:08:15,620
and that's all he can fucking
hope for. And um, you know,

1173
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:18,410
all you guys make it fun of people
driving electric cars. I don't know.

1174
01:08:18,411 --> 01:08:21,740
Now you know what the fuck
I drive gas combustion cars.

1175
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:24,200
So I'm not fucking looking down on you,
but you know,

1176
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,280
I don't know what the battery does in
the end when you drive the Tesla into the

1177
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:31,490
fucking ocean. Can you recycle
the battery? I have no idea.

1178
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:34,160
But I'll tell you what that guys doing
over there at that Tesla company.

1179
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:38,630
I like it. I like it. I just wished the
car could look a little more meaner.

1180
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:41,930
Looks great from the back. Looks
great from the side, the front.

1181
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:47,280
I don't know what it is, just
can't quite get into it. But uh,

1182
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,480
I know it's a fucking amazing car. But
then they asked you these fucking cool,

1183
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:53,900
Huh?
The Lamborghini doors opening up a plus.

1184
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:57,200
It's also a great way to win the
war in the Middle East. You know,

1185
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,940
drive an electric car,
you ride a bicycle,

1186
01:09:00,941 --> 01:09:04,090
anything you do to use
less fucking fossil fuels,

1187
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:08,380
fucks those people over over there and
they don't have money to funnel through

1188
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:12,100
the mosques to give to the terrorist. And
there you go. And then all of a sudden,

1189
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:16,000
oh, a Jimmy cracked corn is
out of fireworks, right? Oh,

1190
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:19,300
I just saw the Middle East or
problem or the Middle East.

1191
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:21,760
Prob not Middle Eastern. I don't have
problems with Middle Eastern people.

1192
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,160
And this is why I don't hold office.
All right, go fuck yourselves people.

1193
01:09:27,161 --> 01:09:28,180
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
