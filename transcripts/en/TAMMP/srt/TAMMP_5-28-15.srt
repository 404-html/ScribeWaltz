1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,230
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burnham.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,173
Yeah.
Yay.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,460
Just checking on you on an ar for a
Thursday afternoon. Hope all is well.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,880
I'll deal the enjoy your
last couple of days.

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:17,570
I hope Tuesday and Wednesday
was everything that you
thought it was going to be.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,250
You know what was the last time you look
forward to a Tuesday or a Wednesday?

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,580
You never do.
You never do unless you have the day off,

8
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:29,600
which is why you have to go
and kill your boss. Okay.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,660
And I think there's not a jury in the
world that would convict you if you just

10
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:35,990
said,
listen,

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,210
I just wanted for once in my life to be
able to look forward to a Tuesday and on

12
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:42,170
Wednesday,
you know?

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,100
Okay.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,470
And they would all put their heads to
the side and they'd smile and be like,

15
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:49,880
you know what, that that person
did. That man deserves to die. Okay.

16
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,240
Not to be a chauvinist, but I just
assumed the boss is a man, you know,

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,870
with all the squawk
and from the feminists,

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,820
like you know how they're not fucking,
I dunno, I dunno what that problem is.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,700
You know, if there's not enough gum
drops in their fucking ice cream.

20
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,600
Evidently I think that's their basis.
I'm not gonna start that shit again.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,030
By the way, me and me, it
had a great time on Monday.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,750
Most people thought it was a great time,
enjoyed us having a good time,

23
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:13,100
and then other people
got a little sensitive.

24
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:15,760
I thought you a little bit
too hard on her, did ya?

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,680
Did you really think I was a little
harder? You think she couldn't take it?

26
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,640
She was fucking destroying me.
You know, there's always one do.

27
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:27,440
She just has to take everything to fucking
seriously and for some reason in this

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,790
day and age,
then the whole world,

29
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:32,990
the whole world will listen to one douche
bag and think that it's a tsunami of

30
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:37,280
fucking human beings. A tsunami bill.
Hey, I'm, I'm fucking refund here.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,790
Every once in a while the wrong
fucking reference will come out.

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,920
10 people fucking complain and
they'll act like it's all a China.

33
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,170
So dumb as shit.
Just like,

34
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,280
I really think someone needs to look at
these fucking groups and be like, hey,

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,550
hey, hey, shut up.

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,340
Shut the fuck up.

37
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,390
You're fucking bullies.

38
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,590
Okay.

39
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,200
That's all you're doing. The exact
fucking thing you don't want done to you.

40
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:09,880
Now you're doing everybody else. There's
such cons. Who Bill, which groups?

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,650
All of them generally speaking about
the way they go about with their mission

42
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,150
statement.
They really are.

43
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:19,510
They don't give a fuck who the fuck
they destroy as long as in the the end

44
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,580
result is there a,
you know,

45
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:24,100
most of the time you know what they
want to do I think is a good thing.

46
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,760
But the way they go about it, what the
fuck is my computer talking about now?

47
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,750
A script on this page may be
busy or it may have stopped.

48
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:36,370
I don't give a fuck telling
me about it for um, all right,

49
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,640
my computer's going to be a
pain in the ass to me this week.

50
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:44,140
I can already tell cause I'm trying to
fucking upload some files to an external

51
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:47,680
hard drive so I can have them on there
so I can never look at them again.

52
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,920
How many external hard drives
do you fucking have? You know,

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,300
all these important pictures,

54
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:54,900
all these selfies you took while
you were shit faced in a bar,

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,800
got to keep all of them right. You
know, some dumb thing sent you,

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,310
but you save for some reason to show
somebody else and then that's there and

57
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,730
then that's in your fucking hard
drive. All right. I get it. I get it.

58
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,410
I get a computer. Okay. Stop the script.
Fuck it. Okay. I'll get off my life.

59
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,150
Um, so anyways, uh, yeah,

60
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,520
like last year when a couple of weeks ago,
and I told you that hilarious story,

61
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,930
the white kid fucking than the clean shirt
and the beautiful glasses and the, uh,

62
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:25,870
the rope necklace was asking
for money and how, uh,

63
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,480
you know, I was teasing her
about how good he looked.

64
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,740
So then he handed the money back,

65
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,560
so I took it and gave it back to my
friends and then the guy in the wheelchair

66
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,020
came and then they gave it to him and
the fucking white kid flipped out.

67
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:37,660
And how funny it was. Right. Um,

68
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,310
somebody got all pissed at me on Twitter
about that and said, you know what? Yeah.

69
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,150
That was great.
You don't,

70
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:48,151
the only thing it's funny isn't that is
me not go to Amazon League when they go

71
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,500
to Amazon. It's like, all right.

72
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,410
Yeah, do that. There you go.

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,040
My entire fucking economy was based
on you going to fucking Amazon.

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,580
I don't give a fuck. I don't pressure
anybody to do that. If you want to do it,

75
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,040
I appreciate it. If you don't, don't,

76
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,100
then you're going to have your fucking
reasons. Stop fucking send me tweets.

77
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:13,840
Like that's going to like,
I'm gonna like feet brought to my niece.

78
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,030
Bill power will not be at the comedy
store this weekend because one can't

79
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,580
decided not to use is Amazon link.
Now what's he going to deal?

80
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,300
He can't afford the gas to get over here.
Speaking of which,

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,370
oh, fractals, I am sold
on that fucking Tesla.

82
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,410
A buddy of mine last night, uh, comic,
he got one. He just got the ass model.

83
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,030
It was the sickest fucking car. He
got an in blue. It was the shit.

84
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,463
Um,

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,490
I woke up this morning thinking about
that car smiling and that's usually a good

86
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:48,490
thing when you wake up. Thinking
about something smiling, you know,

87
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,890
unless you're murdered somebody the night
before and you're smiling about that,

88
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,640
then I guess you'd be
a psycho. Um, but, uh,

89
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm Solon the fucking car
and I want to get the,

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,030
I want to get the one that fucks
with the core of that. The p,

91
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,550
the series one where it's got two motors.

92
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,340
I want to get one of those fucking things.
And I was talking to another comedy.

93
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:10,660
He goes, well, you know what? If
there's a power outage, it's like, okay,

94
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:15,040
you never going to have to buy gas again
and you're worried about a power outage.

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,660
Power outage. Think about your cell
phone. Think about your cell phone.

96
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,470
When was the law?
That thing needs electricity.

97
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:28,040
When was the last time there was a power
outage and you couldn't use your cell

98
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,630
phone for some ridiculous period of time?
Can you remember?

99
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,520
Okay, now, now that you're off the
ledge, go out and go buy the fucking car.

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,210
Fucking dope.
Dope.

101
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,390
What do I do that anybody doesn't think
what I think is then a dope? Yeah,

102
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:49,570
he's just fucking, your word is wrong
with me. I Dunno. So anyways, um,

103
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,550
had a great time last night.

104
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,780
I want to thank everybody that came
down to the comedy store for the, uh,

105
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,900
the all things comedy,
uh, showcase last night.

106
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:03,010
Everybody had a great time and Joe Rogan
was nice enough to jump on in the end.

107
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:07,010
Had a great time hanging out
with him. Al Madrigal, bird fry.

108
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,570
Um, Jill Barton, the Rosebowl
legend was there. Um,

109
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,590
Neil Brennan, Dean del Ray was just,
it was just a fucking awesome time.

110
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,060
And you know,
what's the greatest thing about it?

111
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:23,350
At no point did anybody periscope
backstage that's becoming the new fucking

112
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,000
thing,
you know,

113
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,010
the new desperate thing to try to sell
your fucking love songs on, you know, hey,

114
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,170
this is fucking Lao.
Love it on periscope.

115
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,620
This is what my face looks like when I
take his shit in my fucking bathroom.

116
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,820
And a, by the way, uh, this bathroom
was done in a Victorian style.

117
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,450
Um, I fucking hate periscope. I,

118
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,460
I don't, you know what, I
just, I haven't even seen it.

119
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,390
It's just the people who have used it,
it's so fucking intrusive.

120
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:53,640
If somebody just comes walking in the
wrong, I'm on terrorists scope right now.

121
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,040
It's just like,
did I ask to be on this fucking thing?

122
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Don't have to sign a release or am I just
guilty of being out in public then and

123
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,220
now it's like everybody's
becoming like TMZ. Um, I dunno,

124
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,380
I'm not, you know me, I'm
not a fucking fan of that.

125
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:12,240
The only thing I don't like about the
Tesla is that giant supersized fucking

126
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,840
iPad. I hate that thing. Everything
else about the car I love,

127
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,840
but I'm so I'm already thinking about,
uh,

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,680
I know this guy that does custom car shit
and I'll just have a window shade made

129
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:26,010
for that thing and I'll just fucking
pull it down. I don't want that thing,

130
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,810
you know,
glaring in my face.

131
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,380
Like I opened that thing and
Raiders of the lost Ark can,

132
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:34,680
every time I'd drive down the fucking
street, you know, other than that,

133
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,120
I think that car is, uh, I think
that car is pretty sick personally,

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,860
personally is what I'm thinking.
So anyways,

135
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,550
this is Thursday afternoon and
for all you hockey fans out there,

136
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,420
all you fans of the game of hockey, you
have to be unbelievably excited, Huh?

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,340
To game seven. It's one tonight though.
Rages against the fucking lightening.

138
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:58,341
And then tomorrow night the Black Hawks
got to go to Anaheim and play the ducks.

139
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:03,240
Man. Um, I can honestly tell you, I have
no idea who's going to win either one,

140
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,340
either one of those series.
Um,

141
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,700
but I do think whoever wins black cops
ducks is going to take the a is going to

142
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:12,240
win the cup.
Unfortunately,

143
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,680
the West is just been stronger than the
east for fucking ever. And I'm honest,

144
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,690
that van, the Bruins one in all 2011
and I say oh 11th, then I almost say,

145
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,140
oh 11 is that what I fucking did?
Um,

146
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,610
I was trying to get onto this fucking
website here. I got it here. There's a a,

147
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,780
some of you, this is something
people wanted me to talk about it.

148
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,520
If you want me to go off on something,

149
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,880
just a tweet at me with Hashtag
t a m m p Thursday afternoon,

150
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,030
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.
Um,

151
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,720
this is feminist upset over statue
of a man and a woman talking.

152
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,860
I'm seeing, okay, here's the scene.
All right, this is in Washington DC.

153
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,030
You're a woman's sitting
on a bench reading a book.

154
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,270
Your male friends sees you on the,
and it comes

155
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,610
over to say hello and talk.
You put down your book,

156
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:02,450
Lean back against the bench and smile.
He doesn't sit next to you.

157
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:06,770
Instead he puts his foot on the
bench and leads over on his knee. Uh,

158
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,620
so sexist, right? Uh,

159
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,910
that scene is depicted in a statue at
the University of incarnate word in San

160
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,290
Antonio, Texas. And despite no sign
of distress or physical assertion,

161
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:24,620
some women have decided it is a statue.
Oh my God,

162
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,600
this is of mansplaining.

163
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,570
A term used to describe men
condescendingly explaining
something to a woman.

164
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,013
Yeah,

165
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,570
Dude, how much do they fucking
hate us? Like they never do that.

166
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,180
Jesus Christ,
every five seconds,

167
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:47,150
they're trying to fixture
then change how you are.

168
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,120
Why don't they see the balance in that?
That's fucking nuts to me anyways.

169
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:51,860
Seriously.

170
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,720
Here's the actual statue
and the claim of a massage.

171
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,160
Massage Uni. Um, okay. It's some,

172
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,220
some woman wrote of friends spider
this and Texas Hashtag mansplaining

173
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,870
the statue. Oh my God. I have to
start explaining shit to women.

174
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,950
If this fucking annoys him, all you
gotta do is just do it more. Uh,

175
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,510
the tweet went viral over
Memorial Day weekend.

176
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:23,700
It all started when Ash Hernandez saw
the statue on her way to a teacher's

177
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,630
certification tests.

178
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,530
She was so outraged that she ran back
to her car to get her phone to snap a

179
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:33,280
picture. Uh, the sculpture
just screamed at mansplaining.

180
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,650
Let me just fucking try
to be open and honest,

181
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,600
which was really difficult for
me because I'm such a cunt.

182
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:40,360
But when I look at this thing,
um,

183
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,920
I don't see her smiling. She actually
looks like her lips are purse.

184
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:48,880
Like she's going really? But he, he,

185
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,450
he seems like a nice guy.
He's got a nice full head of hair.

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,970
He's wearing a pair of slacks.
He's got his shirt tucked in.

187
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,810
He does seem like she,
she seems annoyed by him.

188
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,450
I will say that the way
she's looking up at him,

189
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,590
I don't fuck do we make this a little
bigger? But I mean, if I saw this,

190
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:10,320
I would be like this guy striking out.
She's not having it.

191
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,080
I Dunno. I Dunno what the deal
is. He definitely, I got to admit,

192
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,170
he definitely does look like
he interrupted her. You know,

193
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,180
she's got her legs crossed.
She's got the book there.

194
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:27,960
She was reading and he came over.
I know this is mansplaining.

195
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,060
I think the guy's kind of a douche bag
and he's taken a fucking, you know,

196
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:35,770
he's second to swing. Um, I think
feminists have to understand that, uh,

197
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,580
in order for us to get laid, we have
to initiate the, uh, the interactions.

198
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,090
So, uh, you know,

199
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,690
maybe he didn't have to put
as low for up on the bench,

200
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,070
but I don't think that's a reason to
take the whole fucking thing down. Like,

201
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:54,140
I wouldn't walk by that statue was a guy
and be like, you know what, I'm gonna

202
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,540
do that next time I see
a line reading a book,

203
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm going to put my fucking foot on there.
Mansplaining is hilarious.

204
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,980
Just for the record ladies.
They do it to us too.

205
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,380
There's always that fucking person,
you know, that person. It's,

206
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:10,910
it's usually a person who's

207
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,510
either they're not educated or they're
overly impressed with their education.

208
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,390
Like someone who didn't go to college
is always trying to constantly, uh,

209
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,620
throw out some information about something
that they're well read on that they

210
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,454
rent,
you know,

211
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,510
to overcompensate for the fact that they
didn't fucking throw a hundred grand

212
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:32,830
into the god damn toilet going
of going away to school. Um,

213
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,450
or you get those people
that, um, you know,

214
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:41,230
I went to Undergrad here and
then I matriculated Holford
to fucking blah, blah,

215
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:45,640
blah for my graduate and my
baccalaureate degree. You know,

216
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,200
those fucking people.
And you know,

217
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,080
and I'm not saying that they can't be
cool and I'm not saying someone that

218
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:52,750
doesn't go to a fucking call, never
didn't go. It didn't go to college.

219
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,660
Can't be fucking cool, but I'm just
saying generally fucking speaking. Um,

220
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,570
those are the two types of people.
They overexplain shit.

221
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,320
You know, I've had people
who don't live in California.

222
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,840
Tell me what California is like,
you know,

223
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,210
and then you just sit in there going
like, dude, I lived there. The to La.

224
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:17,690
It's just everybody's plastic.
Everybody's got plastic surgery in Botox.

225
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,250
It's like, no, no. There's a lot of
unbelievably talented Pete. You know,

226
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,980
all those fucking shows you love
all those shows that blow your mind.

227
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,570
This golden age of TV.

228
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,380
Most of the people writing those in
shooting those live in Los Angeles.

229
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,680
So know that. All right. No, that okay.
You want to see a lot of plastic surgery?

230
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:37,210
I'd go down to Orange County. All
right. I'd go down there. Okay.

231
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,970
They even got laid. Off you go. I
thought that there was just going to be,

232
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:46,300
uh, you know, my wife watches the
real housewives of Orange County.

233
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:47,530
I thought it was bullshit.
I was like, all right.

234
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:50,860
They picked the six biggest
freaks down here, you know,

235
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,690
and then of course made
this place look bad.

236
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:55,660
And then I went down there and I did a
couple of weekends down in Irvine and I

237
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,150
was like, oh, why can't I see,

238
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,330
I see what's going on now
I see what's going on.

239
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:05,920
53 year old woman wearing spaghetti
straps, you know, freckled shoulders.

240
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,900
You can see they're still working out,
but you know,

241
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:10,870
your skin just loses the elasticity
and it just, it doesn't look good,

242
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,560
doesn't look good. No one should wear
a tank top man or a woman over 50.

243
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:18,340
You just shouldn't do it. You
know, even Jake a jackal lane,

244
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,550
we had the decency to wear that funds.
He fucking onesy zip up.

245
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,690
He was still in great shape, but he knew,
he knew what was going on. You know,

246
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,620
varicose vein here or there. You
cover it up, you know, you, you,

247
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,190
you keep yourself in shape
and you wear a lot of clothes.

248
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,590
Hey,
by the way,

249
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,340
all freckles is turning the ship
around this big fucking tugboat of a,

250
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,330
of a belly that I've put on here.
Uh, I was a buck 87 or something.

251
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:52,570
I think I, I've dropped a couple, you
know, when you first started dating,

252
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:56,590
you can drop a couple of times in a few
days just by, just by eating healthy,

253
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,300
just by going from the beginning of
the day to the end of the day. So, um,

254
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,080
I've been doing the oatmeal in the
morning with a banana and then between

255
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:09,980
breakfast and lunch I have an
orange. And then for lunch, uh,

256
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,250
I've been just doing like a,
what did I have yesterday?

257
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,710
Had a giant salad and then I had
a little bit of steak in there.

258
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,160
And what are they have
a little bit tuna later.

259
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,880
And then for dinner I was
running out the door and I just,

260
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,950
I had this salary already fucking chopped
up at a big glob of peanut butter and

261
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:30,680
I just did that. And uh, do,
that's a game changer, man.

262
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,630
If you have salary with
a glove of peanut butter,

263
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:36,290
if you can fucking tough your way through
that and deal with people going like,

264
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,160
what are you doing? A
remake of fucking, uh,

265
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,510
outcast or whatever that fucking movie
Tom Hanks did where he talked to the ball.

266
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,340
Was that called Lone
survivor? Oh, Jesus Christ.

267
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:51,310
I know this one.
It begins with an o not outcast,

268
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,960
shipwrecked overcast weather.

269
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,660
Okay.

270
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,440
The fuck was that called?
God dammit. Anyways,

271
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,840
didn't being with an, Oh, let me add
the big beard. Well said. Well said.

272
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,950
Okay.

273
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,860
All right. You're on an island.
His ship wrecked castaway.

274
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,493
Gasaway.

275
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,940
What does a castaway is that
when they throw you overboard

276
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,700
and they fucking stole, you've been
cached away. Not to fucking safe.

277
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,450
Let's say one of the worst things
ever is getting keel hauled.

278
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,510
Can you imagine that shit just fucking
drag you underneath the boat til you pass

279
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:37,240
out from sucking in water? I mean, like,

280
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,800
it's just a fact that that could
be a punishment. The egg shells,

281
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,140
that I would be walking on it,

282
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,740
whatever that fucking one legged maniac
told me to do that was fucking driving

283
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:52,630
the boat. I would do I fucking do
anything. He cannot fucking Keel, homey.

284
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,760
And your friends is fucking sitting
there strapping me up for that ride.

285
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,861
And you're sitting there going,

286
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:04,450
come on guys under your breath
like [inaudible]. [inaudible] um,

287
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,690
oh my God,
I could never live back then.

288
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,760
I would been y'all this shit
that I talk right now. You know,

289
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,750
I talk all this shit right
now because there's no,

290
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,520
none of that belly of the beast. No iron
maiden's left. None of that fucking shit,

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,890
at least in this part of the
world or at least where I live.

292
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,773
You know what I mean?

293
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,530
But we don't to fucking set you on fire
and do all that fucking horrific shit

294
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:25,450
that we've done to people
throughout the years. All right,

295
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:29,440
let's get off this subject.
It's a, it's Kinda creepy, Huh?

296
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,420
All right.
What do we got here?

297
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,160
Other shit people wanted me to talk
about battle rapper holds nothing back on

298
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:40,960
the fat jokes. Uh, uh, post that
video, I started to watch it,

299
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:45,910
but he was going so goddamn
slow. Um, it was annoying me.

300
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,770
Ah, Shit. I gotta hit pause. Hang
on, hang on, hang on. Hang on.

301
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,900
All right,
sorry about that.

302
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,970
He sent to make sure that was somebody's
calling me about something to have

303
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:02,430
later on in the day,
and I got to make sure I'm not gonna

304
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,120
we laid over there. Um, it's something
else. Somebody wanted me to go off on. Um,

305
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,360
cancer charities allegedly missed,

306
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:14,361
used $187 million for
concerts and dating sites,

307
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,300
luxury cars for cancer charities.
I think I already talked about this.

308
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,690
Use more than a hundred to $87
million to buy luxury cars,

309
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,550
luxury cruises, concert tickets,
and even dating members.

310
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,260
Memberships for families and friends.

311
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:34,000
It's one of the largest charity frauds
accusations ever leveled in the u s well,

312
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:35,890
I gotta be honest with you.
So many of them.

313
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,490
Okay.

314
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,830
If you dig a little bit,
it seems like a,

315
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,090
I can't say like say
like five hour energy.

316
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,710
Gee, they just got a thing now
that every time you buy something,

317
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,850
five hour energy, they're going to
donate to this fucking costs. All right?

318
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:56,960
And basically what they're going to do
is they, but they have it on the screen.

319
00:18:56,961 --> 00:19:01,961
They say we're going to give at least
200 grand and we're going to give 5 cents

320
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,710
on every five hour energy thing that we
sell. And I got to be, when I'm talking,

321
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:09,330
I don't think that that's
bad because they're being,

322
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
they're being upfront about it.

323
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,643
MMM.

324
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,850
Oh, Jesus Christ, you
blocked me and jerk face,

325
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,180
close the driveway gates and lock the
front door. I had to move your rental car.

326
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,940
That's a nice block. My wife and I are
driving like an asshole. Um, anyways,

327
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,730
um,
I don't think that that's bad.

328
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,053
MMM.

329
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,580
But I,
I just,

330
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,580
you just have to pay attention to a up
a portion of the proceeds is the big

331
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:41,570
thing and it becomes like what portion
of the proceeds and then it becomes like,

332
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,310
well,
what charity can I give to that?

333
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,490
The most amount is going to go to
the actual people that are suffering.

334
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,780
Now you have to have some sort
of infrastructure and the people,

335
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,960
if they donating 100% of
their time to the charity,

336
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:03,830
they have to make a living where they
can pay a mortgage. So I get all of that.

337
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,740
But, um, there is, there is a thing
where it becomes like, well, how much,

338
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,310
how much are you making a year?
Like if you're taking in $10 million,

339
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,790
you're paying yourself a
fucking $1 million a year.

340
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,700
Then that's when it starts getting
weird where it's just like, all right,

341
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:23,570
so you're a fucking millionaire right
now because people have rickets or

342
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:27,200
whatever, you know, I don't
fucking know who the fuck knows.

343
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,240
All I can tell you is that my charity.

344
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,620
Okay.

345
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,940
Okay. The all freckles.
All right. To raise, uh,

346
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,470
to raise awareness on skin cancer is,
is going to be a,

347
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm going to get that in motion
for a 2021 even in 2015, 2016

348
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,740
I'm going to set it up. All right? And
every time you guys go, oh, Jane's is,

349
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:52,510
I'm going to, uh, I can't do that. I
will go broke if I, um, I don't know.

350
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,520
I'll come up with some more shit.

351
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,750
I can fuck you guys out of money and make
it seem like you guys are doing a good

352
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:57,890
thing and I'm doing a good thing.

353
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,430
And then one day you'll find out that I
completely fucked you over and then I'll

354
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:03,800
have like no comment as I get out of my,

355
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,920
you guys find out that you bought
my Tesla. Can you imagine that if I,

356
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,230
you know what kills me about
people do shit like that is,

357
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:21,020
it's funny to me like if they can
sleep at night or if, if they can't,

358
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:24,020
if they're out or if it's the other way
and they're just fucking wide awake at

359
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:27,530
night going out Jesus
Christ like a hey man,

360
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,300
those alligator shoes who sings like
Tom Ford, like 12 fucking grand. Yeah.

361
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,460
How did you get dosed?
Ah,

362
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,380
raising awareness for a kidney stones.
You know,

363
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,060
while we raised a ton of money and I just
take a percentage, 90% and I, you know,

364
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:47,540
um, I do, I'm doing God's
work. Glad plash shit.

365
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,170
You're doing God's work.
You do God's guides work.

366
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,270
I run a nonprofit. Oh yeah.
Then how do you pay your bills?

367
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,760
Okay.

368
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,130
Ball's in your court, Sweetheart.
I just asked you a question.

369
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:01,964
Don't stare at me like,

370
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,810
how do you run a nonprofit and
fucking put fruit loops on the table?

371
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,950
I want to know at some
point while I draw a salary,

372
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,810
they go, you are profiting,
you profit. But whatever.

373
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:16,430
I guess I, I'm, I'm
starting to think like,

374
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,690
I'm overly critical of a lot of
these charities that uh, you know,

375
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,090
people do have to make a living,
you know what I mean?

376
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,200
But then there's that weird thing
where it's like the bigger the event,

377
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,080
they feel like the more money that
they're going to make I guess.

378
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:33,050
And then they got to start renting
out these sick ass fucking places.

379
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,190
And that's why I think it
starts getting weird. I Dunno,

380
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,320
there's a good movie in that somewhere,
somewhere in there,

381
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:43,190
there's a good movie script about somebody
that starts a fucking nonprofit for

382
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:45,560
the right reasons. And
then the end, you know,

383
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:47,870
the money's coming in
and they get a nicer car.

384
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:50,690
All of a sudden that driving
around you ain't gold digging.

385
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:53,880
Whores starts showing up.
You make a statue of it,

386
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:57,770
some broad walking into class doesn't
like it. She fucking tweets about it.

387
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,060
Nine people lose their minds.
So 15 people lose their jobs.

388
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,330
Isn't that how it works? And I'll bill
you is such a Douche. Shut up. All right.

389
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:10,190
Fuck you. All right, let me,
let me, um, oh by the way, uh,

390
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,053
the,
uh,

391
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,980
the extra posters that then I had
leftover from the Billy Bible belt tour,

392
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:20,981
they're all autographed and they
went on sale yesterday and uh,

393
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,830
much to my, uh, happiness there.

394
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,720
They're going really fast. So,
um, if you want to get one there,

395
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:33,830
uh, I made sure I autographed
all of them and um,

396
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,420
I dunno, we get a, I
don't know to get left,

397
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:41,390
I'm like 150 left or something like that.
So if you'd like to get one, you know,

398
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,030
if you can't make it to my
shows or somebody, you know,

399
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,980
you know that deal if like it to get it.
If you

400
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,090
don't, I fucking get it.
All right. Um, so anyways,

401
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:53,610
what are we up to here?
23, fuck, 24 minutes. Um,

402
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,820
let me do a little read here. A
little advertising. Read a blue apron.

403
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,260
A fuck is this blue apron.
It's okay.

404
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:06,530
You can admit the last thing anybody
wants to do after work is waiting in line

405
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:10,100
at a grocery store. Schlep home
and cook. Cook a complicated meal.

406
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,770
I agree with that. I agree with
this copy so far and expensive,

407
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:20,690
unhealthy takeoff take out is hardly
better. I'll put it, it's delicious.

408
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,750

424
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,790
Each balanced meal is 500 to 700
calories per serving and so tasty.

425
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:24,980
You'd never know.
I love when they do that.

426
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,400
Acting like healthy food doesn't taste
good. Cooking takes half an hour.

427
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Shipping is flexible and free
and the menus are always new.

428
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,260
They won't send the same meal twice.

429
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:36,210
They work around your schedule and
dietary preferences and blue paper and

430
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:39,380
experts source only the best
seasonal ingredients, uh,

431
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,840
from incredible meals like sliced pork.

432
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Steak was smashed potatoes and
strawberry rhubarb compote.

433
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,670
What component?
Cal Zone with Broccoli Rabe.

434
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,670
The fuck is this food.
Which Chili Garlic Mozzarella,

435
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,840
ricotta cheese with the creamy dip baby.

436
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,860
You'll cook incredible meals and be
blown away by the quality and freshness.

437
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,570
Blue Apron.
It's a better way to cook.

438
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:13,571
Check out this week's menu and get your
first two meals for free by going to

439
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:18,080
blue apron.com/barbie you are uh,
my treat.

440
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:22,230
Really the first two meals are on me.
When you go to blue apron.com/birth well,

441
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:25,610
they're not on me. They're on. You
guys at least tried to do that.

442
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:28,610
They always try to put words in your
mouth. These people, you know what I mean?

443
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,580
I just put on my blue apron
and I feel like a million buck.

444
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,840
My deck is standing at
attention a has everybody.

445
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,290
Chances are if you have feet,
you wear socks and face it.

446
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:43,040
Socks haven't changed since they were
invented and the hour they'd fucking mass

447
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,200
by crying

448
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Asians or people down in El Salvador.
It's disgusting. It's changed a lot.

449
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:53,140
Back in the day your mom made him sat
down and knitted him, hey bond this,

450
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:55,030
why don't you fucking,
you know,

451
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,970
read a little bit of history before he
started throwing up crazy shit like that.

452
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,430
Uh, they were all, they fall down,

453
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,630
they wear out and there's always that
toasting that's never in the right place.

454
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,420
Our new sponsor bond buzz has changed.

455
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:11,530
All of that bomb is dedicated two years
to engineering socks that stay up last

456
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:16,450
forever and feel amazing on your feet.
Um, evidently I have a pair of Obama's,

457
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,740
I probably dope gives a fuck.

458
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:23,380
New socks are awesome and these guys are
going to send them to you if it's got

459
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:26,050
to this. Let's cut to the chase
here. There's so comfortable.

460
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:29,800
The honeycomb stitching. I'm a big fan
of honeycomb stitching. Hugs your foot.

461
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,250
So whether you're walking or running,
your feet feel perfect.

462
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,390
This is such an old guy thing.
Young guys, you got LR ladies,

463
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:38,440
you got to get into this shit.

464
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,570
You got to take care of your feet
because as you get older, man,

465
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,310
those are the things that talk to
you first. She got damn dogs. Um,

466
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,360
um, anyways, uh,

467
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,030
you might find yourself washing them
over and over so you can wear them again.

468
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,740
You need to get more of you buddy.

469
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:54,590
If you haven't gotten them yet to know
what you, what you're talking about.

470
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,030
I'm checking all the eyes here. You need
to really try a pair of for yourself.

471
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:02,180
But listen, bombers don't stop with
your comfort with every pair of socks.

472
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,870
Bombers sells a parish. Donate
it to someone in need. Yeah.

473
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,340
The person who had a fucking sewn together
for 2 cents an hour because socks is,

474
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:13,650
it turns out are the number one requested
thing at the homeless shelters. Uh,

You are r.

481
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,860
Um, she's just quite how fucking
hard. If people work in these days,

482
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,070
they don't have time to shop.
They don't have time to get food.

483
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,750
It's fucking unreal. Do you guys remember
that cartoon? The Jetsons? You know,

484
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:54,751
meet George Jetson [inaudible] data to
do his boy [inaudible] daughter Judy.

485
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,460
Um, Jane, his wife,

486
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,760
Dang Dude.
Ooh.

487
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,200
And His fucking car folded up and do a
briefcase that was supposed to be in the

488
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,840
future. And the whole premise
was, is pool's getting,

489
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:17,140
it was the Flintstones flipped on its ear.
It's just like the Flintstones,

490
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:21,790
but it's in the future. No, Dino,
you got astro, right? No, Bam, Bam.

491
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:26,230
You got Ellroy whenever the fuck
I'm talking about. So anyways, they,

492
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,750
the big premise about that was technology.

493
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,770
Technology was going to be
so fucking insane that uh,

494
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,280
we were going to have three day work
weeks and that was a running joke on that.

495
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:39,700
George Jetson would always say, oh my God,
these three day work weeks are murder.

496
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,580
And,
and I guess that hasn't happened.

497
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,710
People are working more than they
have a fucking worked. And uh,

498
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,730
to the point they don't have time to
go to a goddamned grocery store growth,

499
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,870
some fucking vegetables. I'll
pick up a pair of socks, you know,

500
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,990
or afford a pair razor blades down at cvs.

501
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:58,790
So then all the shit that
I'm fucking than I, than I,

502
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,560
all these people that advertise, you
don't have time to go to the post office.

503
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:06,410
You don't get time to fucking do
anything anymore. Why is that?

504
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,740
Did we, did we not understand that the
technology was now going to own us?

505
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,210
Like look at all this shit.

506
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:16,790
I'm fucking sitting there uploading
all these fucking photos that I'm never

507
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:20,690
going to look at it and it's making my
computer freeze the fuck am I doing when

508
00:30:20,691 --> 00:30:22,610
I've been dealing with this thing.
I don't even know what the problem is.

509
00:30:22,611 --> 00:30:25,730
It's been, it's, it started last
night and it's still hasn't uploaded.

510
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,980
It won't let me stop the process.

511
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,200
It doesn't give me an
option or probably a dozen.

512
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,660
I don't know how to fucking do it,
you know,

513
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,230
and it just becomes something else that
I got to fucking deal with. So I dunno.

514
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,080
Would you guys ever have the balls to go
back to a flip phone like some of these

515
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:43,840
kids are doing?
Actually I heard this comic did that.

516
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,840
He just got sick of fucking being on his,

517
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,830
his iPhone or his fucking whatever the
elements are. What are the other ones?

518
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,140
You know Hitachi,
who else makes it?

519
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:02,600
Who else makes a a phone?
There's the other one,

520
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,010
the really big one and
I don't fucking know.

521
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:09,190
All I know is I don't talk on mine
anymore. I just, I used the speaker.

522
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,710
I'm big on the speaker, man. I
don't hold it up to my fucking head.

523
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,820
After that kid in mobile,

524
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:17,680
Alabama told me his dad died of a brain
tumor on the side of his head that he's

525
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:20,680
talking to a cell phone all the fucking
time and he's convinced that that's what

526
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,100
it was.

527
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,400
And I remember hearing Roger Ebert say
that about gene Siskel the same fucking

528
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:26,290
thing. So, um, uh,

529
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,490
I hope I didn't wait too long because
God knows I can't remember shit.

530
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,560
This is getting really fucking depressing.
All right,

531
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:37,120
we're up to a half hour
here. Um, all right, so a,

532
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:40,600
I didn't talk to me about any basketball.
Let me talk about that real quick. Uh,

533
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,070
the basketball man, who do
you like? Who Do you like?

534
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,923
Um,

535
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,670
I love that the Golden State Warriors
it back in it for the first time since

536
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:55,300
what, 75. And um,

537
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,640
I love that they play in
that old ass fucking arena.

538
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,550
There's a lot to like about them,
but for some reason, you know,

539
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,490
Lebron going back after they hated him
and they burned all these jerseys and

540
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:10,550
shit.
Him going back and becoming a champion,

541
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:14,660
showing that he didn't have to be part
of a fucking pile on team with all,

542
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:18,380
you know, all the injuries that
got, I dunno, I can tell you this,

543
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:21,980
I'm going to be happy with the,
the team that wins and um,

544
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,030
but I think, uh, I think
Lebron's going to get,

545
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:30,480
he's just such a fucking force,
but I will say,

546
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,550
and I don't know shit about
basketball and that fucking,

547
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,060
what's his Stephon Curry said, I
you say his name Steve. Dan Curry.

548
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:39,450
Stephon Curry. I don't know
his fucking name was. I've not,

549
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,460
I've never seen a guy shoot
threes like that in my life.

550
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,050
He's like Larry Bird level
unconscious every fucking game.

551
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,460
Uv starts bad. All of a sudden he just,
he starts, I haven't seen anybody.

552
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,380
There was the greatest three
point shooters I've seen
in my life is Larry Bird,

553
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:59,460
Reggie Miller,
and just for degree of difficulty,

554
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,360
the amount of times I saw Colby take a
turnaround jumper with two guys hanging

555
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:06,810
on him and he fucking hits it.
Um,

556
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,130
I mean those, those rhino, right.

557
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,680
Wral and I guess I never
watched him when he was playing.

558
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:18,100
What do you play with the bucks?
The Sonics? I don't fucking know.

559
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:20,850
I'm not a basketball guy. All
I know is this guy. Is He,

560
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,540
the way he shoots every fucking game
is like a career game. He's the one,

561
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,420
he's the greatest three
point shooter I've ever seen.

562
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:31,930
I would say Reggie Miller
second and then Larry Bird.

563
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,630
I've never seen anything like this kid.
So,

564
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,340
but I don't think that
that's going to be enough.

565
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:39,730
Him just fucking flicking that wrist
and it going right through the net to

566
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:42,670
compensate for the,
the domination of Lebron.

567
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:45,730
I just think that that guy is,
um,

568
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,910
I dunno if he's just on another level,
just another level.

569
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,230
And I think according to law head,
Cleveland has a fucking amazing defense.

570
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,850
Defense wins championships or what?

571
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,020
That little tidbit of information from
La had day of golf. That's my prediction.

572
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:03,110
I'm saying the Cavaliers win
a championship. All right.

573
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,910
And Lebron goes down with Cleveland
legends. I think it's funny.

574
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:12,320
You gotta go back to Jim Brown
and Bob Feller and then Lebron,

575
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,270
right? That's going to be
there. Bobby or Ted Williams,

576
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:22,250
Larry Berg, Tom Brady,
right. Those are ours.

577
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,113
Those are our four.

578
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,870
You gotta throw Bill Russell and
another though 11 championships.

579
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,020
Um, who's getting hurt? We got so
many fucking champions were fun.

580
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,310
So many fucking champions.

581
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,060
So many champions so that they have to
suspend one of the great quarterbacks of

582
00:34:37,061 --> 00:34:40,080
all time of over. Absolutely
fucking nothing. Um,

583
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,230
do you guys read up on Jim Marsay
how he had a, a, you know his,

584
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:47,710
his mistress there. He bought her a house
and she fucking hoe dating it. You know,

585
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,990
he's a great guy. Okay. You
know, it's solid fucking dude.

586
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:51,640
You should be listening to that guy,
Bill.

587
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,890
Are you really going to whine about
it again? You're right. You're right.

588
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,210
It's over. It's done. It's
going to happen. So anyways,
thank you for listening.

589
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,970
Enjoy the throwback clip here.

590
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Have yourselves a wonderful weekend
if cons and I will love talk to you on

591
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,024
Monday.

592
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,823
Okay.

593
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,553
Uh,

594
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,710
alright, next question.
Alright. Hey, fill huge fan.

595
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,980
Not sure if this is where we ask podcasts

596
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,400
questions or what,
but what are some of your guilty pleasure?

597
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,470
My guilty pleasures.
Desperate housewives.

598
00:35:57,471 --> 00:36:01,430
A pint of Haagen Daas Ryan Seacrest's.

599
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,550
Guilty pleasure. You know what?
I gotta give it up to this guy.

600
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:07,880
And he did call himself out for
asking kind of a faggy question.

601
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,810
What are some of my guilty pleasures?
Uh,

602
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,310
Jesus Christ. I don't know. You know what?

603
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,690
This looks like a job for iTunes.
Let's look at my iPod.

604
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,460
Let me going to scroll down here and
let's look at Kate Alice in chains.

605
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,050
This is the last few things I
downloaded. Alison chains, Jar flies,

606
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:34,940
the new foo fighters.
That's all respectable. Um,

607
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,410
somebody was walking by staring at me.

608
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:39,790
I'm doing this podcast in
my car by the way. Uh Oh,

609
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,070
there's one Rosanna by toto.

610
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,100
Fuck Yo. I like the drum beat. I want
to learn how to play it. All right.

611
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,330
God dammit. And I want to do it either
way. It could be, yeah, it's a gay song.

612
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,470
All right. That's a guilty
pleasure. Um, nine, I'm going
to get a bunch of comments.

613
00:36:57,471 --> 00:37:00,740
Everybody was fucking total pictures.
Just make sure Jeff Macarthur was in it,

614
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,260
so who won't get fooled again?
That's kind of Hacky, muddy waters.

615
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:10,310
I'm ready. The Allman brothers
one way out. Kanye West.

616
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,590
I Dunno, some people don't like him.
Gym Class Heroes. Oh, wait a minute.

617
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,000
Wait a minute. There's one
poison. Every rose has it's thorn.

618
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,580
Oh. You know, it's funny.

619
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:27,581
I love that song and I can't listen to
it without every time I listened to what

620
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:31,460
I always picture people I know,
watching me listen, catching me,

621
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,750
listening to that song. So I always get
embarrassed during the breakdown park.

622
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,300
You know, where he just Sorta strums
the guitar, Dan in Aa, that part.

623
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,570
Um, yeah. I actually get embarrassed.

624
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:48,260
And a lot of times I say 30% of the
time I have to shut off the fucking sun.

625
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,940
I don't know what that says about me.
Ben Harper, does that make me a Douche?

626
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:56,990
I Dunno. Uh, loving spoonful. Maya,

627
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,170
I got some,
I got some weird ones here.

628
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,130
Band of horses kind of
makes me a hipster Douche.

629
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,450
Dionne Warwick walk on by.

630
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,900
I didn't download that today.
Fucked about it. Up On my,

631
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,840
I'm the only one to use. Is this
bathroom really exposing myself here? Uh,

632
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:25,270
what else do I got here?
Beastie boys. Men at work. Work

633
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,430
overkill. What did it all, you
know why I downloaded that? I wait,

634
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:34,490
what does that move? What's
that show with it? Scrubs.

635
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,160
The guy plays the, uh, the doctor,
the guy with that fucking, uh,

636
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,770
show them with the black dude.
Can I see your funny show?

637
00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:45,010
And they had that one time the
guy came on, he, you know, you,

638
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,290
you don't have a song like you don't
think you like it or maybe you don't even

639
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,620
like it and it's in a movie,
then all of a sudden everybody likes it.

640
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,310
It's kind of like black people all of
a sudden, like in sweet home Alabama.

641
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,410
Was that because they played that
in, uh, what was it a con air?

642
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,950
Was that the first time and then
that guy rapped over it anyway,

643
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,120
black listening to that you should really
do is you should look at the words to

644
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:10,070
that song.
I don't think you'd like that song.

645
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,810
Especially the second
verse that in Birmingham,

646
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,170
they love the good near Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

647
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,250
That they're talking about governor
Wallace who was pro segregation.

648
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,330
So think of that.
Next time you're a,

649
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,380
you're walking it out down there
and hot Atlanta. That's not a,

650
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:31,910
I don't think that's a pro black song.

651
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,120
It's got a nice beat and you could dance
to it though. I will give him that.

652
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,043
All right.

653
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:41,510
Does that pretty much pretty much
answered this the question I got to redeem

654
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:44,240
myself.
What are we gonna be a tool?

655
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,460
You can tell him blowing by a bunch.
I don't want to tell you.

656
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:52,880
I'm just scrolling down here.
Grace Jones. Demolition man.

657
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,480
Yeah, yeah, yes. Somebody is,

658
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,950
I just took a chance on temptation.

659
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,900
I got a whole bunch of ACDC,

660
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,230
uh,
oh my God.

661
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,690
Actually have that pink song that's
been on that forever though. Amazon, um,

662
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,030
come in and say, you better get
the buddy [inaudible] add up done.

663
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,400
And I downloaded that.

664
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,030
There was a moment in my life where I
actually wanted to hear that song again.

665
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,550
It's Kinda like Nickelback
I have one of those songs,

666
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,900
that song photograph there go back
as amazing to me where it's like,

667
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,410
the first time you hear the song
you're like, Eh, Eh, it's not that bad.

668
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:36,190
Why they get so much, so much shit. Then
the second time you hear it, you're like,

669
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,550
hey, I kinda like that.
Maybe I'll download it. Then
the third time you hear it,

670
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:44,470
you're like, I want to find that
group. Hunt them down, kill them.

671
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,900
You know, like a deer. Have
some ravens. Oh my back.

672
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:53,080
Wait for me to fucking got them so the
meat doesn't go bad and then they kind of

673
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:57,660
fly in. We need the end trails. You ever
watch? You ever watch someone ravens?

674
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,100
I just watched someone Raven's
the other day. All right,

675
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,760
let's move on to the next question.
This is my guilty pleasures.

676
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,670
So

677
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,660
[inaudible] so,

678
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,830
so what happens then? Is that a,
uh, you know, they, we, we, we,

679
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:37,880
we auditioned him at the comedy
connection. We go to do it live.

680
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,780
We had done it in a room and they said,
we want to see you live and we bond bond.

681
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,210
It's just like, it's sucking silence now.
What do you think? Wait a minute. Wait,

682
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,830
so the first time you ever
did it on comedy stage,

683
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,370
now I've always said the first
time if I bombed the first time,

684
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,530
I don't know if I would ever have the
courage to go back and do it again. Well,

685
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,780
well that, that that's a difference
between people that are, are, are,

686
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,220
are hooked on it and people,
yeah.

687
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,280
People who are born comics and people
who are just, you know, dabbling.

688
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,210
Is that like really, if you bond you
would have done it again. It would've,

689
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,600
it would've taken me a minute. I
would had it been like the, just the,

690
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,190
the sheer fucking embarrassment of a,

691
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,730
I mean you can still, this is deal with
standup is you can still eat it today.

692
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm 18 years in, I kind of, yeah, you
can't eat it fun. But this is the thing,

693
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,260
you have years of good shows
to be like, well, you know,

694
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,300
I know I don't suck at this.
I had a bad night,

695
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:33,030
but you know it right out of the gate.
Oh yeah. The bad night thing is hard to,

696
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,750
to really get around you had,
cause it still hurts me if I bombed,

697
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:39,320
but when you're up there and you know, you
have this whole idea that you know, uh,

698
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:43,130
it's, it's never, the
audience is bullshit. I mean
sometimes it's the audience,

699
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,760
right. And you know, like
you, you can tell, you know,

700
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:48,830
you've done your shit and you can see
where they're peaking laughter wise and

701
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:49,191
you know,

702
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,070
after a certain point that they're
not going to go any further with that.

703
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,203
So I'll get after it.

704
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,390
I'm just going to have to realize this
is the best I'm going to do in this

705
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:59,930
situation and either eat it
and you don't take the hit or,

706
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:02,130
or make light of the fact. Yeah. I've,

707
00:43:02,131 --> 00:43:05,150
I've learned like there's nothing worse
than being angry on stage. But I heard,

708
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,840
I actually heard a funny story last night.
I was doing a kick and uh, this, uh,

709
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:12,650
this book or Jeff Wills from the
uh, yeah, he was telling a story.

710
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:13,750
He saw one night,
uh,

711
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,210
said Bill Hicks it an entire show
with his back to the audience.

712
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,390
There was like a Bachelorette party. There
was every fucking thing it did. Yeah.

713
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:23,630
Those, you know, those Booker's they love
to talk about those stories, you know.

714
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,490
But if anyone else did that now,

715
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,670
they would never fucking work in that
club again. All these guys pretend like,

716
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:29,150
you know, like, oh,

717
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:33,170
Bill Hicks was the guy and he went on
stage and angrily tanked in a brilliant

718
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:35,780
inspired way almost all the time.

719
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,050
But if someone existed like that
now he wouldn't have a fucking shot.

720
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,210
You think so? Absolutely. Well, I bet.

721
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,360
I bet he was still selling tickets at
that point. Cause you can't, you can't,

722
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,570
you can't turn your back
on a fucking crowd and,

723
00:43:46,571 --> 00:43:48,560
and ever think that you're going to work.
I don't think that's true.

724
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,090
I think that the reason he got booked in
this country primarily was to make club

725
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,130
owners feel like they were,
you know,

726
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,340
they were at least championing something
terrific. Like I think they innate,

727
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:01,970
we knew this guy was special.
There was no one like him.

728
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,360
And even the fact that he didn't sell
tickets or alienated the audience every

729
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:09,380
time they were gonna have him twice a
year to keep their content straight. Oh.

730
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:12,830
So that can be dicks to everybody else
basically. But just to sort of like, to,

731
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,970
to at least support that,

732
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:16,730
at least they knew well enough
that he was an inspired guy.

733
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,560
But I've gotten angry on stage. I did
it the other night, dude, not in it.

734
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:22,820
And it would've been a long time because
I used to snap all the tabs and say,

735
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:25,750
that's kind of an understatement
coming from you. Yeah. But,

736
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,760
but that's like me saying, I've
snapped. No, but, but you know,

737
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:33,030
I'm pretty accessible now. Not, Oh
yeah, you're your way, your way. Uh,

738
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,330
but it happened at the store, dude,
it happened at this how long ago?

739
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,180
Two nights ago. And I, I, I, I
could do this whole thing. Yeah,

740
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,760
much better now. Much better
enough. I snapped one time.
What was it, 48 hours ago?

741
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,010
I couldn't believe I did. It was
such a different person. You know,

742
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:48,590
that place brings it out of here.
Come on.

743
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,500
The comedy store brings it
out of here sometimes. I,
that's what I love it though.

744
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,640
It's so fucking soul on
stage. It is evil. It is.

745
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:59,700
It's just painted and heat,
you know,

746
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:03,510
you feel the walls wanting you to lose
it, you know, if it's just in the place,

747
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,850
so I'm on stage,
it's like 40 people in the room and like,

748
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,200
I'm already like just right when
I get in there. You have some kid,

749
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:13,560
that kid David Taylor, you know that
kid, he's a tall guy, used to do comedy.

750
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:16,630
He's very cynical and negative and I just,
I wasn't in the mood for it.

751
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,560
I hadn't seen them in months and
I said hi to him and he goes,

752
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:22,200
I'm staying around just to see you.
You better be good.

753
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,050
And so right away I'm like,
I haven't seen you in a fucking long time.

754
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:28,740
You have no right to fucking talk like
that to me enough with the negative shit,

755
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,870
you know?
And I stormed off

756
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,600
and I walked back and made me feel
really good about myself by that cause

757
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:39,330
usually I sound like the angry psycho.
I can be like the happy person.

758
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:42,910
That's where take, take a
break. Yeah. Thank you. Oh go
ahead. You Go. All right. So,

759
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:47,210
so I get on stage magical one on who I
think is just terrific. I love al. He's,

760
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,160
I think he's fucking hilarious. It's
really original, unique stylists,

761
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:52,590
real storyteller. He does good, you know,

762
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:55,300
and then he brings me up
and then I'm getting laughs.

763
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:58,200
There's only like 30 or 40 people
in the or and it's going fine.

764
00:45:58,201 --> 00:45:59,520
There's an old couple up front,

765
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,520
the Oh maybe in their mid
fifties early sixties and they,

766
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,460
if someone talked to him and [inaudible]
and they asked him about religion,

767
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:07,980
I think Neal Brennan did. They said
they were Jews. I'm like, fine.

768
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,660
So I'm doing my show and
they're not laughing at nothing.

769
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,850
And I looked at them and I said,
uh, I'm sorry, my two filthy,

770
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:16,620
you want me to talk some political
stuff, you know, is, is that what it is?

771
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,330
And then the old man looks at me, he
goes, you're not funny. Yeah. And I,

772
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:24,600
and I just had this moment where I'm like,
all right, dude, all right. And I said,

773
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,640
you know what, I am
funny. I know I'm funny.

774
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:30,070
I'm doing well with the rest
of the audience. All right.
And, and I, and, and I,

775
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,240
I understand what you're saying. And, uh,

776
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:35,970
and then like for some reason
I just looked at him, I said,

777
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:39,720
but the fact that that's what you had
to pull out of your guts to say to me in

778
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:43,980
this situation makes me fucking hate you.
And,

779
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,490
and, and the real punchline there, mark.
So now you lose the rest of the crowd.

780
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,960
That's right. This is quite in the room.
And I'm like, what? That wasn't funny.

781
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,050
What did I say? Did Not come out funny
now you turn on the rest of them.

782
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,970
All right. Then I turned on the rest of
them. And then, uh, and then he goes,

783
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:02,730
you know, you asked and I said, well, you
didn't, you could have qualified it. Like,

784
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:04,530
how about you're not funny to me.

785
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,270
All of a sudden you're the god of this
fucking room. You're the Almighty.

786
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,690
You're the one that has the last
word. Fuck that. Right. And so that,

787
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,450
and then like you were in a bad mood
before you got there because you're going

788
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,380
to say the read of this guy
saying you are not funny.

789
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:19,380
Sounds to me like you said some
shit that he didn't want to hear.

790
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,470
It was more of a subject thing. Not,
not, no, I just, it was a general thing.

791
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,910
So then I,
and the rest of the act,

792
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:26,360
I'm doing my act and everyone's
laughing every time everyone else will.

793
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:29,290
After I looked at him and I went,
Huh, Huh. And then like, you know,

794
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,760
at the end of my set and bringing
that Brenda is easy and he,

795
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,410
he stands up with his wife and they
walk out and while I'm still on stage

796
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,430
bringing up Steve and I got very
powerful statement, very powerful.

797
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:44,840
I'll see you later, dad. Oh
Jesus mark. Cause that's what
I said to him. I said, hey,

798
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:47,680
like you know, it's like every fucking
Jewish guy that has that kind of judgment.

799
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:48,281
That's your age.

800
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:50,910
You just some surrogate for my
father and I understand I'm trans,

801
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,140
I'm transposing some contempt on you,

802
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:55,680
but you could have fucking
shows a different way. All
right. All right. Anyways,

803
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,470
Mark Marin here on Monday morning,
but that's not funny. No, no, no.

804
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:02,410
I'm just letting people know I'm acting.
You know what I just did there?

805
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:06,280
I acted like this was a live show.
I like it. We'll take some callers

806
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:13,100
[inaudible].
