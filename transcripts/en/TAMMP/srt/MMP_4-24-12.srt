5
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:26,670
Isn't as that conti thing to say. You

00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,180

00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:38,600
Anyway, so this is the podcast and this
week I have another special guest, um,

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,780
cheating again this week,
making it easy on myself, uh,

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,350
all the way from New Jersey. Ladies
and gentlemen, the legendary.

11
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,440
We brought you up a zillion times
on this podcast, Paul Versey.

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,720
It's good to be here, man. Paul,
Vinny, Michael, Anthony Versie,

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,680
what's going on from fucking New Jersey,
New York,

14
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:03,420
from New York and big time jets and
giants fan depending on who's winning.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,410
You know,
it's funny about that.

16
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:07,870
People actually come up to me
now and they were like, oh yeah,

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,580
like some guys saw my name on a list to
do a show, and he goes, oh yeah. He goes,

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,370
oh dude, Bill [inaudible] was just
saying that guy, it's just listed like,

19
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:17,760
you know, like any team in New York who's
winning and stuff. And he goes, yeah,

20
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,400
he's right here. And I turn. He goes,
Oh, you're a poet. He goes, yeah man,

21
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:23,820
Bill Bonner was trashy today. And I
go, what did he say? He goes, well,

22
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,690
you're from Jersey. No, I'm
from New York and I'm a giants
fan. He goes, no. He said,

23
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,030
you're a jets fan too. I got, no,
he didn't. He goes, yeah, he did it.

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,450
And I know you had it. And that's the
exact reason why I did it. I did it.

25
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,010
So it would, people would just
be coming up to you. Yeah,

26
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:37,020
she do it on your podcast.

27
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,360
Just make up some shit about me
and then I'll have to deal with it.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,680
I did that with Derosa,
the Rosa. Uh, when, when I,

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,300
when I moved out to La and he slid into
my spot on the opiod Anthony Program,

30
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,210
the running gag was that I was
upset that he stole my thunder.

31
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,530
That's the show that miss me.

32
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:57,210
So I started calling him the teen idol
sensation from the opiate Anthony Program

33
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,960
and people started calling him except
he loved it so that now we just call him

34
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:04,140
the sensation, which I think is one of
the great fucking nicknames out there.

35
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,370
Joey roses, roses is a great nickname.
Nia came up with that. That's a great one.

36
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,330
Joey roses called that.

37
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,690
That's what he should be called is
it's fucking old school. So that,

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,200
that makes me thrilled.
Thrilled that people are bothering you.

39
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,590
The Jersey thing is sticking,
man. You're getting me with dude.

40
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:22,100
You look like a guy from New Jersey.
I know. To be honest with you. Well,

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,000
this is to give people a background
here on, uh, on, on Paul, Michael,

42
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,970
Anthony Versie,
whatever,

43
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:32,350
whatever Italian middle name
you fucking is my nickname.

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,830
My middle name is Thomas Paul Thomas.
He is like, I can't tell you he's,

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,270
he's been going off on how fucking awful
New Jersey is like a typical New Yorker.

46
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:46,500
What he does is he goes through the
Lincoln tunnel and he drives to Newark

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,370
Airport. He sees Ikea and some of those
awful chemical things and then you,

48
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,510
you start thinking that Jersey is the
less chemical things like that is less

49
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,660
than the whole term. Pike is
less than, the air is horrible.

50
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,400
The traffic is terrible and
the people were stupid. Right.
Is Disgusting. And, and,

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,990
and, and, and, and, and the,
the, the, the people are stupid.
Right. I never said that.

52
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,210
You said that. Don said that people
are stupid. I said the crowds are low.

53
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,290
You're going to pull back on the park.
You're going to hold back. No, no, no.

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,420
The crowds are a little dumber in Jersey.
Damn.

55
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,330
Fucking say what you have to
say that they're a little dumb.

56
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,500
They're just more like animals,
like, you know what I mean?

57
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,130
The animals did just like, you
know, I got to tell you like,

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,940
do you get more of that in
general? I am not biased. Okay.

59
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,410
As a fucking outsider. There's a
part of you that I can tell you. Oh,

60
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:32,340
I definitely hate New York,
New Jersey too. Oh, all right.

61
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,270
Just as far as like their sports teams,
I hate them.

62
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,640
I wish misery on all you guys
cause you're a bunch of cunts. Um,

63
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,530
and the only reason I'm saying that is
because I've been behind enemy lines,

64
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:45,850
but anybody from Jersey or New York who
went to bu or came up in [inaudible] and

65
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,570
it's the same thing when you're
behind enemy lines, you, you hate,

66
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,990
you thought you hate the red
sox until you moved to Boston,

67
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,150
then you really fucking hate him.
And that's what happened to me.

68
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,910
I lived in New York during that whole
curse of the Bape thing and then we

69
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,160
fucking finally beat
you guys. And Alia, you,

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,730
you run in whole hide is fucking Pete.
Corey.

71
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,820
Ellie says y'all ran and hid. Oh No,
I'm happy for you. I'm happy for you.

72
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,420
See you later. Everybody fucking
ran out. Right? So, but I'm saying,

73
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:13,480
but I equally hate all of
that. So being unbiased. Dude,

74
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,510
I cannot tell the difference between New
Jersey and New Jersey crowd of fucking

75
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,290
upstate New York guy like you and
fucking long island out in governor's,

76
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:28,240
it's all the same. Oh, no,
no, no. I think the crowds,

77
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,120
I think the crowds can be both good.
But I think they're smarter in New York.

78
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:34,030
I do. I remember one time, uh,
Mike D's to finals on and Eagle.

79
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,830
He did a joke and it didn't
go, it something happened
in Jersey. He goes right,

80
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,880
right over the fucking bricks.
He was just confirming.

81
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,260
That's right over the bridge. I, yeah. No,

82
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not saying that they're not
more suburban. Absolutely. But Paul,

83
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,860
if you think that you're somehow smarter,

84
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,550
then those fucking Jackass
is in New Jersey. I've just,
from where I'm standing,

85
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:54,550
I don't see the difference. I
really dope. That's ridiculous.

86
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,260
You guys all do the same thing.
Oh,

87
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,180
whenever you eat and do a
sandwich and you like it,

88
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:02,080
you fucking drop it for half a second.
You look down the street like, oh,

89
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,570
taste the fucking bugging you,
bugging that thing.

90
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,140
It's all the same fucking guy to me.
Oh my God, I'm breaking you play.

91
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,430
You're gonna tell me
you don't go to Boston.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,700
It's not a bunch of fucking freckled
face guys would clatter rinks. Oh my God,

93
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:16,960
that acts fucking socks. Stove. Oh my
God. It's horrific. Yeah, my friend.

94
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,170
I'm not defending it. I'm not. We're
angry. Fucking psychopaths. We are.

95
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,160
You got,

96
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,580
you have deep rooted hatred for New York
because you were hurt by the Yankees.

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,350
Okay.
Here's a problem with you.

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,220
You hate the Yankees more than we've had
great discussions about sports. Yeah,

99
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,280
I absolutely hate the Yankees come up.
I've seen a sport.

100
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,340
I've seen you go from a fun loving
sports conversation. I hate them too.

101
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,740
A Yank and all of a sudden you just get,
because you guys eat and he's just,

102
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:45,140
he's just buy your way out of
every fucking problem. Right.

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,210
But that's not my problem as a fan bill,
that's,

104
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,690
I'm not saying it is your problem.
I'm saying why I hate it.

105
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,650
Stop making it about you.

106
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,870
It's about my hatred of
the fucking Yankees and all
those stupid fucking songs.

107
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,200
If I can wake up and all the
losers in New York, walking around,

108
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,350
eating fucking eaten pizza,
slice of pizza next to the met,

109
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,410
and you're fucking sweatpants, you know,
we'll fucking piece of work in there.

110
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,050
They think they're a part of it.
That's what kills me.

111
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,020
They think they're a part of it.

112
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,520
The amount of people in New York live
like fucking animals. And I know too,

113
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,280
I lived there. I fucking lived
there. I was sleeping on a futon.

114
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,870
It fucking 34 pain,

115
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:22,400
1400 bucks a month in a fucking studio
apartment that they slammed a wall into

116
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,850
and fucking told me it was a one
bedroom until the night I went upstairs.

117
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,650
I met the girl upstairs, right? Yeah.

118
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,620
And I fucking went up to her apartment
and she had the exact same unit right

119
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,050
above me and it was a fucking studio
and she was paying way less than me, uh,

120
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,140
and a city that doesn't sleep.
I love New York.

121
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:42,950
You got to him in New York's great.
Oh, it's the Paris. It's the Paris of,

122
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,000
of the United States. Without a fucking
doubt. I think it is our best city,

123
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,100
but the amount of people who are in New
York and who just think that they're

124
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,320
winning just cause they're
there and they're not.

125
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:57,890
And if they would just move across the
fucking river into Jersey and not live

126
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:00,080
like a fucking animal,
they could just be as dumb.

127
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,650
They could still wear the sweatpants is
good pizza out there, but they don't.

128
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:08,651
They got a p like near all these things
that other people are making money on so

129
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,350
that they can feel like, you
know, come on dude, you walk to,

130
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:13,580
if you walked into one of those
Trump towers, they'd spit on you.

131
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,660
They throw you right out in the
street. That's hilarious. Nah Man.

132
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,800
Brainwasher after every fucking
Yankees game win or lose. But

133
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,210
you guys walk out. I see you walk out on
air. You're feeling good about yourself.

134
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,300
Yeah, I mean, listen, I'm
happy. I'm happy I lived there.

135
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,210
What do you want me to tell
you? No, no, no, absolutely.

136
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,290
I now am I saying no and I'm
saying it's awesome. I love it.

137
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,480
I just hate the fucking Yankees.
I don't even hit the rangers.

138
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,600
I and I love the rangers coach.
I actually really like the Rangers.

139
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,420
I like the Rangers. I like the
island islanders. I like the Knicks.

140
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,770
I like the mets.

141
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,410
And you liked the giants and I
actually like the giant like nice.

142
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,230
I love the giants. I love, I love uh,
how they, how their defense first.

143
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:56,300
I love, I love, I like the uniforms.

144
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,210
I love the old Helene went back to the
old Frank Gifford. The Yankees ruined you.

145
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,930
Yeah, that's the one thing that I
noticed. It wasn't the Yankees, it was,

146
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:07,610
it was how it was also reading the sports
page and just the fucking pot shots.

147
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:08,540
They be taken these,

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,800
cause I was reading the Dan Shauna's
sees of New York just taking these stupid

149
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:15,290
shots at a,
you know,

150
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,290
cause it just trying to sell papers
because they're fucking lazy and all they

151
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,150
gotta do is trashed the red sox.
Right.

152
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,380
Was that you said Dan Shaughnessy brings
baseball and everything no matter what

153
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,470
he's talking about. That's what I love
about that guy. That guy, that guy,

154
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,720
he has his hustle and he sticks with it.

155
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,380
If he was talking about the Bruins
last year and he's just everybody,

156
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:36,860
like everything was a red sox
references Milan, Lou Cheech,

157
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,470
like the Grady little of
the Boston Bruins. Yeah.

158
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,220
I was on the train with him once.
It was after. You guys want to,

159
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,240
I was just sitting at drunk. It was
funny. It was drunk. New Yorkers.

160
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:51,470
You guys won game. One of it was
I, it was all three or all four.

161
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:56,010
Mike Mussina lost the game. Oh, pause.
Oh four we lost. He lost the first three.

162
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,731
Let me just remind you,

163
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,400
we lost the first three and then
somehow you guys lost four in a row.

164
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Biggest choke ever. Biggest joke
ever as far as like, you know,

165
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:06,030
four or five first ballot hall of Famers,
$215 million.

166
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,210
I have to take that responsibility.
That was the worst. I know you do.

167
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,880
That's like when you fuck up in a game
and then afterwards you talked to the

168
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,700
meeting going, I take full
responsibility. We know you fucked up.

169
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:18,180
Just sit there and listen to me. Say it.
Yeah. Cause you have to keep printing.

170
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,030
It was funny watching Dan,

171
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:25,350
Sean to see his face on a subway in New
York City with drunk Yankee fans who

172
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:28,770
just saw their team lose game,
one of a big playoff series.

173
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,680
And I was sitting there
next to somebody and go,

174
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,960
well the fuck this dude we're going to.

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,460
And he was just sitting there kind of
just like looking around with his eyes and

176
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,430
his fro he hair and he's got that,
you know that little boy Irish,

177
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,240
he's got to watch out now because
he's on ESPN now. He's not,

178
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:45,630
he wasn't as well known back then. So
yeah, he was down there covering it. His,

179
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,600
his whole angle was the
misery of red sox fans.

180
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:53,160
So when they finally won, like his hustle
was over, he didn't know what to do.

181
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:57,520
And I remember an o five, the red sox
were in first place and we started, uh,

182
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,390
we started to fade in
September is oh five, right?

183
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,610
And he wrote some article is the curse
back and it was like the curse of what

184
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,610
fucking 11 months ago because
you guys got a thing with, um,

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,910
you guys got to think which
fade in September last year.

186
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,060
End Up worst collabs ever.
How'd that work out? Well,

187
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,710
if we didn't win fucking
nine championships and all
sports, that would bug me.

188
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,890
Hey Man. You know what's great
though is that's all you got. You,

189
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,310
you used to use to go back to 1980
and you had to go back to you.

190
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:31,050
You're giving me shit about
September in 2011. Listen, Paul,

191
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:34,410
this is what I realized and this is what
the red sox failed to realize that in

192
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,520
life there are ups and downs.
No matter how much money you spend,

193
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:42,210
because I'll tell you, I abandoned
the Red Sox, uh, sometime in 2007.

194
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:44,850
I didn't even watch that world series
because at that point we became you guys.

195
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,100
We just trying to buy it every
fucking year. It's disgusting.

196
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,990
But Major League baseball, it's
fucking awful. You guys are Walmart.

197
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,320
We're fucking like cvs. Uh,
you know, you know what I mean?

198
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,160
It's just I don't give a fuck anymore.
I don't, I honestly don't give a shit.

199
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,160
And uh,
I remember I went to a Padres game,

200
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,040
beautiful stadium down there
and there was nobody there.

201
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,210
And I went there to the game with my
mother and she was looking nobody in the

202
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,180
stance. She goes, oh my God. She goes,
this is a sin, this beautiful ballpark.

203
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,880
It's not filled. And I was trying
to explain to her it is a sin.

204
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,560
I was trying to explain
to where they'll do,

205
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,800
we took the only fucking reason to go
to the game that whenever that first

206
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,410
baseman is, I don't watch baseball
anymore, but he was the guy,

207
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,450
he was there fucking cheater and we bought
them. Now there was no reason to go.

208
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:29,360
Is it that Gonzales guy? You got
it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No,

209
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:30,840
I don't watch baseball.
Baseball is,

210
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,750
I am way more interested
in my New York Knicks.

211
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm way more interested in other sports
because I mean I can't watch, uh, uh,

212
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,280
well I, I, I'm the era cheater
can know. You know, it really is.

213
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,370
It did get rejected.

214
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,100
You then watch Cano Cano Cano was your
boyfriend knows my favorite baseball

215
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:50,520
player of all time for the Aussie guys
who never listened to this podcast.

216
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,380
Versie has a fucking man. No, I,

217
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,130
I just love how you hate that
cause you fucker so homophobic.

218
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,700
I love it man crush. So ridiculous. It
is ridiculous. And you know what happens?

219
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,920
Your eyes always get squinty and he'd
get upset and that's why I say it.

220
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,420
This is why I like Robinson can all cause.
Dude I fucking called it.

221
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,500
That's why they listen to this called
and it's a classic Paul Versey Call

222
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,600
Classic Paul Versey. He you call it
the blue shirt blue chip prospect.

223
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:19,360
He was and the Yankees System
update got a hunch on this kid.

224
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,770
You're telling me he sucks
all the way through fucking
baseball. He sucked. Right.

225
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,690
And that's why the Yankees brought
him back him up and they're like, oh,

226
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:29,350
you know who else Paul called this year?
Cam Newton, the Heisman trophy winner.

227
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,630
This guy. Yeah, but every
Heisman trophy winner. You're
the worst. The worst. No, no,

228
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:39,480
no. I have a call. You call everybody. You
call, you call blue chips and then, no,

229
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,440
no, no, I'm never going to give you, I'm
never going to give it to you cause I,

230
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,230
well I'm not accepted. They were like,
they were, they were, they were like,

231
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,150
oh they're going to trade him
to the twins. All my friends.

232
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,610
And now this guy's just to come in up
because you know he's just coming up

233
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,220
because we need a second base right now.

234
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,480
All these guys that you can't
bring in here as evidence,

235
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:57,490
they all disagree with you.
He's a hall of Famer. Well,

236
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:00,280
I never looked at the guy like
he was a bum. I never did.

237
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,940
I don't understand why you,
this is the worst thing.

238
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,630
Like Paul does that shit where he
starts a sentence three fucking times.

239
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,310
So anytime.

240
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,540
He'll call me up like he made me hate
this guy and I don't even watch baseball.

241
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,870
He calls me anytime he does anything
like a fucking eight year old still

242
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:20,290
collecting cards.
It'd be like bill he gave tonight.

243
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,510
Oh God,
you missed it.

244
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,750
So Robinson Cano Robinson couldn't
do Robinson could know came up

245
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,320
lace the double brings in Gita.
Oh then you always do that.

246
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,700
Oh that fucking joy in your voice and
it just drives me. I made you, Hey,

247
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,550
I made you hate it made me hate him.
I know, but I will tell you this.

248
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:46,690
You know it's funny. I was like, when we
first started arguing Yankees, I would go,

249
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:50,680
Bill, you're crazy. I would go, the
payroll doesn't mean Shit, you know,

250
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,130
it doesn't mean other
places where I've been,

251
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,850
all of a sudden we got like to
share and then we got like the,

252
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,890
they already had a rod at that point. It
was ridiculous. Then after awhile ago,

253
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,790
you know what I gotta look, this is what
this is. That's how I look at baseball.

254
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,580
You cannot buy a championship.
All right? But you can turn.

255
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,390
Making the playoffs into a
layup and this is the deal.

256
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,910
You can miss a layup like
the red sox last year.

257
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,610
Anybody can miss a layup and
like the brewers, you can,

258
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,850
you can hit a half court shot,
but genuinely fucking speaking,

259
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:17,410
if you look at the American league east,

260
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,280
it's been Yankees red sox every year to
the point I'm burned out. Like, dude,

261
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:24,520
I used to get so fucking amped up for
those games and part of it is because we

262
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,260
won a world series, but
I gotta be honest, Dude,

263
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,640
when you haven't played each other 50
times a fucking year and they're always in

264
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,440
first place,
always in second place.

265
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:37,441
It's like watching a comic who's on 10
the second they get on stage and they're

266
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,290
screaming like they're
doing their closing bit for,

267
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,080
for for the first 12 minutes sheet,
you're exhausted. You're like, all right,

268
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,090
I can't, I can't. I gotta listen
to the 50 minutes of this.

269
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,740
I can't listen to that anymore.

270
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,860
I actually think the baseball
season's just long and drawn out.

271
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:54,920
Like I could really give a shit until
August. September. I think it's a hunt.

272
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,480
I think it's too long. I, I'm bored to
tears. I think baseball, the older I get,

273
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,290
the more I think baseball
sucks. Oh really? Yeah. I
still think it's a great game.

274
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:07,040
I watched Kansas City of against the AC
of the day and it was like a rain delay

275
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,970
and there was nobody in the stance
and I loved it. I'm a grumpy old man.

276
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,150
I can only do something.
When we,

277
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,970
when we were at that Laker game and we
were watching that, I just said to myself,

278
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:18,650
this is fucking awesome. Basketball
is fast paced, you know, good passes.

279
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,550
The falseness show until the end,
until the end, until the end.

280
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,420
Well you don't like the bomp bomp
bomp bomp bomp bomp anytime, you know,

281
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,590
during the whole game
[inaudible] they do that,

282
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,920
you know that that's just to get the
crowd pumped up and stuff. But yeah.

283
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,830
But we kind of saw some loser fans.
Do you have that?

284
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:41,600
You have to have a height man.
The whole show's bomp Bomp d fans,

285
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,120
bom,
bom thief Fed stood back in the day.

286
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,770
You used to judge the fans by what they
chanted. You can still kind of do it.

287
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,570
Like the weight flyer fans chanted when
they went up three games to none against

288
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:57,200
the penguins. They just spontaneously
started chanting. You can't beat us.

289
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,490
It was fucking great. Now that says a lot
about your fans is like a personality.

290
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,230
There's a character to that. But like
you go to a fucking Laker game and it's,

291
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,110
they have like a DJ even have like a,
they have a fucking nightclub.

292
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,560
I sat up there for like a kings game,
the stupidest shit in between periods.

293
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,680
They start playing like music and
there's like chicks dance and it's the

294
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:20,510
stupidest fucking thing ever. Yeah.
Um, but like basketball, I like,

295
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,610
the only thing I don't
like is in the end there's,

296
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,850
I just don't like how it's this war.

297
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,500
And then in the end I watched them
take unguarded shots to win the game.

298
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,740
It's like anticlimatic in the
timeout, timeout TV. No, they got,

299
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,740
that was a good file. They had a file
to give. Then they stopped the clock.

300
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:39,560
And then the worst is when the other
team has already lost the game.

301
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,210
And just to be conscious.
They call timeout again. Yeah.

302
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,900
You just delaying the inevitable and uh,

303
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,450
you feel like a landlord trying to get
some piece of shit out of the apartment.

304
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,450
Yeah, I made sense. But they got
what? They got to hit the shots.

305
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,480
That's the one thing about it. You got
to hit the foul shots, you know? I know,

306
00:16:56,481 --> 00:17:00,860
but it turns into golf ball. It's like
a guideline and up a putt now. Yeah.

307
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,590
You know what I mean? It gets drawn out.
It gets thrown up. But I'm such a sports,

308
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,990
I'm so nuts with sports. I
don't get how like, you know,

309
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,240
there some people like [inaudible]
quick, it's in and out. I'm like, wow,

310
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,490
I got to tell you hockey
starting to do that. Hockey,

311
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:14,020
this is the thing about hockey. You get
one time out of game. I think you do,

312
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,460
cause I've watched it for 30 years.
They never used them.

313
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,900
Every once in a while they'd
call a timeout and the
coach would just be sitting

314
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:23,780
there with a rolled up
program screaming at guys,

315
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,320
just BB would just take a time out because
he couldn't wait to the edit of the

316
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:30,320
game to tell the team how fucking
disappointed he was with the way they were

317
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:33,530
playing. And that was the time. Now
I'm finding at the end of the game,

318
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,390
they're starting to call
timeouts at the end of the game.

319
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:39,830
And it sucks because like I,
that's what I like about hockey.

320
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:42,320
I like how it it, it just
keeps moving. And people did,

321
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:43,910
they get involved in like
the scoring and everything.

322
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,480
And I totally understand that hockey is
a very difficult game if you didn't grow

323
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:51,540
up with it to get into.
It's a very difficult game to watch on TV,

324
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:55,440
but once you fucking understand it,
it's, it's the best. Get to that flyers.

325
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,160
Penguin series was the shit you want
to talk about fucking animals. Okay.

326
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,040
You know, I'm not a big hockey
guy. I love the three major sports.

327
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,600
Maybe it's because I grew up in New
York. I, you know, I'm not a hockey guy.

328
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:06,780
It never was my uncle too.
It's a fast game, Paul.

329
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,470
It takes a certain level intellect.
My uncle took me to a,

330
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,950
an islanders game years ago,
but this shit, this playoffs,

331
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,150
it's like fucking MMA on skates.
These guys are fucking barbaric.

332
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,930
That Shit,
that highlight game I saw against up,

333
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,840
it was a New York in Ottawa when the
guy just came up and it wasn't like,

334
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,510
you know the typical fight where
they wait, they look at each other,

335
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,270
but the officials know what's going to
go down. Gloves come off and they get,

336
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,540
it wasn't that this dude just came
up and basically you could tell,

337
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,810
you could watch as he skated, he mentally
just tapped out of the game and said,

338
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,170
it's fuck it's dom fighting this guy.
He came over,

339
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:41,010
he could start fucking
teen off on this guy.

340
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,750
Benches cleared and I just saw blood and
guys just looking to hurt somebody and

341
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,910
I've never seen that. It's,
it's, that's hilarious.

342
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,780
Kills hockey is because those are the
highlights. They show like, you know what?

343
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,371
What's his face?

344
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:57,480
Did their metal world peace in the game
we went to where he through the elbows

345
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,670
to where it's so stupid
that I love that name. No,

346
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,770
but the fact that people actually
call him that and let them,

347
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,120
it themselves like wow.
I mean Metta,

348
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,890
you gotta you gotta you
gotta go Cosell on that.

349
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,410
Like how Cosell would say I lean
and everyone was going Cassius clay,

350
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,630
he gotta gotta go metta world peace.
It's this,

351
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:12,000
he's such a nut job that
it's fucking beautiful.

352
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,000
You know what it takes me back to when I
first started watching the NBA and that

353
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:19,490
guy world B free was in the
league. He's a, I think,

354
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,130
I don't want to slander the guy,
but I,

355
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:25,620
I think he had some issues and
then he came around and uh,

356
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,640
and then he changed his name to world B
free. That's who's great. He went bald.

357
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:32,880
The way old school people went bald.
We didn't shave the sides, you know,

358
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,240
black guy,
he had the John Amos thing going on and

359
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,200
he played for the Cavaliers by
the time I was watching him.

360
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:42,750
I forget who we played for before that,
but he was a guy who,

361
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:46,770
who I may be confusing them with Maurice
Lucas. As far as like his background,

362
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,620
I can't remember if he had
the same recreational issues,

363
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,890
but like to the NBA in the late seventies
right before burden magic came in,

364
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,270
was this weird time when they,
the,

365
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:02,271
they basically they merged with the
Aba ratings were so fucking low.

366
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,121
They're the,

367
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:05,820
first of all they had a major drug
problem cause that's when coke came around

368
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,820
and they came up with the brilliant
thing saying that cocaine was no more

369
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,810
addictive than caffeine. It was kind
of a rich person drunk and yeah,

370
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,960
and everybody got like everyone, football,
Hollywood, Henderson, all these guys.

371
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:16,740
So the,
the,

372
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,400
there was a bunch of guys who had fucking
cocaine problems were in the league

373
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,640
and white people were still getting used
to the fact that black people own the

374
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:29,240
sport and that it wasn't coming back.
You know,

375
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,330
anytime soon it was fucking over when
all of a sudden Dr Jay brought the game

376
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:37,320
above the rim. Once it was above the rim,
it was all for all you can be with set,

377
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,470
set shot Johnny or a good fucking
pass or as far as a white guy,

378
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:43,350
which is something I think I talked about
in this podcast is how whenever we go

379
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:46,860
to an NBA game, we have that inside
joke. When the white guy screws up,

380
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:48,810
we just look at each other and we go,
fucking white guy.

381
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,790
Best best is when we went to Portland,

382
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,990
we went to Portland and the guy did it
and in unison at the same time. Yeah.

383
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:59,770
You said, what did he do? He missed
it. He was like a wide open layup.

384
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,110
It was just something that was
absolutely so horrible and just such bad.

385
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,070
He looked horrible doing it. Look
terrible doing it. And you said,

386
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:07,060
you mentioned this once before,

387
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:10,720
but we looked at each other and it was
exactly until we just go fucking white

388
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,550
guy, white guy, get him
off, get him out of that.

389
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:17,290
Give him a clipboard and some fucking
long select set of a suit or something.

390
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,330
He looked bad.
It was something easy.

391
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:22,450
It was something that should
have been terrible. We're off.

392
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:25,720
We don't even look good. Even the good
guys don't look as does dark new whiskey.

393
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,770
Does he look good now? We were
talking about if we did a Larry Bird,

394
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:33,010
did he look good when he did the things
he did? He did. It just went in one. No,

395
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,580
but but Dirks like there are certain
guys would unacceptable faces.

396
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,410
That's why I was thinking about the
website on the unacceptable faces and

397
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:44,790
sports.com or worst faces in sports.com
which we were talking about yours.

398
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,300
Who are the ones that you hate the most?
Oh Scott Brochure.

399
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:50,680
Sunny Yankee third basically bank is is
one of the worst hate on the red sox.

400
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:54,190
We just train them to the Phillies. Oh my
God. There was nothing worse in sports.

401
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,173
Nothing.

402
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,920
Then that fake like hardcore
intense look in that.

403
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,770
Jonathan [inaudible].
I love it yet to say safe.

404
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,840
Fake now cause you knew he
was striking out your player.

405
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,900
He made his lips kind of come together
and he looked in like you, yeah,

406
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,260
his lips came together and you had the
thing and his eyes came down and he just

407
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:14,590
stared and then he did the thing and
it was just almost like, okay. The big,

408
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:17,170
the big dramatic. Ah, it
was the absolute worst.

409
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,560
Podres faces a little unacceptable,
but he actually tries hard.

410
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:23,480
So I liked that guy. But what are you
thinking about Reggie Miller's tries hard.

411
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,370
The MVP,

412
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,690
there's some conos never done is kind of
easy to be the MVP when you're fucking

413
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:32,360
nestled in there between Jeter
and to Sharon, a rod. Oh Gee.

414
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,830
You're seeing a lot of pitches
to Robinson. Ken Robinson,

415
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,000
Robinson Cano. Ah, single

416
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,200
though. Do you think we were talking
today about a Reggie Miller's faces?

417
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:47,540
Reggie Miller had an unacceptable
face. No, mine would be to share,

418
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,190
to share has got a deaf to share. I
don't know what it is. And I'm like,

419
00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:53,050
when he's in an interview, he looks
intelligent. When he's out in the field,

420
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:57,420
he looks intelligent. The second that
bat goes above his head, I don't know.

421
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,330
He looks, he looks like some extra on
fucking the Andy Griffith show. He looks,

422
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:04,090
he looks like he's having a hard time
thinking he looks like he's going to puke.

423
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,920
Zero Iq is what he looks like.

424
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:09,040
I don't know if he shuts his brain down
and just be the balls. See the ball,

425
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,480
be the ball.
I don't know what he's doing,

426
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,090
but he just looks like [inaudible]
got an unacceptable facing sports.

427
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,050
He would be on the list.
I don't know how high he would be,

428
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,760
but he's got an unacceptable face.
Who did you say was worse than brochures?

429
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,470
She said somebody who all you said
somebody who is worse than brochures. Oh,

430
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:27,360
going through going through the years as
far as awful faces are Danny Ainge and

431
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,400
spices. Oh, Pau Gasol. Oh, pat.

432
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,870
Paul was saw when when they call a foul
on Pau Gasol off. That's the worst thing.

433
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,180
Oh,
he's got an unacceptable face to nothing.

434
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:40,120
We would think that somebody just said,
yeah, listen, Pau Pau, your career's over.

435
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,340
You're not making any more money.
That's the face he makes. Like, whoo.

436
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,670
Nothing's worse than an athlete
that that is. Good and just ugly.

437
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:49,580
And every time he see me like Ah,
Larry Bird wasn't a good looking man.

438
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:52,100
Bill notice you hate all Boston guys.
Oh No,

439
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,370
I'm just saying because they just took
a lot of their faces are unacceptable.

440
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,770
I never found any of the
next phases unacceptable.

441
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,370
I love their look of defeat every
time we played them in any major game.

442
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,380
Do they ever going to win a championship?

443
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,690
So this is one thing I've
got to give you shit about.

444
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,410
You got to admit at this
point you say the very least.

445
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,360
New York definitely has a problem with
crowning people king and giving them

446
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,850
ridiculous nicknames before they've done.

447
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,670
They have like fiber like Lynn Sanity.

448
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,240
You can add that to sand shies man.

449
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:27,710
Genius Godzilla. Godzilla
was great though. I liked,

450
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,650
I liked the name Godzilla
but I fit man Godzilla,

451
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,720
Godzilla cause he dominated
the Japanese league,

452
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,570
which at this point I'm starting
to think I could play over there.

453
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,150
The fact that Valentine
won the world series.

454
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,270
All those Japanese players who've come
over there and all of them had best,

455
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,980
they're fundamentally sound except for
each row and they all come over here like,

456
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,240
like dice k, the Gyro ball.
Uh, what's his face? Uh,

457
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,270
Matsui coming over Godzilla. He's going
to hit 800 home runs. You know what dude?

458
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:54,980
They don't know.
Okay.

459
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,370
They trying to act to know you
go to the Dominican Republican,

460
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,340
Republican Republican, the Dominican
Republic. That's where you go.

461
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:05,270
That's where it starts. That's
where, yeah, yeah, exactly. And,

462
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,220
and you called him. It's amazing. I
can't believe that that in Cam Newton,

463
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:13,220
dude, I don't know how you figured
that one out, but the Cam Newton thing,

464
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,830
all I was saying was that, would you
disagree with that guy with the, the,

465
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,730
the game show host hair on ESPN?
A lot of,

466
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,940
a lot of Heisman trophy winner is coming
to the NFL and their bus and you know

467
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:26,770
that they're fucking bust. And
everybody, I do, I do know that part.

468
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:30,680
But I also know that you, you, you first
of all, every year you call 20 things.

469
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,750
You like the guy who,
who you bet,

470
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:35,510
you bet show place to when you
fucking bet everything you go,

471
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,740
everything's straight across the board.

472
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:39,740
And then you at some point
you're gonna have a winner.
No, no, no, no, no, no. See,

473
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,420
this is what this is.
Paul goes,

474
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,510
I'm standing up right now because
you're really fucking bugging me.

475
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:49,070
You're the one, you were with all those
clowns on ESPN telling me that fucking,

476
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,020
that fucking, uh, that Peyton
manning was better than Tom Brady.

477
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,100
When would Peyton heads on the bureau
rings and fucking Brady has toes.

478
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:00,080
I was definitely wrong about it.
Okay. Talk to me out of that.

479
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,010
But I'm admittedly way
too harsh on that guy.

480
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,820
But the unbelievable level of fucking
disrespect. Tom Brady got the,

481
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,360
he had three fucking rings and they were
still going, but dude, I got to toilet.

482
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,540
You know, I've got to tell you if I
got it started, fucking guy, but blah,

483
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,200
blah blah.

484
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,220
And all these stupid cold fans this year
who said the cults go and fucking Oh

485
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:23,840
and 14 is a testament as to
how good Peyton manning is.

486
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,660
It's it dude. It's partly that
and it's partly how awful you are.

487
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:31,661
Fucking franchise was how zero you had
zero depth at the quarterback position

488
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:35,090
because the guy had never missed a start
and he lulls you into this false sense

489
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:39,560
of security where you went from fucking
Peyton manning to some guy you got off a

490
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:42,530
car. Well that's fine. Without him they
were nothing and you can't have that.

491
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:42,720
That's,

492
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,390
and they were also already on their way
out and they weren't going to win 13

493
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:48,210
games this year with him. They weren't.
They were all there on the way down.

494
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,630
Double digit wins. I think they'd
have with him this year I think to,

495
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,470
I think they get to the play 10 and six
and he gets to play tennis six maybe 11

496
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:58,060
and five but they weren't
going to be 13 and three do.

497
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,880
They couldn't even beat
the fucking jets last year.

498
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:02,430
They had the game won and they still
blew it. That's another thing too.

499
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,810
Too many first round losses with
that guy. But I have a feeling, um,

500
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,790
I don't think he's got enough
guys out there, but I mean,
look, I have admittedly,

501
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,400
did you know what? This is the real
thing of my hatred of Peyton Manning,

502
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:18,210
my hatred of pate manning stemmed out
of the complete disrespect of Tom Brady

503
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,000
and then I blamed it on Peyton
manning is if he said it,

504
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,280
I mean the guys obviously first
ballot fucking hall of Famer,

505
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,143
but I got to tell you,
dude,

506
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,180
he's got too many first round playoff
losses against too many mediocre fucking

507
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:33,090
teams. I've talked about this
many times. Tom, terrific.

508
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,420
And he doesn't deserve to hold anything
else that Tom Terrific is the fucking,

509
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,270
I think I've made it. We've gotten
too many arguments. I think he,

510
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,860
if he gets one more,
it solidifies it.

511
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,010
I think that that man has
played to position as good,

512
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,760
if not better than anybody else ever.
And pate manage or is true. Can't throw,

513
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:51,710
pick six and a Superbowl.

514
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,080
Can't do it through a pick six and a
Superbowl to lose it, to lose. That's bad.

515
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,470
That's bad, but I guarantee you this,
I'll guarantee you this though, if,

516
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,910
if he wins the second one,
if he wins another one with the Broncos,

517
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,410
you'll never hear Tom Brady's name. It'll
all be about, it'll all be about him.

518
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:09,480
He just, he has that thing
because you know what to think.

519
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,840
He had the advantage of when he went
outside and his backyard to play catch.

520
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,460
He was playing catch with the fucking
professional quarterback. So the guy,

521
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,840
the guy's like, he's been around,
he's fucking flawless. Oh yeah.

522
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,090
And he's flawless. He is the Anti Tim
Tebow. He might be one of the best people.

523
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,220
I'll tell you his brother, his
brother, if you could insert Tim Tebow,

524
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:32,280
his heart into that giant tin man,
Frankenstein,

525
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,910
you would have the ultimate quarterback.
I think Eli Manning,

526
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:39,490
I think his brother Eli Manning has a
lot more balls and his, his, uh, his,

527
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,410
you got balls. They don't get mad at
debt. No. Eli's a fucking winner, dude.

528
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:45,600
He's got ice in his veins.
He's, uh, he taught absolutely.

529
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,060
You don't need to tell me that.
He fucking stuck me in the heart twice.

530
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,360
He's another face guy though. He's another
guy. You look at his face and it's,

531
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:52,650
it's, it's just, you know,

532
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:55,320
you don't think he's got the heart that
he's got when you look at his face. Yeah.

533
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,620
Both of them. I don't know what it is
about their faces. They uh, you know,

534
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:01,110
that old joke, he doesn't quite look
done yet. Put them back in the oven.

535
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,460
They both have that. They have, they have
cookie dough faces. Yeah. But I think,

536
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:09,870
I think Peyton is a, I think Peyton is
definitely pay this pay. This is a man.

537
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,750
Eli's the fucking bag. I like, I just
get people going on the podcast, but uh,

538
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:17,790
I, I obviously don't fucking disrespect
those guys and I obviously know that the

539
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:22,130
Broncos are going to be a way better
team and I respect the fact that,

540
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,960
that this is what actually made
me like Peyton manning now.

541
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,940
I actually kind of switched because he
could have gone with the 40 niners and,

542
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:32,370
and, and that when he did and he said, I
don't want to, I don't want to be like,

543
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,380
like thinking that I just piled on.

544
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,700
So right then that that's
it because Clemens, shit,

545
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:41,410
when I watched Clemons, when those
two rings, when he jumped in Limo,

546
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,191
when you guys fucking,

547
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:45,850
we're already winning championships and
he slid his fat roided ass through the

548
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,380
sunroof.
Anal is worse than that.

549
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:49,510
He said before that he would
never want to play in New York.

550
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,360
Like that's another thing about that guy.

551
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,450
I think that that guy is just a bad human
being. I'd really don't like that guy.

552
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:56,870
There's nothing likable about him
and you know what the fighting is.

553
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,480
Every time I beat the shit
out of both of us, every time.

554
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,050
Every time I saw Roger corn these days
run into one of these people I'm talking

555
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:07,490
about. I mean fucking trouble. Every
time I saw Roger Clemens pitch live fee,

556
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,220
he got shelter every time.
Just shit the bed.

557
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:14,710
Every time I saw him and he goes, I don't
like them. Yeah, you could see that.

558
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,400
That really think coming though.
Cause he was fucking gigantic.

559
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,080
And I swear to God,
living in New York City,

560
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,100
I think like six times a year they would
do some sort of insider story about his,

561
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,610
his, his workout in everybody
was walking around. Cool, dude,

562
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:29,670
you see this guy's workout? It's like,
that's exactly what they want you to say.

563
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,170
So anyways, let's get, let's get back to
fucking metal world peace here through.

564
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:37,320
There's not one woman still listening
to this podcast. We've talked sports.

565
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,370
Stop for a half. I mean, done a fucking
commercial yet. Here. Paul, let me,

566
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,920
let me do a commercial. When we come
back a little metal world peace.

567
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,290
You'll listen to the fan,
uh,

568
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,510
with the fucking password.
I got to type in here. Paul,

569
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:53,780
how'd you like riding around in my truck?
I was at. That's awesome by the way.

570
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:56,720
And even, yeah, mentioned that
you crashing out here. Uh,

571
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,000
you like that three in the tree.
How fucking bad ass is that?

572
00:30:59,001 --> 00:30:59,970
That's a bad ass truck.

573
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,860
That truck looks like you have a rightful
in it and you're just about to go do

574
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,170
something really, really bad.
That's what I like about it.

575
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:10,070
It looks like I know how to fight.
That's somebody told him. I said, dude,

576
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:12,740
I look at their trucks like the kind of
truck you get into after you just beat

577
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:17,180
up everybody in the bar now. You said the
funniest shit. You Go. I go, that truck,

578
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:20,210
it looks like a bad motherfucker is in
it and you just go yet till I get out

579
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:22,921
dude.

580
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:26,810
The difference of the looks that I get
between driving my truck and driving the

581
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:30,890
Prius is fucking hilarious. Oh yeah. Dude.

582
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,660
Fucking eight year old. Stare me
down when I get out of my, no,

583
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,690
the front girl of your
truck looks like you.

584
00:31:36,691 --> 00:31:40,290
Just something like bad happened in your
past. All right. Wait a second here.

585
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:44,680
Where the fuck is a,
what the fuck is the, uh,

586
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,450
all the God damn advertising. See
this. This is what happens, Paul.

587
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,320
This is when it slows down is when it
slows down. Paul, what do you got to hype?

588
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,140
Why don't we, why don't we, why don't
we try and do something with you here?

589
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,770
What do you got to High Paul? Uh,
where can people see you next?

590
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,270
I've got a couple of shots in Jersey.

591
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:03,870
I know that going out and going
grocery shopping, right? No,

592
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:07,260
I'm actually going to be at the,
um, I got a big show coming up.

593
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,750
You got a big show. Where you
going to be? I'm going to be in.

594
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,070
You've got a really big shoe in
the back of this Deli in Jersey.

595
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,360
It's a guy's giving me 10 minutes now.
Um,

596
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,330
what a fuck is all the game fly stuff?
I'm the worst.

597
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,030
Oh go ahead. Puff up. You
can not do what you gotta do.

598
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,210
No, I can't park cause in
the podcast stops. All right.

599
00:32:31,211 --> 00:32:35,590
I already got this shit
memorized. Hey everybody, do
you like playing video games?

600
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:38,890
Sure. We all do. Check this up. All
your big video game guy right now.

601
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,470
You're not a big video game now and
I still roll with it. Oh okay. Yeah,

602
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:45,560
no but holy shit,
I gotta start over.

603
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,890
I got to start over cause my ad guy
cuts these things up. No, no, no.

604
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,190
I can't say cut during and my kids say
any that just shut up when we start over

605
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:56,420
again. All right. Hey, who
likes playing video games? Sure.

606
00:32:56,421 --> 00:33:00,770
We all do. Paul Versey. Do
you like playing video game?
Love them. You love them?

607
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,590
Absolutely. No. If you had to
choose between that and a loved one,

608
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,550
you're going to video games,

613
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,500
What do you need a girlfriend? Now, why
do you need to? Why do you need a wife?

614
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:29,480
Why did you even need to
be a parent at that point?

Paul, for two weeks and a day.

617
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,910
I know you from Jersey, so you don't
understand that. But two weeks in a day,

618
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,410

30 seconds or less. That's right.

621
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:51,230
You can't do any better than that. All
right, game fly.com I recommend it.

622
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,910
You should recommend it and some day your
mom will too. There we go. All right,

623
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:00,410
back to the podcast. Um,
Metta world peace dude.

624
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:01,550
You know what's funny about that guy?

625
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,930
Like he had no intentions of elbowing
that guy in the head while he was just so

626
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:07,520
in the moment. But this is the
thing. He's like that, you know,

627
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:12,170
that kid that wasn't special needs but
almost was and he had like that Olympic

628
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,400
weightlifter kind of strength. That's
fucking world peace. That's how he is.

629
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,360
And those kids, whenever they
got angry or excited, he's,

630
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:24,080
somebody got hurt. Somebody got hurt or
something got ripped out of the wall.

631
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:26,900
Fucking nuts. There's no you don't.
That's what happened with them. He,

632
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,920
he went in and he, he scored,
he started thumping his chest.

633
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,470
Somebody can't hear him and he
just fucking throw an elbow.

634
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,330
We're talking about a man who jumped in
the stands and grabbed a civilian by the

635
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:41,480
neck and started teeing off on him. I'll
give you this. He grabbed the wrong guy,

636
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:44,690
but he was fucking right. Now we're
in a perfect world. He's right.

637
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,950
That's like built in audiences where,

638
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,080
where in this fucking world
can you throw a drink in a,

639
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:53,030
in the face of a guy
who is twice the size,

640
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:54,710
you will not get the living
shit kicked out of you.

641
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,070
I'll tell you where that a fucking
NBA basketball game where there's no

642
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:00,950
protection. They don't have that helmet.
The helmet. No. You're a fucking hat on.

643
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,300
This guy throws a drink in his face. That
guy, you just see the guy through it.

644
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,530
How many, how many, how many,

645
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:09,890
how many Edward Jokes do you think that
guy told and laughed about in his life

646
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,230
and they were in Indiana.
Gimme a break.

647
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,070
He probably had his fucking Klan
Hood underneath the seat. Fuck him.

648
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,550
He should've got the shit kicked out of
him and I feel bad for the web designer

649
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,940
that actually got
grabbed by the throat and

650
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,390
that guy, that kid had never
been in a fight in his life.

651
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,770
He didn't even know enough to run.

652
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,990
He didn't even know enough
to run all the look of fear.

653
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,040
He didn't even know what happened.

654
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,460
He just had horrified fear in his eyes
and then Ron Artest just because his feet

655
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:38,640
were moving, but he wasn't going anywhere
and then he was trying to explain what,

656
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,930
I'm trying to explain. The situation
was going to like this. If you're on,

657
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,500
if you're at a comedy club here on stage
and somebody throws something at you,

658
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,340
you're not going to do. As a matter of
fact, somebody threw something at you,

659
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,560
right? I know somebody,
I know somebody else.

660
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:53,700
I think somebody said they were flicking
stuff. I saw this woman, she goes really?

661
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,850
And she kind of just called the crowd
an animal, but as a professional,

662
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:00,720
you can't fall out there right now. If
you were doing a bit and for some reason,

663
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,030
oh, well let me get no, because
this was a different cause.

664
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:05,520
It was a bullshit call and that's
why he laid down on the table.

665
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:09,300
So let's just say you're, you're playing
some fucking hell Gig. All right.

666
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,590
The crowd socks. The microphone's
not working. So you like,

667
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,170
you gotta give me a fucking, I can't
even, I can't even get the show going.

668
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,200
I can't even speak into this microphone.
This is my light saber.

669
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,100
It's not even working.

670
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,950
And then you just make a joke and
you lay down until you get the,

671
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,010
you get the proper microphone
and while you're laying there,

672
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,420
some drunk dude takes a full
drink and throws it in your face.

673
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,530
You're telling me you're not going into
the crowd. He'll be tough. It'd be tough.

674
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,990
You know, I, I, yeah, it would be really,
I mean, that's got to do that then.

675
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,660
That's what I hated about
that whole thing with like,

676
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:44,800
well not excusing the fair behavior,
but as a professional basketball player,

677
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,700
you wrote the blue, blue, blue, blue. Now
you don't, you don't, you have a fucking,

678
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,680
you have a responsibility for your
own safety in the world. Okay.

679
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:57,070
And part of that responsibilities that
you don't walk around throwing drinks and

680
00:36:57,071 --> 00:37:01,060
faces of people that you cannot beat
the shit out of her. Right? Right. Yeah.

681
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:05,710
So you do that and then somebody else
gets their fucking ass kicked because of

682
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:05,831
it.

683
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:09,040
I mean like I was a coward who's a fucking
coward or when he ran in the stands

684
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:13,690
or that was like unbelievable. He should
play. She played for the penguins.

685
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,580
Oh, I just like fucking with the
penguins. I was so happy that they,

686
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,190
I had this weird thing where I like
most of the people on the team,

687
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:23,380
but then they always,
they was just have a couple of those,

688
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:27,340
those fucking guys going for the
knees. I just don't like him. I can't.

689
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:27,901
Then they an end,

690
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:30,760
they always get like upset like penguin
fans when paying her fans talk about

691
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,130
other teams being dirty.
You know what that's like?

692
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,220
That's like that chick with the big tits
who goes to a party and has her tits

693
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:39,160
hanging out and it says like, you
know, what are you looking at? Right.

694
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,080
That's what penguins fans are to me.
I think.

695
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:44,020
I think they're all dirty like that Greg
Williams thing. You heard that right?

696
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:47,490
The Greg Williams, you had the Greg
waves on the saints, like the, the,

697
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:51,220
the what he was saying to them. Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. And when he was like,

698
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,380
kill the head,
kill frankly wars head.

699
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,400
That's where it's crossed the line.

700
00:37:57,401 --> 00:38:01,570
When he said I wanted his head fucking
sideways. That's where cross line.

701
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,420
What I hated about how all
the players were going like,

702
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:09,040
I mean that just sounded like standard
locker room talk until they named guys.

703
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:13,550
It's like, no, no, no. He said,
obviously he said rip his AC. No,

704
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:14,680
but I'm talking about don't love it.
I'm in me.

705
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,560
He loves to put the point I'm making the
point of making was every player kept

706
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,340
saying, I've heard that stuff
in locker rooms my entire life.

707
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,840
But the part where he made it
like personally named guys,

708
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:28,390
that's where it went too far and it was
driving me nuts. It's like, yeah, dude,

709
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,320
that's what we're freaking out about. I
opt dude, when I was in little league,

710
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,110
the fucking coach is sitting there going
like, we've got to kick their fucking,

711
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,200
you know, the, a bunch of posters,
football update. It's always say that.

712
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:42,010
But when you literally go like the
shortstop, I don't like his face.

713
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,120
I want his fucking nose bond. Yeah,
right. I already got an ACL problem.

714
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,880
Why don't you go out there
and deliberately blow
out as ACL when you start

715
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:52,630
literally naming it, that's where it
crossed the fucking line. That's my thing.

716
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,660
It seems straight across the board that
none of the players had a problem with

717
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:55,811
it.

718
00:38:55,811 --> 00:39:00,580
So now I don't feel bad that they have
the concussion problems that they have at

719
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:04,210
the end. Because if you actually, if
you participate in that, then you know,

720
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
but then that's kind of like
the chicken and the egg.

721
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:09,330
It's like if you don't do that, then
you're not on the team. Um, but I,

722
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:12,100
I actually agreed with everything
that they've penalties that they got.

723
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:15,430
And I think that this happens all
over. This happens all over, you know,

724
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,610
I don't think guys like Tony Dungy do it.
I don't think certain guys do it.

725
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:21,220
But I think, I think, you know, they'll
say go fucking get like, you know,

726
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,130
I think it's been once, listen
my deal, like go kill him,

727
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,870
rip his head off half his
head gone the other way.

728
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,310
But when you specifically name a player
and you say what their injury is and all

729
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:32,590
the plays, it's like we are, we
already know what their injuries are,

730
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,020
so we're definitely going
to try to exploit that dude.

731
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:37,360
You know what all of that is Paul.
That is,

732
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,050
it all has to do with millions
of dollars being at stake,

733
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,260
which brings in the horse and there's a
level pussy and it's all there and then

734
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,300
it's like,
dude,

735
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,760
you're getting to the top of the mountain
and it just becomes by hook or by

736
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,650
Crook and they're just going
to do that type of shit.

737
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,560
It's just really shit that as fans,
you didn't want to see,

738
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,281
he didn't want to hear.

739
00:39:57,281 --> 00:40:01,690
ButW and now they make an example out of
that guy because everybody's livelihood,

740
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:05,860
including ESPNs is on the line that if
there's too much of that negative shit,

741
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,530
people aren't gonna Watch
it because, uh, that's,

742
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,420
that's the only guy in sports I don't
like is I don't like the guy who

743
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:16,870
deliberately goes up who
can't beat the other team.

744
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:20,350
So he deliberately goes out and tries to
injure a fucking player because I feel

745
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:25,210
like that requires no skill whatsoever
on any given play. You know,

746
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:27,490
people are watching the guy with the ball.
I know.

747
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,580
Keep your head on a
swivel is what's his face.

748
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:31,630
But at that time he said
that 80 fucking times.

749
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:33,520
Warren Sapp keep your head on a swivel.

750
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,680
I understand you're supposed
to be looking around.

751
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,870
Isn't it amazing how fucking out of
shape he was yet still was fat fast.

752
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:45,220
How fast? What did that Guy Ben,
if he dropped 40 pounds, dude,

753
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:46,990
he had that line on the side.
You know,

754
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:51,670
when he got that love handle that just
puts a divot his whole fucking career.

755
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,450
It looks fucking eight months pregnant
his whole career and he fucking could run.

756
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,650
And which was fast as hell
was fascinating. Anyway, is
it? Here's a good one. Worst,

757
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,250
worst sports bodies yet.
For some reason,

758
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:07,060
Phil Mickelson just pops to mind
first. Okay, I'll get one. Paul Pierce.

759
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,790
Paul Paul Pierce's arms. Yeah.
Are Unacceptable. Unacceptable.

760
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,610
You're okay.
You're an athlete and you're a black guy.

761
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:18,340
You should be fucking chiseled.
I'd be ripped.

762
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:22,870
I think he doesn't even have white guy
arms. He has like middle-aged accountant.

763
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,020
He, how does he do his two year
old? He's got 60 year old arms.

764
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,850
I think Peyton Manning's body's weird.

765
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,490
He's still got that little pot belly
belly the way he walks and he kinda, he,

766
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,310
he uh, he has a pot belly. You
see pate manning without his past.

767
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:38,060
He's got that gut. Yeah, he's got
sitting on a tractor body. Um,

768
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,880
Phil Mickelson definitely film Mcgee.
He's been better than lately. He's sweet.

769
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:45,380
He's just, he was off to coffers. I told
you that golf is not a fucking sport.

770
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,933
It's a skill.

771
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,870
It's a skill to the amount of guys I
know that suck at real sports like this.

772
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:53,600
Somebody trying to prevent you from
scoring and you have to like be able to

773
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:58,370
throw and catch or whatever, skate to
stick handle. They absolutely suck.

774
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,950
But then you put them on a golf course
and they can hit it straight because it's

775
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,270
like just this, this mechanics,
just a mechanical thing. Yeah. Yeah.

776
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,180
And it's all like, dude, it's you against
yourself. It's not, it's not dude. It's,

777
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:11,980
it's like, it's like pool,
but pool. You're also playing
some Adena on a bold goal.

778
00:42:11,981 --> 00:42:16,940
He Golf, bowling, Golf.
You're also playing something.
They are bowling, bowling,

779
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:21,830
pool, golf. They're there. They're
tier two sports. I would say.

780
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,650
Although pool is cool as hell.
What do you think about NASCAR?

781
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,070
You never see a fat fuck driving
a car around 200 mile. Once again.

782
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,160
Once again though. Uh, yeah, we
gotta be in shape for that. Uh,

783
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,410
unless you can drive like a van.

784
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,850
There's not one fat NASCAR
driver. Really? Yeah,

785
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,830
but that just means they're in shape.
You know what I mean?

786
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,420
I look at everybody in China,
they're all,

787
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:44,540
everybody in China is fucking in
ridiculously good shape compared to this

788
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,000
country. That doesn't mean they
can all catch a ball. Right.

789
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,850
You just say somebody is in shape. You
know they're written well, but no, but,

790
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,290
but I, I once again, you think it's,
I have a friend of mine, same thing,

791
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:58,370
can't catch, can't throw, throw it like
a fucking girl. Anything with wheels,

792
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:03,020
forget about it. The guy becomes, he's,
he's one with it drives like a maniac.

793
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:06,920
He had a BMW five series and he
took me out on the highway, dude.

794
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,350
And I swear to God,
I almost fucking threw up.

795
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:13,280
It was like I was in an f 16 I had my
foot up on the dashboard going through.

796
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,540
Don't dude, I got it. I got it.

797
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,510
And he's just sitting there laughing
at me and then you get them out on the

798
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,540
court, but you throw a ball at him.
I swear to God, it's like a toddler.

799
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,550
Like those guys that go fast like that.
Man. That's so funny that you were going,

800
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:25,011
dude,
dude.

801
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:28,850
One time I was in college and we were
driving and me and my friend was rain in

802
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:31,370
my friends trying to show off and me
and my other friend didn't want to look

803
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:33,460
like, you know, we don't
like pussies. Right.

804
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,690
But we got some genuinely scared and like,
I don't know,

805
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:39,400
and to do it was just gone. And the
rain's coming down. I'll be my friend.

806
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,920
We're doing work that we go
to do. It's not worth it.
Not worth slow down. So yeah,

807
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,700
trying to calm. Yeah. Tried to
become like, no dude, listen to,

808
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,980
I think there's a cop, there's a cop
up there, but those guys that get that,

809
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:52,540
those are like those motorcycle guys
that need that speed. They fucking that.

810
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:55,460
That's scary shit too. That's one of
those, yeah, you're going so fast.

811
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:57,410
You're going to be like, well,
I'm going to work sedans. Bill,

812
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,700
you're going to wake up at injected
from the car if you're lucky.

813
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,880
If you're lucky, you're going to fucking
wake up. It's brutal. Fucking garbage.

814
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,660
Just joke
first.

815
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:11,880
He's got me addicted to Florentines
podcast and now verse, he does like,

816
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,260
he does a pretty good
Florentine Florentine is the
funniest motherfucker and I'm

817
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:20,620
listening to just warrantying complain
about anything. Oh my God. Oh,

818
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,700
buys care robot. You're fucking
kidding me. Garbage fucking show.

819
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:33,030
Like at Fox News robot. Fucking you. That
right robot. The way it goes like up.

820
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,210
All right. Like drags the word
out at half time. So again,

821
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,520
that's really good man.

822
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,760
He's fucking funny man. Let's get it
to that guy. Complained rarely, rarely.

823
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:47,590
Like we never seen a beautiful
woman before bud light commercial.

824
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:51,140
It's fucking ridiculous. Um,
all right. Uh, we got here.

825
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,960
This is a, okay. Sunglasses.

826
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,370
There's some really some weird ones
this week. People like this guy says,

827
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,950
hey bill, I need, I need to Mike,

828
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,750
my listeners sent in like questions and
shit and I read it just to let you know.

829
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,540
Billion. I need to ask you
a very important question.

830
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,120
My wife makes fun of my
choice of sunglasses.

831
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,630
She's thinks they're not hip enough.
Um,

832
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,040
I told her I was wearing brown tinted
sunburst aviators since college,

833
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:19,630
before the whole aviator hype.
Is there eight or hype?

834
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,010
I don't even remember top.
Yeah. So say back then,

835
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:27,310
those people who in 1980 [inaudible] yeah.
Who wanted to be like Tom Cruise.

836
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:31,120
You know, my neighbor when I was growing
up, any movie that Tom Cruise was in,

837
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:36,010
he got into that, like whatever
it was like a top gun. He
joined like the fucking,

838
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,480
uh, no, no. He joined like the, the,
the, the, the air force reserves,

839
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,280
the alligator arms. He joined that
and then, um, days of thunder,

840
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:48,580
he started racing cars. No cocktail.
He became like a bartender.

841
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:52,180
His Rich Dad got him out of the
fucking, uh, reserves. Yeah,

842
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:54,580
he started getting into that.
And what else did he do?

843
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:57,070
There was like three things.
So it kind of became this running joke,

844
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:57,611
like whatever,

845
00:45:57,611 --> 00:46:01,360
fuck a Tom cruise movie was coming out
and then eventually he moved out to la

846
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:04,390
finally. Well, why don't we just
be a fucking actor, you know,

847
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:06,790
so I don't want to actually
join the fucking air force.

848
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,570
That's a don't know what ever happened
to him. So anyway, aviator glasses,

849
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:14,500
which were, yeah, the Tom
Cruise fan slash date rapist.

850
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,640
Remember that fucking kid
I was talking about him.

851
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,300
You remember that kid who he had the
rough sex with a girl in them in central

852
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:23,490
park and she died. No, you're too
young for that yet. This guy. Yeah.

853
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,710
This fucking psycho. No, he killed
her. He tried to, he tried to,

854
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,440
he tried to say that they,
that she wanted rough sex.

855
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:33,200
It was consensual and I
don't know what it, it, it,

856
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,140
he accidentally killed her or whatever.
I mean,

857
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,210
the whole of the meeting's going
to, we're killing it. Yeah.

858
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,510
Jesus Christ always kill it.

859
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:48,290
Crushed it. Fucking
crushed it. Um, so, oh,

860
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,830
anyway, still, that's fucking
brutal. So anyway, but this guy,

861
00:46:51,831 --> 00:46:56,010
you know what actually made me mad when
he got out of prison, not only that, that,

862
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,340
that he got out of on two loves
and maybe men, first of all,

863
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,870
the guy got out of prison, but, uh,

864
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:05,510
the idiots on the news going off on the
guy was saying, because when he got out,

865
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:09,170
he wasn't on parole because he did all
his time because he didn't get time off

866
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:12,890
for good behavior because they were just
like, you know, he had fights in prison,

867
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,330
he was selling drugs and blah, blah,
blah. It's like, yeah, the, all the,

868
00:47:17,331 --> 00:47:19,730
all that that says in there
as he didn't get raped,

869
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,880
he did what he had to
do in there to survive.

870
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:26,270
So on some level yet you have
to respect that because that's,

871
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:30,220
that's the big fear is a guy who did he
raped a girl or it was just rough sex.

872
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,480
I don't know what he did. I don't know.
What has such a big difference though?

873
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,170
Well, I don't know if he
went like Ron our tests,

874
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:37,760
like it was going good and he was
excited and then he fucking elbow.

875
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,330
Why are we joking about this?

876
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,590
Fucking started pounding his chest and
then they didn't show the replay because

877
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:46,480
it was a home game.
Um,

878
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,770
no, he, he fucking, I dunno. How long did
he, do they let him out of jail? Yeah,

879
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:58,270
he did like all 15 or 16 years because
they couldn't get him on murder because

880
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,890
he said it was like, I know like
on, on rape trials, like they, what

881
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,580
they always do,
like the,

882
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:09,850
the hardest thing to get them on
is when they say it was consensual,

883
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,870
so then all DNA is out the fucking
window. Then you have to like, it's,

884
00:48:14,871 --> 00:48:16,360
it's, it's, it's the worst fucking thing.

885
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,640
If somebody does that to a woman that
they should be, honestly, they should,

886
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,523
they should just,

887
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,340
they should have like a flame thrower
and they should just have it pointed at

888
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:25,570
the defendant and Jerry,

889
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:29,620
would you like to read the
verdict on the count of a rape?

890
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,300
We find him guilty in the first degree.

891
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:35,080
It just just light them on fire
right in front of the family. Yeah,

892
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,660
right in front of it. Right in front of
the family. That's how I would run it.

893
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,350
Just same, same thing with
child molesters. Star,

894
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,520
that's the word I'm less is that's it.
Sham listed.

895
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:47,150
I would actually have them get chased
by rabid dogs first and then to descend

896
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,760
Dusky guy and it fucking,

897
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,880
the Sandusky guy should get fucking
drawn and quartered in the courtroom.

898
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,710
Just put his fucking body parts.

899
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:57,220
He should be underneath an oil tanker and
then they should drive it to fucking r

900
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,690
is that you got to drive a boat,

901
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,560
drive it to like fucking a man
that's walking this earth. These,

902
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:04,990
if that's what I would do with that guy,
what I would do with that guy. Well,

903
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:08,680
I would go into shark infested waters and
I would give him a bunch of paper cuts

904
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:10,110
and add time to the front of a boat.

905
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,180
Oh my God. I never heard of like that.
Well that's, that's a good one, man. Well,

906
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,800
you gotta understand. Wait, when you
do something like that to somebody,

907
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:21,920
you didn't just [inaudible],

908
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,410
you ended that kid's life and then you
affected generations of people because

909
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:29,440
who they're going to marry, how they're
going to treat the person they marry,

910
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,350
how they're going to treat their kids,
and then the treatment of the kids,

911
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:37,250
how they're going to act in
society, society. It just,
it creates, it's like that,

912
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:38,380
that little Confucius thing,

913
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:42,130
when you drop the pebble in the still
pond and the ripples just go like that.

914
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:44,760
And he got a little poetic on
you. It's like that. No, see,

915
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:47,470
that's why I say time to the
front of a boat, paper cuts,

916
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:50,230
shark infested waters and that's it.

917
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,590
And you know what's fun and this
is the thing about it. That's fine.

918
00:49:52,591 --> 00:49:56,110
It'd be awesome. Um, and
it still wants stop him.

919
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,800
It's the one stop it from happening, but
you should just start weeding them out.

920
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,600
That's like, that's a sickness
man from young. It's fucking
crazy, man. Yeah, it's,

921
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:09,050
it, uh, that's just, uh, uh, and it
ruins the lives of everybody for, but,

922
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:12,740
but the kid forever. Yeah, it's over. Why
you saying what? I just said Paul. Oh,

923
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,120
did you set it up so you won't even
listen to the typical comedian? No,

924
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,480
we're thinking about what
you were going to say.

925
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,910
That's literally exactly what I just said.
No,

926
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:21,090
I was thinking about the use anymore.

927
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,220
I was thinking about him actually like
hitting the thing like a boat. Oh,

928
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,450
that's right. You got, you got that.

929
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,520
You got that weird fucking shit where
you every once in a while you just take

930
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:32,020
about doing crazy stuff, right.
I was getting nervous about it.

931
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,000
Mitton this type of stuff.
Like someday if you're like on trial,

932
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,850
like you know I'm going to get put in
contempt of court because that's still

933
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,040
never rat you out.
But it'd be like we talking about,

934
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:43,280
you guys talked about this on the
podcast but it kept me, it was a joke.

935
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,520
What's the less fucked up
thought you had? Um, well it's,

936
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:55,910
it's tough man, because my son
was born, I would think about,

937
00:50:55,911 --> 00:50:57,560
I loved him so much and
when I would hold them,

938
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:01,580
all you think about was what if I, what
if I hurt? I have the power to hurt them,

939
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:02,990
but you love him so much
and it freaked me out.

940
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:06,890
And now my daughter's coming Monday, you
know, and, and I'm just kind of like,

941
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,530
I just, all you want to do is block it
out. And the more you try to block it out,

942
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,450
bad things happen. But no, I've, you know,

943
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:14,240
I'll sit down with somebody and talk to
me. The more he tried to block it out,

944
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,930
like bad things happen,
the more, the more,

945
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,340
the more you think the fucked
up does not say, man, I'm,

946
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,510
I don't want to think about that
cause it's crazy and fucked up.

947
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,580
What happens is it gets,

948
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:25,130
it just magnifies them to multiply in your
head and your head and it keeps going.

949
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,580
So what do you like stoically walking
with your kid towards your wife and just

950
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:29,930
handed off to her? No, no, no.

951
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:33,170
I just keep telling myself that you
wouldn't ever do it, but it's fucked up.

952
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:35,690
Like it's painful. But I've been dealing
with it for, so it's more like a fear.

953
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,690
You have like a fear like, oh my God,
what if I did this? It's not like a,

954
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,690
obviously an urge. No,
no, it's actually, it's a,

955
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:44,930
it's an urge that you won't act on it,
but you're not going to do it, you know?

956
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:49,970
But it's a fear and urge and it's first
he has inexplicably one of the smartest

957
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,170
kids I've ever seen a kid is,
is, is ridiculously smart.

958
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,550
And when I hang out with you,
Paul,

959
00:51:55,551 --> 00:52:00,080
I just think that you must've married
one of the smartest women on the planet

960
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:01,550
because that kid is a genius.

961
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,580
I've been sitting with somebody and really
thinking about if I just would take a

962
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,920
vase and fucking smash it over their face.
And,

963
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,690
and the funny thing is you'll just,

964
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,080
sometimes you just have to like smile
and laugh and you can never tell the

965
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:14,570
person what you're thinking. But it's
OCD. It's what it is. You know what?

966
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:17,390
I actually woke up thinking today
and I was just laughing my ass off.

967
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:19,700
I was thinking about what if he just,

968
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:24,701
you videotaped a game called shut your
God damn mouth and you're the thing was

969
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,353
it just

970
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:32,180
you and a friend walk around and you just
randomly scream that it strangers who

971
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:37,181
are having a conversation and the first
guy that gets somebody mad enough to hit

972
00:52:37,641 --> 00:52:39,290
them,
you can't hit him back.

973
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,010
The first guy to get some mad
enough to hit them wins, whatever.

974
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,310
And I was just picturing all the
different scenarios and just the amount of

975
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:49,910
people who don't fight in the amount
of people who have too much to lose.

976
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,680
The amount of people who would be would
be like startled and then you get like

977
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:58,130
the whole like race thing going on where
like as a white guy you think if I ran

978
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,090
up to a black guy did that,

979
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:00,710
this automatically is going
to beat the shit out of me.

980
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:04,730
But like this is something about when
you do that to somebody black as a white

981
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:05,180
person,

982
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,890
they think like know he knows I'm going
to kick the shit out of him and he's got

983
00:53:07,891 --> 00:53:10,670
to be crazy. And then I think
people just think that in general.

984
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:15,320
Cause every one time, long time ago, I
was on a subway, I was on a subway. Uh,

985
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:20,350
I was on the downtown six and this
fucking white dude junky gets on.

986
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,550
I don't know what this guy was,

987
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,890
but he was in the beginnings of being
a junkie because his clothes were still

988
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:26,191
nice,

989
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:31,191
but he was clearly fucked up and he was
dropping the n word singing this song.

990
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,510
It was hammered out of his whatever.

991
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,270
He's high out of his mind and he
gets on the subway and he was,

992
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,770
he was singing this song on
going, I'm a crazy end word.

993
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:47,910
Yes I am. I'm a crazy Edward doing
the best they can. And then we'd go,

994
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,150
he would punch the side of the
train right inside the train.

995
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,410
So all the white people,

996
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:58,240
immediately we're looking at all the
black people going like, oh, here comes,

997
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,070
here comes the beat down.

998
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,710
How can I position myself so
they know I'm not with him,

999
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,140
that I don't condone that,
any of that shit.

1000
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:09,120
And he just kept fucking doing it and I
saw on their faces the look of what the

1001
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,440
fuck did he just say and then
going like, oh, that guy's crazy.

1002
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,240
And then,
then the,

1003
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:19,500
then the social awkwardness of them
knowing that we're thinking, wait,

1004
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:22,110
I thought that was an automatic
fucking beat down. That's when I,

1005
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:25,260
that's when I first learned about crazy
wasn't when I first moved to New York.

1006
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,900
So what was the game? The game
that you saw? Shut your shit.

1007
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:33,060
It's called shut your God damn mouth
and that's you just, I, for some reason,

1008
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:37,410
I woke up this morning, I woke up this
morning and I just was fucking, I just,

1009
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:41,070
the first thing I thought of and I just
started laughing my ass off and Nia came

1010
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:44,940
out of the bathroom and she saw the bed
shaking like I was under the covers,

1011
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:48,690
just laughing, laying on my side, despite
that was jerking off or something.

1012
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,740
She was like, what are you doing? And I
just started, I was like crying, laughing,

1013
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:57,480
going, I got a great idea for a game.
It's called shut your God damn mouth.

1014
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:02,800
She just starts laughing going,
I would love to watch that.

1015
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:07,240
Oh yeah. Either that or hey, just people
like talking, just walking into a high,

1016
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,290
as loud as you can quiet.
Do you know,

1017
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,560
I had to whisper like
a psycho back in a day.

1018
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:15,910
I had a game I did call reactions and it
was just real, everything was coming up.

1019
00:55:15,911 --> 00:55:18,850
But you would just go to the counter at
a supermarket and you would just say the

1020
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:21,850
fucking craziest thing with
a dead straight phase. It
just see how people react.

1021
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,520
And you know what's funny like that right
now, we're actually pitching a TV show.

1022
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:29,430
I mean, it's sort of like
jackass meets, uh, the beginning
of a what? What's, what's,

1023
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:32,140
what's that? What's that? What's
that movie where they fought?

1024
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,780
Patrice says it was
white people's Scarface.

1025
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:39,200
What's the one with the soap fight club.
Oh, a fight club. Fight Club. Yeah.

1026
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,680
Was hilarious. Patrice, you
sit on Opie and Anthony that,

1027
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:43,130
that was white people Scarface,

1028
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:47,170
because he's watched it a zillion times
and cannot understand the connection.

1029
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,980
Uh, and I'm not one of those white
people that connects to that movie.

1030
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:53,410
I watched it. I saw it one
time. I watched it. I liked it.

1031
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:55,060
I thought it was a little,
I thought it was okay.

1032
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,670
But everybody that like love just doesn't,

1033
00:55:57,671 --> 00:56:01,250
meat loaf take his shirt off at some
point in the movie and he looks like I can

1034
00:56:01,251 --> 00:56:05,830
never see that again. Was that to
balance out how shredded Brad Pitt was?

1035
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,520
You know what I mean?

1036
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,470
That movie was fucking weird and I
didn't understand when the guy die,

1037
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,830
when he put the gun in his mouth
at the end and shot himself.

1038
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:14,440
It was supposed to kill
the one personality,

1039
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:17,230
but he put a gun in his mouth and
pulled the trigger. It was crazy. Right.

1040
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,700
I don't even remember that part.
I just meant when he,

1041
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:22,920
when he beat up the one kid saying
I wanted to, I wanted to uh, rex,

1042
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,210
beautiful like that.
They just made me,

1043
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:29,500
that was like that same thing going on
for somebody at ACL for no fucking reason.

1044
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:33,400
And then sat in the stand by that
movie. Nah, Nah man, I didn't. Anyways,

1045
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:35,380
our cartoons, dear
bill, this is, it's, oh,

1046
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:38,150
we didn't ask the fucking guys question
here. We were talking about ABMS.

1047
00:56:38,151 --> 00:56:38,441
She said,

1048
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:42,730
what's the breakdown of Douchey sunglasses
verse acceptable versus acceptable

1049
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:47,440
ones? What kind of sunglasses do you wear
and dyspnea have any say in the matter?

1050
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,050
I imagine you were very nonthreatening,
low profile.

1051
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,650
I can't tell if that's an insult or if
he's calm. Sounds like an insult, right?

1052
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,920
Um, no, I don't think it's an insult.

1053
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:03,550
I think this guy is genuinely wants to
know what you could wear to make his girl

1054
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:07,120
stop trashing them. Well, this is
what you have to do. First of all,

1055
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:09,030
depending on where you are
and your relationship is,

1056
00:57:09,031 --> 00:57:11,260
is if you feel secure
in your relationship,

1057
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,590
maybe she's just doing you a solid and
telling you that you look like a Douche,

1058
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,010
but if she's always telling
you everything what to do,

1059
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,160
then you have to continue wearing those
glasses and you have to wear them over

1060
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:22,090
to her mother's house,

1061
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,990
defiance and wear them into the house
and don't take them off when a mom's

1062
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:30,370
talking to you, that's like a buddy, a
buddy of mine, right? Do Women know women?

1063
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:32,800
Just, I just want me to say
something real quick. Oh God.

1064
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:35,260
More women trashing has what people
are going to be nice to like.

1065
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,270
Could you like a guy who's really thinking
about it? And this happens all time.

1066
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:40,990
This guy's got a genuine concern here.
But like for like,

1067
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,040
I've heard of guys going,
yeah,

1068
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,320
my girl just looked over at me and
looked at that shirt and goes, oh,

1069
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,130
it's such a turn off. Take it off and I
want it. It's in my mind I'm just like,

1070
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,550
I want to be like, dude, shut the, yeah.
But those guys, those guys deserve it.

1071
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,860
They fucking deserve it. Paul, if you,

1072
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:56,860
if you let the woman in your
life talk to you like that,

1073
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,650
they fucking deserve it the same
way a woman deserves it. If,

1074
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:04,420
if that guy is a fucking as a minus,
then beating the shit out of you.

1075
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,150
But I got us. Yeah, minus and beaten
the shit out of you. But like,

1076
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,600
and if they beat you up and that's
just complete bullshit. Could,

1077
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,980
if they're walking around being a
fucking asshole, disrespecting you,

1078
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:15,760
that that's on you. Okay. You guys break
up with them. But if the guy says to shut,

1079
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:19,170
you shut up. You know I'm wearing
the shirts. Shut up. Yeah,

1080
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,460
we see a dick now. Right? But then
it's like, oh, I'm like, I don't,

1081
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,960
that's a total turnoff that discussed.
We take that off. Just flip it around.

1082
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,580
What if you have ever said that
to you girl? Exactly. Disgusting.

1083
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:31,180
Makes you look fat. You come
on, you'd never do that.

1084
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,870
Even if you said that disgusts me, that
would be it. Listen, here's my aunt.

1085
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:38,290
They went through the fucking dessert
that night. At the meal. Well,

1086
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:40,990
here's my answer to your, to your,
uh, your listener's question here.

1087
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:44,020
If you like them, dude, and you look in
the mirror and you go, you know something,

1088
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,750
I liked it. I liked the glare. I
like, if it's orange tent or whatever,

1089
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:49,150
you'd like it. Fucking wear
it. Paul. You know, some,

1090
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,600
that's why you and your
wife was so comfortable to
hang around because how many

1091
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:55,210
times you guys tell each other go, fuck
you. He say, go fuck yourself. Right.

1092
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,920
You do that, right? Like,
you know, we'll just be like,
ah, you know, something shut.

1093
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:02,680
Like, yeah, shut up. Right. In a loving
way. Like, uh, yeah, but you have to,

1094
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:04,690
you have to keep them.
You got to keep Mafia the same way.

1095
00:59:04,691 --> 00:59:07,160
She has to keep you off or you know,
she didn't keep you in check.

1096
00:59:07,161 --> 00:59:11,380
He'd golf fucking nine times a week,
right? Yeah, no, no, absolutely.

1097
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,380
There's a fine line. And what's
like, you know, yes, exactly. Dude.

1098
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:15,850
I had a buddy of mine, right? He fucking,

1099
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:20,280
we went fishing right when we
were done fishing. Uh, you know,

1100
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,070
we drank a bunch of booze or whatever,

1101
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:24,410
we was smoking cigars and his
wife pulls up and you know,

1102
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:26,750
they told their kid about the
dangers of smoking, right?

1103
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,030
So the kid starts fucking crying and blah.

1104
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,710
There's all this big
fucking thing and the kid,

1105
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,370
the guy was literally in the dog house
and I guess maybe because the kid was

1106
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:35,750
crying,
I kind of saw her point,

1107
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:39,920
but he's one of those fucking guys I
wanted to say to him like, dude, you know,

1108
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:44,090
it really helped your relationship. Next
time you drop your kid off in the car,

1109
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:48,880
take out a big fat fucking Cuban
and just light it up. And again,

1110
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:49,251
what are you doing?

1111
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:52,970
I'm smoking a cigar because I enjoy it
when I come home I'm going to watch a

1112
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:57,320
game and I'm smoking this fucking cigar.
And when she says,

1113
00:59:57,321 --> 01:00:00,200
why you say,
because you can go fuck yourself and that,

1114
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,870
and I'm telling you it's a little blunt.
You can,

1115
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,010
you can round off the edges and I want
to say you could go fuck yourself.

1116
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:09,920
I'm just saying that would help your
relationship. It's like that movie.

1117
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,340
Remember the movie there with the
Kevin Spacey when she comes home,

1118
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:18,050
what does that in the driveway? He's
like, that is a 1969 Firebird and he just,

1119
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,220
I went out, bought it cause I
wanted it go fuck you. Like,

1120
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:22,610
and you saw the look on her face.

1121
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:25,670
There was a shift for the
better in that relationship.

1122
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:28,970
But doesn't he die in the end?
I think it killed. I don't know.

1123
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:32,030
It was that was that, that was a weird
one. He wanted to fuck that 12 year old,

1124
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:35,130
you know, fuck that movie. Sitting
with rose petals falling all over him.

1125
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:39,980
I'm sort of saying, you know what you wear
that you wear the God damn sunglasses.

1126
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:41,960
You want to surface right Jesus,

1127
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:44,510
we're an hour and we got to blow
through these here. Cartoons. Dear bill,

1128
01:00:44,511 --> 01:00:47,930
this isn't so much a request for,
for advice, but an offer of one.

1129
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:53,270
Everyone needs to watch more cartoons.
The old school one for kids, looney toons,

1130
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:54,104
et cetera.

1131
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:57,470
I used to be a nice guy and then I started
watching MTV and thinking I was too

1132
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,150
cool for cartoons.
Recently,

1133
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:04,040
I watched my son watch cartoons as I
realized and I realized he's in a great

1134
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:08,210
mood because of it. When I changed the
channel, he got mad. But here's the catch.

1135
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:08,990
So did I.

1136
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:12,740
When I changed the Channel Two news
sports or even a show like breaking bad,

1137
01:01:12,741 --> 01:01:15,050
Hey I'm on that show.
He said,

1138
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:19,100
I get mad somethings something
gets my adrenaline going.

1139
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,950
Oh you get like all amped up this guy,

1140
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,830
let a little let them metal world
peace going on here. I would say metal,

1141
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:26,100
like metal Lark,
Metta.

1142
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:31,490
Is it me or can I watch a little
yellow bird talk like a wise ass?

1143
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,501
Oh is it me?

1144
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:38,210
Or can watching a yellow little yellow
bird talk like a wise ass help with blood

1145
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:41,900
pressure situations do it if
it works for you. Absolutely.

1146
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:43,490
I went to the gun range the other day,
right?

1147
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,350
Squeezed off a few fucking
runs through it. I came.

1148
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:48,110
So it was such a stress reliever.
Really. It's phenomenal.

1149
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,520
I don't think it's inexplicably.

1150
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:52,550
You think that if you were doing something
like that and the violence associated

1151
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:56,540
with it, that you would be like,
uh, well I guess he hit a heavy bag.

1152
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:58,820
You feel better. We do
that. Can we do that? Yeah.

1153
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,790
You know what's weird is you have to go
over there with somebody else out here

1154
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,280
because somebody went in there say,
hey, going to have a gun. All right,

1155
01:02:04,281 --> 01:02:08,270
thanks a lot. And they fucking blew
their brains out. No, he's serious. Yeah,

1156
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:12,200
but how would you stop me? Funny. I
got a loaded gun. Get away from me.

1157
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:13,760
Then I just fucking put it in my head.

1158
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:17,060
I think they just don't
want the responsibility. Uh,

1159
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,980
I don't even know if that's true.
Somebody just told me that.

1160
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:22,320
That's one of those classic things
at a bar. Somebody told me. Um,

1161
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,690
all right, Paul, you know what a Kegger
rater is? A K? Yes. A Keg rater. Right.

1162
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,120
He's a guy. All right.
First things first. Hey,

1163
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:33,510
did you hype any shows you have
coming up? Oh, no, not yet. Yeah.

1164
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:35,970
What do you have coming up before we
get through all this bullshit. Oh, okay.

1165
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:37,590
Are you going to be poor?
You can check me out.

1166
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,740
I'm going to be a wise guys
comedy club in Syracuse, New York.

1167
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,240
May 10th through the 13th and then I got
a big one at the beautiful new levity

1168
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:49,380
live comedy club in West Nyack, New
York. I'm headline and it's my night.

1169
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:52,830
It's a Thursday night. Tickets are already
selling. It's in my neck of the woods.

1170
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,260
So please come out.
And uh,

1171
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,720
and is that the one with
the sign incorporated these
to funnel? Uh, no, no, no.

1172
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:00,310
That's going to be the new one coming
out in New York. I just ruined,

1173
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,690
now they're doing one at,
I'll definitely announced that one.

1174
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:08,580
But levity live is the new one that
Mozilla the alright. Paul offers.

1175
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:13,410
He has my stamp of approval. All
right, thank you. And also bill burn.

1176
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:18,240
I support this comedian and Twitter at
Paul Versey. Jesus' sacrifice. Okay.

1177
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,750
Social Security number. I know he fucking
Horn yourself out here. All right.

1178
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,430
Kegger rater first thing first.
I'm over 21 years of age,

1179
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:27,570
so no worries about giving
advice to a minor. Recently,

1180
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:31,930
my wife approached me and that's
why we don't have a kegerator. Huh?

1181
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,560
He's got a good one here.
He goes, needless to say,

1182
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,060
within minutes of that statement,

1183
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:40,620
we now are the proud owners of a new
keg rater and seeing as how I've been

1184
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:45,621
married for eight years and this is the
first time she's ever given approval for

1185
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:49,650
a purchase prior to me buying it.
I'm pretty excited about this.

1186
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:51,370
How do guys get themselves
in that situation?

1187
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:54,990
Unless she's making all the money and
you've got to go to her for cash, right?

1188
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,810
Yeah, that'd be, she seems cool
unless she's got a drinking problem,

1189
01:03:57,811 --> 01:04:01,440
but that's awesome. Now you know what,
I didn't even think of that. Anyways,

1190
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:02,040
however,

1191
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,300
I really need some advice as to what kind
of beer I should keep it stocked with.

1192
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,430
Choosing the right beer
is key to the process.

1193
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:12,570
I'm afraid if I buy something like
Amstel light, all my friends will know.

1194
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:14,490
My wife wears the pants in the family.

1195
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,490
That's hilarious cause he gets the
calorie less calories here. Um,

1196
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:22,110
if I buy us a stronger, thicker, more
manly beer like Newcastle or Guinness,

1197
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,730
I may also have to buy a wheelbarrow to
wheel my friends out of the basement on

1198
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:29,430
weekends. And I really don't need
that level of responsibility.

1199
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,550
I can't do anything like Miller
lite or course cause like,

1200
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:36,210
cause I might as well hook the
tap up to the faucet. That's true.

1201
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,490
That's very true. I said a long
time ago, the court's light,

1202
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,840
that's like vitamin water for alcoholics.
Like all my friends. Yeah. Yeah. Just,

1203
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:44,760
you know, I'm on the wagon, I'm
on the wagon. You're like, dude,

1204
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:47,720
you're fucking drink. It
has, of course the light. Um,

1205
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:51,390
I narrowed it down to those
seconds or Labatt blue.

1206
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,530
The only thing with Labatt blue would
be if any French Canadians find out I'm

1207
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:56,910
fucked because you know,

1208
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,080
those bastards would be knocking
on my door seven days a week. Uh,

1209
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:04,170
what do you think, Paul? If you had to get
a Kegger rater, if you had to get a cat,

1210
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:06,420
it sounds like this guy doesn't
want to go domestic. Uh,

1211
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:10,980
but he also doesn't want to
go really fattening Sam. Yeah.

1212
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:16,380
Sam, maybe a nice parallel. I would go,
uh, I would go, I would just go classic.

1213
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,430
It's a keg. It's a fucking
keg. I would go, bud rises.

1214
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,940
That's such a weird thing for your wife
to just purchase it. Like to be like,

1215
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:24,520
yeah, you know what I got to like,
that's, that's pretty fucking cool.

1216
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,480
That's beyond cool. That's weird. Almost
like Stacie came home with a loud, yeah,

1217
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:32,810
I've got this big wine rack.
I start doing like little keg raters.

1218
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,010
Headstands you don't like, you
don't, you have girl pushups.

1219
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:38,950
She does like the girl version.
What fucking keg stand?

1220
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,700
What beer would you put in there?
I get,

1221
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,350
I'd get Budweiser because
that's like a classic, like,

1222
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:48,220
like who's going to come home? What are
you gonna come home like norm on cheers.

1223
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:49,990
He just can start pouring
yourself a big mug of beer.

1224
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:51,040
You're going to be a tub of shit.

1225
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,400
So I figured the only time you really
going to be pouring like that is if you

1226
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:55,540
have guys over for the game.

1227
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,100
Budweiser is a nice middle of the road
that everybody's going to like you drink.

1228
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:01,930
But at the game it's not,

1229
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,750
it's not one of the Light Beers shitting
out like now that I'm like, you know,

1230
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,350
33 years old and stuff. So my
metabolism is obviously slowing down,

1231
01:06:08,351 --> 01:06:10,450
but I gotta be honest with you man,
when I drink three beers,

1232
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,010
I feel like a fucking fat bloated.
I could feel my tits getting bigger.

1233
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,910
You're about ready to enter. You enter
your whiskey and Scotch years. Yeah,

1234
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:19,441
I think so.

1235
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:22,420
Do you get so because beer just gives
me an output and then you get tired.

1236
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,120
Whiskey.
If I drink a whiskey on the rocks now,

1237
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:29,240
which is kind of whiskey
Scotch, that's like a, a,

1238
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:34,210
a vaporizer for alcoholics. Like you
know vaporizer, you have like vaporizer.

1239
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:37,700
If you're gonna smoke weed is the
way to do it, I would think cause it,

1240
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:40,360
it filters out everything except
the shit that gets you high.

1241
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:45,860
You take a hit off it, it, there's
no burning sensation. It, it's, oh,

1242
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,830
it's like a mist.
And I swear to God,

1243
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:52,831
if you get high with the vaporizer
versus drinking three or four beers,

1244
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,290
like just the fatty tissue you're
going to build on your liver.

1245
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,240
Like I would think that a vaporizer is,

1246
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:02,650
I mean obviously no research here
because I'm an idiot, but I, I just,

1247
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:06,640
by looking at it, that's arguably
the healthiest way to get fucked up.

1248
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,120
You know what I mean? What's the most
healthy to drink was more healthy.

1249
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:14,680
I have no idea. Well, I would say
for not being fat. Look at, if you,

1250
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:19,681
if you get like a juice drink hard stuff
and you drink it on the rocks or he'd

1251
01:07:20,361 --> 01:07:24,190
just drink it neat. And uh, what
people get fucked up is, you know,

1252
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:25,870
they drink like Jack and cokes,

1253
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:30,120
you drinking sodas all night and all
those fucking like alcoholic wards.

1254
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:34,540
Like neat. I would just be regular.
Yeah. Neat is a no, no ice.

1255
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,470
That's just straight. Okay. And then
rocks is obviously with some ice,

1256
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,770
but you don't want to mix
it with anything. Like, you
know, I guess, you know,

1257
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,900
twist of lime. The
older you get, you just,

1258
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:46,400
you just want to go right to the fucking,
you get right to the pill.

1259
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,870
It's like how old old people fight.
If they're going to fight,

1260
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:51,220
they're not going to sit there and try it.

1261
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:53,530
You know who used to do that bit
like Richard Pryor, somebody,

1262
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:54,810
they're not going to look cool.
Anything else?

1263
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:57,100
You immediately try to blow out
your knee and just end the ship.

1264
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,990
They'll kick in the balls.
They don't give a fuck.

1265
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,250
That's the way old people drink.

1266
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,370
Like I've heard somebody tell was a
bartender said when somebody comes in,

1267
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,550
if they order a beer, I think,
okay, this guy could be a problem.

1268
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:10,220
But if somebody just comes in and they
order like a whiskey or whatever and then

1269
01:08:10,221 --> 01:08:13,360
it's this sitting there, you
know, and they know how they
want to think. All right,

1270
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:18,100
this guy's a pro he can handle as a
rookie. Yeah, yeah. Ugly. Oh yeah,

1271
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:22,790
he's coming in. Let me get a, you know,
give me get a shot as Damn Buka a couple.

1272
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:26,780
Yeah. You guys want to do
shots went around those guys.
Yeah, that's going to be,

1273
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:28,460
it's like a car bomb.
As soon as you

1274
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,260
do the carb on the dumbest thing,
the Irish carbon,

1275
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:36,110
it's cool because it makes
you drop Amaretto into a beer.

1276
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,030
Is that it's a isn't it? It's a
Guinness in it's a shot up. No,

1277
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:41,980
not again. It's, it's uh,

1278
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,800
maybe there's a bunch of alcohol to the
end of this podcast. Get me Thursday.

1279
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,010
Oh yeah, do it. I'm ready to drink.
Yeah, me too. Like, yeah, yeah, no, no,

1280
01:08:49,011 --> 01:08:53,030
we're were boozing after this. Um, yeah,
so sorry. I would go with, but okay,

1281
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:56,240
so he says those seconds of Labatt blue.
You know what I would do?

1282
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,270
I wouldn't do the SEC. He's just because
the most interesting man in the world.

1283
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:03,470
It's a little overhype. I go Labatt
blue. I think that's cool. I have,

1284
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:06,230
I can't remember what Labatt blue
chase likes Canadian, right? Yeah.

1285
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:10,880
But does it have the extra alcohol now
Rick wants it comes in and once it comes

1286
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:15,140
into triple x has the extra Oco as the
sec, he's got hurt the second my window.

1287
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:17,690
That's another reason to fucking get
into hockey. When you go up to Canada,

1288
01:09:17,691 --> 01:09:22,010
when you drink their beer, it has twice
the alcohol content. You know what,

1289
01:09:22,011 --> 01:09:22,880
that's fucking tremendous.

1290
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,200
Other than the fact that they're peaceful
and neutral where everything but their

1291
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:30,720
sport is fucking by Barrick and
they drink like fucking maniac do.

1292
01:09:30,721 --> 01:09:32,180
And they're not peaceful either.
They're not.

1293
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:36,020
That's just Michael Morris version of
what they are because it worked for his

1294
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:39,350
documentary. Did they lost the hockey
game and they burned down the city.

1295
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:42,290
Talk about an unexplainable face. Exactly.
Michael Morris on the head of that.

1296
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:47,000
I got, I got, I got fucking two
words for Canada grow up. All right,

1297
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,640
here's another to act your fucking age.

1298
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:55,280
I'll be in Edmonton at
the, all right. Here's one.

1299
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:58,520
Here's another one when the last
ones here, Doh. Jesus. Bill,

1300
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:00,680
I'm a 23 year old guy
from the Netherlands.

1301
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:03,950
I'm a longtime listener and always looked
forward to listening to your podcast.

1302
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:07,610
Uh, I always have a blast
listening to your podcast.

1303
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:09,020
He said listening three times,

1304
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:11,030
but I'm not giving him shit
cause this is a second language.

1305
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:14,420
So this is very impressive to me. Um,
but every time you talk about religion,

1306
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,170
I start cringing.
I don't mind a Jesus joke or two,

1307
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:22,160
but this time it felt really personal
and angry. Well, I'm an angry guy, dude.

1308
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:24,860
I could talk about ice cream
and you'd be like, Jesus,

1309
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:28,760
somebody get him another one. Um, I
might be exaggerating since she, uh,

1310
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:32,150
you had a hangover last
week that we come anyways,

1311
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:36,680
last week you gave an illustration
about why beings from another dimension

1312
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:41,690
dimension would be interested in us, which
made me think, uh, which made me think,

1313
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,460
well, I'll play along with your
illustration and explain why a powerful,

1314
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:50,450
intelligent being from another dimension
would be interested in us and in you.

1315
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,860
He's trying to explain to me why he
thinks God exists. Uh, yeah. First of all,

1316
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:56,060
do you,
are you a believer?

1317
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:59,090
I believe I put that microphone
down and get the fuck out.

1318
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:01,550
How do I believe in some,
I'm not friends with you anymore.

1319
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:05,310
I thought you were intelligent Napkin.
I respect the fact,

1320
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:10,220
believe in something to fuck yourself.
Uh, well, first of all, this, this being,

1321
01:11:10,221 --> 01:11:12,650
this being God made our universe,

1322
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,430
made our universe also our dimensions.
Either you believe that or not.

1323
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,330
Uh, so would make total sense
for him to be interested in us.

1324
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,170
They see what he just did there. He said,
well, first of all, God made everything.

1325
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,080
Either you believe it or not.
All right. And then he goes.

1326
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,450
So that makes total sense for
him to be interested in us.

1327
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,310
Like he just proved that he exists.

1328
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:37,770
This is Grand Canyon in between what
the fuck you started saying and then the

1329
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:40,020
logic you just came to anyways,
he says,

1330
01:11:40,021 --> 01:11:45,000
the Bible speaks that God made the
earth in a living space in seven days.

1331
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,120
The planet itself already
existed or excited.

1332
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:54,450
I can't read what he wrote
here. God simply made it
into, oh, it already existed.

1333
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,850
God simply made it into
a living place for us.

1334
01:11:56,851 --> 01:12:01,851
Humans when translated to Hebrew seven
days doesn't literally mean a team of 24

1335
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:05,220
hours, but periods that could've
lasted thousands of years. Oh,

1336
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:08,340
so now it totally makes sense that this
invisible being that nobody's seen.

1337
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,890
It could have made this,
why don't you say thousands of years?

1338
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,650
You know what's crazy about
this too? It's like, um,

1339
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,890
what's comedian willy bar center was
telling me that he went to perform for the

1340
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:20,130
troops and he said they had a tent to
bibles, right? For all the different,

1341
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,970
and he said it totally put into
perspective what you know, religion,

1342
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:25,530
because he went into the tent and he said,

1343
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,080
you couldn't even count
the amount of bibles.

1344
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,070
The amount of different
bibles for different soldiers
for different beliefs is

1345
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:34,470
so much. And my older brother made
a good point. My elder brother goes,

1346
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:37,960
what's wrong with people just saying you
don't know. Yeah, why can't you just say,

1347
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,260
listen, I believe in something
and I'll take it. It's a fear.

1348
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:43,020
It's the fear of dying. I believe
in higher power. It's a fear.

1349
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,840
It's a fear and Diane, and then they
also have to just the fear of dying,

1350
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,690
but they also have to there. Then it's
also control. They had to keep you,

1351
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,910
they have to in a way.

1352
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:55,410
It's good because if there wasn't
this fear of our eternal damnation,

1353
01:12:56,070 --> 01:13:00,300
you know, just, you know, rape, pillage
and all kinds of shit could be going down.

1354
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:04,410
Like you have to keep human beings
like under control so you don't weave.

1355
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,460
So we don't act like a bunch of fucking
savages because we wouldn't act like a

1356
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:09,294
bunch of savages.

1357
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:13,350
You are three days without food and
water away from fucking eat my foot right

1358
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:16,920
now telling you, okay, the only
reason why we're civilized.

1359
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:18,780
You know what it's like?
It's like when you're,

1360
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:23,010
you're the fan of a team that wins a
bunch of championships and you of course,

1361
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:26,500
you're going to go to the stadium, be
classy. Your team's winning. All right?

1362
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:29,100
But all of a sudden
your team starts losing.

1363
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:31,620
That's when you decide whether
he got class or not. You know,

1364
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,490
they start litter in the field with shit.
But what do you believe in Belk?

1365
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,640
You believe in God? Well, let me finish.
What's, what's going on here? Um, I,

1366
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:39,840
I believe in,
I don't know what the fuck happens in.

1367
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:42,030
Everybody finds out what
happens when you die.

1368
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,950
So don't fucking be telling me
definitively what's going, what,

1369
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,180
what happens when you die?
If you do that,

1370
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:51,890
you automatically lose points with
me because you don't, because it's,

1371
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:55,770
it's written down by guys and me come
with enough already and stop getting mad

1372
01:13:55,771 --> 01:13:59,730
at people because their
version of it isn't like that.

1373
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:03,420
People make the mistake that I'm mad at
people because they believe this stuff.

1374
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:03,871
I don't,

1375
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:08,700
what I don't like is that they fucking
the all the murderer and all this shit

1376
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:13,530
that, that comes out of it and
it's this whole like, uh, like, uh,

1377
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:17,830
everybody like Jewish people with the
whole, with the chosen ones, right?

1378
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,230
It's like, why? Why would you
have that fucking written in?

1379
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:22,050
Don't they have that in there?
I don't even know. Like every,

1380
01:14:22,051 --> 01:14:24,960
every fucking group or like baptist,
you know,

1381
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:27,730
you're going to go to hell because you
don't fucking spend 20 hours in. True,

1382
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:29,230
I'm getting in trouble.
Like every fucking group here,

1383
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:33,370
Catholics think they're the chosen one.
Every fucking group says, you know,

1384
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,330
God loves everybody created all of us,
but he loves us the best.

1385
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:40,480
It's like you're trying to be the
favorite son. It's fucking childish.

1386
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:45,040
And it's that thought right
there too. Yeah, it's that,
yeah, that he gives a fuck.

1387
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,720
Yeah. Look, if there's a higher power,

1388
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:50,860
why would he make sociopath just
to keep an interesting, you know,

1389
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,320
just to do it. That's, that's,

1390
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:57,430
that's like the wildcat offense when
you just throw the fucking show that

1391
01:14:57,431 --> 01:14:59,800
sociopath in there. So
anyways, he goes, yes, Bill.

1392
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:04,480
It's true that you didn't ask Jesus to
die for your sin, but just like God,

1393
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:08,530
he was interested in the human race and
wanted to save them from death and sin.

1394
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,110
And yes,
that includes you also.

1395
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:15,760
I understand you have a beef with religion
since those responsible seem to guide

1396
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,840
people with God's words and
become greedy and perverted pigs.

1397
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:23,890
And in no way should they carry God's
name, make fun of them all you want,

1398
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:25,870
but please leave Jesus
himself out of this.

1399
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:27,850
All he wanted to do was
help the human race.

1400
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,360
I actually think he's right
about that. What did Jesus do? I,

1401
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:33,730
it was just some hippie walking
around, hey man, like, you know,

1402
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:35,530
can't we all get along?
It's right.

1403
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:39,190
So I'll just attack religions
from here on out. Yeah.

1404
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:41,950
I don't really know much about the Bible.
Did I read the sports page?

1405
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:46,000
I can't get through it. He said it
on the you and I can't even read it.

1406
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,650
You know what's a good one? No, it's
Solomon. Just those, those quotes to,

1407
01:15:48,651 --> 01:15:53,560
I was like, John wouldn't have, then he
just, he just says, you know, wisdom,

1408
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:58,020
this is good shit. I refused.
There's nobody mad at me. Okay.

1409
01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:01,950
Other than me. Okay. I'm mad
at myself. Nia gets mad at me,

1410
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:06,720
but God doesn't care. Somebody told
me is my son baptized and I said no,

1411
01:16:06,721 --> 01:16:09,030
we're going to do a double.
And my daughter's born and they go,

1412
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,630
you gotta get your son baptized cause
you know you want him to go to like,

1413
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,820
and it just kind of, they assume
that like what, what my beautiful,

1414
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:18,960
intelligent and God would throw him
into a pit of fire. It's like I just,

1415
01:16:18,961 --> 01:16:21,780
that is the most fucking and
look and who came up with that,

1416
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,460
who came up with the fucking church goes,

1417
01:16:23,461 --> 01:16:26,940
if you don't get this kid fucking
Zombie fied in with what we do doing,

1418
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:31,050
then they're going to take this beautiful
boy and throw him into a learning pit

1419
01:16:31,051 --> 01:16:32,250
of hell forever.

1420
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:36,900
I just looked at my son gone and I want
get some Swedish fish and this kid,

1421
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,650
this fung, a beautiful little boy, is it
because he didn't get baptized? It's like,

1422
01:16:40,651 --> 01:16:43,470
it's such and then they want money,
dude.

1423
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,870
And then these priests live
in these houses. Listen,

1424
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:48,420
I don't want to sit here and trash.
Listen and I, and I'll say this now,

1425
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,590
I believe in something.

1426
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:53,100
I believe in a higher power and I believe
in a god and I believe it. You know,

1427
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:58,140
I believe that there's something cannot
explain that this is what it is and your

1428
01:16:58,141 --> 01:17:01,500
wrong and crazy. I find
arrogant, I find ridiculous.

1429
01:17:01,501 --> 01:17:06,270
And to to even insinuate the fact that
my son may not go to heaven because we

1430
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:10,760
didn't do anything yet. So because of me
and my wife being or or you'd be like,

1431
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,690
that's ridiculous.
I don't need to be more lazy.

1432
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,600
I don't need to go and do a house of
worship. They hijacked what's in me.

1433
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,090
That's what I don't like. Cause what
if I do something good? I feel good.

1434
01:17:20,091 --> 01:17:21,230
If I do something bad,

1435
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:25,550
I feel bad and it's that feeling
of doing the right thing.

1436
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:29,600
That's your connection to some sort of
higher thing and they hijack it and they

1437
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:33,290
flip it all around and they make this
guy mad at me and then his kid did

1438
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:37,520
something for me and got tortured for
fucking days and days and days from and

1439
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:42,050
they just dump all this guilt on me. It's
like, Oh fuck you are you fucking idiot?

1440
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:45,500
You sound like a guy who's trying to
sell me some piece of shit car right now.

1441
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:50,280
I honestly, this is just my opinion
that I feel that like you, you,

1442
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:55,220
you are fucking, you have your week.
If you buy into that is the pimp game.

1443
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:58,820
That's the same thing you get
and you get me in this insecure,

1444
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:01,370
I'm not worthy.
Let me bow down.

1445
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:05,120
Let's make the ceilings as high as
fucking hell and have these giant fucking

1446
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:09,320
doors that a goddamn parade elephants
could go through. Three, three.

1447
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:13,310
Hi did just make me feel all small
and insignificant and then you,

1448
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:17,090
you're going to stand up there as a
fellow human being and sit there and talk

1449
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:21,160
down to me and your little fancy
fucking Elvis robe. Oh, come on. Yeah.

1450
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,640
How old am I?
And you know what,

1451
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:25,700
if I'm not saying I'm a good person and
I'm not saying that if it's a bad place

1452
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,350
that you go to, I'm not even
saying that I'm not going there,

1453
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,600
but I can tell you right now,
all my friends are going to,

1454
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,610
and I want to hang out with
them so I don't give a fuck.

1455
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:35,660
I actually all my buddies dying recently
like made me less afraid of dying

1456
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:39,320
because I know I'm going where
they're going. So I don't want to not,

1457
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:41,170
what am I not going to see
them forever? Cause they, they,

1458
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:44,450
they went to one less titty bar. I went
to one less titty bar than they did.

1459
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,000
Right. And then I'm going to hang out
with fucking Jesus going, you know,

1460
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:49,910
I did all that stuff for, you know,
why the fuck would I want to be there?

1461
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:55,520
Hey Buddy, go fuck yourself.
He says, all right,

1462
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:57,770
I'm just fucking around. Surf
from the Netherlands. All right.

1463
01:18:57,771 --> 01:18:59,120
You can love Jesus all you want.

1464
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:01,130
I don't have a problem with
them because just like you,

1465
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,310
I never met him and don't
send me one next week. Well,

1466
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:06,800
maybe that's what you need to do.
You need to meet them.

1467
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,780
You need to bring him into your life.
Not Dude, it's cultish, cultish, cultish.

1468
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:16,640
To what? A fucking way to end this. Let's,
