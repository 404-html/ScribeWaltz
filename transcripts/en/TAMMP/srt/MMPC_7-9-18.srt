1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,080
Hey what's going on.
It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,110
It is time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday July 9th 2018.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,670
When a man loves you will

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,120
he'll do some dumb shit like get a ring.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,890
Then all of a sudden he's
married he's like What did I do.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,440
Did he will say Are you mad at me.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,370
She'll just shake her hand and say no.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,280
And then she'll treat you like
shit for the next five days

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,773
what's going on.

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:46,880
It never ends.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,010
People never it's.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,140
How are you. What's going on.
I'm out here in a heat wave.

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,630
I'm still getting over this
fucking ball that I caught.

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,520
I don't know what I have it you
know they're just lingering.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,370
I'm just I'm all congested.

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,650
You know don't take it down.

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,940
Put it over your head and then sit behind
your car and have somebody stand it up.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,520
All right. You make sure you
have a lemming in your mouth.

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,440
You know that's what it might swat my
fucking day has been like for the last

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,470
eight days.
Everybody has it's fucking hilarious.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,610
All these people who
aren't pharmacists right.

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,030
All of these people have never
invented anything in their life.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,250
I mean even just some dumb shit like
you you take some wire and you fucking

24
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:38,250
twist it. Then you bend it and it's
like look for nineteen ninety five.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,700
It's your very own but it's
your right back massager

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,153
Yeah.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,370
They've all been telling me how to
fucking cure this shit and it's just like

28
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:51,530
okay all right I'll Oh I'll try that.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,330
Oh what you say zinc the man over there
in the plaid shirt says zinc What are

30
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,110
you what say you vitamin D.

31
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,900
You say vitamin D but you would say yeah.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,940
I feel like I'm on a game show right.

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,740
When you are the price is right and
everybody's yelling out a price like a

34
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:09,350
different number and the person's
looking with their deer in the headlights

35
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,840
that's what it's like when
you have a fucking cold.

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,580
By the way me and my wife who
isn't mad at me who isn't.

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Not not talking to me but isn't
actually really chatty either you know.

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,670
You know you get them out of that mood
you're happy you can't say it out loud.

39
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,550
You can't say I don't you know I don't
give a shit anymore at this point.

40
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,700
I've gone through enough hours of torture
here what you do is you just think you

41
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:38,030
know what.
I don't give a fuck.

42
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,120
And they are so smart they sense the
second you do that and then immediately

43
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,500
they want to sit down and talk about it
because once you give a fuck the game's

44
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,900
over okay.

45
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,090
And they don't want you to settle into
not giving a fuck because then you won't

46
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:58,010
be able to listen to their
lecture and nod and go OK.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,150
Yes I will work on
that. OK. You know what.

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,240
I didn't know that. Oh I'll do I
do that. Is that what I do. Wow.

49
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,550
It's it's so great to have somebody
outside myself to let me know what it is

50
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,200
that I'm doing.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,290
You know you're like a mom like just
going around my fucking the planet of my

52
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,900
head observing
not a moon honey.

53
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,970
May maybe be like a an alien aircraft
you know of higher intelligence.

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,840
Does that make you feel better.

55
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,990
Anyways it was on

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,710
godly fucking hot ungodly fuck it was
the hottest it's ever been it was like

57
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:40,711
palm desert out here it was 109 fucking
degrees on Friday and I'm not I'm not

58
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,650
even talking about in the valley.
Maybe that was the valley.

59
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,810
I don't know what it was but it
was like you were what it was like.

60
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,880
I feel like I was standing inside a dryer

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,880
and I've used that reference a lot but
this time was like Oh yeah I could dry my

62
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,810
clothes in this you know by the way
those idiots who like you could fuck and

63
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:03,310
fried egg on the sidewalk you could
probably do that when it's like 80 degrees

64
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:03,640
out.

65
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,890
You know I mean it'd be
like frying it on low.

66
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,810
I don't know what it would be like me you
know but like on Friday when I was 109

67
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:15,130
degrees out at around 2:00 in the
afternoon I like your shit would be over

68
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,620
medium before you even flicked it

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,950
then you wouldn't have to season it
because of all the rock salt right.

70
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,180
For those you back east

71
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,990
and so the inevitable happens is there's
then after human beings in their own

72
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,500
way have made it.

73
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,750
I don't know how many degrees
hotter but we have made it harder.

74
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,170
I think even scientists that wear red
coats a red ties even they have been like

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,620
you know we're kind of having
an effect on the environment.

76
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,610
I mean if gypsy moth caterpillars have
to be stopped I mean what about human

77
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,160
beings.
Say what you want

78
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,270
about gypsy moth caterpillars.

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,090
You know they they don't make you know
nuclear waste they they've never you know

80
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,550
invested in plastics you know they're
pretty green for what it is that they do

81
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,170
right and they are part of nature so
they probably really don't need to be

82
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:21,190
stopped by an outside force like us
we're stopping them for our own fucking

83
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,024
survival.

84
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,140
And the problem is his mother nature
up until this point has been bringing a

85
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:31,120
knife to a gunfight with like fucking
gypsy moth caterpillars it's some bullshit

86
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:36,121
like that and I think now she's realizing
that she needs to go down to the local

87
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,493
fuckin

88
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,290
what he called the place to go down to
the place where there's always like a bad

89
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:47,291
keyboard in the fucking window pawnshop
go down in the pawn shop she's gonna get

90
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:53,321
herself a fucking heater boner powder a
burner whatever the fuck you call them

91
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,160
and I'm fucking a boner she's going to
come out with a fucking dick move she's

92
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:02,690
going she's going to do a reverse Bruce
she's gonna fuck all of us in the ass

93
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:05,900
with the weather I think that that's sort
of a stretch to say I have no idea but

94
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:10,901
all I know was you know
it was fucking insane.

95
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,760
So the inevitable happens is then there's
a power surge there was like nobody on

96
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:19,340
the roads like that's how fucking hot
it was everybody was just staying inside

97
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,250
sitting in air conditioning
like Oh my God.

98
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,260
And that fucking guy out there and then
we all after making it harder you know

99
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm not saying it wouldn't be
answered four degrees or whatever.

100
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,910
I don't even know if we made it
five degrees higher or whatever but

101
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,420
we sit inside and we don't get to feel
we don't feel the effects of what the

102
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:42,780
fuck we're doing. It's like buying
a shirt. You know what I mean.

103
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,100
You don't see the fucking 8
year old that sewed it together.

104
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,740
Does this shirt make me look good.
Right. It's like it's painless.

105
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,170
So now we're all sitting there in the
AC and inevitably we don't have enough

106
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:55,680
power.

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,500
So now they have to have a blackout.
Now where are they going to do it.

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,720
Okay now I already gave it away.
Okay.

109
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,620
The keyword here is Blackout
Black would be the keyword.

110
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,150
You know I don't you know where they did
it but I know they didn't fucking go.

111
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,560
Well we have to shut down the grid
somewhere. Where should we shut it down.

112
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,780
Should we shut it down in Beverly Hills
or fuckin Bel Air or these people with

113
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:21,781
their fucking infinity pools that fall
off into the goddamn ocean with their

114
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,470
panoramic views.

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,420
You can only see the
roundness of the planet.

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,613
You know

117
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,810
these people with their MTV Cribs
stocked fuckin refrigerators

118
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,080
they're giant carbon footprint or now.
Now

119
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,680
those people fund our campaigns.

120
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,750
Let's fuckin
let's if I can go down here.

121
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,150
These people who can barely rub two
fucking nickels together will shut down

122
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:48,984
their shit

123
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,460
just an evil fuckin world.

124
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,450
And oddly enough this weekend as I sat
in my air conditioned house you know not

125
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:03,320
in Beverly Hills but not the hood either.

126
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,590
You don't know me like if I was on a
chessboard I wouldn't be a pawn but I

127
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:08,820
wouldn't be in the castle either.

128
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,980
You know I don't think I'd be the horse

129
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,880
I wouldn't be a bishop I think I'd be a
rook you know basic forward sideways you

130
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,100
know weight gain no
lateral fucking movement

131
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,560
went dark diagonal I'd fucking trip over
myself or try to run a fuckin it or an

132
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,840
outright route like a fuckin horse I
would still think I'd make it you know

133
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,990
cause the fuckin bride can
do whatever she wants right.

134
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,070
John all the goddamn power at the fucking
king they'll just sit there back it up

135
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:48,210
Whoa whoa hey guys surround me she's
pissed she's pissed or she said she's not

136
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,310
pissed but she's not talking to me.

137
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,230
She is but you know what I
mean it's really quick and

138
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,630
serviceable conversation
would you like some dinner

139
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,840
okay. It's ready salmon

140
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,890
likes talking to nothing.

141
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,720
Anyways they should have like this is
such a hacky idea of what they should

142
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,260
literally.

143
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,830
I wish they had right now if they had
like a fuckin like a relationship to me or

144
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,970
someone must have done a bit like this.
Like you have like a relationship.

145
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,970
Meteorologist you know what I mean.

146
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,550
That could give you a
five day fucking forecast.

147
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,550
Let you know what kind of coat to wear.

148
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,570
Basically what kind of kind of
shit am I going to try to avoid.

149
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,820
So I don't step into it.
You know what I mean.

150
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,620
So anyways I'm in the fucking house right.
And

151
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,580
you know I got the kid now and she's
getting bigger and eventually she's going

152
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,800
to need her own room.
All right.

153
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,600
And I have all and I don't even have a
lot of shit but I have all I have a lot

154
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,610
of shit.
I didn't figure out a lot of shit.

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,860
I wrote a lot of furniture
but I have a lot of shit

156
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,570
you know just over the years going on the
road buying a little thing here little

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,740
thing their fan giving you something the
venue giving you something and all of a

158
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,390
sudden you just got a bunch of shit.

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,750
And then what happens is
if enough time goes by

160
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,940
Easter I don't know I'm sentimental.

161
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,640
I start to develop feelings for
it and it's hard to get rid of it.

162
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,133
Well

163
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,350
I don't have a choice now people.

164
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,430
So in the near future

165
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,450
I'm going to I am going to have a
massive massive fucking giveaway

166
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,010
of memorabilia and shit
and an old drums stuff.

167
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,940
And like you know I try to give some
people my my old drum magazines and just

168
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:06,240
nobody wanted them all these fucking young
kids are like you know I stick it out

169
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,170
and fold bra.

170
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,100
And is good fucking I can read
this on my phone like I like.

171
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,310
I don't know what like you'd think I was
handed and like a hammer and chisel in

172
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,380
a rock and be like you I
draw pictures with this.

173
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,180
So I didn't feel too bad because they're
made out of paper although I'm sure the

174
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:27,500
ink is bad for the environment.

175
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,530
But I I put like 20 years of all of these
fucking magazines that I saved like I

176
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:39,230
was going to go back and peruse through
two decades of fucking drum magazines

177
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,490
and I kept some of them you know

178
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,090
John Theodore's the fucking Nico brain
the fuckin Steve Jordan you know all the

179
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,360
way back all the drummers
and I fucking love right.

180
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,450
Tommy Lee you know but then you know
the latest ones were the easiest ones to

181
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:04,920
get rid of because I'm an old man and
I probably didn't know a lot of those

182
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,760
players although I probably should but

183
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,420
you know I don't know I just wish
I could go back in time and that by

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
anything you know Jimmy The Gent don't
what the fuck that I say don't buy

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,340
anything you know as much as he was
a murderous psychopath he was very

186
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:28,080
environmentally conscious in
that part of Goodfellas you know.

187
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,900
So anyways just giving you guys a heads
up I I got it all out in front of me

188
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:40,820
here. I got it all laid out.
My wife who's not mad at me

189
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,993
is.

190
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,370
You know she was like Well what
do you get like a storage shed.

191
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,780
You know you like this stuff and it's
like I'm not fucking doing that I'm not

192
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:58,781
doing that like whenever I
see those places I get like
I have a fucking almost a

193
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:04,330
physical reaction to them
when I see a storage facility.

194
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,980
And it's the second I did that
before and I fucking do with them.

195
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,630
You have to go back and
check in on your stuff.

196
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,670
It's like your stuff went
to jail and then you know.

197
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,000
You can just fuckin

198
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,750
hang on a second I got a
fuckin text escape back.

199
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,690
There's no way for me to continue talking.

200
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,420
Call you in

201
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,280
in a 45 minute

202
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,923
anyways.

203
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,860
This just
than you do in the George Carlin bit.

204
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,170
You just have shit just spread out all
over the fucking world and it's just like

205
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,310
if there's not like.

206
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,590
Fox shut up
all right.

207
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,140
If there's not Roman it in your house.

208
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,030
Like we have more rooms that
could be bedrooms and people here.

209
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,880
Okay. It's just me why I
want my wife for my daughter.

210
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,930
So there's no fucking reason why there
should be no room other than the fact

211
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:21,000
that we just have too much shit.
And I'm not throwing it out.

212
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,940
I thought the magazines because I made
out of paper and I don't obviously give a

213
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:27,900
shit about it but I'm really trying to
fucking think about where this stuff is

214
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,750
going to end up.
OK and

215
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,440
I don't know.

216
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,120
So I'm going to try to like you know I
figured if I could just take some of this

217
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,210
shit if you guys wanted.

218
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,430
You know I'll just fucking give
the stuff away or whatever.

219
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,490
I hope some people aren't going to get
mad cause some of the stuff is like shit

220
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:48,750
that venues have given me

221
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,240
you know some sports jerseys with my name
on the back of them and stuff which is

222
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:58,380
fucking cool or whatever but like you
know I'm not going Oh I'm not I never wore

223
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:03,150
it and I always appreciated the gesture
but I just took it and I put it in a box

224
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,510
and then I just started piling these
fucking things up and I don't know any

225
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,530
fuckin room I don't know
what to do with them so

226
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,870
my new fuckin thing from here on out
fifty fucking years old is Jimmy The Gent

227
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,540
I'm not fuckin buying anything I'm not
buying anything you know I'm trying to

228
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:28,850
get my wife on the same fuckin page but
you know you know that's not work it

229
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,120
ought to be Jesus Christ

230
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,670
telling her not to go on Amazon is like
her telling me not to get shitfaced on a

231
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,200
Tuesday I mean it's just not happening

232
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,900
by the way speaking of drinking I haven't
drank you wouldn't know it from my

233
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,901
voice sound like shit but I haven't
drinks at the end of June and

234
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,530
it's so it's so fucked up it's so
fucked up how it's just like food

235
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,590
I made the same relationship with food
that I have with booze that I do is I

236
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:05,550
just fucking walk away for a few days
what the fuck am I doing when I see food

237
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:09,750
walking away it's like sugar and shit
and bad food and I start eating well and

238
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,560
then all of a sudden if I look at bad
foods I want to fucking eat that and I

239
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,350
feel that way and I do the same thing
with booze like you know when I'm drinking

240
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:20,220
and I see a bottle of booze I swear to
God it's like you know it's backlit at

241
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:25,221
the bar I mean it just looks like you're
drinking life it just looks golden you

242
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,100
know so inviting and then when I just
stopped drinking I just looked at him like

243
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,980
Jesus I don't fucking mess with that shit.

244
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,960
What the fuck did I do now.

245
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,640
What I got to apologize for I know I'm
wrong that's the worst thing about it you

246
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:45,474
know what I mean

247
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,490
Jesus does it ever fucking end you don't
I mean it's like when I was a kid my

248
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:52,830
mother was mad at me and I didn't she
wouldn't tell me I got to fucking figure

249
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:53,664
out what I did

250
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,130
I love on all these fucking tv shows
where they sit there and they always sit

251
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:02,520
there they talk about how we're living
to see twice as many fucking words in a

252
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,550
day and how they got great
at communicating it's like
No they're not they're not

253
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,070
then I go to communicating.

254
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,880
They speak in fucking riddles.
Can you tell she's home.

255
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,390
I keep whispering so
speak in fucking riddles.

256
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,340
I'm so no body mind today younger right.

257
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,590
Now sit in a telephone like
to which you're going to
understand about a woman is

258
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,770
by the time they're eight they get
the whole fucking thing planned out.

259
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,330
Not all of them but enough of them.

260
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,100
He is still sitting there playing in
a fucking mud puddle or jumping off a

261
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:35,460
jungle gym going Hey Mom look what the
fuck I can do whatever kids do nowadays

262
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,940
you know fucking dancing with your
fucking toy robot whatever you guys do.

263
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,540
They got it all planned out.
That's why.

264
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,070
How many times guys have you been out
on a date with a woman and she said some

265
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:50,160
shit to you that sounded like a
riddle and you're like What the fuck.

266
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,690
And then you answer the question then
she goes I know you're supposed to say

267
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,530
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

268
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Like I didn't know there was a script
nobody sent me the sides for my part like

269
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:07,401
they have the whole fucking thing
the whole fucking thing mapped out.

270
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,590
And you basically you have three options

271
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,990
you really just accept it

272
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,040
or die alone.

273
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,650
Or you go out by a wife
beater and you become that guy

274
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,260
and she don't want to do that

275
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,690
is he playing women it's a mythic village.

276
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,610
Shut up. God. Just fucking around.

277
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
You know I was on Twitter right.

278
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,623
And

279
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,850
Sony wrote some fucking hilarious
smart ass thing about me.

280
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,840
So I clicked on their profile because
I was just like you know that is above

281
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,720
average shit talk.
Is this another comic.

282
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,300
Is this an up and coming
comic I don't know.

283
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,680
I was like go with a comedian level funny
so I went to this person's thread and

284
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:08,670
I you know read a little blurb figure
what they did so I scrolled down to try to

285
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,270
figure out are they a comedian look for
a standup picture and one of the things

286
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,790
this person had retweeted was from this.

287
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
Something something feminist
was talking about Donald Trump

288
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,413
and

289
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,040
and was saying like Donald Trump just
made fun of the victims of me too and the

290
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:35,190
crowd roared with approval period.

291
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,800
And then again she wrote roared with
approval right and then she had the leg.

292
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,660
Oh my God oh my God are you kidding me.
This is what he did today.

293
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,710
This guy's fucking crazy.

294
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,120
So I clicked on it

295
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,600
and he made a roundabout
reference to me to

296
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,240
you know he was using me to the way
some people use millennials which is not

297
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:55,570
right.

298
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,830
I'm not saying it's right to do that
but you know I'm not trying to be a cunt

299
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:04,120
here but I am a comedian and
I've been on stage for 26 years.

300
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,590
They did not roar with approval okay.

301
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,310
He got a chuckle

302
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,380
he got a polite chuckle.

303
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,630
I'm not saying they weren't meat heads.

304
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,380
I'm not saying what he
said was back in right.

305
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,910
But the crowd did not
roar with approval period.

306
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Roared with approval and it just as a
comedian that fucking annoyed me because I

307
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:31,890
went back in the day you'd
see these fucking comics
get offstage after I crushed

308
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,290
a fucking crushed NBC if I could.
You got the job done.

309
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,850
That's not telling.

310
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,090
You can't stop walking around saying
you killed it didn't Donald Trump didn't

311
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,170
kill OK.

312
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,850
If that was his fucking audition set for
a club and those were the laughs he was

313
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:48,480
getting.

314
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,570
They would say you know what.
He's he's not ready yet.

315
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,920
Well I'd say he's not funny.

316
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,850
He she she was getting some
laughs but he was all right buddy.

317
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,950
I don't think he's ready for a weekend
spot yet like he was getting like Monday

318
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,390
Tuesday level laughs.

319
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,350
Like back you know when there was some
sort of fucking system in the clubs when

320
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,580
they would actually build talent.

321
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,680
They used to have you know Monday was
like an open mike night at Nick's.

322
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,200
And then the big deal was your next move
and next time you stop in Boston the

323
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:24,661
next move was the host Billy Martin who's
now like you know one of the made men

324
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,590
over there at Bill Marshall.

325
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,630
He then had a show Wednesday night at
the Kowloon and that was the first big

326
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,260
fucking move out of the open mikes.

327
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,770
I got a spot at the Kowloon and you'd
say that to the other open makers in.

328
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,170
Did you just burn through the crowd of
open makers doing it for a burger spot at

329
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,004
the Kowloon.

330
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,570
And then I remember thinking like the
first time I did a spot at the Kowloon.

331
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,910
I was so fucking nervous because this
was the first time I went out in front of

332
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:00,930
a crowd that was not expecting
to see an open maker.

333
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,510
They did not go to an open
mike show going all right.

334
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,400
Let's see what these fucking people
have or I'm here to see a friend of mine

335
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,220
like they came out to see a comedy show
and they were like All right we're gonna

336
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,320
give you that we're gonna hand you the
keys for five minutes let's see what the

337
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,154
fuck you do right.

338
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,050
So I would say I would say that
that's where Trump was in that speech.

339
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,920
He was doing five minutes
at the counter all right.

340
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,680
This has nothing to do about
what the fuck he said or whatever

341
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,150
but I did find it interesting though.
But that's how she heard it.

342
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,920
She heard them roaring with laughter

343
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,210
Yeah like

344
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,260
anywhere you fucking elicit a Trump go
in fake news Fake news like it wasn't

345
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,360
necessary.

346
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Well sometimes it's fake but it's more
just people hear shit and then whatever

347
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:59,370
they're passionate with it just it
raises the fucking levels you know

348
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,030
like you know with me this you know
you know you guys at this point if you

349
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:07,150
listened long enough you know
this shit that sets me off.

350
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,063
All right.

351
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,990
And like the amount of fuckin times I
lose my shit and I think it's go it's

352
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,640
going a certain way.

353
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,660
And then I find out not only am
I not right I am 100 percent.

354
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,510
It's a complete 180 it's
going in the other direction.

355
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,790
Now I'm not saying that this woman should
not have been upset you know and also

356
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,510
get upset that people chuckled you know
but they did not roar with laughter.

357
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,740
I'm just being a country
comedian right now.

358
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,160
You know there's just certain things
that people say that that goes into the

359
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:45,360
terminology terminology of a comedian.
And it bugs me.

360
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,240
Like the thing that I you know I talked
about a part a year ago or two years ago

361
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,260
was this fucking phenomenon where all
of a sudden people started saying I love

362
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,510
when the comedian heckled the crowd

363
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,390
it's like no no the community
doesn't heckle the crowd.

364
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,570
Comedian gets heckled a heckler goes
to a performance and tries to disrupt a

365
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,580
performance speech.

366
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,670
Anything that is a heckler all right
for a comedian to be heckling a crowd.

367
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,180
The crowd to be had to be collectively
giving some sort of fucking performance

368
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,100
that he he's interrupting.

369
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,463
All right.

370
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,860
You could say the comedian snapped a
loved one you fucking just lost your shit

371
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:34,574
on that go.

372
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,050
But I'm not heckling the crowd like
oh look at I you sit in your seats.

373
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,550
You call that a show. Sorry. Whatever.

374
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:53,310
So anyways how many documents and that's
24 minutes got them then a bad day pay

375
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,070
a bad at all.

376
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,960
Hey let's talk about World Cup soccer huh.
What's what.

377
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,970
You know Asia we talk about NFL football.

378
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,270
I know the theme song.

379
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,930
I don't know what the the World Cup thing
is you know but I've watched enough of

380
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:15,180
it that I know in the end they're
going to go to the wrap up with the

381
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,380
fashionable lady.

382
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,090
Then there's the old black guy looks
he's like you know fell off a stool at a

383
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:23,640
pub. He's probably some old
fucking football player you know.

384
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,230
And then there's the
excitable like sort of fat guy

385
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,680
who looks like you with the mustache.

386
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,450
You know that may allow to say Latino as
a white guy. I mean he is a latino dude.

387
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,630
He looks like the guy though when the
first guys that gets killed in a fuckin

388
00:25:39,631 --> 00:25:40,464
mob movie

389
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,140
and then the other ones it seemed like
they just we had a revolving chair like I

390
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:48,790
recognized this black dude
with dreads as being like.

391
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,590
Wasn't he on our fucking Team
USA Team.

392
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,430
Oh by the way I finally figured out
how to fucking tell who the fuck is ho.

393
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,840
In a world cup game if you didn't get
there at the beginning this is how works

394
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:08,841
at American TV on Fox Sports they
basically right next to the team name.

395
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,000
They'll have the smallest little sliver
of color and that's the color of the

396
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:20,001
uniform like I watched Russia
first Croatia and I'm just
sitting there literally

397
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:24,950
waiting for somebody to fuckin score
so I can figure out who the fuck is who

398
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,230
have set their course you know if I can
get it all to three hours I'm kidding

399
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,760
man it was it was a fucking unbelievable
game but I finally just figured out now

400
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,010
some explain it to me on Twitter
I just start tweeting about

401
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,170
go and you know I I don't I don't
know who the fuck is who here

402
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,900
you know and

403
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,710
I had this weird thing like I didn't
know who to root for because there was

404
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:55,390
something so fucking funny to me
if the Russians won the World Cup

405
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,620
I would just would have been so awesome.

406
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,633
Listening.

407
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,010
Two people losing their shit over here
and getting all wound up again saying

408
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:10,011
that they you know tampered with the
election over here you know and then

409
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,890
everybody just starts yelling at each
other again it's just I was looking

410
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:16,620
forward to that. You know just
adding to the fucking heat out here.

411
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,040
But anyways it was an incredible game
and I can not fucking I root for Croatia.

412
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,540
You know although every time they cut
to the Russians in the crowd I was just

413
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,040
like you know those are
some good looking people.

414
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,450
You know there's really no middle ground
with Russians so you know what I mean.

415
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,660
Already Eastern European.

416
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,690
So either they'd look like
fucking supermodels or they
look like it's still like

417
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,700
medieval times.
You don't mean.

418
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,200
I mean they got some women over there
that looked like they could easily fucking

419
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,180
impress some NFL scouts you know in
the in the we know the NFL Combine when

420
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:56,200
they're pushing up to 25. How many
reps they can do much. You know.

421
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,290
Course they wouldn't get drafted after
the 40 but I'm just saying that they.

422
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,350
You know. But then they got some other
ones it's like Oh my God. Gorgeous.

423
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,970
I'm fucking with you I'm not saying
that you know there's not a lot of weird

424
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,853
looking Americans

425
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,060
but that was one of the really cool
things looking at that thinking of all the

426
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,520
fucking bullshit that goes
on at a political level.

427
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,630
You know with the missiles and all of
that shit and then just to watch all these

428
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:26,631
Russians losing their fucking minds every
time Russia would score a goal so long

429
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:29,310
story short that's their game with
the Croatian crowd. Same thing.

430
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,150
Fucking really good looking people that
I mentioned that I'm gonna be doing an

431
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,170
Eastern European tour at the beginning
of next year you know and I will be

432
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,160

numbers down a half a degree during

433
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:46,410
the time in your fucking country.

437
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,870
I am the greatest in Transylvania.

438
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,290
That's why I approach people on the
street with my fuckin business card.

439
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:11,050
I'm sweating as I'm watching this fucking
game and like I'm doing the typical

440
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:11,934
American thing like.

441
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,640
I can't think you will do this. Look at
this level. Fuck you you'll be sued soon.

442
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Do you love doing that shit and all of a
sudden Croatia scores a goal and I just

443
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,630
don't. I couldn't control myself.
I just fucking lost my shit right.

444
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,060
And then Russia comes back immediately.

445
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,270
I believe I watched some of the
games I forget. They fuckin scored

446
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,490
and fucking the Russian fans are going
nuts and I'm like all these motherfuckers

447
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,190
you know you know me I'm
always good spirits today.

448
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,350
Vladimir Lenin and Putin you know he's
got it he's got the fucking he's got the

449
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,210
it's got the invisible hand you know and

450
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,700
then Croatia scores

451
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,300
and it's fucking 2 to 1 there's like
barely any time left and I just I almost

452
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,260
made my daughter jump out of the chair
in the other room I yelled so loud when

453
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:06,800
they scored and I was like Holy fuck this
is gonna be on bleep that fucking guy

454
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:11,120
number 10.
Number 10 is a beast of Croatia right.

455
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,930
And there's like no time left and all
of a sudden Russia gets like a fucking

456
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:19,360
corner kick and I was just sitting there
I had my hands over my mouth just going

457
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,530
like Oh no no
come on come on.

458
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,470
And then he fucking kicks
it this beautiful whatever
the fuck you call it you

459
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:33,270
know it was like a pass into the slot
you know in hockey like a sausage pass

460
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,490
just right over everybody's fucking
head and it just goes right to this one

461
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:42,170
Russian dude who just makes it glances
it off his head into the back of the net

462
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,070
and I just go.

463
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,100
And every time I yelled
I've surprised myself.

464
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,200
I can't believe how
fucking into this game I

465
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,920
saw my wife and my and my daughter
are getting ready to leave.

466
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,570
And I'm like I'm sorry I. We can't leave.
I have to see the end of this game.

467
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,160
She's like Are you serious.

468
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,470
Like is that this is yet another
thing that you're fucking into.

469
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,910
I'm like Yeah I go it's the shoot out
whatever the penalty whatever fuck they

470
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:14,911
call it and I sat there like literally
like I was like that Tarkanian guy like

471
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,920
chewing on a fucking towel.

472
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,530
I was in the kitchen yo because I had to
keep you know leave in the fucking room

473
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:26,880
and I had like the fucking towel you
dry dishes with to make my wife is gone

474
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,740
you're going to throw that in the hamper
I'm like I'm fucking non on the thing

475
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,820
and just the level the
level of fucking pressure.

476
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,170
And if you miss one of those penalty
kicks and your team only loses by one like

477
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:44,090
you just get shit for the rest of your
life you know I mean there was a guy in

478
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:47,180
Columbia and they don't know if he got
killed because of that but me it's pretty

479
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:51,320
fucking suspicious.
It was an incredible game.

480
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,183
And like

481
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,720
it's safe to say that I 100 percent get
it and I actually love the game now.

482
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,000
There I said it. I love soccer.
It's a fucking great game.

483
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,480
I finally get it.
I fucking get it you know.

484
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,880
And then how great the World Cup is.

485
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,990
Where it's truly is a world championship.

486
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,980
And then what's great is if you lose
okay that other team can talk shit to you

487
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,940
for the next three fucking years and
it's once every four years but you're not

488
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:29,160
even guarantee that
you're going to get in.

489
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,810
So when you get to that fucking
close when you lose. Now I get it.

490
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,910
Now I get why I'm sitting there watching
grown man cry who are in their 50s and

491
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:44,570
60s because they're sitting there going
like it's not going to happen in my

492
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:45,404
lifetime.

493
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,760
I'm going to die without ever see them
holding up an astoundingly small trophy

494
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,590
for a true World Championship to see
how big the fucking Stanley Cup is.

495
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,480
That's 30 teams 30 one whatever
the fuck they're up to.

496
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,350
It's not the whole world.
You got the whole world.

497
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,790
Why the fuck is the trophy so small.

498
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,920
It's so funny when they win it and
they all try to run around with it.

499
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,780
They're all like know trying to hold it up

500
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,290
there like bumping heads and shit like
they keep their cake they should make it

501
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:29,270
bigger. You know what. That's classic
fucking. That's how an American thinks.

502
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,090
That's how we think you know
bigger is better. It is.

503
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,270
And you know something as much as you

beautiful picture of me and my wife in

589
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:37,000

652
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,970
All right let's get on.

653
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,180
Well we can't get onto the letters
I have to talk about the F1 race.

654
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,670
That was in Great Britain
back to back.

655
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,790
I'd have to say these are the two most
exciting races I've seen since I've been

656
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:08,650
watching which has been Monaco 2016.

657
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,410
I've seen almost every race since then.

658
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,070
What a fucking race.

659
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,160
Lewis Hamilton was trying to get the
pole position for like the eighth fucking

660
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:21,910
time in a row there I think he's
won like the last six or seven.

661
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,660
He always dominates there.

662
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,330
He had a rough showing didn't even
finish it it did not finish his last one

663
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,220
wherever the fuck they were.

664
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,560
I remember in Austria and you knew
Mercedes was going to come back strong.

665
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,810
So the race starts all right.

666
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,940
I believe Lewis Hamilton was in first

667
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,780
Vettel was in second Kimi Reagan
and was somewhere in there.

668
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,510
Normally they go into
the first fucking turn.

669
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,730
Lewis Hamilton something you
hardly ever see has a bad start.

670
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:55,220
Fatal blows by Hamilton
gets his fucking car going.

671
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,290
I don't understand did he pop the clutch
I don't get how they have a bad start.

672
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,780
I don't understand that Atari fuckin
steering wheel that they're doing there I

673
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,370
don't get it.
There is no clutch anymore.

674
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,160
I don't even know what they did get
a little paddle thing there I have no

675
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:14,120
fucking idea but sometimes they don't
hit the right button and they just go on

676
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:17,440
too slow. I don't know but
they blame the driver right.

677
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,290
So anyway so they get into the first
fucking turn and all of a sudden factory

678
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,760
boats comes screaming in out of
nowhere Venables in first place

679
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,890
Lewis Hamilton's all of a sudden in third.
I was like no fucking way.

680
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,450
And then out of nowhere you just see
all this smoke and shit and now just go

681
00:45:35,451 --> 00:45:39,380
nuts in Lewis Hamilton got
hit by Kimi reckoning and

682
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,800
any fuckin spun out and he went from
like one Turner to turns from being first

683
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:50,350
in the race to being last and

684
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,160
it was just like What the fuck.

685
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,820
And then I believe at
that point it was Vettel.

686
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,580
Bow ties and then Kimi reckoning or
maybe max for Stamper went up there.

687
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:08,610
But you know the Red Bull team was right
there by the way the United States the

688
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,590
fucking Haas team we were we've qualified
fifth and sixth we were killing it

689
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:17,570
until we fucking slammed into each other
like assholes and took ourselves out of

690
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:18,404
the points

691
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,880
and we may be at one point I think we
came in 10th means fuck it sucked but we

692
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:26,810
do it better than we
are doing better than I.

693
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,670
That's the team that I want really want
to win anything anybody has to do with

694
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:34,730
American racing but where
we're having a great season.

695
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,760
If we could just quit fucking
up and bought our plowing ahead

696
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:42,523
so

697
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:48,300
Lewis Hamilton is not out of the race
he gets his car going again and which is

698
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:49,320
one of my favorite things.

699
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,800
What a great driver like him Sebastian
Vettel gets knocked all over the back of

700
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,600
the race. Then you get to
watch him go through the field.

701
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,600
And he was driving go in my car and
messed up it's messed up the rear and they

702
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:04,050
go No you find your phone you're fine
and he just tears through the whole field

703
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:08,280
basically up until the top five and then
even when he got top five he's still

704
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:09,540
like 25 seconds behind

705
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,340
that's how superior basically Red Bull
really Mercedes Ferrari is and then Red

706
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:22,570
Bull and
so Mercedes adopted this.

707
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,790
We're just going to stop once like
an hour if you're not into this shit.

708
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,730
It's actually like fascinating
like petting and all of that stuff.

709
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,900
You can win and lose it.

710
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,200
And long story fucking short
is by the end of the race.

711
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,580
Like the final five laps.

712
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:47,060
Because Mercedes only pitted one time
and Ferrari's period at least twice

713
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,800
because I think one time they went in
like I never understand out works well

714
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:57,130
with the safety car out there or whatever
the fuck they call it pace car some

715
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:58,314
shit right.

716
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,090
But anyways all of a sudden with five
laps left it's felt terrible task is in

717
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:03,924
first place

718
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,030
Sebastian Vettel is right behind him
with fresher tires what's his face.

719
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,600
Lewis Hamilton driving like a maniac once
again with not as fresh tires because

720
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:19,510
they only stopped once so they're all
fucking chewed up and they're right on his

721
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:21,320
ass.
Is that fucking psycho.

722
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,880
Kimmy Regan who I fucking love drives
like a maniac and a 10 second penalty by

723
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:28,570
the way because they said he smashed
into Lewis Hamilton he didn't need to do

724
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:33,220
that and he was yelling at his fucking
pit crew and all that shit was fucking

725
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:37,570
great. So they're all driving
like absolute fucking maniacs.

726
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,410
And once again I'm screaming at the
TV Young once again at a sport I never

727
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:42,310
thought I would be into.

728
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:47,620
And unfortunately for Vanna like his
his tires just crapped out and he just

729
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,270
didn't have enough grip and

730
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,830
I'm sorry you felt terrible to us.

731
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,500
I'm sorry his tires just crapped out and
Vettel was able to duck underneath them

732
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,670
and then he then he gave way to Lewis
Hamilton which I thought was really cool

733
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,020
that Hamilton was trying
to stay on his ass.

734
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:09,870
They just didn't have the fucking tyres.
And what's his face.

735
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,790
Bolton set it up.

736
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,120
I think it went all the way down Fifth
or Sixth but the final was Sebastian

737
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:21,580
Vettel for Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton
from Mercedes and that can be reckoned

738
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,740
on the podium there was two
Ferraris and a Mercedes.

739
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:31,250
Sebastian Vettel is now eight points up
and the Ferrari team I think is like 20

740
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:35,460
points up for the year and we've got
two more races before the summer break.

741
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:41,670
There couldn't be any closer it's
going to be fucking great fuck

742
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,880
anyways.

743
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,070
Jesus Christ.
By the way I just hit pause there.

744
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,460
Coughing What flick another
nine fucking seconds.

745
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,590
I must read some advertising here.

746
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,920
So anyways the next one I believe is
I think it's in Germany or is it the

747
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:04,570
Hungarian or is it the next two. But I
got to think a lot of jeeps coming up.

748
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,810
I hope I didn't fucking make my stupid

749
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,980
recorder is it fucking not.

750
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,540
Isn't recording those things because
sometimes it gets bumped down in priority

751
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,930
or another fact that
works. All right. Okay.

752
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,680
In regard to Eastern European tour.

753
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,690
Dear Bill you mentioned
planning East European tour.

754
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:32,420
I just want to make just one as a mention
to think about visiting one of former

755
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:34,790
Yugoslavian countries in the parklands.

756
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,240
If this plan moves forward I emailed you
from Belgrade Serbia but anything here

757
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:44,430
like Croatia Bosnia or even
Slovenia can work for local fans.

758
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,620
Check out some stats.

759
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,820
We have the most site visits or something
as it would be interesting to see you

760
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:50,930
live somewhere near.

761
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,490
Stand up is still relatively rising here
but I am sure it might be interesting

762
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:57,920
for you to visit if you are around here.

763
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,920
Dude I will go there and fucking
eat my balls in a second.

764
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,720
What am I ever gonna go there.

765
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,790
I'll be close enough that you
can jump on a train. All right.

766
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:11,890
Your papers please.

767
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,520
However the fuck it works over there
you know Eastern Europe scares me.

768
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,320
That is still behind the communist
bloc like for most of my life.

769
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,053
So

770
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,160
then I know you know once Russia went
out of there you guys kind of picked up

771
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:29,110
some Hatfield McCoy shit that you.

772
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,180
Hadn't finished you know got a little
crazy there with the fucking genocide

773
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,090
stuff you know get a little
nuts over there so you know

774
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,890
you guys don't fuck around over
there is what I'm trying to say.

775
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,980
It's not like you're going to Canada.
Oh hey how you doing.

776
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,570
You know it's not like someone loves sex.

777
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,610
I feel like I'm gonna go over there
it's going to happen like that same vibe

778
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:54,660
like Belfast had where I was just like
if you didn't know some shit went down

779
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:59,320
the second you go eat sleep well some
fucking shit went down here and you just

780
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:03,550
immediately act accordingly like I
will not be fucking with anybody here.

781
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,510
All the best for you and your family.
I will.

782
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,900
I'm very very excited to see that part
of the world and we are putting it

783
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:19,960
together. I wouldn't bring it up
if we weren't putting it together.

784
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,060
All right. Okay. Possible Eastern
European tour. Another one.

785
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,673
Hey chief.

786
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,100
I was just listening to
your latest podcast July 2nd
where you mentioned putting

787
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:32,820
together an Eastern European tour.
Look at this look at all the fans.

788
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:37,090
This is two people.
I knew this tour be successful.

789
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,550
Hopefully you'll have the balls to come
to Belgrade Serbia so I can see you

790
00:52:42,551 --> 00:52:43,660
perform in person.

791
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:48,130
Well the second you tell me I need balls
to go where the fuck are you from. Yeah.

792
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,780
Go fuck yourself no go in there.

793
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,260
Why don't I what I need
to have balls to go there.

794
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,180
Don't even talk about the weather.

795
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:59,950
It's not Siberia it's Serbia because
I'm going to go there and take a fucking

796
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,580
farm tool to the side of my head.
I don't need that shit.

797
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,320
We had vampires are considered as
I'm sure you'll have a blast here.

798
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,370
I like how he scares the fuck out of
me. I there. Go go to the waterpark.

799
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,470
Also I don't know when you're playing to
do this tour but I'd recommend sometime

800
00:53:17,471 --> 00:53:18,910
between September and November.

801
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:22,630
Hopefully you'll put some more
specific information out of this plan.

802
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,190
So now I was thinking like January
or February. Why is that a bad time.

803
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,620
What happens in those months anyway.

804
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:39,650
Love your oh lows during January we
everybody stays inside and they let the

805
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,390
inmates run down the street.

806
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,150
It's like running of bulls with murder.

807
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:50,250
Anyways love your shtick and wacky antics
with the occasion random high jinks.

808
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,930
Rock on you crazy bastard right.
Just where you're talking.

809
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,930
I think I'll be fine
if I go over all right.

810
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,790
Obama's Money Hi Bill.

811
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,340
I'm eager to get the shit
kicked out of me on this one.

812
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:07,450
He signed a book deal you unread
douche Oh stop it stop it.

813
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,060
I don't want to hear this shit.
I don't want to hear this shit.

814
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,030
I don't want to hear this dude. He's
going to go around and he's got to do it.

815
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,970
He had 70 million dollars
with a fucking tour dates.

816
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,960
He also had that you selectively
UN reading douche bag.

817
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:29,020
Don't tell me he fucked you. He had a
fucking 900 million dollar book deal.

818
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,680
Obama 65 million dollar book deal.

819
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,020
All right.
Wait a second wait a second.

820
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,270
Now I'm going to fucking
hit you back with my shit.

821
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,410
Obama
speaking dates.

822
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,310
Money tour.

823
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,220
Here we go. Come on man. Big
number big no big number.

824
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,510
Michelle Obama tickets
for two thousand eighty.

825
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,480
Barack Obama four hundred
thousand dollars. Speaking fees.

826
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,310
Reveal what few.

827
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,953
Here we go.

828
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,410
Obama secures eight hundred
grand for two speaking

829
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,790
and we think he's talking to.

830
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,600
These go to a homeless shelter.

831
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,740
The reason many of us have been critical
Barack Obama's outrageous for those TV

832
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:18,710
ads is it robs us of a fantasy that
sooner or later the first black president

833
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:23,440
was going to use his considerable
powers in or out of office to help the

834
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:26,210
economic ravages of the poor who
are disproportionately black.

835
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,720
But you know a white
person probably wrote this.

836
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,700
I want to know who he's talking to huh.

837
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,850
Who the fuck has 400 grand
to throw at this fucking guy.

838
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,460
They're all. I don't I don't know
how to talk to you fucking assholes.

839
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,000
So am I really supposed to sit here and
I'm supposed to think that these fucking

840
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:47,850
guys like everybody with the blue tie.
I just don't buy it.

841
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,630
I don't fucking buy it. All right. OK.

842
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,350
Sixty five billion dollar book
deal. OK. After taxes sir.

843
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,440
After taxes and all the bullshit that'll
probably be about 30 billion bucks.

844
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,880
And I guarantee fucking T you he is gonna
be worth when it's all said and done

845
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,950
about 200 million bucks.

846
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:13,940
OK. And it's not going to be because
he wrote a fucking book. All right.

847
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,660
He's also going to go out and they do
these speaking engagements to all these

848
00:56:17,661 --> 00:56:21,320
corporations that they'll
pay them 400 fucking grand.

849
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,550
And these are the same people that got
him into office and he went in there and

850
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:26,930
did what the fuck they wanted.

851
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,500
And this is just them
washing their bribe money.

852
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:36,150
I mean honestly dude what changed when
he was in office that everybody is so

853
00:56:36,151 --> 00:56:36,984
enamored with.

854
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,940
Did we stop torturing people
down in Guantanamo that we
fucking end the war over

855
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:42,774
there.

856
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,630
Are we finally going like hey wait a
minute ISIS doesn't have a plane or a boat

857
00:56:47,631 --> 00:56:49,960
why are we acting like
Germany got back together

858
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,090
now it's the same fucking thing.
It's the same god damn.

859
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,640
It's the same guy with a
different colored tie. All right.

860
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,670
I will fuckin read up on this.
Hi Bill.

861
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,420
Love these shows you
work in our little world.

862
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,140
Our most recent party you talked about
the House Obama just bought and wondered

863
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:09,080
where the money came from.
Here's a piece that explains it.

864
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,730
It doesn't
it doesn't.

865
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,990
Sixty five million dollars you don't turn
around and you're only going to get 30

866
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:20,100
million dollars of that
OK.

867
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,710
And then you're gonna go out buy an 80
billion dollar fucking house you're gonna

868
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,850
pay at the 30 year note on that paying
interest on that because you just

869
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:30,520
basically got 30 million
dollars after taxes.

870
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:36,460
That makes no fucking sense
all right.

871
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,720
And also I would say I would actually be
willing to suggest that I am a fucking

872
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:44,740
paranoid maniac that the information
that you're going to they're not going to

873
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:45,574
tell you.

874
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,570
Can someone explain to me how did the
Clintons become worth hundreds of millions

875
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:50,404
of dollars.

876
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,150
Let me guess they both wrote a book for
one hundred million dollars each and

877
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:58,000
they what they don't pay taxes.
And that was it.

878
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,600
And then other than that they like Jimmy
Carter driving around the world fucking

879
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:05,050
you know
building houses for the poor.

880
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:10,260
I never claimed sir to be 100
percent fucking read up on this shit.

881
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,690
I'm not even 2 percent read
up on it but neither are you.

882
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,890
OK.
This is not a piece that explains it.

883
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:24,100
This is a piece that just shows this
guy cashing the fucking sixty million is

884
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,130
the gross

885
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,040
he's gonna get about 30 million bucks

886
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,650
that's it because he's got to kick in
for this never ending war too. All right.

887
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,760
So now he's got 30 million bucks.
He owes 82 million.

888
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,240
Like what is the fucking
payment on that a month.

889
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,660
Now he's going to go around and he's gonna
give all these fucking speeches. Okay.

890
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,820
And at schools do not
have the fucking you know

891
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,000
I would say Ivy League schools some of
these bigger fucking schools maybe they

892
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:58,760
have that but generally speaking they
go round and they talk to these fucking

893
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,080
these corporations.

894
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,100
Who got him into fucking office.

895
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,280
Hey dude what the fuck me what do you
do with it but putting you know every

896
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:10,900
fucking one of them. I don't I think
the whole fucking thing is weird.

897
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:15,610
It's all weird it's all weird that he's
a public servant and blah blah blah blah.

898
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,010
And in the end of the rainbow you were
two hundred fucking million dollars and

899
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:22,790
you're living in the same neighborhood
is all those corporate cunts who pour

900
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,680
shit into the fucking water supply.

901
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,840
Like the fact that that doesn't bother
you on any goddamn level and you're going

902
00:59:28,841 --> 00:59:31,880
to just sit that way yet you
get 65 million for a book.

903
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:35,630
I mean there you go.
I'm satisfied with that.

904
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,110
I don't think the political
system is corrupt at all.

905
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,610
I don't think it's a bad thing that now
corporations can dump unlimited amount

906
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:46,490
of funds into presidential candidates.

907
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,870
I don't think that that influences their
decisions on foreign policy whatsoever.

908
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:55,783
I don't know.

909
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,370
Hey you know what sir.
Agree to fucking disagree.

910
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:01,703
All right.

911
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,430
Anyways I've been rather restless and
despite the fact that I disagree with you

912
01:00:06,431 --> 01:00:08,740
I will say that there are
assholes on both sides.

913
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:13,770
However I however believe that there is
a lot to be said about how one conducts

914
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:17,470
themselves which is why I
side with Hillary over Trump.

915
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:23,280
Yeah I love you people who like it's
how you conduct yourself as long as you

916
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:26,880
continue murdering innocent people.
It's like it's not a problem.

917
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,730
But but is so eloquent
when they give a speech

918
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,740
do you know why the president
ages the way they do.

919
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,600
It's because of the dead bodies.
That's why it's not the economy.

920
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,930
It's not the sketches on SNL which is
what always cracks me up when you see like

921
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,990
people in Hollywood talking about how
they want to run for president you're

922
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:52,991
basically saying that you're so fucked
in their head that that you will that you

923
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:58,100
want to go to bed put your head on the
pillow go and like that I do the right

924
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:02,570
thing we thought they were the enemy.
It turned out to be a family.

925
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,480
There were children there.
And you have to fucking go to bed.

926
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,950
And then the next day fuck and
smile and give some goddamn speech.

927
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,910
It is the most fucked that maybe maybe
they deserve the money. I don't know.

928
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,200
Maybe I'm oversimplifying I am.

929
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,080
I always oversimplify you know what sir
I agree with you. You're probably right.

930
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,910
You know I think that's how we
got the house. He wrote a book.

931
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,100
He could be declared duck.

932
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,910
This chick was sucking my cock clubs
to do forget about Andrew Dice Clay.

933
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,130
God bless you.
All right.

934
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,320
Podcast topic table wondering if on an
upcoming podcast you can talk about how

935
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:43,250
your views may or may not have
changed on being a stay at home mom

936
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,270
that you are a parent yourself.

937
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:52,070
No they haven't changed
they haven't changed.

938
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:57,100
I think everybody exaggerates how
difficult their fucking Jarvis

939
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,280
alright. Listen. Being a single parent

940
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,043
is difficult.

941
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:09,310
I would say they would probably
unbelievably fucking difficult.

942
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,110
However if you fucking
married you know what I mean.

943
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:16,360
It's and you got one kid.
It's not that hard.

944
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:18,400
The first three months.
Yeah.

945
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:23,450
You're hallucinating you know but you
get somebody to help you out a friend a

946
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:26,610
family member something to help you out
see state that whole fucking thing where

947
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,290
people try to do it themselves this is
goddamn and it's fucking insane it's

948
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:34,140
fucking insane. That's not that
people didn't do that back in the day.

949
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,580
They say it takes a village to raise a
child back in the day you didn't fuckin

950
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:42,180
move to the other side of the goddamn
forest you just built a fucking log cabin

951
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:44,460
right next to your parents. That was
it. They came over they helped you out.

952
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:49,760
Follow a grizzly bear.
OK.

953
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,210
Now my views have have not changed.

954
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:57,610
Other than that I gave you answer to when
I watched my kid I'm fucking psyched.

955
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,020
I love it.
I have a great goddamn time.

956
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:05,190
We play games were screaming and yelling
with throwing balls all over the living

957
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:06,024
room.

958
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,650
And you know

959
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,400
I don't what the problem is.

960
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:18,440
You know my buddy was bitching about
something talking money or do something

961
01:03:18,441 --> 01:03:18,920
difficult.

962
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,920
I said Do you realize there's probably
some guy from Cuba right now that you

963
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:25,074
know

964
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:31,210
made a boat out of the discarded desk
and he's using a fucking sport coat is a

965
01:03:33,051 --> 01:03:33,884
sail.

966
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:38,230
Trying to get into this fucking country
risking the fact that he's gonna get cut

967
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,320
sent back and God knows what the fuck out.

968
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,180
I still don't know what exactly
is the problem with your day.

969
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:47,440
It's what I would say ma'am is it's about
perspective which is what that bit was

970
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:48,274
about.

971
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,840
I'm not saying it's not a challenging
job I'm not saying it's not an important

972
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:55,080
job.

973
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,980
I just said it's not the most
difficult job on the planet.

974
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:05,010
I would say that that people who fucking
were trying when the lava was coming

975
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:08,880
down at their house and they didn't have
lava insurance I would say some more

976
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:13,290
trying day than when your kid
just would not stop crying.

977
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,233
You know

978
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,450
your hero could not stop crying when that
fucking lava is at the front to help.

979
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,840
Should I tell my
boyfriend I'm a prostitute

980
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,553
OK.

981
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:32,910
Now you and I know sometimes these these
these e-mails get a little fuckin not

982
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:36,680
believable. Like what am I
supposed to do with this shit here.

983
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,040
Is this actually sir.
Help. Exclamation point.

984
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,120
Should I tell my boyfriend
I'm a prostitute.

985
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:43,050
All right.

986
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:46,140
What do I do here people do I ignore
this to actually act like this is real.

987
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:49,410
All right let's wait until
Dear Billy ball Baggins.

988
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:54,470
I'm a 25 year old semi single
lady living in the Netherlands OK.

989
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,340
I've got good qualifications
masters degree in social.

990
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,000
Well sounds like an outgoing am I going
to argue and try to treat other people

991
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:08,250
with kindness and respect.
God bless you.

992
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:11,760
You're the prostitute
with a heart of gold Adam.

993
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,680
You really have a master's degree.

994
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,240
I'd really like to build a special
relationship in my life and I'm currently

995
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:24,190
dating a nice guy from Brazil.
Oh boy. But there's a catch.

996
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,190
For the past three years I've
been working in the sex industry.

997
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:32,710
I like my job make good money and
always practice safe sex. Oh boy oh boy.

998
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,150
Get out of that business sweetheart.

999
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:39,130
I don't want to quit as it would mean
busting my ass to some corporate job

1000
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,320
working for the man.
Yikes.

1001
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:45,150
You can't just be a stripper
you know.

1002
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,190
No offense to strippers but Jesus Christ.

1003
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,230
You gotta shake your ass a little bit
you know close yourself off in the green

1004
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:54,820
room and just walk away
like it never happened.

1005
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:02,250
For me it's not a big deal to balance my
job in a loving relationship as I don't

1006
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:05,410
find the work side of things
emotionally intimate at all.

1007
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:10,580
However my boyfriend seldom
sees it the same way.

1008
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:16,550
My boyfriend's I am sure if I should be
honest with my new potential boyfriend

1009
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,620
about my profession

1010
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,410
I'm unsure if I should be.

1011
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:26,120
Normally I'm very honest and upfront my
boyfriend's about my job and normally it

1012
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,720
kills the relationship I see.

1013
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:32,400
I'm starting to wonder if honesty is
really the best policy as the truth always

1014
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:36,750
seems to add extra pressure in the
strained the relationship and it hurts me

1015
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,860
when I get attached to people and they
finish with me. What do you think.

1016
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,220
I hope you and Nia had a nice time
in Paris and go fuck yourself.

1017
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,800
We had a great time all right.
Okay if this is true sweetheart.

1018
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,840
Yeah. If you want to find a
loving relationship I think
you need to stop being a

1019
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,093
prostitute.

1020
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,480
Okay.
You know.

1021
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,790
I understand.
You know nobody understands.

1022
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,060
Not want to ending up in
a cubicle more than me.

1023
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,610
But I mean it's a fucking dangerous job.

1024
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,360
You know it's a very dangerous job.

1025
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:12,780
It's a bunch of creeps out there and I
practice safe sex but you know there's

1026
01:07:12,781 --> 01:07:13,560
always problems.

1027
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,270
It's just you know.
I don't know.

1028
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,570
I don't know something I'm looking at
this as a you know what that Puritan

1029
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,380
American fucking viewpoint.

1030
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,310
I don't know if you're
free you're over there man.

1031
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:32,380
I don't know what the deal is but let's
say I could actually handle the fact the

1032
01:07:34,011 --> 01:07:37,780
physical aspects of the girl I was
dating being a prostitute which I could.

1033
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,760
Let's just say I could
I would be so worried.

1034
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:44,320
Every time she went out that someone
was gonna beat her up or kill her.

1035
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,360
I mean you're in the sex industry.
It's a fucking horrible industry.

1036
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:52,670
You know I would

1037
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,880
I think you know at least I would be
worried about is how I tell this fucking

1038
01:08:01,881 --> 01:08:02,500
guy.

1039
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,160
I mean the sex industry.
I would be more worried.

1040
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,310
How the fuck do I get
out of the sex industry.

1041
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:10,220
Because what's going to happen is
eventually you're going to be an old

1042
01:08:10,221 --> 01:08:12,270
prostitute all right.

1043
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:18,570
And I don't know what you're investing
your money in Bitcoin or you know your

1044
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:21,520
own whorehouse. I have no idea
what you're doing here but like

1045
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,710
you know then all of a sudden
there's this big gap in your resume.

1046
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,810
Well you weren't in a cubicle you're
trying to get a corporate job and you're

1047
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:34,811
like you know what did
you do from 2010 to 2021.

1048
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,820
Oh I I.
I had sex for money.

1049
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:42,413
Oh.

1050
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,850
Oh okay. Well all right. I don't
think we have any more questions.

1051
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,140
I mean
you know assuming this is all true

1052
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,940
I would love it if you
got out of that industry.

1053
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:01,310
Just get out of it. You know what I mean.
There's easy money in my business too.

1054
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:05,180
You know I could go fucking do it
like a whore myself out you know.

1055
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,810
But you know what. You always leave a
piece of yourself there back in that room.

1056
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,300
I don't know you have a tremendous
attitude. I mean you make it sound fun.

1057
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:19,360
I love it that you know don't
get emotionally attached
to making good fucking

1058
01:09:19,361 --> 01:09:20,194
money.

1059
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:25,310
You know this is when any woman group
would be like That's because she's so numb

1060
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:29,740
from the Zapotec be that both you know
they start throwing their thoughts into

1061
01:09:29,741 --> 01:09:30,520
your fucking head.

1062
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:34,710
I don't know how you're wired it might
be fucking true it might not be true.

1063
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:38,220
I don't have any if I don't know
if this is way above my pay grade.

1064
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,370
I have no idea but I you should fucking
tell somebody that you're you know

1065
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,470
having sex for money.

1066
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:49,320
You know you probably want to
know that because it is dangerous

1067
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,850
you know there's FTD or
all that shit out there.

1068
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:57,870
Yeah I guess I would I would you know I
would tell fuck it you know I guess you

1069
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:03,550
can continue being a prostitute you're
soul mates gonna be the person you don't

1070
01:10:03,551 --> 01:10:07,980
have to lie to and you can't
accept me for who I am. You know.

1071
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,170
All right. I don't know what I got to
do to get rid of this fucking called.

1072
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:23,270
It just came on slow.

1073
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:28,240
My doctor was telling me if it comes out
fast it goes away fast comes on slow it

1074
01:10:28,241 --> 01:10:30,290
goes way slow I guess that's
what the fuck's going on here.

1075
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,150
But anyways that is the podcast.

1076
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,200
Good luck to all four teams
left to the World Cup.

1077
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,150
Good luck to that prostitute
and Brazilian guy.

1078
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,970
God bless the United States of America
and congratulations to Obama for signing

1079
01:10:46,971 --> 01:10:48,770
a 900 million dollar book deal.

1080
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:53,780
That's how he got that house.
That's how he's gonna pay for it.

1081
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,420
All you need is 30 million bucks

1082
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,320
or 80 to fuck it.

1083
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,950
If I get a 60 million
dollar fucking book deal

1084
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:09,120
and I was gonna get was 30 million
bucks out of it I was getting 40 grand a

1085
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:09,360
night.

1086
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,420
I still wouldn't go out buy an 82 million
dollar house I wouldn't fucking do it

1087
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,450
in a two million dollar house
is a fuckin white elephant.

1088
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,650
No offense to the Obamas.

1089
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:17,760
All right.

1090
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,760
I mean when you turn around to sell
that thing I mean there's like point one

1091
01:11:23,201 --> 01:11:25,450
percent of people that can
actually fucking afford it.

1092
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,490
You got to hope that they're
in the goddamn market.

1093
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,510
Do you think of flight drones are it
for old time's sake.

1094
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:42,570
Oh I was a low blow see Bill this is
why people think you voted for Trump.

1095
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,800
I don't like making fun of Trump it's
too fucking easy there's two idiots in

1096
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:50,900
paying attention to him it's too
fucking depressing. You know.

1097
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:56,710
Oh by the way that I got a of that dopey
Brad thing on fucking Instagram and I

any idea what the fuck my dad does.

1102
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,990
I cannot believe that a man
said that to another man.

Do you have any idea what the fuck my dad

1111

They all walked away right but they
were so convinced that this bouncer was

1112
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:05,470
fucked.

1113
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:09,840
It's the point I was sitting there like
I was feel like unsatisfied.

1114
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,700
Like do I want to know

the fucking tools of you.

1122
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,320

1123
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:52,650
My little polo shirt.
All right that's it.

1124
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:57,540
I apologize to Obama and all presidents.
Evidently they just do book deals.

1125
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,310
Just make 40 grand a
night giving speeches to

1126
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,370
banking colored conglomerates
and that type of shit.

1127
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,890
No they don't they go around a homeless
shelter so they all scrape together

1128
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:13,120
fucking nickels that they they pay
for that. I have no fucking idea.

1129
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:13,990
And you know what.

1130
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,870
Neither does the guy who I love
how he looked up one fucking thing.

1131
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,170
That's why I just I love doing
