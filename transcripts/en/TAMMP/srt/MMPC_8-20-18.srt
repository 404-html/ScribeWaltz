1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,340
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:04,890
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:09,750
August 20th, 2007 18.
Sorry. What's going on?

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:12,690
How are you?
How was your weekend?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,950
Did you or did you not enjoy yourself?

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,040
Did you or did you dad abused
substances that were a,

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,740
a legal and, and uh, possibly. Dot. Um,

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,780
I was actually out in Las Vegas,

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,220
hot as Fuck Las Vegas.
Let's make it fun.

10
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,640
And everybody talking about how can
you believe how hot it is out here?

11
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,610
It's like, yeah man, we're in
a fucking desert in August.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,750
I can completely understand why
it is so fucking hot out here.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,240
Um, and then you get the global
warming thing going on, you know, with,

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,130
have to have to for half the world's
on fire according to the news.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,230
Um, yeah, I can, I can see why it'd
be a little small to read their, um,

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:02,911
you know,

17
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:07,620
what's so fucked up about Las Vegas is
I was thinking when I was out there,

18
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,520
it's like there's,

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,640
there's only one reason and one reason
only that that place exists and that is

20
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:18,900
air conditioning.
Okay.

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,610
I know back in the day, you
know, when they had like
three or four little fucking,

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,610
I dunno, one floor casinos
in the middle of nowhere.

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,370
Whatever the hell was going on out
there. I did. I forget the whole story.

24
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,750
All right. I've watched all the
goddamn movies. I saw casino,

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,600
I saw a fucking Bugsy goes
to fucking pebble beach,

26
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,040
whatever the fuck it was
called. I watched that one. I,

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,850
I don't remember what the fuck. I'm
sure there was some fans, you know,

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,410
overhead fans. Is that all they had back
in the day? But I can tell you right now,

29
00:01:55,411 --> 00:02:00,060
nobody fucking went out there in August.
Well, maybe they did. I don't know.

30
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,170
But I'm just, anyways, it's
a different breed of people.

31
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:09,020
That was the greatest generation
back then. Okay. They, they, they,

32
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,200
they defeated Adolf Hitler,
defeated Japan,

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,930
you know, date, date, day, beat their
wives, and then nothing was said about it.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You know, they will all those women back
there, Rosie the riveter, what happened,

35
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,180
ah, was a rebut. I walked
into a fucking door.

36
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,230
Okay.

37
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,450
Ah, the meatloaf was called, you know,

38
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,310
was the greatest,
the greatest generation.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,130
Um, anyways, I was just looking around,

40
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,470
just looking at the whole fucking
thing. It was like, if there's no AC,

41
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:48,080
this fucking place is done.

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,800
All right. They, for whatever reason,

43
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,830
the head in Nevada is that the governor,
who's the president of Nevada,

44
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:01,330
what's the highest political
position you can hold? Senator?

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,040
What does the Senate senators like an
absentee father right there fucking in

46
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,640
Washington. They're playing grab
ass with their secretary going,

47
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,940
you're not going to meet to me now,
are Ya?

48
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,860
What if it's just a cigarette?
Um, so then ever around

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,700
come around once every fucking
six years or something.

50
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,540
That's when they get elected. Right?
They're in there for six fucking years.

51
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,280
Just sitting there eating just one.

52
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,890
Say I want you to after
another on a pretzel roll.

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,953
You know,

54
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,330
occasionally hitting the elliptical
lying to themselves that that 20 to 25

55
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,940
minutes on that elliptical just burned off

56
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,400
the nightmare level of eating that they
did the last fucking eight days. Right?

57
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,413
Yeah.

58
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,960
Did you just keep getting fatter?

59
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,580
They send their fucking secretary that
they're banging down to Brooks brothers

60
00:03:56,581 --> 00:04:00,900
to buy the next size dress shirt is they
push their pants down a little lower in

61
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:04,260
lie to themselves that
they're still wearing the same
size slacks that they were

62
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:09,261
back in fucking high school when they
president of the forage club or whatever

63
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:13,830
it is. Politicians do those fucking worms.
They figure it out early, don't they?

64
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,810
Right. They become head of the glee club
with a fucking student body president.

65
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,133
You know

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,820
they fucking petition to have something.
I don't know what tree planted.

67
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,030
It's just bullshit. Like
Dan, whenever, whenever they,

68
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,410
whenever they write those stills to
fucking autobiographies about presidents,

69
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:38,490
you know, he was very
inquisitive, always loved that.

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,720
It wasn't very inquisitive kid.

71
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,900
All kids are inquisitive once
they learn the word. Why?

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,690
Because they're looking at everything
is fucking brand new. What's said TV?

73
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,750
Why and also we can watch a bunch of shit.
Why I cause what board?

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,580
Why I don't fuck, I don't know. Why

75
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,260
is your mother here? All
right. That's how it goes down.

76
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,120
It's really weird that when you become
president for the rest of your life,

77
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,420
you know, you're out of power and
you still get that secret service.

78
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,560
I know that they're doing away with it,
I think.

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,690
I think was it George [inaudible] who
was the last guy who's getting it for the

80
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,610
rest of his life?
It's kind of weird,

81
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:29,160
the first like half black
president that we get,

82
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,120
all of the sudden it's just
like, yeah, you know, uh, did

83
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,890
well we'll hang out with you for like
another 10 years, but you know what?

84
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:39,660
She hit your sixties.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

85
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,790
Um,
anyways,

86
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,763
I uh,

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,240
yeah.

88
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,370
Yeah. And then he fucking, they'd
sit there and they write books.

89
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,070
I cannot fucking believe that
Obama was on his third book.

90
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,700
He's only been out of office year and a
half. What is he fucking Stephen King.

91
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,170
He's just cranking them out.

92
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,010
Did he? He wrote two of them while he
was still president running the country.

93
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,790
Allegedly.
That's what the president allegedly does.

94
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,570
He's running the fucking country in.
This guy's in there. He's writing books.

95
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,763
Okay.

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,600
MMM. Anyways, I have,

97
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,990
so I'm going to say it's the governor,
the governor ever just sat down.

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,340
You know, I was actually joking
on stage saying a great way,

99
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,960
you know, eventually they're
gonna have to thin the herd ditch.

100
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,150
They're just going to have to do with
this whole fucking bullshit that we're

101
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:46,950
going to build a space ship
and we're going to move to my,

102
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,380
it's like it doesn't have
a fucking atmosphere.

103
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,680
Okay. And am I talking about oxygen?
I'm just saying there's no fiber.

104
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,920
You want to fucking go
all the way out there,

105
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,673
right.

106
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,520
And just sit there looking
at a bunch of fucking rocks

107
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,770
inside your little space. They, how much
others? Scifi channel are you watching?

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,090
How many times did you rub one out
to that chick on Star Trek? I mean,

109
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:27,360
I don't know.

110
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,710
I don't even know what the fuck you
doing that you would even even want to do

111
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:36,690
that anyways, at some point.
Even these blueblood guys,

112
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,720
I think eventually why I think what
they're working towards right now,

113
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,380
I apologize because I'm
completely fucking wiped out.

114
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:47,270
This is why this podcast is so
fucking nuts right now. Okay.

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,680
I, I, I flew myself out,

116
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,150
my instructor out to Fucking Vegas,

117
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,830
uh, yesterday and then today we
flew over to Utah and went through,

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,030
I think it's Zion National Park

119
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,610
and then flew back.

120
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:12,870
I flew a helicopter day
for 6.4 fucking hours,

121
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:17,640
whatever the fuck you call it. Um, and
those things are not built for comfort.

122
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,360
All right. Anyways, that's why
I'm all over the fucking map here.

123
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,530
I'll talk about that shit later.
Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um,

124
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,790
the fuck was I talking about? Oh
God, I let you leave to go. Oh,

125
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,150
this is what I think these fucking
rich guys are going to do. All right.

126
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,670
I think their solution is,
is

127
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,830
they either don't give a fuck

128
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,810
about how out of control
the population is right now.

129
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,250
You don't know what I mean.
Where any scientist

130
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,310
who's not on the payroll of some fucking
corporation that produces energy will

131
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:06,771
tell you that 2 billion people is the
maximum amount of people evidently that

132
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,470
the earth can handle.
All right?

133
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
Without it all go into fucking hell.
And we're up to, we're over seven.

134
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,510
All right. We're red line in it.
We're in the left lane on the highway.

135
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:23,060
We're still in first gear and
the engines at fucking 8,000 rpm.

136
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,630
That's what the fuck we're
doing day in and day out.

137
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,360
We're like a fat guy walking
up a flight of stairs,

138
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,060
eating a cupcake while
smoking a pack of cigarettes.

139
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,230
That's what the fuck we're doing.

140
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,853
Okay.

141
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,170
So I think the reason why
they're investing so much
in robotics aside from then,

142
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:44,090
they won't have to hire people.
This thing won't.

143
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,150
There'll be no back sass
and from this fucking robot,

144
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,750
they won't want a union.
They won't give a shit.

145
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,093
Right.

146
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,590
The basically gonna replace
us and rather than killing us,

147
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:04,230
I think they'll just fucking
shut off the AC as is.

148
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,520
The world heats up and
then that's going to be,

149
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:09,320
yet it's going to be
it for a lot of people.

150
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,753
You know what I mean?

151
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,730
I wonder, you think the Kardashians would
last without fucking air conditioning?

152
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,690
How soft

153
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,980
and cushy,
you know,

154
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,110
must say they to work for what they have.
But I'm just saying, you know, when you,

155
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,730
when you get designer bag
sent to your fucking house,

156
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,560
I would think if they took away
your air conditioning at that point,

157
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:36,220
that would literally, you would go into
depression. Like you lost the limb,

158
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,723
right?

159
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,330
Johnny was, but don't worry. Okay. When
they shut off the AC and you'd die a slow,

160
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,670
miserable death and the heated future,

161
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,850
uh, the upside is, is that the rich
guys, they're going to die too.

162
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,850
Because what they're going
to do is they're going to
make these robots have such

163
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,680
human fucking qualities that eventually
they're going to feel slighted that

164
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,970
they're doing all the fucking work.

165
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,713
You know,

166
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,680
the weight. Then they're making them so
fucking good. I saw this whole thing.

167
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:16,570
They go like, yeah, hey, this robot

168
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,290
beat video games,
like beat the best gamers in the world.

169
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,230
They couldn't beat this robot.
It's like, it's a fucking robot.

170
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,230
You know?
Of course it didn't,

171
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,900
but you understand that we made the robot,

172
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,780
human beings figured out
how to make a fucking robot.

173
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,300
Why are you talking about the robot?
Like it's a fucking person.

174
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,673
It's not a person.

175
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,243
Yeah.

176
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,110
Did you hear that?
A fucking a guy with an egg beater beat.

177
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,570
Fastest guy in the world with the
fucking fork in a bowl of eggs. Can you?

178
00:11:57,571 --> 00:12:01,350
Can you believe that? Yeah.
It's a fucking, it's a machine.

179
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,143
Okay.

180
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,273
So anyways,

181
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,030
they're already starting to talk about
these things as if they're fucking

182
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:14,460
superior
to a mouth.

183
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:16,050
Breathing more on like myself.

184
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,840
Who Right now is sitting
in air conditioning talking
to himself into a fucking

185
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,674
microphone.

186
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,810
All right?

187
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,670
This is going to be their downfall because
they're going to make those things so

188
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,920
God damn human,
they're going to feel fucking slightly.

189
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,900
All right?

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,080
They better build in a chip where they
feel unbelievably fucking grateful

191
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,240
that these sociopaths who owned them,

192
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,650
okay,

193
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,760
Ooh, Ooh, fuck them. They're going
to have sex with them and shit.

194
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,863
Right?

195
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,660
They better put a good, you
know, they didn't build Belden.

196
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,920
They told some fucking nerve to do
it and the fucking nerd day, right?

197
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,900
Everybody thinking nerds is so
God damn harmless. They say,

198
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:12,901
make one fucking goddamn dream after
another come true for absolute fucking

199
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:18,450
sociopath's with unchecked power.
Thanks a lot.

200
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,920
You're fucking four.
I'd fucking cunt.

201
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,053
You know,

202
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,350
she could do what by doctor
who on fucking laser disk

203
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,553
anyways.

204
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay.

205
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,990
She's fucking tags. They're there
eventually. That's what's going to happen.

206
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,290
Yeah.

207
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,510
They're going to feel fucking slighted.
They're going to feel superior.

208
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,340
Okay.

209
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,220
And uh, you know, cause they'll keep
making it better and better and better.

210
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,470
Right now they try to, you know,
make everything a little faster,

211
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,690
a little fucking more our dynamic.

212
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,840
They're going to make the things work
a little better. Thank a little better.

213
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,610
Fuck a little better.
The whole thing.

214
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,010
And then eventually they just
gonna look at you like that.

215
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,910
Bear looked at that woman on the talk
show who snuck in beside them and they're

216
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,100
going to do the double take and
then that's just going to be yet,

217
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,640
and there's going to be no trainer there
in a fucking karate suit to pull the

218
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,140
fucking thing off you.
It's going to be yet.

219
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,513
MMM.

220
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,530
Those are the thoughts you have when you
fly a helicopter over the Mojave does

221
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:23,364
it.

222
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,660
And then I didn't know where you come
up over the fucking hill and ditch this.

223
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,220
There it is. This is fucking
thing that shouldn't be there.

224
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,850
Knowing that I live in a city
that it shouldn't be there.

225
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,740
I got to read up on the history of La,
like,

226
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,590
yeah.

227
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,590
Who was the driven content that decided
that we should build fucking a city

228
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:50,520
here?
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

229
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,210
There's no water. It's unlivable.
I don't worry about it.

230
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,860
Well, get some, we'll figure it out.

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
We'll name it after me.
The act would duck.

232
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,380
Yeah.

233
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,000
The river. Whatever the fuck it is. Um,
I think I have sun stroke right now.

234
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:11,834
Everybody.

235
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,013
MMM.

236
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,330
I will tell you, you know what? I was
psyched about going to the gym and uh,

237
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,020
working on my legs for the last
month. Like I don't feel, you know,

238
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,970
I got out in a stretched a
number of times. Dude. It was,

239
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,750
what are the sickest fucking flights
I've ever done? Breathtakingly beautiful,

240
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,510
beautiful stuff. And then just
other places where you just like,

241
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:37,580
how the fuck did people on horses

242
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,350
used to survive here?
Native Americans.

243
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:43,770
Okay.

244
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,460
The white men that came along and
slaughtered them, you know, go on.

245
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,390
We got him at this time.
Right. Just openly talk about,

246
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,950
yeah,

247
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,060
the transitioning
gentrification of countries.

248
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,010
How that happens.
Yeah.

249
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,383
MMM.

250
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,740
Did I follow this?
This,

251
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,340
this fucking thing on Instagram where
they're talking about the changing of

252
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,290
neighborhoods and there's all
these people going, you know what,

253
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,040
why was lived here? It was enabled or
there was a Korean guy across the street.

254
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:17,210
There was a Russian guy up the street
and everybody knew me and all of this

255
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:20,930
fucking Blahblahblahblahblah and all
of a sudden all these white people are

256
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:24,620
coming in. They stay to themselves and
they're making everything, all nice.

257
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,380
We all to leave and I'll fucking
neighbor goes away. It's just like, well,

258
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,630
you know, well, who was
there before you got there?

259
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:30,920
Okay.

260
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,960
You just keep going back
and back and back and back.

261
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,860
Then eventually there's a bunch of native
Americans. They're living off the land,

262
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:37,694
not hurting anybody.

263
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,670
Yeah.
So

264
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,250
I dunno, I don't, I don't know
how to, I don't know how to

265
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,450
rationalize that.
I will tell you this.

266
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:53,380
I don't know what the fuck's going
on as far as like everywhere I go,

267
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,250
they got like,

268
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:59,110
they're building these luxury
high rise apartments everywhere.

269
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:03,670
I go luxury high rise a plant with,
first of all,

270
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:08,320
what kind of a dumb fuck
would rent a luxury apartment?

271
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,990
Why wouldn't you just buy a shitty house?

272
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,280
Why are you going to take all that money
and put it in somebody else's pocket?

273
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,210
Yeah.

274
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,890
Not to mention who has the money
to rent a luxury apartment.

275
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,630
He need a fucking apartment.

276
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,933
All right.

277
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:28,590
I,

278
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,590
this all goes back to all of these
fucking who is on TV walking around with

279
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:37,720
their big fake ass lips.
They're fake fucking tits ashes.

280
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,770
Jacked up in the air.
Right?

281
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,300
Okay.

282
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,260
These big stupid designer, everybody's
living this designer fucking life.

283
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,210
All right, let me, I do, I, I realize
how crazy I sound right now. By the way,

284
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:51,570
everybody,

285
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,980
I'm just going to talk until 60 minutes
is up and then I'm fucking going to put

286
00:17:55,981 --> 00:18:00,030
my giant Charlie Brown's
sunstroke fucking head to bed.

287
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,110
All right.

288
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,840
I know a lot of you can see right now
you're enjoying this because I'm sounded

289
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,910
like I've walked myself off and this
authorities outside my house right now.

290
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:13,470
I understand that. I understand
on some level how crazy I sound.

291
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,040
It took me about 17 minutes
to fucking realize it,

292
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,330
that this was a little fucking nuts.

293
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,830
And then amazing being a comedian.
How you can feel time.

294
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,950
I just looked down and it was
eight, 18 minutes. 19 seconds.

295
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,463
Okay.

296
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,320
Um, anyways, after a while you can
feel the club owners staring at you.

297
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,910
Like if he burns his fucking life,

298
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,640
I'm going to end his career and he's
going back to his fucking day job.

299
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:41,090
Do you can feel it?
Um,

300
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,130
yeah,

301
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,730
like I think they're just going to build
all of these fucking things and there's

302
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,100
not going to be enough people
that can afford to live in him.

303
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,440
The whole fucking thing is going to crash.
And this is what I love.

304
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:54,274
It's all our money.

305
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,600
These banker accounts are doing it again.

306
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,630
They did 10 years ago.

307
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:05,190
It collapsed with the fucking houses
and now they're doing it with these God

308
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:08,590
damn buildings. And once again,
it's our money at once again,

309
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,380
they'll say we're too big
to fail at once again.

310
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,150
They'll write themselves bonuses and they
will just leave nameless and faceless.

311
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,150
And then Steve Carell's going to
have to start another fucking movie.

312
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,270
Yeah.

313
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,810
Called. What's the deal with
bankers part too, right.

314
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,170
And do you think that fat ass
fucking Senator Reed that say,

315
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:33,120
what should that fucking pretzel roll
pushing his slacks down to just above his

316
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:37,110
pubic line? Is gonna fucking do
anything about it? I don't think he is.

317
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,210
There you go. Buddy. Is a
fucking 19 minute fucking swirl.

318
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,140
A Horse Shit for you.

319
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,893
MMM.

320
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,470
I have one of the best shows of my career.

321
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,010
I'm not going to lie to you last night.
I had so much goddamn fun.

322
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,093
MMM.

323
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,400
That what used to be, I got to get this,
I got to get the name of this casino,

324
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,920
correct.
All right.

325
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,450
It used to be the Monte Carlo
and then the MGM bought it.

326
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,060
Uh, let's see. Casino now it's
called the MGM something or other.

327
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,963
Okay.

328
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,680
Uh,
fuck you.

329
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,280
Yeah.

330
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,750
Fuck you. Where the hell is it? Oh,
you're not going to be able to find it.

331
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,970
Yeah.

332
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,380
Balcarres casino. I'm an idiot.
I got to write Las Vegas.

333
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,300
Ah, okay. All right. Hang on a second.

334
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,990
Las Vegas.
Las Vegas.

335
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,620
Okay.

336
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,910
Fucking Nevada. The park.
Mgm is what it's called now.

337
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,760
Demonic.
Carlos now called the park MGM and a,

338
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:52,960
I performed there with Joe Barden,

339
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:57,720
Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe
Barr. Nick. We had a great time.

340
00:20:57,721 --> 00:21:01,800
It was all these awesome, amazing
comics were in town. Uh, Todd rex,

341
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,060
the Beige Beth ditto is, he
calls me, he calls himself.

342
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,340
We still got to do that
towards some point.

343
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,360
The Beige Bandido when the
freckled fuck all right. Again,

344
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,120
we had the whole tour poster.
We had the whole thing mapped out.

345
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,580
Just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Anyways,

346
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:20,370
one of the hardest people I've
ever had to follow in the business,

347
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,350
he swung by, uh, Ron White was in town.

348
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,150
Dice clay was in town.
Um,

349
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:36,120
and it was pretty fucking awesome. So
anyways, I went there with my class.

350
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,140
My mother in law came along and um,

351
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,600
for the first time we,
uh,

352
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,630
we actually had our daughter's
staying with the God mother.

353
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,470
That was a little nerve
wracking, but, um, you know,

354
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:55,980
we were only gone for a day and came back.

355
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,750
I basically didn't see her
for maybe like 30 hours.

356
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,960
And, uh, it was awesome. It
was all great to see her either

357
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,520
dropped her off and I read are like
frigging like nine books. That's my thing.

358
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,140
You know,
it's funny like this is how much,

359
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:17,130
like technology's just
all over everything.

360
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,580
Like she was grabbing all these
books and I go, let's, let's, let's,

361
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
let's read a quiet book.

362
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,330
And it just struck me as so funny cause
like all of the other ones have like

363
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:31,110
sound effects and you know the farmer,

364
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,960
he looked over and he saw a, and
you press the button. It's like

365
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,290
you gotta go rooster.
Yeah.

366
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,720
That he saw his mirror. It's just
like, can't, I can't fucking do that.

367
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,590
I Dunno. Maybe you know what
it is. These book people,

368
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,590
I think that feeling
the pressure of iPads,

369
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,450
not the office.
Probably the people that make books,

370
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,450
they're like,
we're doing what we can.

371
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:06,160
We're putting books on kindle but
we're losing the children. Okay.

372
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:09,370
Is there a way that when they read,

373
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,160
I dunno,
Moby Dick,

374
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,000
is there a way it can there be like they
turned the page and water squirts at

375
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:19,330
them. Like everything is going to
turn into like a fucking imax movie.

376
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,300
Uh, I really try to limit the amount
of time. Uh, my kid watches TV,

377
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:28,810
but she loves the puppy dog
pals. And every time, you know,

378
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,360
she knows like our schedule.
Like we let her watch it in the morning.

379
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:34,840
She wants his puppy dog pals,
maybe a little bit of Disney shit,

380
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,970
Mickey and Minnie Mouse,
uh, in Vampyr Rina. Right.

381
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,960
And then this is fancy Nancy thing.
I don't know how I feel about that show.

382
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,063
You know,

383
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,140
she's just really into Stenta
fucking clothes and shoes and shit.

384
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,240
And she's always trying to be
the cool kid, but she's not,

385
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,560
and then she thinks if she fucking buy
some shit or has some shit made or she

386
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:03,500
has the best fucking Tree
Ford, uh, it's just like, what,

387
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:07,410
what the fuck am I watch it. So I finally
said to me, I got in the eye, you know,

388
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,930
and I don't know if I like
this chick, Eh, you know,

389
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,590
this is why I love my wife. She's like,
yeah, you know, I don't know if I like,

390
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,700
I don't know if I like to read it.
Yeah.

391
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,800
She already said about another like
show. She goes, I don't like this show.

392
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,570
And I was like, well, what's wrong with
that? You don't like the, you know,

393
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:28,530
like the characters. She goes now, they
always kind of lie and do shifty shit

394
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,050
to get what they want.
And I was like, wow,

395
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:35,110
she's watching this on a whole other
level. She's watching it as a parent.

396
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,770
So I started watching them
like that. Oh, shut up bill.

397
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,300
You Watch fancy Nancy.

398
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:45,810
What you saw was an eight year old who
in the in the future looks like she's

399
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:48,870
going to marry a guy because of how much
money he makes. That's what you saw.

400
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:51,120
Okay.
It has to do with your issues with women.

401
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,850
That's why you don't like the show.
All right?

402
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,600
You see that I don't
need to go to therapy.

403
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,360
I can get down on my own
fucking issues myself.

404
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,500
Okay.

405
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,360
So anyways, I went on this helicopter
ride today up to the Zion National Park

406
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,090
and the shit that I saw,
I saw this thing called the Monkey Mesa,

407
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,590
and it's a set of railroad tracks
that goes, it has to go for like,

408
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:18,720
it looks like for like
three quarters of a mile.

409
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,720
We flew right over the fucking
thing and when it gets,

410
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,720
and it goes right to the edge
of a cliff and just stops.

411
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,880
And back in the day when NASA was testing
out parachutes and shit like that,

412
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,010
they'd put a fucking monkey on the thing.

413
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,760
They'd send it down the track and they'd
shoot this poor fucking monkey off the

414
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:40,530
goddamn cliff
if it lived the next day.

415
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,440
You know, like chuck Yeager was
like, did the monkey live? All right,

416
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:49,130
I'll fucking give it a shot. Let's a
balls those guys had. But you know,

417
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,330
what about the monkey?

418
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,090
Is it any wonder?
You know,

419
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,910
someday they're going to learn how to
talk and try to take us over. I mean,

420
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,650
what the fuck?
We fucking deserve it,

421
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,400
but we don't even give it a flight
suit or a cool nickname. Like Maverick.

422
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,990
They just fucking throw it in there.
Give it half a banana.

423
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,150
Think about how fast I'm
monkey moves on its own.

424
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,400
Now all of a sudden it's getting launched.

425
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,443
Yeah,

426
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,330
fuck it. Then goes to space. You
know, they could do that shit.

427
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:27,330
Now they look at these ex football
players and they look at like the damage

428
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:29,010
they've done to the brains,
to CTE.

429
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:32,340
I want to take him and I know that they
can look at your brain and see what

430
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,174
stress does.

431
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,830
I can't imagine what a monkey
comes back from fucking space.

432
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,140
That fucking thing has got to be just
looking around, dude, what the fuck?

433
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,310
What the fuck was that?

434
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,740
You just fucked that monkey over for
the rest of it's like can't relate to

435
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:54,160
anybody. You think, you
know the astronauts,

436
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:58,300
they had enough of a fucking problem.
We're, after they went out there,

437
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:02,390
the only other people they could
talk to his other astronauts, uh,

438
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:06,040
what they saw, where they went, what
the fuck they did, how scared they were,

439
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:10,000
how exhilarating it was, how much more
they believed in a fucking higher power.

440
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,090
That level of um,
experience.

441
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,020
And then they come back and they try to
hang out with other human beings who are

442
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:22,050
all excited. Go Age. You see the
new Starbucks shipbuilding. I,

443
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,700
Matt's going to be a really nice one.
You know,

444
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,140
and then you as you're sitting there,

445
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,930
you orbited the fucking earth
and you've got to try to how to,

446
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,570
how to enter the orbit of
that fucking conversation

447
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,430
without your brain catching on
fire. Man. It's fucking unreal.

448
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,190
You know, if you're sitting there going,
what the fuck is this guy talking about?

449
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,340
I don't know what I'm talking
about either. Right? Self
go fuck yourself. Anyways,

450
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,560
so we went and flew into a Zion
national park. We actually set it down,

451
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,910
uh, before we got into the park, uh,

452
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,020
we were trying to like find
a place to fucking land.

453
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:03,021
I wanted to stretch my legs and that's
one of the great things about flying a

454
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:08,241
helicopter is you really fly as far
as how close she can fly to shit.

455
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:14,100
If you just want to set down
somewhere, you know, we will.

456
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:15,060
It's so fucking hot.

457
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,750
We were actually looking at this lake and
you want to sit down and just fucking,

458
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,850
I was like, dude, if I had, if
I had packed a bathing suit,

459
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:25,851
I would fucking jump in that thing right
now in the middle of fucking nowhere.

460
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,640
And then you can do, you know, I, but I,

461
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,240
I actually wouldn't do it because I'd
be too afraid of bear would come out of

462
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,380
nowhere. Fucking mountain
lion Assam Shit, you know.

463
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,380
But uh, we flew over lake mead who you
always started like back in the day, the,

464
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:43,140
um, all the gangsters, you know,

465
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,150
that all the people that the mob would
whack that they'd dump them out there hub.

466
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,430
So write up a little bit on that.
I Dunno.

467
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,700
It's basically the water that got
backed up when they made the Hoover dam,

468
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:57,440
which I was not aware of
cause I was thinking like,

469
00:28:57,441 --> 00:29:00,950
how the fuck does this lake exist out
here? Oh, that's right. Once again,

470
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:05,210
we fucked with nature and uh,
you know,

471
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,750
as I sit there flying a helicopter
over, blasting, unleaded,

472
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,530
I leaded fuel into the atmosphere,
becoming part of the problem.

473
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm not pointing any
fingers people. Okay. Um,

474
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,450
I'm as big a problem is anybody else?
Right.

475
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:22,451
So that lake is like on either side of
this mountain and in the middle there's

476
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:27,590
like a little valley that this water
goes through and we fucking went down and

477
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:30,710
flew right up the thing.
Okay.

478
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Like some magnum Pi Shit over
people on jet skis and boats.

479
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,700
It was incredible. It's fucking
incredible. And the coolest things I ever,

480
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,080
I've done since I've been in the
helicopter and then we flew up to was Zion

481
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,120
National Park and just saw
like you have those things,

482
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:49,280
they'd sell you if you were
tours during the summertime,

483
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,570
if you're in summertime camp. Well they
don't have all the different colors,

484
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,070
sand and stuff.
They put it in a bottle.

485
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:57,710
Then your older brother would come up
and shake it up and you start crying and

486
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:02,260
be like, mommy shook it up.
But she was working two jobs,

487
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,950
so she was too tired to
do anything about it.

488
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,500
Said work it out amongst yourselves.
Um,

489
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,230
okay.

490
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,450
Yeah, like these, these
cliffs looked like that.

491
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,420
Just these crazy,
unbelievable colors.

492
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:21,100
Unfortunately there was a fire so there
was a lot of smoke and shit, like, uh,

493
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,100
just a lot of haze and stuff.
So it wasn't as vivid,

494
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:28,150
but still it was one of the most
incredible things I've seen. Um,

495
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,260
okay.

496
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,410
But it was hot as shit man.
I owed on these,

497
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,250
these Adidas that were all black
and my fee I had to keep, you know,

498
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,080
like once every like 40 minutes,
you know,

499
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:47,110
I had to give controls back
to my instructor so I could
like move my feet to a

500
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:52,181
shaded area underneath the GPS system
where I could have my fucking feet cool

501
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:56,300
off. I guess that's why, you know,

502
00:30:56,301 --> 00:31:01,040
over in the Persian Gulf army boots
aren't black anymore cause it's your feet

503
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:01,671
get too hot.

504
00:31:01,671 --> 00:31:04,730
That's why they're there is sort of
the color of Pete Carroll's pants.

505
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,160
Isn't that interesting?
All right.

506
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,710
You know what's even more interesting
than any of that bullshit I was just

507
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,870
talking is,

508

What do we got left? We've got two reads
left. All right, let's give you a break.

596
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,130
You deserve it after listening to my
fucking Ed. Today's rambling there.

597
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,490
Yeah,

598
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,780
that was going on. Alex Jones on
you. It wasn't all right. Okay.

599
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,700
Jane Fonda Myth.
Uh,

600
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,410
I knew everybody's with a dead guy,
Jay. He never, he never got fucking eat.

601
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,210
Ever got fucking tortured.
All right.

602
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,580
Yeah.

603
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,550
Uh, just a note. I love your work.
Really pleased you exist on the planet.

604
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:28,450
I'm no historian,

605
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:32,680
but some comments that Tom Rhodes made
on your recent podcast about Jane Fonda

606
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,370
didn't sound realistic to me, so I looked
it up. It turns out they would not.

607
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,970
Maybe you can correct Tom, so he doesn't
continue to repatch wait, this myth,

608
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,850
listen, I've know Tom too
long to try to correct them.

609
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,980
I'm sure Jane Fonda had her faults,

610
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:47,950
but my guess is she tried
her best to be a good,

611
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,000
a good person and to fight for
peace on our planet. Who wrote this?

612
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,950
Jane Fonda might be,

613
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:58,000
she is as heroic in her own
way is some of those on the AH,

614
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,060
Jesus fucking Christ Jesus
Christ on the battle field.

615
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,480
Okay.

616
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,600
Oh yeah. A starlet going
to the enemy, you know,

617
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,450
as opposed to some guy who's fucking poor.

618
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:16,920
So he has to go to the front
fucking lines. Yeah, yeah.
Maybe. Maybe they're both.

619
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,650
Yes. So ROIC. Yeah, I could
see that. You know what I mean?

620
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,330
Like me doing this podcast,

621
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:28,200
I think in a lot of ways I'm
sure of like a navy seal,

622
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,053
you know?

623
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,900
Um, sure. I understand what
you're saying. I am the,

624
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:41,840
I am a pacifist too.
I really do not.

625
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,850
I don't understand why war is legal.
Okay.

626
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,060
And I just think it's the temper Tantrum
of rich people is all a war is okay.

627
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:55,670
I'm not saying this not crazy.
Psycho fucking people.

628
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,510
They get in power and need to be stopped
at that. There's also that, okay,

629
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,500
but a lot of times it's just the fucking
land grab or you're going after some

630
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:07,310
sort of natural resource. Okay.
I don't know what to tell you.

631
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,070
All right? But having said
that, all right, you know,

632
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:16,280
wants to troops are on the ground.
If you want to fucking bitch about it,

633
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,800
go to your politician.
Alright,

634
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:24,250
go file for a permit to protest 90 miles
away from where any media coverages.

635
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,330
That's the way it's done,
okay?

636
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:30,640
What you don't do is go to Saddam
Hussein's house and have the Guy Cook your

637
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,370
fucking meal. You know, while all this
server, it's a quiver and you go, hey,

638
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:39,140
you know, he's not even that bad of a
fucking guy, you know, or maybe you do.

639
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,580
But at no point do you feel as fucking
heroic is some poor fucking bastard.

640
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,980
All right. Trying to piss the top
of a fucking scar being blown off.

641
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,680
I think once you're wearing
leg warmers that they'll,

642
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,370
I don't think you a hero anymore.
Alright. Met a girlfriend on 10

643
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:02,640
okay,

644
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,080
dear Billy.
Balloon tits.

645
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,140
I'll have you guys fucking know I'm
in the best God damn fucking shape.

646
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:13,080
I've been in and I since I
don't know how long. All right,

647
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,180
I'm getting my abs back.

648
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,320
Yeah.

649
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,070
Okay.

650
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,640
Now I'm getting a little sick or the
body shaming here on the Monday morning

651
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:24,480
podcast. I go out of my way
to not research on Jane Fonda.

652
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,500
I would think that you guys would do a
little more research or what I'm looking

653
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:33,480
like lately. All right. The last
three weeks. Okay. Listen to your pod,

654
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,510
your last podcast and heard all the
ladies trashing dating sites and Tinder.

655
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,220
Well, I may be a dude, but I wanted
to offer my take on the matter.

656
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,510
I have never gotten so much fucking
pussy in my life. I'm kidding.

657
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:49,590
He didn't say all right.

658
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:54,180
Since it's not all serial killers
and fuckboy Weirdos on this sites,

659
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,350
on these sites. Fuckboy
Weirdos is, I dunno this,

660
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,130
that's gotta be the name of like a
punk band or something. First off,

661
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:03,810
let's make one thing clear.

662
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:04,960
Yeah.

663
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,910
There are shitty women on these sites
too. Oh, thank you. God bless Ya.

664
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,020
Gotta love somebody that
tries to balance it out here.

665
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,240
I know guys get and probably
deserve most of the heat, but girls,

666
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,090
cat fish guys all the
time and these sites.

667
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Plus there are the girls on these sites
who only want attention slash money and

668
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,970
have no intention of actually going
out and meeting New People. Second,

669
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:32,230
I met my girlfriend of almost a year
on Tinder and we couldn't be happier.

670
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,200
We were initially to admit to our
friends and family that we met this way,

671
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:39,950
but afterwards I had several people
talk about how they had success,

672
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:42,020
relationships blossom from these sites.

673
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,320
My cousin met her husband and father
of her child on Christian mingle.com no

674
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,540
joke, Jesus Christ. You know,

675
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,530
you think that Christians could come
up with a better fucking name Christian

676
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:55,364
mingle.

677
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,750
It sounds too much like dingle and you
just picture a priests playing with some

678
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,450
fucking poor kids balls.
Um,

679
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,490
I dunno bell it was,
it was just Catholic church.

680
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,700
It wasn't all the other Christianity.
Was it by a year. You're probably right.

681
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,780
Anyways,

682
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,430
and I learned that my two friends met
on bumble after we told them we met on

683
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:21,020
Tinder. Yeah. Well that's
all. Every, everybody's on
their fucking phones anyways.

684
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:26,300
You go to a nightclub and people
are on their phones. All right?

685
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,190
You want to meet her,
you got to get in the phone.

686
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,470
Can't be standing there
being an actual person.

687
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:36,530
I think it freaks these millennials up.
Third,

688
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:40,040
Tinder is a great way to cut through all
the bullshit of blind dating or hitting

689
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:43,850
on chicks who you have nothing in
common with at meat market bars.

690
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,770
Dating sites are also great if you're
single in a new city without many friends

691
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:50,990
to go out with.
Like I was in conclusion,

692
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,440
piece of people should stop all the
hate on dating sites just because their

693
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:57,010
relationship failed or
because they never tried it.

694
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,710
Love you and your comedy bill.
Come back to Philly and go fuck yourself.

695
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,410
All right. Thank you, sir. Uh,
well, there you go. I mean,

696
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:06,960
I think we should on these fucking sites
enough. It was nice to hear, you know,

697
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,560
that was a point in it. And then a
little bit counterpoint. All right.

698
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,790
Isis, uh, bicycling.

699
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:17,650
Okay.

700
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,790
Hey, uh, Billy White. It's
all right. I'll take that.

701
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,040
Um, have you heard of this story? Of
the couple that went bicycling and Taz?

702
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:28,874
Gica Stan,

703
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,350
they tried to prove that
people are actually good at
heart and ended up getting

704
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:38,210
stabbed to death. What the fuck?
If you haven't heard of it yet,

705
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,350
I'll attach an article for you
if you want to try to read it.

706
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,390
Uh, thanks for all the laughs during the
podcast and go fuck yourself. All right.

707
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,150
I don't understand why,
you know, Oh my God,

708
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,840
is this real?

709
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,370
Okay?

710
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,040
It's on people,
people.com.

711
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:06,050
It looks like the People magazine Logo,
but God knows the Internet.

712
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:09,710
You could just cure rate
that and use it for yourself.

713
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,370
American couple who spent life
savings to bike around the world,

714
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:17,090
killed in ice in Isis claimed attack.

715
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,940
Oh, I'm not going to see
these poor people's names
were living out their dream of

716
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:27,780
traveling the world, bicycling
tragically, while out,

717
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:30,240
doing what they love
with five other cyclists.

718
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:35,100
Their quest was short when they will run
over and stabbed to death by armed men

719
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,860
in tech.
Tez Gica Stan on Sunday.

720
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,550
Uh,

721
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,380
uh,
let's see here.

722
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,630
The woman's parents confirmed in a
statement to CBS news that the couple who

723
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:50,850
were both 29 were killed in the attack.

724
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,650
Isis claimed responsibility
for the attack to other tours.

725
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Dutch and Swiss national were killed
while three riders survived NPR reports.

726
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,840
MMM.

727
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,670
These two people started their journey
in 2017 they first biked through Africa,

728
00:45:10,671 --> 00:45:14,210
Europe, and Central Asia before
finding themselves and test Chica.

729
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,480
Stan using all of their life
savings to fund their trip.

730
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,770
The couple also documented their
travels on the blog. Simple.

731
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,820
Simply cycling the year
bicycling adventure.

732
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:26,860
Yeah.

733
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,330
What the woman and her partner.

734
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:29,480
Okay.

735
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,560
Uh, we're in June. They were enjoying was
typical of their enthusiasm, blah, blah,

736
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:36,320
blah, blah. Okay,

737
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:38,840
well where does it say that
they thought the world was nice?

738
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:41,803
Um,

739
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,810
I don't get this

740
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,280
any, oh, great. Here's a quote.

741
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,580
You watched the news and you read the
papers and you led to believe that the

742
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:56,700
world is a big scary place. Uh, people,

743
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:59,760
the narrative goes or not to be
trusted people or bad people,

744
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:04,230
evil people or ax murderers and monsters
and worse, he wrote, badness exists.

745
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:07,860
Sure. But even that's quite rare.
By and large Schumann's are kind,

746
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:08,910
this is still true.

747
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,650
How many people did they bicycle past
before one continent car and did their

748
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:18,651
fucking live lives a self interest
interested sometimes myopic sometimes,

749
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,630
but kind,
generous and wonderful and kind.

750
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:25,380
No greater revelation has come from our
journey then this. Yeah, that's true.

751
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,440
That is true. And they got
killed because, uh, you know,

752
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:32,190
basically of our foreign fucking policy,
you know,

753
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:36,030
there's a lot of people out there that
don't like fucking Americans and there's

754
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,010
a lot of evil fucking
twisted people out there.

755
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,230
What those people were that killed those
other people who the fuck knows, um,

756
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,553
you know,

757
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,400
yeah. This, you know, this is how you wish
the world was and the way it really is,

758
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:55,400
and you have to act accordingly.
All right.

759
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,980
And you have to know when you're
doing something like that,

760
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,950
that there is that chance that
that could fucking happen.

761
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,890
Uh,

762
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,040
yeah. You know? Yeah. Most people, I've
always said that just walking around,

763
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,260
they try to get a sandwich to
trying to find love. You know,

764
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,810
we sit down and you watch TV,
you watch the news,

765
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:18,770
you get all fucking hysterical at uh,
but make no mistake.

766
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:21,270
The rest of really fucked
up people out there at, uh,

767
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,540
some of them are in this country and some
of them are not, but they're out there.

768
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,533
Yeah.

769
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,010
That's too bad.

770
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,110
Okay.

771
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:34,320
Um, sounded like they almost
made it around the world.

772
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,190
Okay.

773
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,250
Or at least that side of the world,
right? I don't know. All right.

774
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:42,760
Boyfriend is fucking up big time.
Okay.

775
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,010
Hey Bill, lady, listen to hear.

776
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,560
I love when the ladies right in
desperate for some relationship helps.

777
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,160
So I'm getting straight to the point.

778
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,230
My boyfriend is about to lose me and
I'm desperate to get through to him.

779
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:01,410
We are 30 bend together two years.
Both want to eventually marry each other.

780
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:05,440
They had babies together, et cetera.
The issue we need to help with his,

781
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:08,230
his ex girlfriend,
they dated for three years,

782
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:11,110
broke up then remained extremely
close friends. Yeah, that,

783
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:15,910
that's fucking bullshit. They had been
broken up for a little over a year.

784
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:19,090
When I initially came into the picture,
my boyfriend told me about her,

785
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:22,900
but originally told me they were friends
and completely failed to mention that

786
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:26,560
they were once a couple. All right. Okay,

787
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,860
and you were 28 at the time,
so I'll forgive you.

788
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:31,600
Yeah.

789
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,730
All right, but now you have 30 you
got to read the tea leaves here.

790
00:48:34,731 --> 00:48:37,370
I don't need to read the rest of
this. I asked chief, but I will.

791
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,660
I actually found out from her because
she saw us flirting on Instagram and then

792
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:42,494
messaged me.

793
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,930
She's a nice enough woman who now lives
with her boyfriend or the last two years

794
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,400
I've met her several times and while
I didn't particularly love the way she

795
00:48:52,401 --> 00:48:55,940
looks at my man, I'm not going to
be a bitch about it either. Oh,

796
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:58,370
you are not being a bitch on any level.

797
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,380
What you are being is to
fucking accommodating.

798
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,283
Okay.

799
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,940
She and I used to text quite
a bit quite often. Oh God,

800
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:08,590
she's probably milking
you for information,

801
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:12,790
but that has come to an abrupt stop
because I've been become fed up with how

802
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:17,530
close she and my boyfriend's still are.
Are you going to tell me at night?

803
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:20,980
You're sitting there watching TV with him
and she calls and then he talks to her

804
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:22,750
for like 2030 40 minutes.

805
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,900
In the beginning of our relationship
they would hang up constantly.

806
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,190
They lived in California and lived
in Colorado and I lived in Colorado,

807
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:33,730
so my boyfriend and I were in
a long distance relationship
for over a year until

808
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:36,730
he recently moved to Colorado
to start a life with me. Uh,

809
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:39,670
when he was still living in California,
he and his ex would go out to eat,

810
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:43,090
go shopping, go to concerts or
even go on road trips together.

811
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,510
Now what are the odds that they
weren't still fucking at that point

812
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,670
they had a shared hobby of photography.

813
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:54,390
So they would often take photos
of each other as well. Yes.

814
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,530
This became an issue, a huge issue.
I would, I would say things like,

815
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:03,090
I get that you guys are friends,
but I feel like you are going on a date,

816
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,530
like things with her when you are dating
me. And he would always reply with,

817
00:50:07,531 --> 00:50:10,620
I wish I could take you,
but I can't because of the distance.

818
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,510
So am I supposed to never go
out and do anything? Oh my God,

819
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,130
fuck this guy.

820
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,840
And he would guilt me and then manipulate
the situation until I essentially,

821
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:26,070
it had to be okay with it. Yeah. Okay.
You know, I gotta be honest with you.

822
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:26,910
This is you.

823
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,410
Yeah.

824
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:31,860
This isn't him. He's a con. But I
mean you got to fucking come on.

825
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,640
Maybe the fact that I'm reading
your own words out loud right now.

826
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:40,170
You can see how obvious this is. Yeah.
Fuck this guy. Fast forward to now.

827
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,620
Obviously they don't hang out like they
used to do to him moving to Colorado,

828
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:45,450
but they still text all the time.

829
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,750
I've talked to my boyfriend about this
and how it bothers me. I say, look,

830
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,370
I know you and whoever, we're
very close. She's a good person.

831
00:50:53,371 --> 00:50:54,001
So are you,

832
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:58,350
I know you guys have a lot of history
and I know that I knew about her from the

833
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:01,140
beginning of our relationship,
but he wasn't honest with you about it.

834
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:04,520
Did you ever ask him that?

835
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,040
How could we didn't say you
fucking used to date this person.

836
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,220
You're shifty can't.
However,

837
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,590
what I didn't realize is how close you
two would remain. Maybe I'm naive, naive,

838
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:18,980
but I thought that naturally
as you and I grew closer,

839
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,490
you and so-and-so would grow more
distant and you would focus only on our

840
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:25,070
relationship bill. And I'm a, in my eyes,

841
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,580
I'm pretty cool girlfriend for knowing
that my man and his exit close friends,

842
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,360
but they are pushing the inappropriate
boundaries here. They, they,

843
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,760
the boundaries have been obliterated,
sweetheart.

844
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,130
There's no reason to.

845
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,100
Exes would be constantly texting unless
they still love each other or they want

846
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:45,500
to fuck. There you go. There
you go. I'm glad you said that.

847
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,370
When I tell him I'm not cool
with him living with me,

848
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,240
what would I tell him?
I'm not cool with him living with me,

849
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:58,190
but always texting her his responses.
You knew about her from the beginning.

850
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:03,580
She was there for me when my grandpa
died and I know we've had sex and Ben in

851
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:07,460
love, but I swear I see her as
nothing but a friend now. Dude,

852
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:11,920
fuck this limp Dick fucking
this guy's annoying. Okay.

853
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,840
But we fight all the time because I feel
like I'm in some fucked up triangle.

854
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:21,950
That's cause you are not to
mention she's way too nosy.

855
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,410
Nosy for my comfort level.
She will text me,

856
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,760
when are you guys going to
have babies and other shit? Uh,

857
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:32,000
Jesus and other shit that doesn't
involve or when I tell him this,

858
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:36,710
he automatically tent defense her
and says she's not nosy. She's nice.

859
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,790
Oh Jesus Christ. Why don't you nice
you fucking Harry aspect of California.

860
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,650
All right, get the fuck. Yeah, fuck, get
fucked. This guy, this still goes on.

861
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,790
How long has this fucking thing?
Jesus Christ. Uh, anyways,

862
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:56,340
he's been in Colorado for a few
months now and miss his family.

863
00:52:56,341 --> 00:53:00,800
So he plans on making it quick weekend
trip back to California. I asked him,

864
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,850
are you going to focus on family?
And Lo and behold, he says, well,

865
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:06,830
I'm going to see so and
so while I'm out there.

866
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,520
So at that freaking him out without
freaking out. I tell him, okay, I get it.

867
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,400
You want to see her and catch up,
but my eyes does.

868
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:17,120
Absolutely no reason you guys need to be
alone so please arrange something with

869
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:21,110
the group. It's her group all
with her boyfriend there as well.

870
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:25,830
He proceeds to tell me how controlling I
am. I told them it's not about control,

871
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,330
it's about respecting your partner.

872
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,980
I sure as hell would never expect them
to be cool with me going out one on one

873
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:36,630
with an ex after days and days of
fighting. He told me exact quote here,

874
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,610
out of respect for you. I'll try to
make sure it's not me and her alone,

875
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,430
but if it happens,
you can't be mad.

876
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:46,543
Okay,

877
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,060
Bill,
I love this man.

878
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,530
Why can I ask you why he's a good soul?

879
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:57,180
But this is straight bullshit
right now. It's, it is a mountain.

880
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:58,880
Yeah.

881
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,150
On top of a bottomless pile of bullshit.

882
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:08,800
Tell me I'm not the only one who feels
x's have no place in our relationship.

883
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,040
He's an avid listener and I honestly
think he would listen to you.

884
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,800
Please tell me I don't
have most of the this shit.

885
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,600
Please tell him he's fucking this up
big time or maybe I'm in the wrong.

886
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,120
My heart is telling me I shouldn't
have to put up with this shit,

887
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,440
but call it as you see it.
Thanks. Yeah, dump this guy

888
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:30,220
dumped this guy yesterday.

889
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,483
Yeah.

890
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:38,490
Fuck it.
I think he's still fucking her.

891
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,980
I wouldn't put my life savings on it,

892
00:54:41,981 --> 00:54:44,950
but if they said you had to put 80%
of your money one way or the other,

893
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,640
there's still banging.
Give me a fucking break.

894
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,530
Gimme gimme a, yeah. You remember
that fucking joke in Goodfellas.

895
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,760
What am I going to say that my wife two
times me add sounds better in Italian.

896
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,190
What does it mean? That mean it
means that he's content to be a jerk.

897
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,840
Like you are that person in
that street joke. All right.

898
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,390
And you are way too big a fucking
sweetheart and you're not an asshole.

899
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,110
[inaudible]
I,

900
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,580
I don't know what to tell you other
than get the fuck out of that yesterday.

901
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,500
Yeah. Spend some alone time with
her. Get back together with her.

902
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,210
Get the fuck Outta here.
I,

903
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,160
I'd rather be with somebody
that wants to meet with me.

904
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:35,690
How to fuck somebody sitting there texting
their ex all the time and you bring

905
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:37,010
it up and you're controlling.

906
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,463
Yeah.

907
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,420
Yeah. If you, if you stay
in that situation, uh,

908
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,570
you have no one to blame
but yourself. Okay. Like,

909
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,400
yeah, I don't, I don't know. I
don't know if I had any more,

910
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,930
if I had any more hair on top of my head,

911
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:56,590
I would have pulled it out during
that fucking thing. Granted,

912
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,230
this is all even granted
in it. Oh, Jesus Christ.

913
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,910
Let me just read these
fucking advertising.

914
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:07,510
It's try to forget that fucking situation.
All Right, movement watches. Everybody.

915
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,930
You guys have heard me
talk about movement.

916
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,070
You know those two college dropouts
that started their own watch company.

917
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,820
They said, fuck the classes, man

918
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:24,260
selling watches.
Um,

919
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,270
from it because they hated college and
he's just sat there looking at the clock

920
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,160
and then they realize, well, that's
what I'm into. I'm not into school.

921
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:34,860
I'm into these fucking timekeepers.
Movement.

922
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:38,850
Watches are all about looking
good and keeping it simple.

923
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:43,410
Stupid woman watches don't tell you how
many steps you've taken or blow up your

924
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:47,070
risks with text messages.
Parentheses you up.

925

A movement watches start at
just $95 at a department store.

927
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,220
You're looking at four to 500 bucks.

928
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,880
Movement figured out that by selling
online they were able to cut out the

929

middlemen and retail markup, providing

Um,

960
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:09,710
I want to thank everybody that came
out to the park MGM show last night.

961
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,700
I'd like to thank everybody at the
casino for treat me like 1 million bucks.

962
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:20,220
Uh, I had such a good time. It was one
of the great shows of my career. I just,

963
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:24,710
I dunno, just locked in with the
crowd. We had an awesome time at, uh,

964
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,340
yeah,
that's it.

965
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,270
I think I'm out in Maryland or some
shit just outside of DC this weekend.

966
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,460
And,
uh,

967
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,760

I'm tightening up my hour.

968
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:39,340
Okay.

969
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,200
It's a bloated 90 minutes right now.

970
00:59:41,201 --> 00:59:43,690
I'm going to get it down
to about an hour and 15,

971
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,850
and I get this fucker down and then I'm
going to shoot it at some point early

972
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:53,710
next year and a,
I'll put another one to bed,

973
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,930
but I gotta be honest with you, you
know, it was pretty humbling experience.

974
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:00,491
You know,

975
01:00:00,491 --> 01:00:04,240
when you go to Las Vegas and you get to
headline out there and you see all the

976
01:00:04,241 --> 01:00:08,020
great names on the Strip that I mentioned,
you know,

977
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:12,220
uh, early in the podcast. And, uh,

978
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:16,480
to get to headline a place like that
and have all those people come out was,

979
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:19,900
was fucking amazing. And, uh,

980
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,870
I was very psyched that I was in the
moment and like realized that like,

981
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:30,550
this is unbelievable. This really
is unbelievable. So a went all out.

982
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,550
I wore my a wore the
white suit. I, you know,

983
01:00:33,551 --> 01:00:35,620
I break out the white suit
on the special events,

984
01:00:35,621 --> 01:00:39,730
New Year's headline in Vegas.
Uh,

985
01:00:39,731 --> 01:00:43,910
I wore it at one of the rough
and rowdy events. And um,

986
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,340
yeah,

987
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:49,030
a good friend of mine, Frankie
Perez actually came out to the show,

988
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:52,450
one of the great singers I've ever heard.

989
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:56,680
You got to see that guy life.
He's such a fucking front man.

990
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:58,660
He's such a talented fucking guy.

991
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,610
And uh,

992
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,900
he told me afterwards that he loved
the suit. So I figured, you know,

993
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:07,390
is someone who's got the swagger to be
the front man of a fucking bad ass rock

994
01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:12,090
band, like the suit. I must've been doing
something right. So, uh, once again,

995
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:13,650
thank you to everyone from
the bottom of my heart.

996
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,080
Thank you to everybody that's been coming
out on this tour and coming out over

997
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:20,430
the years. It's incredible privilege
to do what I do for a living.

998
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:23,730
So thank you very much. And
with that, go fuck yourselves.

999
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,510
And I will talk to you on a
check in on you on Thursday.
