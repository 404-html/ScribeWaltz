1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,170
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,190
just before Friday,

3
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:09,420
Monday morning podcast and
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,560
How's it going?
As you can hopefully immediately tell,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,260
especially after I just pushed
that button. I um, I forgot,

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,070
I didn't forget my recording equipment.

7
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,740
I'm having a problem
with one of the cords.

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,400
I can't tell if the cord got stepped
on and it's fucked up or the Jack to my

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,450
computer's messed up.

10
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:32,451
But I've learned in life to not force
things because you just make a bad

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,680
situation a little worse.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,110
So I'm just kind of to record this
one like this and maybe Monday,

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,000
cause I'm on the road right now. I'm out
here in Nashville, Tennessee, Nashville,

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,983
Tennessee,

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,850
home with the Grand Ole Opry and that
fucking [inaudible] river that overflows

16
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,570
in the evil looking building downtown.
Other than that, wonderful people,

17
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,400
great food and all that type of shit.
Um,

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,430
I'm out here for one
day and one day on week.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,010
I know you guys probably think,
well what the fuck bill,

20
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:07,150
you didn't advertise it on your goddamn
website. Are you doing a stand up show?

21
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,120
I am not,
what I am doing is a,

22
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:15,121
I'm doing a panel thing for
f is for family with uh,

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,960
the Great Mike Price.

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,130
Cocreator co creator of the show from
other Simpsons were doing like a live

25
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:24,940
thing where they show an episode and
then we answer some questions, um,

26
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,970
hosted by Russell Peters and
it's going to be on Xm Sirius.

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,590
I don't know what channel of course,
cause I'm a moron,

28
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,420
but that's basically what I'm doing here.

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,900
And then I go off to Calgary
tomorrow morning, Calgary,

30
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,570
Edmonton and then Seattle. So, oh,

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,520
I got some stories for you. I hope these
levels are okay. I did my best with them.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,130
Um,
this was my plane ride out to Nashville,

33
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:54,070
so we wrote all day and then,
uh,

34
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,800
I took the red eye out and um,

35
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,150
okay.

36
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,600
The dude who sat next to me on
the fucking plane, God bless him,

37
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:04,660
but he's one of these guys, man,
if he doesn't turn it around,

38
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,390
he's not going to see 50 because

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,370
okay.

40
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,120
He was one of those guys who was
abusing his body so bad. Like, I can't,

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,980
like when I go go to guesses age,
it's going to, he was either like

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,940
26 to 28.

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,160
Yeah.

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,210
Or like 37.
I couldn't tell,

45
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,770
but he looked as old as me.
Uh,

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,380
he looked like he was, if he
was my age, you're like, dude,

47
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:37,490
you got like another two years because
if you fucking did that to yourself for

48
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41,600
close to 48 years, you would be done
this fucking guy, man. Holy Shit.

49
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,600
He put on a display.
All right.

50
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,470
So you know it's late at
night and take them right.

51
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,280
I like I said 11:00 PM and I got
the aisle, he's got the window.

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,830
Right. And fortunately my
Sciatica is, is almost yeah,

53
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,450
but gone away.
And um,

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,820
I just been taking it easy and a,

55
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,470
it's just sort of naturally working
itself out while doing all the,

56
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,450
all the stretches and all that shit.
So anyways,

57
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,550
he's got the fucking window seat and
I'm thinking I'm being smarter than the

58
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,140
aisle thing because all right,

59
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,350
if I need to stretch I can just step out
into the island and won't have to step

60
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,800
over anybody. Um, cause I fucked
up. Last time I went to Saint Louis,

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,310
I flew southwest and I wasn't thinking,

62
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,750
I just went to the window seat
and then I was trapped, you know,

63
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,490
on the other side of two other people.
So this time I'm thinking I'm being smart,

64
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,020
but it turns out my back feels great and
now all I want to do was go to sleep in

65
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:38,510
this fucking guy. Man. Holy Shit.

66
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,590
This guy was like crushing
the fucking airport bar.

67
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,040
I don't know how many fucking
Jack and cokes this guy drank.

68
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,010
But he just kept going like the guy would,
he would just go,

69
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,440
can I get another one? And then the guy
would bring it over and he'd be like,

70
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:57,710
my dude, thank you freight.
Some reason he said my dude.

71
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,990
And then he would just be
sucking these sinks down.

72
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,530
And he was one of these fucking
guys that was so out of shape.

73
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:08,060
Like he snored while he was awake.
You know what I mean?

74
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,850
He did the noises this guide makes right.

75
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,300
So after about, I dunno, like fucking
five of these things. We're in the flight,

76
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,530
I'm starting to nod off.

77
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,460
He fucking goes to step over me.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,580
Mountain of a man goes to step over me,
you know,

79
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:29,020
which course sort of wakes me up and
he goes into the bathroom and I noticed

80
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,440
he's wearing his socks.
Fucking animal.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,350
This guy is like trying to kill himself
from all sides. You know what I made?

82
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,190
Death comes from the mouth, but he's
also trying to fucking speed it up.

83
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,760
Try to go into the express lane by
bringing a little in through the fucking

84
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:47,430
pores of the bottom of his feet.
People.

85
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,810
It's not your fault that
you weren't raised right,

86
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:54,980
but you got to look around in life.
Okay? You got to do the fucking math.

87
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,010
I almost think. What do you
think it's his grocer to?

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,080
To be in your bare feet or in your socks.

89
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,450
I know initially the bare
feet has worked worse,

90
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:10,090
but does something about the socks
just absorbing it and like, you know,

91
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,690
the next day if you put them on
again after you took a shower,

92
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:17,590
you still got the fucking shit and cause
it's going India feet no matter what.

93
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,370
One of the grossest things,
so the entire fucking flight,

94
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,430
this guy has just pounding Jack and cokes.
I mean he had,

95
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,260
he must've had like nine
of them on like a a,

96
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,830
I don't know how long that flight is
like four fucking hours and I'm trying to

97
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:36,370
sleep and I can't get to sleep because,
you know, he's a big guy. He's a cool guy.

98
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,660
He was trying to step over,
you know,

99
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,520
one point I did that Vietnamese
gamblers squat and he's like,

100
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,760
he goes, what are you doing? You praying
over there? You all right? And I said, no,

101
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,930
I got it. I got a Sattik nervous
unit. He goes, Oh man, that sucks.

102
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,510
So I couldn't get mad at him
cause he was friendly spot.

103
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,040
Every time he went to step over me,

104
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,680
he'd fucking wake me up and then I'd
look and he'd be going into the bathroom

105
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,280
just wearing his socks and it
just was driving me fucking nuts.

106
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,980
So finally, all I'm
thinking is going, my God,

107
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,770
when this fucking mountain
of a man goes down,

108
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,260
like he is going to snore like a,
I mean,

109
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:15,780
I've never had the displeasure of
sleeping next to Terry Saragossa,

110
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,760
whatever's Tony Serra Bussa but I imagined
he was going to sound like whatever

111
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,730
that guy sounds like at like two
o'clock in the fucking morning. Right.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,780
But it was the weirdest
thing. He was snoring while
he was awake, but when he was,

113
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,890
when he went to sleep, he didn't
make a fucking sound. And uh, oh,

114
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,960
he kept dropping his fucking iPhone.

115
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,800
He had his shoes off and just the noises
he was trying to make to try to pick it

116
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,830
up. It's like, why the fuck would
you do to that? Do that to yourself,

117
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,490
these fucking people that treat
their own bodies like a rental car,

118
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,730
I just don't understand it. It's like
you can't return this fucking thing.

119
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,950
At the end of the weekend,
you got to keep,

120
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,060
this is the vessel that's going to
bring you around for your fucking life.

121
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:56,360
You know, I mean, I should talk the
way I fucking booze, but you know,

122
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,260
I still do my jumping jacks and I do a
couple of cartwheels to keep the stomach

123
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,170
down, you know. So anyways,
the flight fucking ends,

124
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,600
my travel is all fucked up
for whatever reason. And um,

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm basically,
by the time they booked my hotel,

126
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,850
everything was sold out.
So I had a hotel for the night,

127
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:20,120
but I couldn't check in until three
in the afternoon. So I go, you know,

128
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:23,630
so they booked me at another
hotel and the person, you know,

129
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:28,070
the travel person goes, so you've got
to check in at this hotel, you know,

130
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:31,790
at five 30 in the morning and then check
out at 12 and then check in for the

131
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,840
other places. It is like at
3:00 PM it's like, is that cool?

132
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,980
And I'm like, no, it's not
cool. Like, do you ever travel?

133
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:43,730
Is that the way you set up your travel?
Do you want to switch hotels?

134
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,030
You know,
in the same fucking city you staying.

135
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,520
But I mean I don't have any choice,
so it's going to have to be cool.

136
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,740
So I fucking take a cab over there.

137
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,100
I get to the place that like fucking
five 30 in the morning. It's like planes,

138
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:59,810
trains and automobiles, right. I get there
and they're like, yeah, what's it under?

139
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,420
And I'm like, oh no. I'm like
bill burr. They're like, yeah,

140
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,200
see I'm like William, Eh rumple fucking
still scan. I may not get it right.

141
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,490
And the guy keeps going, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry. I'm like,

142
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:14,960
well I know it's not your fault.

143
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,560
So now it's like fucking five
and the God damn morning,

144
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,490
I got no place to stay.
And he goes,

145
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:25,180
well the bellhop can take you over
to the fucking waffle house. Right.

146
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,600
Sorry if I make Mike Noise here,

147
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,200
I to move this laptop around cause I
want you to fucking hear this thing.

148
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,000
So good. Yeah. I'm sorry if
a, you know, sorry about that.

149
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:37,450
So the fucking, so now it like
fucking five 20 in the morning.

150
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,650
I got no place to stay til three in
the afternoon. I'm fucking dead tired.

151
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:45,610
I couldn't sleep because all fatty cakes
over there was drinking the fucking, uh,

152
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,750
Jack and cokes all night,

153
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:52,751
stepping over on me with his fucking piss
and shit and fested soak socks and now

154
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,880
they don't have a room for me. And
now I'm to a waffle house. Right.

155
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,800
So I get to the fucking waffle house,
you know,

156
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,720
it fucking quarter to six in the morning,

157
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,500
half expecting to see Jay z finishing
the end of that song. You know,

158
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,020
it'll fucking thing go to the waffle house
and we're going to do it again or how

159
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,550
the fuck,

160
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,150
I guess he'd be walking out with them
right to banger and then kicked around at

161
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:19,260
seven. Well, Beyonce sings
lemonade in the background.

162
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,770
I don't know what the fuck it is,
those two do. I don't pretend to know.

163
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,070
I'm an old man anyways,
so I walk in there,

164
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,390
okay.

165
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,320
Bunch of fucking characters
and uh, um, bleary died.

166
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,580
I'm not even fucking hungry,

167
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:36,840
but I know I can't just sit in there like
some sort of vagrant soil, some eggs,

168
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,800
and a fucking waffle.

169
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:42,801
And I'm sitting there and this black
guy in there wearing a suit and he's,

170
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,420
he's like an anomaly. I don't
know. He sees a black guy,

171
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,470
but he isn't funny.

172
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,150
It's very rare.
It's like an obese Asian.

173
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,960
It's very rare that you see like obesity,
you know,

174
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,650
I don't know what food they eat over in
Asia, but I mean, whatever they're doing,

175
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,520
they're doing it right with all the
vegetables and the third fried, those,

176
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:07,840
those people are phenomenal.

177
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,250
Okay. And it was getting old,
right? Have you, once you,

178
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,010
it's very rare you meet a black guy wasn't
funny. This fucking guy is not funny.

179
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:16,420
Any,
won't shut the fuck up.

180
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,770
He keeps telling jokes and he's laughing
at his own fucking jokes and I just

181
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:24,640
want to, I want to stab myself
with my fucking waffle house.

182
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,770
Fucking fork.
So at one point he just won't shut up.

183
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,110
And then finally one of the
waitresses makes a joke. Well,

184
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,930
and the other way to see all
the way to goes, you know,

185
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:38,350
don't be walking up behind me. You
know, you don't want to, you know,

186
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,410
you don't want to basically fuck with
me. And then the lady goes, no, she goes,

187
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:45,620
I don't slight pregnant women
and she wasn't pregnant. Okay.

188
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,930
But admittedly it was a decent joke.
The unfunny black dude in the suit,

189
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,510
you know, high pitch left, stands
up, runs out of the waffle house,

190
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,790
goes up to the front and does like a
fucking three 60 turn and immediately the

191
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,320
fucking, you know, the road
weary comedian in me going like,

192
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,860
all right dude. It was funny. It
wasn't that fucking funny. And uh,

193
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,210
yeah,

194
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,030
he comes back in and then I didn't
know what the fuck they do. I'm like,

195
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,340
what the fuck am I going to do
with myself? I can't go to sleep.

196
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,260
Yeah.

197
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,690
My phone's running out of batteries.
I'm charging it there.

198
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:26,170
It was just a fucking nightmare. So,
uh, I just started calling hotels.

199
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:29,620
They're all fucking booked up. I don't
know what's going on here in Nashville.

200
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:33,130
If there's some sort of fucking Banjo
festival, I have no fucking idea.

201
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,830
But there's no way,
some Jesus Shit.

202
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,010
Okay.

203
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,030
You know, or some, you know,
democratic or Republican convention,

204
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:45,530
I have no fucking idea, but I cannot
get a room. So, you know, I'm like,

205
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:48,020
what do I do?
So I called in EOP and Jimmy show.

206
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,390
Yeah,

207
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,480
I talked to them for a minute and
then I was just like, what am I doing?

208
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:53,260
So I finally,

209
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,430
the cat and I just went over to the hotel
that I was supposed to be at and they

210
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:01,800
were like, and they were like, oh yeah,
you know, somebody called said, you know,

211
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,430
fucking last night if we could get you in,

212
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,220
unfortunately we can not blah blah blah,
blah blah.

213
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,910
So I at least check my bags,
you know,

214
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,390
I felt like a fucking homeless person
when I was in the waffle house with the

215
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:14,230
unfunny black dude.

216
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:19,231
And I had my fucking bags on the
inside of myself as I sat in the booth,

217
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,090
made the two fucking people, but
of sitting there by myself. Right.

218
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,230
So I get to the hotel,

219
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,270
at least checked in my bags and they had
a fucking like a couch in the lobby of

220
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,530
this place.
They go,

221
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,130
we're already cleaning a room and at
this point it's six 30 in the morning.

222
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,790
And I'm like, great. Whenever you
can get me in, if I got to pay extra,

223
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,420
I just don't give a shit. Right.
So they say fine. So I go over,

224
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,260
then I just lay down on the couch,
put my hat over my eyes,

225
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,200
and I just pass out.

226
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,440
I'm talking like I wasn't
even trying to be a gentleman.

227
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,110
I had both feet up on the fucking couch.
I was like,

228
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:00,880
this is my bed and I'm just sleeping
there and I just keep hearing people's,

229
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,360
they're getting waking up,
getting on with their day.

230
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,930
You want to get some smoke.

231
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,300
I heard they have such great
eggs and all this shit.

232
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:10,230
And then at one point this guy walked by,
you know,

233
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:14,930
it was fucking assholes who whistle a
fucking, you know, I think I tweeted,

234
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,580
nobody likes a whistler at some point.

235
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:20,110
This is fucking guy just came
by whistling, you know, just,

236
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,180
it's just some random song. It's not
even, it's not even a fucking song.

237
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:26,690
He's just whistling cause that's
what the fuck he does. Um,

238
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,720
and, uh, then I just completely,

239
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:34,100
I was just zonked out and then all of a
sudden I just feel somebody pushing me

240
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,170
once twice and I fucking wake up and then
they go, hey Mr up, your room's ready.

241
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,520
I'm like thinking, oh, thank God.

242
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,580
And I thought it was like seven 30 in
the morning. I looked, it was like 10,

243
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:47,390
15 if it's sleeping at like
a bum for like four hours.

244
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,623
So

245
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,530
I finally ended up getting
my fucking room and uh,

246
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,010
fortunately it was one of these
rooms that has the great curtains.

247
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:02,600
I was able to close them and it felt
like midnight and I'm then I just fucking

248
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,430
crashed,
woke up,

249
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,120
met some friends that I've met
along the way on the road and uh,

250
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,260
took a drum lesson.
Um,

251
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,870
I hate dropping names on this,
but like,

252
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,720
they're one of my favorite
bands out there right now.

253
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:20,240
Mute math is based out of here. And, uh,

254
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,680
I got some lunch and down king
actually gave me a little drum lesson.

255
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,410
I still stink,
but it was fucking like,

256
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,590
I was beyond geeking out
that I got to do it. So, um,

257
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,610
it was a bad day and I actually,
uh,

258
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,530
ended up turning it around and,
uh,

259
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,620
I'll tell you what's funny is if you
notice in the story, I never flipped up.

260
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,160
Bear with me. Watch your ears. I've
got to click and drag this thing over.

261
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,800
Just hang on a second. I
apologize. Here we go. Here we go.

262
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,110
It's almost over and it's over.

263
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,130
And I just realized I have no idea
how much time I'm doing here. The fuck

264
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,150
does this mean here for 47,
448,

265
00:14:56,151 --> 00:15:01,151
448 one millimeters is just the
metric system where the Fox,

266
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:03,800
the timer.
How do I tell him much time I'm doing

267
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,550
all right. You just going
to have to fucking deal with
this. I apologize. Anyways,

268
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,240
um, I got this weird thing when like
major shit happens. Like I don't,

269
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:16,840
um, I don't flip out like
bigger shit like this.

270
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,810
I don't flip out little shit bugs me.

271
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,150
Like 20 minutes ago,

272
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:27,151
I'm going down in the elevator and we
just hit every fucking floor and every

273
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:32,260
fucking floor is another person coming
on a fucking full grown adult wearing

274
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,660
their name,
a name tag around their neck,

275
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,400
like it's their first day of preschool
and everybody knows everybody. Hey Carl,

276
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,830
like the shorts,
you're wearing those to the meeting.

277
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:46,390
It crazy right down one more floor.
Every fucking floor.

278
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,880
It's getting more and more packed.
And then I have

279
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,910
to sit there and listen to office
humor, right? I'll tell you right now,

280
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,380
if you think every once in a while,

281
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,770
a random black dude in a suit
in a waffle house isn't funny.

282
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,370
Wait till you're in a crowded elevator
with a bunch of people that sit in

283
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,270
cubicles all day.

284
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:07,260
They had their fucking name tags around
the neck listening to their jokes for

285
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:12,000
eight fucking floors that I like. I was,
by the time I got to the third floor,

286
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,290
I was fucking livid.

287
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:17,220
I was so fucking angry that the
people around me could sense it,

288
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,730
that when I went to get off the elevator,
even women got out of the way.

289
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,780
So I'm not proud of that.

290
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,080
Which you would think I would
have flipped out at at the big,

291
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:31,650
don't stepping over me or I
would've thought this anyways,

292
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:35,370
or I would have flipped out when my room
wasn't ready. I would have flipped out.

293
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,600
You know, even when I sent the
text message to my travel person,

294
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,480
I didn't curse. I didn't say
that they fucked it up. I
know somebody fucked it up.

295
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:48,980
But I've learned in the past to not just
slice the head off of the first person.

296
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,510
I just went very like, you know,
I don't know what happened,

297
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:58,070
but this is not acceptable. People
knew I was coming here for two months.

298
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,420
I don't understand. I've never had this
problem before. This can happen again.

299
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,100
I am now on my way to a waffle house at
five 21 in the morning with all of my

300
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:10,910
bags and I just, you know what, what else
do you need the fucking second? Right. So

301
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,110
anyways, it all ended up working out. And,
uh, I got some great food out here and,

302
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,620
uh, I ended up running into one
of the cast members of Nashville,

303
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,260
which is my wife's favorite fucking show,
unfortunately.

304
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:26,710
Just got canceled and I ran into the guy,
Charles Ashton,

305
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,930
and he was the coolest fucking guy am I
was like, oh my God, my wife loves you.

306
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,520
Show is there any way I could get a
picture? And he goes, no, put it on video.

307
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,190
He goes, watch this. He
goes, you do the intro.

308
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,530
He was so fucking cool. So I just was
like, Hey, yeah. Well, I'm in Nashville.

309
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:42,370
I ran into one of the
locals and then it turns in,

310
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:45,330
it's his face and he just goes, Hey
Dan, thanks for watching the show.

311
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,990
She freaked out and I got some good
points, so thank you to Charles.

312
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,630
Make it my fucking, uh, making my
married life a little easier. So a,

313
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:59,170
so they go, I don't know how much time
that took up. According to a garage band,

314
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:01,260
I'm at 540 something.

315
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,460
Yeah,

316
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,930
540 fucking of these.

317
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,070
Okay.

318
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,980
Oh, they count in the little
things was at 540 seconds.

319
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,070
Okay.

320
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,100

had I have I not done 10 minutes yet.

321
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:16,570
600 seconds is 10 minutes.

Hey,

391
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:33,830
I've got to ask you guys a question here
and I apologize for all the extraneous

392
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:35,510
fucking noise,
if that's the right word here.

393
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,903
MMM.

394
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,750
I went into the, uh, the drug
store out here because I forgot my,

395
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:45,680
a leaf to kelp to help
my inflame Sciatica here.

396
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,510
And um,

397
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,390
okay.

398
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,580
Sciatic nerve I should say.
And um,

399
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,030
okay,

400
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,490
I went in there and this,
this campaign,

401
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:58,570
that red nose fucking fun thing,
whatever. And it's all these,

402
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,610
okay.

403
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,650
It's some sort of charity and
it's all these fucking people.

404
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,610
Famous people wearing the red nose.
So I'm going, what the, what is this?

405
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,570
I keep seeing this.

406
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:12,571
So I start reading the box and it says
Walgreens will donate 100% of everything

407
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,920
that they gain,

408
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,660
collect or whatever to this red nose camp,
red nose fund.

409
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,320
100% is going to this red nose fund.

410
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,300
So I'm like, all right, what
is it? What is the fund?

411
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,480
Nowhere on the box.
Will it say what the fuck it is?

412
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,500
It doesn't say what it's raising
money for. Nowhere on the box.

413
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:40,300
So I asked the lady behind the counter
and it goes, so what is this for?

414
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,800
If I buy one of these red noses,
what is this for? She goes, Oh,

415
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,100
you get one of these?

416
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,330
And it was like a little fucking gift
certificate off of fucking chapstick or

417
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:55,130
something. I go, no, no, no,
no. I, I don't like what I
get. If I buy a red nose,

418
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:59,330
like, where does the money go? Who am I
helping out? She goes, oh, I don't know.

419
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:03,840
It's like my first day. And I
just laughed. I was like, well,

420
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm going to just start the fucking green
hat fun and everything's going to go

421
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:09,840
to me. She sorta like,
I guess half ass left.

422
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,750
I should have told it to the black guy
in the suit and the fucking waffle house

423
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:17,450
he would have ran out of the place then
15 cart wheels and come back in. Don't,

424
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,810
it's not that funny. Um, I'm
telling you, man, that's the new,

425
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,410
I'm not saying the red nose thing is a
scam, but it's pretty fucking shifty,

426
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,850
pretty shady than I'm sitting there
looking at all these celebrities and it's

427
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:34,320
just the red nose fund and there's
nothing on there. Same way the money goes,

428
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,263
you know,
is it,

429
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,270
shouldn't that red nose thing bring
up a couple of red flags there? Um,

430
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,580
I think that that's the new,

431
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,180
there's two new things going on in this
country that are actually generating

432
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:46,140
income for people.

433
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:51,240
The legal selling of weed
at the state level and um,

434
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,410
nonprofits.

435
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,880
Okay.

436
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,460
Nonprofit is like the new hardware store.

437
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,820
Like back in the day you had to
open a store and actually sell shit.

438
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:04,410
And nowadays you can just start
fucking come up with a mirror,

439
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,820
a mirror,
not a ribbon of fucking wristband,

440
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,420
a red fucking nose have people dump
ice water over their fucking head,

441
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:16,410
whatever it is. You know,
some of them are legit.

442
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,610
I got this fail and most of them aren't.
And I kind of feel like,

443
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,260
okay,

444
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,190
if you're old like me,

445
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:28,191
and you remember the late eighties when
all those televangelists were on TV and

446
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:32,850
they went to like this national fucking
level and they just made hundreds of

447
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,430
millions of dollars before it all just
came out that it was just this giant

448
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:39,450
fucking cash grab.
I feel like all those fucking nonprofits,

449
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,950
it has to be going in that direction
and how all these sports, uh,

450
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,270
sports leagues get in bed with
all of these fucking people. Um,

451
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,770
okay.

452
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,480
I Dunno,
maybe they have enough money.

453
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,330
Maybe you have enough money to keep it
silent. But, uh, I dunno. I'm Kinda done.

454
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,180
I give money to saint Jude's hospital.
That's it. Everything else. I just, I,

455
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:06,990
I don't have the fucking time to figure
out whether or not you're a fucking scam

456
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:10,710
or not because I gave to that
wounded warrior shit. I gave so many,

457
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:12,570
I gave so much fucking money.

458
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,680
I used to donate like 10% of the Shit I
made in the advertising to those fucking

459
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:19,720
people.
And then people started sending me these,

460
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:22,750
these articles and the
next thing you know,

461
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:26,010
they get investigated and all that type
of shit. And I don't even know. I didn't,

462
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,660
I just stopped following the story and
I just stopped giving him money because,

463
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,250
okay.

464
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,170
I don't, I don't know. I don't
know if it's true or not.

465
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,150
I don't even fucking want to know.
But like,

466
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,430
I just feel like the future of helping
people out is literally walking up to a

467
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,830
wounded warrior, like finding out
where the fuck they live and be like,

468
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:45,840
what do you need?
Go out and get it.

469
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:49,740
Or you raise the money and then you
give it to them. But then if I raise it,

470
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,600
then do I become one of
those people and be like, oh,

471
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:55,470
we have a little bit of overhead and all
of a sudden I have some sick ass drum

472
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:59,730
room and I just bring a fucking box
of bandaids to a fucking veteran.

473
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,760
I mean, that's what seems what
all these, I don't know. I'm,

474
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:08,670
I'm a cynical son of a bitch, but
my new shit is I want to just, um,

475
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,440
I, I still love doing charities.
I love doing benefits.

476
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,830
I did one the other night for like a
fucking, it was for like a private school.

477
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,040
It's like, it's a fucking private
school. Like you guys don't need money.

478
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,770
It's like, oh, it's for the people
who can't afford it. It's like, is it,

479
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,220
who knows what it is?
You just saying what it is and then what?

480
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:33,010
Then all of a sudden they, yeah. Who
gets the money? Where does it go?

481
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,150
Where does that person go? Or they in
Tahiti. Are they helping somebody out?

482
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:40,450
Nobody fucking knows. It's
brilliant. It's fucking brilliant.

483
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,120
I hope that red nose things
is on the label is on the
labels on the level. Sorry,

484
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,940
I didn't get a good night's sleep.
You know those hotel couches are,

485
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,680
and what they fucking used to be there.

486
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,073
MMM.

487
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,940
I honestly have no,
no idea how much time I've done here.

488
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,510
I'm up til like 838 of these seconds here.

489
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,130
I'm just going to say this seconds.

490
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,993
Right.

491
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,290
Well, let's see if there's
600 seconds in 10 minutes.

492
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,390
Yeah.

493
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,740
So that means that'd be 1800 seconds
and a half. That has no fucking way.

494
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:17,240
That's only a second.
What if it's two seconds?

495
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,910
I gotta be coming up. I'm
going to say it's two seconds.
Fuck it. It's two seconds.

496
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,220
So all you gotta do is just make it up
to 900 and I got another 49 to go. Oh,

497
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:30,070
it's fucking easy. Let's talk a
little playoff hockey. Everybody.

498
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,990
Anybody watched ya? I keep missing just
to how busy I am. I keep missing, um,

499
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,190
that uh, that Tampa Bay Pittsburgh
series, I caught the end of a,

500
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,710
a game three with the penguins were up
and then the game a couple of right,

501
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:50,460
their threads
to put it out of reach.

502
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,220
And I fucking sense a buddy
of mine in Pittsburgh,

503
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,240
a text congratulating them because as
much as I don't like what the penguins

504
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,510
cheap shot artists have done
to the Bruins, uh, you know,

505
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,330
I don't take it to the level that I
don't want my friends teams to win.

506
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,220
So I said congratulations.

507
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:09,210
And the second I sent that Tampa Bay
scored one and I felt like I jinxed them

508
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,800
for half a second. But, um,

509
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I've been watching the blues
and in San Jose Shacks and uh,

510
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,450
this is fucking huge tonight

511
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,150
for the blues because San Jose obviously
adjust it to whatever the fuck the

512
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:26,460
blues we're doing and gain one.
And uh,

513
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,670
so now blues have to adjust to whatever
San Jose was doing it because San Jose

514
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,503
Pretty,
uh,

515
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,840
dominated pretty much wire
to wire the last game.

516
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,310
And uh,
I dunno if it's making me nervous as a,

517
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,520
as a total bandwagon blues fan.
They obviously got a witness.

518
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,630
Well that's such a stupid thing to say.
It was a busy, it's just one, a big one.

519
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:51,570
Bill. Should they not go down three
games to one? You fucking dope. Um,

520
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,070
big shout out to all the soccer fans
over there in Europe that got so fucking

521
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:57,560
annoyed at everything that I
said that I shouldn't talk about

522
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,960
about uh, um, sports over in Europe.

523
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,860
You guys all make a great point because
I don't watch them and I don't know

524
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:06,350
anything about them.
But uh,

525
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,360
what you fail to understand is how
much I enjoy irritating the shit out of

526
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:15,300
people that I'd never met before.
So I stand by. What the fuck?

527
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:18,660
I said you guys should have some
sort of in the premier league,

528
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:23,490
you should have a fucking play off play
off the fact that somebody can win a

529
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:28,491
fucking championship because another team
came to like a tie and like that's it.

530
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,230
Just imagine

531
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:37,290
every fucking movie about soccer is
always, there's the big fucking game,

532
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,430
right? And then somebody
comes down and scores a goal.

533
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,500
It's not like the stars of the movie
standing around waiting for somebody to

534
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:50,520
fucking, you know, have a
one, one ty was somebody.

535
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,960
Is this sitting there and fucking street
clothes or sitting in an apartment

536
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,230
doing jello shots with each other.

537
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,410
Okay.

538
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,570
I don't know. I'm just
fucking with you. I know.

539
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,160
Remember that's the best of
Solo movie victory ended them

540
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:04,890
okay

541
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,520
with them walking away from the game.
Oh No, no. They were going to do it.

542
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:11,130
They wanted to escape and then they came
back because they wanted to beat the

543
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:11,964
guys.

544
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,350
Okay.

545
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,190
And if that was actually
based on anything real, um,

546
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,470
the game would have ended
and then they would have won.

547
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,290
They would have been brought back to
the prison camp and they would of been

548
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,041
beaten to death.

549
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:27,041
But instead what ended up happening was
they came back and they beat the Nazis,

550
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,010
these prisoners allied prisoners of

551
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,953
or,

552
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,560
and then they fucking,
uh,

553
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,540
they just walked out with the crowd
that's stored under the field and gave him

554
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,620
extra clothes and shit.

555
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,273
MMM.

556
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,680
I Dunno. I'm sure it was based
on a true story, but, uh,

557
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,490
I've seen enough of the Germans and their
respect for life outside of their own

558
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,324
country.

559
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,460
Um,
for people

560
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,600
who are non German, I think that they
would have just opened up on the crowd.

561
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,650
So I'm calling bullshit. That movie was
called victory, by the way, by the way.

562
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:57,120
It wasn't

563
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,920
great. It was, I actually
really enjoyed that movie,

564
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,500
but it was when I first got
cable. So who knows. Um,

565
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,910
anyways, is that, is that a half hour?

566
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,620
I'm up to 962 seconds or a 1800.

567
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:11,580
I have no fucking idea.

568
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:16,260
You know what I'm going to find out
here because I'm going to have to do the

569
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:20,250
Monday morning podcasts
like this one also. And uh,

570
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,640
my timing will be a little bit better
on the next one cause I'll know exactly

571
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,430
how much time I'm doing. I just don't
understand why this would fucking thing.

572
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:30,150
Wouldn't tell me how much time, but I'm
not gonna start hitting buttons going,

573
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:33,430
it's going to be irritating to you
if you listen to it on a fucking with

574
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:33,780
headphones.

575
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,130
So anyways, that's it for the
Thursday afternoon podcast.
Just checking in on you.

576
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:42,390
Hope you can't have a great and
a his little bit of music and uh,

577
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,090
enjoy the a clips from a
podcasts from years gone ball.

578
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,953
Yeah.

579
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,930
And of course like,
Hey, where there it is.

580
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,740
Hey, what's going on? It's built bar.

581
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:57,260
It's the Monday morning podcast and uh,
eight gloomy,

582
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,113
rainy,

583
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,770
depressing Monday morning
here in Los Angeles.

584
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,370
Um, probably days or extra
depressing out here because,

585
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,243
uh,

586
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,740
it's usually sunny and it's
what you expect out here. See,

587
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,720
look, I'm going to go into
a Karen Carpenter songs,
rainy days and monitored. Oh,

588
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,310
Kathy down.
Really?

589
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:28,490
Is that a reason to stop eating?
I don't think it is. Wow.

590
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,010
Wow. I just started off real means did I
well, well shit. Well, who gives a fuck?

591
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:37,890
It's a gloomy Monday and uh, I attack
a dead anorexic. How do you like that?

592
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:40,950
That's how I started the Monday
morning podcast. So there you go.

593
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:45,840
If you're new to my page, um, I do one
of these, um, every Monday morning,

594
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,290
can I say Monday? Oh, did I say run day?
Every Monday morning I do a podcast and a,

595
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,940
evidently I attack some,
uh,

596
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,670
defenseless dead person. That's how
I started off. Only if it's overcast.

597
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:03,570
If it was sunny, it would have, I
would have a completely different vibe.

598
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,990
But basically I do of these every Monday
and I answer questions that some of my

599
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:15,120
14 listeners send in. Um, lately
I've been giving out advice.

600
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:20,150
People have been asking me advice
and sometimes I ask questions and,

601
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,420
uh, hopefully in the end of
it, nobody learns anything.

602
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:28,640
And you know you've wasted 15 minutes of
your life. That's what I'm trying to do.

603
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:31,260
And speaking of wasting
15 minutes of your life,

604
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,320
I am actually sitting in my apartment,
my little villa,

605
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,130
and really made me sound like
they had a pool. Boy, it didn't.

606
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,880
My little villa here and I'm
waiting for a plumber and you know,

607
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,290
I don't want to judge the
guy cause I never met him.

608
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:50,770
But this motherfucker guy was supposed
to be here at nine o'clock in the goddamn

609
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,540
morning.
All right?

610
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,650
It's two minutes past the
hour of 10 o'clock now I
don't know what time zone you

611
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:59,880
live in, what world you're in, but
in my little neck of the woods,

612
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:03,390
10 oh two. Now it's 10 oh three.
It just turned on my cable box.

613
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:07,350
It's fucking 10 oh three 10 or three
is not nine o'clock and God damn it,

614
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,490
I want some answers.

615
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,790
Unburied a ball my hand up into a fist
and fucking pounded on my coffee table

616
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,690
like, uh, like some like that
guy in the Spiderman comic books.

617
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,360
Who's, who's the guy at the
daily planet? Jamieson. Huh?

618
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,010
With his fucking, it's such a
weird way of going gray. Didn't he?

619
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,470
Just the side of his head turned white
all the way around and then on top it was

620
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:38,970
jet black and he'd always be chomping
on a fucking cigar. You know, just,

621
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,260
I don't want to tack Stan Lee, but you
know, it's really, you know, I got it.

622
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,010
He's the boss. All right. What am I
doing? Okay. All right, let, let's,

623
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,860
let's fucking get back to this. Let's
get down to brass tacks here. Okay.

624
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,390
Why am I waiting for a plumber?

625
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:55,740
I'll tell you why I'm late for a
plumber because for some reason my sink,

626
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,200
when the water comes out lately,

627
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:02,580
it's smells like swamp ass.

628
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,770
Um,
I don't know what it is.

629
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,010
There's definitely a funk coming onto
my sink and it's not coming out of the

630
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:16,890
kitchen sink. So I've ruled out
some sort of outside sources,

631
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:21,540
obviously, you know, cause it was coming
from the street, the main water line,

632
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,940
I think every,
it'd be fucking everything.

633
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,580
It'd be coming out of
everything right now.

634
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:30,090
Do I have any plumber listeners out
there? You know, can you help me out?

635
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,070
Because evidently this
fuck is not showing up.

636
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:36,130
It's 10 oh four and he's still not here.
See,

637
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,750
this is why the United States of America
is starting to lag behind China and all

638
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,430
of them I've had in China,
when you call a plumber,

639
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,530
48 of them show up at fucking eight 58
begging. You don't need to have a wrench.

640
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,671
You know what I mean?

641
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:52,120
Somebody just fucking bites down the
pipe and three other guys just start

642
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:56,890
spinning the guy around, you
know, but not in America.

643
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,750
I got away for this
motherfucker to show up.

644
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:03,130
I'll tell you what sucks too is I don't
know if they act stupid, but it just,

645
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:05,050
that, that, that makes it hurt even more

646
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,220
is when they can't figure
out how to fix a sink.

647
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,940
And then some guy comes up more
mobile boom pole, you know,

648
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:16,210
with his fucking ass hanging out,
he knows how to fix it.

649
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:19,090
That's why I've started to become handy.
Okay.

650
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,320
Because I actually sat down and I
analyzed it the other day and you know,

651
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,210
fixing a sink is not a gift.
You know what I'm saying?

652
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,770
It's a skill. It's something you
learned. Does inventing this sink.

653
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,350
Okay. Or the toilet
like that. That guy, uh,

654
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,730
Eddie crapper but whatever
his fucking name was,

655
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,120
I know is his last name was
crapper. Okay. Because of him,

656
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:44,470
we don't have to shit outside.

657
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,650
And what's what banks does he get his
last name becomes slang for taking a dump.

658
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,630
Tell me he didn't die. A bitter
rich man. Jesus Christ. You know,

659
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:57,440
some people man, it's just
these, you know, they, they,

660
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,790
they do such good and what
do they get out of it? Huh?

661
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,820
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

662
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:08,850
I bet you and your last name was crapper
to every female in that family could

663
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:13,720
not wait to get married and just get
away from that Goddamn last name. I mean,

664
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,030
they probably took the first
thing that came down the pike.

665
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,050
That'd be a great thing to Google and go
check out the amount of women with the

666
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:24,700
last name crapper that married the first
trucker that fucking fingered him on a

667
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:27,520
fucking Tuesday night.
Jesus Christ.

668
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,090
Just cause they were shameful of them.
Their maiden name,

669
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,530
which probably led to some sort
of child abuse and alcoholism.

670
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:38,740
And that's probably another reason why
it's 10 oh six in the fucking plumber

671
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:42,700
still isn't here. I really hope he
shows up halfway through this. Okay.

672
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:46,150
Cause you guys have watched me give
this guy a piece in my fucking mind.

673
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:51,580
Then I won't curse either. So we can't
leave. What is he doing? What's he doing?

674
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:55,910
Huh? He drive and you know he's
got a van. Drew. You know if,

675
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,600
if you're a carpenter you got to pick
up. If you're, if you're a plumber,

676
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,450
you got a van,
you know,

677
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,480
because in case it rains you can't have
it go on the pipes and they get all

678
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:05,710
rusted. I don't know why. What,

679
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:09,520
what is he doing as he is the army
navy store buying some more Dickies,

680
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,760
you know, what do they trade their
underwear for? Their Dickies.

681
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:19,390
So they're fucking crack of their
ass hanging out. 10 Oh seven okay.

682
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,470
Anyways, yeah. So that's the
deal I started, I started
to learn how to fix shit.

683
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,640
Okay. I fix the leaky faucet the
other day, which is unbelievably easy.

684
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,680
But it makes no goddamn sense.

685
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,110
You fucking take the handle
off and there's this,

686
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,280
this little rubber stopper with this
spring in there and that's all it is.

687
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:39,230
You take it out and you
stick the mother fucker back,

688
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,020
pick a new one in there and magically
it stops leaking. I don't get,

689
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,410
it's not like it's in the pipe.
I have no idea why it works,

690
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,600
but it works.

691
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,110
And I went on the Internet within three
seconds I learned how to do it. Okay.

692
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,160
My ass wasn't hanging out in the back
of my pants and I didn't charge somebody

693
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,570
fucking $200 and I was on time.

694
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,800
Damn motherfucker. Okay. So anyways,

695
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:08,360
I do one of these things every single
week and people ask me questions and I

696
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,780
hype upcoming gigs,
like the fact that I'm doing a,

697
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:14,870
B and a this week I'm going
to be at out of the same,

698
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:18,020
he's in Chicago and uh,

699
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:23,110
it's actually downtown Chicago on the
14th and 15th on the 16th I'll be in,

700
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:28,250
in Saint Charles and on the 17th
I'll be in Vernon hills, Illinois.

701
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:32,270
And I got to tell you something I really,
really enjoyed doing

702
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,940
this Gig at, especially the
downtown Chicago, this nice small,

703
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,190
and I mean it looks like a walk in closet.
The place is so small and uh,

704
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,001
I dunno man.

705
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:48,440
It's like an old school comedy club
and all these old comedy photos,

706
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,750
they just left them up for like two.
I'll take a fucking museum.

707
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,690
I loved the place and I always
have great shows there. So,

708
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:58,691
and I'm going to the cubs game on the
15th Beignet be like my third or fourth

709
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:01,790
time going to Wrigley field,
you know.

710
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,580
And here I am pitching about a plumber.

711
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,230
I really ought to count my blessings here.

712
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,760
Going to a fucking cubs game this week.
Okay. And continuing on, on the 29th,

713
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:16,330
May 29th through June 1st I'm making
my triumphant return to New York City,

714
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,620
Caroline's comedy club. Uh,
I got a whole brand new,

715
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:24,590
our last time I was out
there. I take my, uh,

716
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,560
my one hour comedy special,

717
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,000
which I have information about that
I will be giving out later on in this

718
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:36,740
podcast. Uh, look at me. Look
at me. Teasing it a little bit.

719
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,210
Making you stick around. Huh? Don't roll
your eyes at me. I know what I'm doing.

720
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:44,120
I'm playing the fucking game.
Uh,

721
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,150
let's see what else we got here and then
you go into June and I actually forgot

722
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:52,940
about this date. I thought I had a couple,
a couple of weeks off after Caroline's,

723
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:57,290
but evidently not. I'm going right
back out to Raleigh, North Carolina.

724
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,960
Good night's comedy club. How to
fuck did I have a date there, man?

725
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:07,340
I'm turning 40 on the 10th.
I planned on coming home on the second,

726
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,910
getting into the fetal position,
doing some crunches

727
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,570
and not eating any carbs until June
10th when I turned 40 goddamn years old.

728
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,810
But now I have to fly across this country
and go to Raleigh, North Carolina.

729
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,920
The desolate, the frightening
Raleigh, North Carolina.

730
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,400
The what the fuck happened to
the downtown area that, you know,

731
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:37,140
it's a beautiful part of the, this,
the of the state during the day.

732
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,790
Raleigh, North Carolina downtown. I'm
not talking about NC state, NC state,

733
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:42,990
that that place is nice.

734
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,520
I actually went there for two semesters
in 87 88 and if you want to know why,

735
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:52,340
I only went there for two semesters,
go online and Google Bill Burrs,

736
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,330
fucking NC state,
uh,

737
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,240
fucking transcript and you'll
figure out why I left after that.

738
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,100
But the downtown area, that's one
of those downtowns where, you know,

739
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,120
he would tell at some point in the past,
the history. It was, it was a place,

740
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,530
it was hopping, it was jumping. They'll
make a narrow moonshine down there. Right.

741
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:13,980
And then you know what happened? You know
what? I bet the Wa the dreaded Walmart.

742
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:18,750
That's what happened. They built a
Walmart. Then they, then they made a mall,

743
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,880
the Crabtree mall. Is that what you
guys go and the whole downtown area?

744
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:25,860
Just,
it's a fucking ghost town.

745
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:30,861
Past six oh one in the evening and
I'm just left down there by myself,

746
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:35,610
downtown in the fucking hotel. I
hate it. I need people around me.

747
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:39,480
I'm a city person.
Goddamn people all fucking leave.

748
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:42,750
And then I'm down there and I got to go
out and hail a cab and all that stuff is

749
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:46,650
just homeless people. It's like that
fucking, what did that movie, 28 days.

750
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,170
That's what I feel like I'm in.
I'm feeling I'm in a Zombie movie.

751
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,120
If you work in downtown Raleigh and
you're going to go to one of my shows,

752
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:58,260
why don't you hang out at work?
Just work and go straight to the clubs.

753
00:45:58,261 --> 00:45:59,640
So when I walk out to get a cab,

754
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:02,880
I can actually see another fucking human
being that looks like they don't have

755
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:05,640
hepatitis. All right. And uh,

756
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:10,641
the next Gig I have coming up is June
19th through the 21st I'm going to be at

757
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:14,280
the punchline in Atlanta.
Uh,

758
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:18,250
that's another one of my favorite
comedy clubs that Xannies Caroline,

759
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:23,430
good nights punchline in Atlanta.
I like all of those clubs.

760
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,420
I like all of them. They're just
good clubs, good, clean fun.

761
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,500
And I'm going to come in there with my
potty mouth June 19th through the 21st

762
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,300
and uh, I dunno, I've been
to Atlanta a lot lately,

763
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:39,030
so I'm hoping I'm going to start
to build a following out there.

764
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,660
I always seem to get a good turnout and
I got a whole nother new hour for you.

765
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:44,880
You sons of bitches.
And

766
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,100
then after that you guys, you're
on your own. Just go to my website.

767
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,910
You can click on it right there. If you're
looking at my myspace page, I manage.

768
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,940
I imagine most of you are
secretly listening to this
and your cubicle and you've

769
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:02,730
probably reduced the window.
Is that what you did?

770
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,120
And now you sitting there looking at
what do you look at it in a cubicle? Huh?

771
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,940
What are you looking at? A spreadsheet,
some sort of counting thing with,

772
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,400
with assets and liabilities and you're
rubbing your chin as if you're not

773
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:18,900
listening to me. Well
that's good. You know what?

774
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,870
I think that's a good thing you know you
should do today is take a magnet runner

775
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,020
right down in the back of your
bosses hardware, not as hardware,

776
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:26,880
his fucking hard drive.
That's what you do.

777
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,930
And if he walks into the office right
in the middle of you doing that,

778
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,050
what you do is you smile.
They've open smile,

779
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,270
which causes his defense is to go down.

780
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,740
And then you fling that magnet at him
like a fucking Chinese star and you hit

781
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:45,880
him right in the forehead. Now the great
thing about knocking somebody out is, um,

782
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,660
as far as I know, as far as my
experience with getting knocked out,

783
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,000
is you forget the previous three minutes.

784
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:57,360
So as long as you fire that puck and
magnet at him before the three minutes are

785
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:01,570
up, he won't even remember
what happened. But the key is,

786
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,840
is to do it in a manner before
he can be like, you know,

787
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,120
yell your name and say, what are
you doing in this office? You know,

788
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,980
Jennifer fucking, whatever.
I'm so bad at coming up with

789
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,120
God. Dammit, Jennifer,

790
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,650
we'll go with Sullivan
[inaudible] fucking basic name.

791
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,240
That's why I can't write scripts.
These stories are always good.

792
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:31,450
But my fucking name, you know
the hero's name, Joe Smith.

793
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,890
William the worst. Um, it's,
I can have a commit crime.

794
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,950
Never could come up with a good
alias. What's your name? Bob.

795
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:47,560
Bob Was Avenue.
All right.

796
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,890
Robert, why did she get in the back of the
fucking car? Man, I didn't do anything.

797
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:55,990
All right, let's get on to the,
uh, have I ever been arrested? Yes.

798
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,710
Yes I have. Yes, I have. I innocent
arrested, drinking and driving,

799
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,230
uh,

800
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,580
back in December of 1989 and if
you'd like to hear more of the story,

801
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:11,200
tune in next week, um, I'll wait a
minute. What did I say? Oh, I know.

802
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:14,160
That's right. I'm going to tell you
guys when my DVD is coming out. Uh,

803
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,720
but first we're going
to answer some of the,

804
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,250
some of the questions that
people have asked me. Um,

805
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,540
here's a question I might've
answered it before. Okay.

806
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:26,170
Podcast question number
one. A. This is how many,

807
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,680
I have actually went into some old emails
and I found a bunch of other ones so

808
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,700
that I didn't get to. So who knows.
Here we go. Question one eight bill,

809
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,080
have you ever thought about going
to Iraq to entertain the military?

810
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,920
I served in the Gulf War and we liked
having entertainers. Come see us.

811
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,270
If you have a few have already gone.
What was it like for you?

812
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,300
You would fucking kill? Um, no I have not.

813
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,400
I have not gone over there for the simple
and the only way I would go over there

814
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:58,870
is if I went through six weeks
of boot camp first like you did.

815
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,280
And you know, they gave, they taught
me how to fucking kill somebody.

816
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,313
You know what I'm saying?

817
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:11,260
That's like not knowing how to swim
and then doing a fucking, you know,

818
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:14,920
entertain some people on a tugboat during,
during choppy water.

819
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,580
You know what I mean? That to be honest
with you, I would love to go to Iraq,

820
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:19,510
but I'd love to go over there.

821
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:23,860
And when it was fucking peaceful and
experienced the culture over there when

822
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:27,920
there are no insurgence and yeah,
that's thing, you know what I mean?

823
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:31,910
I know they fly into the fucking base
and I'm surrounded by a bunch of marines

824
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:33,290
and that type of shit.
But you know,

825
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:37,610
I just watched too many will Smith
movies where he's the only guy left and I

826
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,000
don't know how to fire
a gun. So, uh, you know,

827
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,780
I don't have that kind of boss
like Bob Hope would go, you know,

828
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:49,130
he went all over Vietnam with like
a fucking golf bag and umbrella.

829
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,350
I guess he never died. Right.
Maybe that should be, uh,
you know, but you know what?

830
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,800
Chaos theory, I don't think he'd get
killed on the base, but you know,

831
00:50:57,801 --> 00:51:01,130
I'd be one of those guys.
Yeah. Fucking, you know,

832
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:04,010
the plane I was in would get shot and
some of everyone in the plane would

833
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:08,390
survive, but I fall out the
bottom through the damn book.

834
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,440
I'll entertain the troops. Okay.
I've done it a bunch of times,

835
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:15,650
but I've done it over here. I don't,
I don't do away games. I'm like,

836
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:20,060
Roger Clemens when he played for
the Astros. Okay, I'm on steroids.

837
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:24,440
I'm cheating on my wife and I
don't fucking pitch in Iraq.

838
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,560
I'll be honest with you, I'm terrified
to go over there. There you go. Okay.

839
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,880
That's why you were fucking marine and
I'm a civilian and I respect you and uh,

840
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,660
you know, I'll fucking, uh, you could
listen to these podcasts and Iraq,

841
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,790
you know what I mean? What am I,
what am I fucking, Chuck Norris

842
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,390
doesn't mean getting all defensive
because I don't have the balls to go,

843
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,890
but yeah, that's basically it. Yeah.

844
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,580
I don't want to go over there and then
somehow get kidnapped and end up being,

845
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:52,750
you know, rocking back and forth gently
in an orange jumpsuit is there, you know,

846
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,210
is there reading shit about our lot and
then they saw my fucking head off and

847
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,450
I'm really sitting there going like, you
know what, why, why did I come over here?

848
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:05,330
Um, okay, moving on. Question number one.

849
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,560
That was one a. Okay. Uh,

850
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:12,350
did you do a voice on grand theft
auto four. There was a biker dude,

851
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:15,620
that sounds just like you. If it
wasn't you, you got to check it out.

852
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,000
Actually yes I did.

853
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,810
I did do a voiceover on that and it was
a big thrill to do that and I got to

854
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:26,130
give a big thanks to uh,

855
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:29,180
to Laszlo for hooking me up and uh,

856
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,990
Jimmy Norton for hooking me
up with the OPN Anthony show.

857
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,300
Cause that's how I met Laszlo. And then
I got in there to do the boys over.

858
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,690
Um, see how that works.
Uh, question number two,

859
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,860
I noticed you have Strikeforce
MMA in your top friends.

860
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:49,630
I was wondering who are a couple
of your favorite MMA fighters? Um,

861
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,110
that's just a friend I accepted and then
I guess they switched their picture.

862
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:59,780
Mixed martial arts. Um, I dunno,
I do watch the, I I watch,

863
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:04,280
uh, what do I watch? I
watch the UFC fights.

864
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,180
I watch,
I watched their reality show,

865
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:12,800
which of course I can't remember the
name of the ultimate fighter this,

866
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:16,340
this season where they have to fight
their way just to get into the house.

867
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,780
And uh,
what the fuck's his name there?

868
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,710
The junk yard dog. I'm getting them
fucking confused with old time wrestlers.

869
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,240
Who's the guy who knocked out chuck light?
Dell,

870
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,270
the fucking guy who goes out and
then kicks the shit out of you.

871
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,570
Where's the chain and Shit,
you know, beats the fuck out
of people. Randy Jackson.

872
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,340
Yeah. And then the other guy with the
fucking, you don't want to fuck with me.

873
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:43,720
Cauliflower ears.
You know,

874
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,350
actually have a theory that if you just
say you don't even need to get the black

875
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:46,621
belt.

876
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:50,010
If you just have some somebody's box
your ears and you get those cauliflower

877
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:50,281
ears,

878
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:53,580
no one's going to fuck with you in a bar
because they just look at those fucked

879
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:57,330
up ears, those exploded vegetable
ears and they're just like,

880
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:59,460
that guy could fucking snap my neck.

881
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:04,490
Choke me out and give me the superman
punch with a flying knee all at the same

882
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:09,180
fucking time. I even answer the question.
Who are some of my favorite ones?

883
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:14,010
Uh, I liked Matt Serra. I
love the shit he talked about.

884
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,550
Uh,
and what's his face was Saint Pierre.

885
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,800
That's the kind of shape
I would like to be in

886
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,930
for my 40th birthday that evidently I'll
be contemplating in downtown Raleigh,

887
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:28,620
North Carolina. All right. You know what,
this podcast is starting to seem long,

888
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:31,650
so when we let me blow through these
next fucking questions. All right.

889
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:32,371
Number three,
Bill,

890
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:35,460
did you hook up with any
of the stewardesses at the
airport from last week's

891
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:38,520
podcast? Oh yeah. I hooked up
with all three of them and they,

892
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,670
we had a fucking foursome right
out in the open, you know,

893
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,560
and that didn't violate any new
fucking Patriot Act. Now I didn't.

894
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:51,070
And um, thanks for bringing
that up. Okay. I don't know.

895
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,920
I was going to go off
and say what's up to him,

896
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:55,620
but there was something about
their blue panty hose that just,

897
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,220
I really found it intimidating.
Question number four. I was wondering,

898
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:03,390
since you're such a big, such a, a
bug sports fan, a big sports fan,

899
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:07,980
what is your best sports
memory from your childhood?

900
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:12,990
Um, well fuck that. Let's go
with something funnier then. Uh,

901
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,640
how about, uh, he, his
my best, my best? Fuck,

902
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,810
he's a good sports memory. When the, uh,
when the New England Patriots beat the,

903
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:25,920
the Los Angeles Raiders,
um,

904
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:31,890
what was it, 1985 the year we get,
we get destroyed in the Superbowl.

905
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,270
We were a wildcard. And, uh,
that's what we beat the jets.

906
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,390
And then the next week we'd beat, look
at me with a memory, beat the jets,

907
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,570
and then we'd beat the Raiders.
And I went down to the,

908
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,510
the airport in Providence,
Rhode Island and a,

909
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,110
it was like me and like
only 70 other people at this
point, you know, and we met,

910
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:55,770
have all the players as they got off
the plane, all the old school guys,

911
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:56,760
Julius Adams,

912
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:01,290
I remember somebody reaching over and
slamming him really hard on his shoulder,

913
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,560
like hitting them way too hard.
And he fucking looked at me like I did it.

914
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,010
And I was like, oh, I went to the mayor.
It was the guy behind me. But, uh,

915
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:11,700
that was the first time I saw a
bunch of athletes up close. Uh,

916
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,340
Tony Easten completely expressionless.

917
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:18,810
I remember he was wearing a butterscotch
members only jacket. I swear to God.

918
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,970
Um,

919
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,460
and he looked like he was on his way to
home depot and right down I should have

920
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:29,320
known that he was going to get crushed in
the Superbowl. But, um, I would say that,

921
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:32,500
you know what, Bruins Games,
the first Bruins games and
went to the Boston Garden.

922
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,060
I used to always go to Bruins.

923
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:38,560
Canadians actually went to that bench
clearing brawl. If you go on a youtube,

924
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,050
it's the one where Chris and island,
uh,

925
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,880
was that the game where he hit Rick
Middleton and the teeth with this thick.

926
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,620
And then as he was walking off,
that's right.

927
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:51,910
He walked off the ice and then he pushed
dot 10 landsman who chased them down.

928
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,130
And next thing you know,
there was a bench clearing brawl.

929
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:57,900
And Terry O'reilly in his
suit was grabbing onto
somebody and never more quad.

930
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,230
I was good. All right, I'm just babbling
here. I'll just wait for my plumber.

931
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,300
10 23 motherfuckers still
down here. Okay. Uh,

932
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:10,780
wow. I'm getting bored with
myself here in number five. Uh,

933
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,780
what do you think of the comedy genre?
Anti humor,

934
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,760
like the type by Neil Hamburger and ted.
I don't know those guys.

935
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:23,470
I watched him and uh, they seem
funny to me, you know, I dunno.

936
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,640
It's not anti humor is it? I Dunno
who gives a fuck. All right. Uh,

937
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:32,230
so I was watching one of these in tool.
Who's throwing food at you?

938
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:35,680
I already answered that. That's
a donut. It's a donut hole.

939
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,920
If you see the video on my
page was a group of people,

940
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:42,130
they were a advertisers.
They all worked at the same place.

941
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:44,770
I started trashing him and they
threw a doughnut hole. Let me,

942
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,760
and evidently I didn't give
a fuck. Um, number seven,

943
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,580
when you have these horrible
thoughts about people,

944
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:54,100
are you able to keep your face stoic,
mine,

945
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:58,690
wrinkles up and I don't notice
until the person looks at me. If so,

946
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:00,790
how do you play it off? Um, no,

947
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:04,310
I'm usually cursing like what
I think is under my breath,

948
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:06,280
but out loud and then
they look right at me.

949
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:10,240
I literally walked through like an
airport, go and look at this fucking guy.

950
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,470
Fuck kind of shirt.
Is that,

951
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,930
and I think I'm kind of doing
it in my head or whispering,

952
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:17,110
but I'm saying it loud enough that they
look right at me and then I look away,

953
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,930
which is pretty pathetic. Okay. Which is,

954
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,420
you know what this podcast is
getting pathetic is way too long.

955
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,660
Let's get the thing.
Okay. My DVD, the dog,

956
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:30,690
the big announcement is going to be
coming out in September of 2008 and the my

957
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:33,251
DVD,

958
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:38,251
my a one hour special will also be shown
on comedy central in September of 2008.

959
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:45,430
So I have all summer to write
some, uh, to write some new jokes,

960
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,620
which I already have already got a whole
new hour. So, uh, all right. This podcast,

961
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,270
I mean minutes is this.
Yeah,

962
00:58:52,271 --> 00:58:55,480
this podcast is really fucking long and
I didn't even get to half the shit I

963
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:59,920
want to talk about. I want to tell you
guys how I was back to drinking Budweiser.

964
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,240
I've come full circle. I actually,
I started off with Michelob light,

965
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,960
then it quickly went to Budweiser and
then throughout the years I switched to

966
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:08,794
vodka.

967
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:13,300
Then I ended up with fucking Johnny
Walker Black and now I'm right back to

968
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:15,730
Budweiser again.
And uh,

969
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:18,520
I guess that was the moment at the Johnnie
Walker black where I was supposed to

970
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,320
admit that I had a problem
and stop cold Turkey.

971
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:25,820
But evidently I'm going to run the cycle
all over again and go back and start

972
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:30,550
dating some of the same psychos
that I, I dated, you know what?

973
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,011
Next week,

974
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:34,250
I'll tell you the story about me getting
arrested for drinking and driving back

975
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:35,880
and fucking June,
no,

976
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
December of 1989 I was on my way back
from Boston college to go watch the

977
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:46,811
Patriots play fucking the Los Angeles
Rams Cause I get season tickets.

978
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:52,230
Who knew they were going to be five
and 11? Um, anyways, so that's the pot,

979
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,690
you know, it started off
fucking, it started off strong.

980
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:02,260
I was trashing the art of plumbing and
a dead Karen Carpenter and then it just

981
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:05,480
sort of tapered off. I, you know, and
I don't want to happen, I shut up,

982
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,970
fucking quit while I was ahead.
But anyways,

983
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,600
thanks to everyone who listened to these
podcasts, I really appreciate it. And, uh,

984
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,910
he would actually, you know,
something, if you enjoy my podcast,

985
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:17,240
could you please let people know
about them? Because, uh, you know,

986
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:20,030
I burn up a lot of minutes every
week on my fucking cell phone.

987
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:24,760
I'm getting brain cancer and I'm
talking to like 15 people. And um,

988
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,940
I'd like to break 20.

989
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,360
If I could get it up to 20 people
before June 10th when I turned 40,

990
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,250
that would make me feel a whole
lot better. All right. So, uh,

991
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,990
thanks to everybody who,
uh,

992
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,300
who has been listening and uh,
sorry to all the Karen Carpenter fans,

993
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:46,400
I'm sorry to people who are
plumbers. Actually, you know
what? I'm not sorry. Okay.

994
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,090
I'm not fucking sorry, because
one of your, I'll, I'll be sorry.

995
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:53,630
When some you guys from the plumber's
union have a little talking to,

996
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:55,640
it's 10 20 fucking seven.

997
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:02,390
I started this podcast at 10 oh three.
So there's a 24 minute podcast.

998
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,210
I was hoping that the guy was going
to walk in during the middle of it,

999
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,840
and we could have a little
reality show moment what he did.

1000
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:10,400
And you don't probably have
when you first walked up,

1001
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:13,250
halfway through the stairs and hurt me
bitching about fucking plumbers on my

1002
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:17,900
podcast. He didn't hear me talking to
anybody, so he thought it was crazy,

1003
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,490
or I was berating my wife,
my nonexistent wife.

1004
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:28,790
Oh God. Look at it. Boom. Look at the
fucking gloom out the window. All right,

1005
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,810
that's it. So please come out and
see me. Uh, Chicago would Zane,

1006
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:36,440
he's this week or Caroline's in New York
City at the end of the month or at a

1007
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,110
good nights and Raleigh, North
Carolina or the punchline in Atlanta,

1008
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:42,440
Georgia next month. All
right. Your mother fuckers.

1009
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,210
I have a CD up on, uh, iTunes
called emotionally unavailable,

1010
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:51,020
the expanded edition. Why don't
you, uh, go there, buy it,

1011
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:56,080
buy for friend five for
plumber. Fucking, uh,

1012
01:01:56,210 --> 01:02:00,530
break the CD and half stab him and
his juggler. He's late and that's it.

1013
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,040
That's the Monday morning podcast

1014
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,683
the next week.

1015
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,683
Ooh,

1016
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:45,843
okay.

1017
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,910
[inaudible]

1018
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:50,450
[inaudible].
