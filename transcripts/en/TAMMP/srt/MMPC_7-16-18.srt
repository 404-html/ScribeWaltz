1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,970
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,190
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:10,750
July 16th,
2018 what's going on?

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,700
How was,
yeah,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,310
how you doing? It's Sunday
afternoon when I'm recording this,

6
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,840
so I'm still in Seattle, Washington.
I've yet to do by shows up here.

7
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:27,790
I'm imagining that they're going to
go pretty well. Um, I was in Portland,

8
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:31,030
Oregon last night. Jesus
Christ. Great shows,

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,410
amazing people coming out. You know,
even though I tease them a little bit,

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,770
you know, I was making fun of
some of the people in Portland.

11
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:42,910
Do you know what I like? What really
amazes me about this generation,

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,900
or actually maybe like the,
I guess the past 10 years,

13
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:51,901
it's just the amount of shit that guys
do in their twenties and that like if I

14
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:56,080
did it back in my twenties I would
get the shit kicked out of me.

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,370
It's really unbelievable. Is
it bill, how about an example?

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,570
I'll give you an example. I was coming
over from Portland airport, by the way,

17
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,230
the first time I've ever landed here or
ever landed important one I should say,

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,830
where it was actually
just sunny and beautiful.

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,610
Like I believe my first
aborted landing I ever had.

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,413
MMM.

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,560
Wasn't Portland, Oregon. It was fucking
raining and the guy was coming in,

22
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:27,140
there was all this wind shear and then
he just fucking went up and around again

23
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:30,710
and we were all like, dude, what the fuck?
And I'm this old guy who was just like,

24
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:34,820
you don't take as many chances as you
need many times as you need or whatever.

25
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,940
It's like, just get this bucket thing
on the ground. Everybody kind of left.

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,390
So this was the first time that was way
back when I was working fucking happy.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,340
It's comedy club down the street.
Um,

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,020
which is a really interesting gig cause
the guy who ran it back in the day,

29
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,870
you know,
he would paper the entire room,

30
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,670
which means he would give the show a way.

31
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:02,330
So you go in and on a Tuesday and the
place would be packed with people who,

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,920
you know, one, a comedy show, you
know what I mean? So it was weird.

33
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:11,330
It was like doing this giant office party
and you do one Tuesday, one Wednesday,

34
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,930
one Thursday to Friday,
three Saturday and then one on Sunday.

35
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,770
And uh, but the cool thing is I
got to hang in Portland all week,

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,600
check out all these cool
places to eat and now, um,

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,910
I kind of dip in and dip out. But
that's that, that's an old story.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,020
So anyway,

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,220
so getting back to what the fuck I saw
it driving from the airport from Oregon,

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,710
from Oregon, from Portland airport over
into my fucking hotel. I swear to God,

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,400
I saw two guys in their 20s on a bicycle,
built for two.

42
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,340
And then behind the guy,
those two guys was another guy.

43
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:50,100
Do you remember those cars when you
were a kid? If he had like a toy car,

44
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,510
you got it, got in it right? It's made all
let them metal and then you pedaled it.

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,510
Yeah.
This guy had an adult version of that car.

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,950
I'm riding behind

47
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,530
the two guys on a bicycle built for two.

48
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:08,160
Now this might seem harsh
and I might seem old school,

49
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:11,490
but shouldn't they be getting
the shit kicked out of them?

50
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,980
I know in a perfect world they should
be able to do whatever makes them happy.

51
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:24,321
But there's just something about that VA
[inaudible] where you're so begging for

52
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,254
attention.

53
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,450
Okay.

54
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,520
You know what I mean?
You just can't get on a bicycle.

55
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,530
It's gotta be a bicycle built for two.

56
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,170
It's gotta be a little toy car and you're
a fucking adult in it with your God

57
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:37,460
damn hipster beard. Like, I dunno,

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,050
I'm really disappointed with the bullies
in the millennial generation. You know,

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,300
you're,
you're letting a lot of stuff slide.

60
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,660
Is he advocating bullying something?

61
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:51,850
Yeah,

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,740
a fucking spit ball.
Anything. I mean, I, I just,

63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,670
I was in the middle of the
pack when I was in school.

64
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,560
I got bullied and I bullied some kids.
You know, I was right in the fucking bill.

65
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,280
You know, I was background. I
wasn't cool. I wasn't a nerd.

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,460
I was just one of those people
that filled out your class picture.

67
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,450
That's all the fuck I was, you know?
And I just felt like this pressure,

68
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:19,510
like that somebody is not doing
the job needs to get done.

69
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:20,820
Yeah.

70
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,680
I felt like sticking
my head out the window,

71
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:26,430
like fucking ogre in that
goddamn movie and just be like,

72
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,140
just something.
I mean,

73
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,570
how as an adult are you supposed to sit
there and talking to another adult with

74
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,900
a waxed mustache and
never fucking bring it up?

75
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,260
You know, I, I don't know

76
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,800
that shit. I Dunno. It's, it's
really is like, it's like how

77
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,030
okay

78
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,030
bored are you as a fucking person that
you have to like become like a character.

79
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:04,410
Like you go back and you watch a beer
commercial from the late seventies,

80
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:05,250
early eighties,

81
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:08,430
and then you just decide that
you're going to dress like that guy,

82
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,680
but she's still going to be your douchey
self, but you're going to have, you know,

83
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,920
his mustache and Hairdo and tee shirt.

84
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,770
It's really fucking weird.
I don't know.

85
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,680
Okay.

86
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,020
I Dunno. Just the shit
that bothers me. Um,

87
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,520
I'm having sort of a anger relapse.
I was doing so well

88
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,000
and the other day I snapped in the car
when this fucking person just, you know,

89
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,690
took them like nine tries to parallel park

90
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,730
and if actually felt
weird to yell in the car,

91
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:45,150
cause I hadn't in a good three weeks.
So I tried to get an in check,

92
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:48,690
but I think I let the fucking genie
out of the bottle. So I need to uh,

93
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,480
sit down and work on myself again.

94
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:54,660
Because today when we were flying
from Portland up to Seattle,

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,280
you know,
we were boarding

96
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,113
the plane

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,030
and um,

98
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,340
I was in the first group, you
know, after people in the military,

99
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,710
people with disabilities,
people with kids,

100
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,510
people with dogs that make them
feel like it's okay to fly.

101
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,630
Uh,
people with acne problems.

102
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:19,840
Like I don't know how many fucking groups
around now before group one boards,

103
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,520
group one is really like group 26
at this point, right? You know,

104
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,660
it's blue shirt Fridays. Anybody with
a blue shirt can now board anyway, so,

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,980
okay,

106
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,930
we walked out onto the tarmac to board,
right?

107
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:39,670
And I see this woman in front
of me, he has stopped, you know,

108
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,920
it's like when these deals where you
walk outside to get on the plane and

109
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,050
there's this little zigzag sorta ramp,

110
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:47,890
you have to walk up and she stopped while
this flight attendant is helping this

111
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:52,180
other woman up there. So I'm
thinking in my head, well you know,

112
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:54,670
she didn't tell me to stop so I'm
going to walk around this lady,

113
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:58,900
I was kind of being a Douche and I went
to walk around her and she fucking stuck

114
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,610
her hand out like that.
She told me to wait,

115
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:02,170
she kinda like hit me with their hands.

116
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,500
She did like the mother
thing and she was like

117
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,583
old,

118
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,690
like white hair and shit and like the
shit that went through my fucking head,

119
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,090
not initially when she hit me,
I was just surprised like what the fuck?

120
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:17,924
She just hit me.

121
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,293
MMM.

122
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,720
Oh my God.
The level that I judged her.

123
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,190
Okay.

124
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,290
I was like,
is that how you got up in the first class?

125
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,590
You fucking competitive cont you know?
Meanwhile,

126
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,710
I was going to walk around her and I knew
I was supposed to wait and I was being

127
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,370
a Douche.

128
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,400
I just kept playing it over my head that
I just wished I walked right through

129
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:41,930
her little fucking stiff arm
that she gave me. And um,

130
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,800
I ended up sitting behind her on
the plane and in my, my, in my,

131
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,660
my brain's telling me to hit the back
of her chair to rattle her head a little

132
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,880
bit, but you know, the, the, the
rest of my brain's going through it.

133
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,820
It's an old woman. Why are you
letting her get to you like this?

134
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,550
And then when we landed, I was
thinking like, she's not married,

135
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,530
just no fucking way any
guys putting up with her.

136
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:05,470
And then it looked and she had a
wedding ring and it was just like, uh,

137
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,270
the fuck is wrong with some somewhat
getting off the plane now we'll walk down

138
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,104
one of those ramps.

139
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,020
And I was actually laughing at myself
because I knew I was going to have to pass

140
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:18,330
her and get into the airport before her,
you know,

141
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,670
just to somehow make up for
that fucking moment. Right.

142
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,620
How fucking stupid is that?
And then I do it.

143
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,300
I turned around and
glance and look at her.

144
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:29,280
She doesn't even know that I exist and
I wasted all of that energy. You know?

145
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,660
It probably took probably,
I don't know,

146
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,820
40 seconds off my life
with that level of just,

147
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,660
you know,
it was like legit hate.

148
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,690
Like I hate this person.
I mean, I don't like,

149
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,400
so she, she fucking touch me, you know,
what am I, what are you supposed to do it?

150
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,930
You don't want me to just say,
Hey d yell at some Old Lady.

151
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,520
Get your fucking hands off
me lady. Ah, do it again.

152
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,720
You'll never make another
batch of cookies. I mean, what,

153
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:07,640
what exactly am I supposed to be
doing there? I just, you know,

154
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,000
I created that whole situation

155
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,620
and I've really, if I'm
honest, looking back,

156
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,420
I knew that she was flying first class,

157
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:23,421
so she was probably on some
level of lunatic and I,

158
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,330
and a control freak. And I kind
of knew that if I went around her,

159
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:28,141
it was going to bugger.

160
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:32,760
I just did not anticipate her giving
me the flare chop when I tried to go

161
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,820
pastor.
So I kinda got what I deserved.

162
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,323
Oh Man.

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,060
I can't believe how upset I let that
get me and I created the whole fucking

164
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:49,380
thing. I really am a pathetic
human being, but um, you know,

165
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,450
it makes for a good story.
You know,

166
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:55,740
it helps fill up a podcast sitting here
in the hotel room. Right. Oh, by the way.

167
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:58,350
So I'm at,
I'm in the airport,

168
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,920
we know before this lady gave
me the flare chop and, uh,

169
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,090
the World Cup final is like
happening and I'm taping it at home.

170
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,380
And it is so not a big deal
in this airport that I can
actually walk in public.

171
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:17,040
Well, the super bowl of the world
is being played and no one's,

172
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,890
there's no spoiler alert. Nothing.
No one had it on. It wasn't on,

173
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:26,580
on any TV. I didn't see anybody watching
the fucking game on their phone.

174
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,220
If I didn't go on Instagram, I wouldn't
even know who won this fucking insane.

175
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,480
But anyways, I guess
France one. All right.

176
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:41,400
Congratulations. What do they
say? I Lay, lay, lay blue, right.

177
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,900
I Layla blue, congratulations to
France and congratulations to Croatia.

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,040
A country of what? 4.1 million
people according to Pete Davidson

179
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,100
and his Instagram page, um, that they
got that far was fucking incredible.

180
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,880
Um,

181
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,260
and I knew I was going to be happy with
either person winning and I obviously

182
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,320
love France and, uh, Croatia was the
underdog, so I was rooting for them,

183
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:08,010
but I did not see the game.
I heard there was an own goal,

184
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
you know, fortunately he didn't
do that in South America,

185
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,870
so I think he has a chance when it
gets back to his hometown, but, uh,

186
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,910
they lost by two goals anyways.
What the fuck are you going to do?

187
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,000
But I did not see it. But, um,

188
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,930
I did in this world club become a soccer
fan and I've gone from not giving a

189
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,931
fuck to wanting to Google where the
next World Cup is going to be so I can

190
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:31,930
actually go.
Um,

191
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,260
and I'll go there with 40 other Americans
if our team makes it and will cheer

192
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:39,120
them on until they lose in
the first fucking round or
whatever the fuck happens.

193
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,950
Um, so anyways, I'm up here in
Seattle, Portland, and Seattle. Well,

194
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:49,470
you know, two of my favorite cities.
What are your favorite cities? Oh,

195
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:52,680
glad you asked a Portland,
Seattle.

196
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,650
I say Seattle over Portland,
you know?

197
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:00,620
Okay.

198
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,460
They're both nice. Portland just has a
little more of a hipster Douche factor,

199
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,350
you know, it was sort of a tie. And
then when I saw that guy in the bice,

200
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,570
the two guys in the bicycle built for two
with the kid with the Kitty car behind

201
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:15,650
it, I says, I was like, I fucking
can't. All right. You know,

202
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,470
and then you come to Seattle and you got
the new world order, hippies. I mean,

203
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:23,360
there's a lot up here to kind of be
annoyed with, but a beautiful cities,

204
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,950
lush land, all kinds of water. And
that's just amazing up here. Um,

205
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,210
San Francisco,
Los Angeles.

206
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,330
Okay.

207
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,620
Milwaukee, Minneapolis,
Chattanooga, Tennessee.

208
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,300
These are my favorites.

209
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,850
MMM.

210
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
Obviously I'm from Boston.

211
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,010
Uh,

212
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,980
Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Pittsburgh.

213
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,413
MMM.

214
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,810
I think that's it. The rest of the towns
can all go fuck himself. Kidding. Tulsa,

215
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:00,710
Oklahoma.

216
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,840
What's,
what's my favorite one in Texas?

217
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,460
I'm going there in two weeks.
I'm going to fucking Houston,

218
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,840
Texas in July as a redheaded bald male.
The fuck was I thinking?

219
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,780
Houston. Dallas, San Antonio.
Austin college station.

220
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,963
Okay.

221
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,210
I Dunno. It's, they're
all kind of the same.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,410
Okay.

223
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,290
It's flat.
This,

224
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,300
the most shiny is new pickup trucks
you've ever seen in your life.

225
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,780
I've never seen so many shiny brand new
pickup trucks in my four door pickup

226
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,970
trucks in my life.
They looked like they just,

227
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,670
they just got taken right
off the showroom floor.

228
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,463
MMM.

229
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,780
Can you hear my stomach growl? And by the
way, I'm having a steak dinner tonight,

230
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:59,980
so I just ate light like an hour and
a half ago. I had a soup and a salad,

231
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,640
fucking old bastard. Um, by the way,

232
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:08,140
I'm up to 70 pounds on the lat pull
down machine. Ah, you liked that?

233
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,380
The fucking rotator cup is a
rehab and a person helped me out,

234
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:19,120
told me I need to get up to about 120
pounds on that thing and I have to do it

235
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,850
really slowly so I don't fucking
blow up my shoulder again.

236
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:25,930
I've got one 20 then I can attempt to
do for pull ups and I'm back in the game

237
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,150
cause I have a bet with
Versie that when I'm 70,

238
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:32,380
I'll be able to do 10 of them and uh,
that's not going to be a fucking problem.

239
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,920
Yeah,

240
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,420
that's what I'm saying. It's 50.
We'll see. That's a long 20 years man.

241
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,910
And I'll tell you all depends
on how I do it. You know,

242
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,130
if I live my life the way I did last
month, I won't be able to do to pull ups.

243
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,350
I don't even know if I'll
be around to do pull ups.

244
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,220
If I live my life the way I'm
living at this month, you know,

245
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,860
I might do 15 I'm crushing it.

246
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:57,670
This month was 16 days in,
Oh,

247
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:01,960
freckles hasn't had a drop of booze,
said shutting it down.

248
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,640
I shut it down for a month.

249
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,160
Give yourself a good fucking month then
ease myself back into my binge drinking.

250
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,190
I can't tell you this though. I have
never caught a fucking cold like this cold

251
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,540
that I caught in Minneapolis and into a
whatever the fuck I went after that to

252
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,010
Troy Jesus Christ.

253
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,010
This thing has been lingering.

254
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,570
I caught it on like June 30th and I was
sick for a week and now it's just been

255
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:38,270
lingering like, uh, I dunno.

256
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,630
I don't know if I need to lay off dairy
or something to get the last little bit

257
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:42,464
out of it.

258
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,040
Last night I was on stage and I started
like cough in my throat was getting all

259
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:50,690
fucking dry. I Dunno. I'm
sure you guys out there,

260
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:54,890
none of whom are doctors all have
a fucking reason why. You know,

261
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,700
maybe I'm just an old bastard.
Speaking of that,

262
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:03,420
speaking of being an old bastard,
I put the TV on and this hotel,

263
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,950
this hotel is really fucking annoying.
You know,

264
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:08,010
like I wanted to order room service and a
sec. Where's the menu? Where's the menu?

265
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:09,480
I can't find the menu.
So I called them up,

266
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:14,220
they got the men used on
the TV sound like, okay,

267
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,050
all right, well I'm not
going to get upset, you know,

268
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,210
but getting up to upset lately,
let's just,

269
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,900
this is the way the kids do it nowadays.
Let's do that. And I go on there, right?

270
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,800
And you know God damn well that the
fucking thing is on the TV cause it cause

271
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,560
they want you to solve. They want
you to order through the fucking TV.

272
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:35,850
So they have that information.
What's his name? Who is he?

273
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,250
How old is he?
What food does he eat?

274
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,020
We've gathered all of this fucking
information. What kind of porn?

275
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:44,460
Oh does he watch? Did he rent a movie?
All of this fucking inflammation,

276
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,700
that dimension that probably watching
you through that little fucking camera on

277
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:51,630
the TV too. And then they just bundle
it all together and they sell it.

278
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,000
So I didn't know where to throw the
TV I called instead that probably got

279
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:01,890
something connected to the phone. It's
just funny. It's fucking unbelievable.

280
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,180
I would, can you imagine if
you actually read the file,

281
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:07,850
okay.

282
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,020
You know on yourself that
these corporations have
like the amount of fucking

283
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,490
information that they have about you.

284
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,220
And if they actually kept
the video cause they'd been,

285
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,120
they've gotten busted watching people
in the, in their fucking houses,

286
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,400
watching people in their houses watching
TV. What if you're banging your wife,

287
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,103
you know?

288
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,550
Well if you're walking around fucking butt
ass naked, what do they do? This is it.

289
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,880
How is that legal?
It's unfucking real man,

290
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,800
these fucking nerds and making robots
that you can fuck the down there.

291
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:46,460
Fucking them at the factory trying
them out before they sell it to us.

292
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,140
You've got these other fucking nerds,

293
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,580
they're in the goddamn
watching your fucking,

294
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:53,610
your wife and there's barely a ripple,

295
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,060
barely a fucking ripple.
But as a comedian,

296
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:01,500
if you send out a fucking tweet
that steps on somebody's toes,

297
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,380
all of a sudden you ended it just
like this big fucking dustup.

298
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,150
If I ever get in trouble for a fucking
Twitter or anything like that's going to

299
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:13,060
be my defense. Hey, hey, hey, hey guys,
guys, guys, I'm not fucking a robot.

300
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,670
Okay?
I'm not bundling your information,

301
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,060
watching your bang and your
spouse through your fucking TV.

302
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,240
Let's have some priorities.
Huh Ladies?

303
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,760
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,680
Getting all fucking amped up here again.

305
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,960
You know? Uh, all right.

306
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,640
So anyways,
so I get it.

307
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,730
I put it on the TV to try to find
the fucking menu on this TV itself.

308
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,880
Like the only way you can
like change the channels,

309
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:49,040
you have to go back to guide and
then goes to, I mean, I came,

310
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,830
I can't even figure out the fucking TV.

311
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,880
Okay,

312
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,200
this is why I hate technology and why
it felt like somewhere in the 90s they

313
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,890
just should have stopped. Quality
of life was good enough, you know?

314
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,780
But this shit where it's just like
I always equated to reading.

315
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,310
It's like I learned how to read.

316
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,610
I didn't have to relearn how to
fucking read every six months.

317
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:15,020
But like with computers and TV and shit,
that's what it's like. It's like, Hey,

318
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:19,400
I know how to turn on a TV. I know how
to operate a TV. And then the next day,

319
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,930
oh wait, no, I don't.

320
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,070
Okay.

321
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,270
Now I have to waste time.

322
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:26,090
Relearning something that it'd be like
every time you've got your fucking car,

323
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,790
you didn't have to, every six months.
Now you don't know how to drive.

324
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:33,330
You have to learn how to fucking
drive again. We get a bill.

325
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,480
You don't like technology? No, I liked
it. I liked it to a point, you know,

326
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:39,510
central air conditioning, you know,
modern medicine and that type of shit.

327
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,880
But I mean, we were, we were all
fucking good right up until, I mean,

328
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,090
what did they really cured?
And the last fucking 20 years,

329
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,530
people still die of cancer.
People still go bald, you know?

330
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,930
Uh, you know, people
still get hammer toes.

331
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,680
Okay.

332
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,460
Actually they can fix hammertoes right.
Stop hammertoes boo Doo Doo Doo. Right.

333
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,080
They can fix those fucking things,
can't they?

334
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,663
MMM.

335
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,660
Anyway,
so I get into the fucking hotel here

336
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,820
and I saw this hilarious ad for this
shit called age ageless, ageless male,

337
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,533
you know,

338
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,481
and then like,
Hey,

339
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:20,830
what'd you get over the age of 40 your
testosterone levels go down and be, yeah,

340
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,420
cause you're too old to fuck.

341
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,230
Yeah.

342
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,230
Cause no one wants to see you with your
shirt off cause you fucking old and now

343
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:31,850
people are taking these
goddamn young pills.

344
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,020
Yeah.

345
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,930
You know you want to fuck
right into your eighties.

346
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,930
You want your Dick to stand at attention.

347
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,210
You want your balls to support the troops.

348
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,970
Okay.

349
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,810
Get this fucking ageless male. All these
fucking morons pumping all this extra.

350
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,030
Isn't that how you lose your fucking hair?
Isn't like a testosterone issue.

351
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,790
Like you have too much in there.
That's going to be fucking hilarious.

352
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,310
All these guys going for abs
that had a nice set of hair,

353
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,080
then they're going to go fucking balls.

354
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,200
Now they've got to get the fucking
hair plugs. It just never ends.

355
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,060
I bet the guys who make hair plugs also
make ageless male, you know, and they,

356
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:12,400
and they've gotten all the bald guys that
gave a fuck enough to get hair plugs.

357
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:17,020
So kind of like, you know, you reached
that saturation point like remember Crocs,

358
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,440
it's just they ran out
of Douche bags to find,

359
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:27,220
to buy those things,
which by the way, man,

360
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,830
I've been like I told you
getting rid of a bunch of shit

361
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,000
and um,

362
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,680
that's all I see stuff as. No, I
just look at it like that shit.

363
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:39,180
I'm just gonna have to throw out one day,

364
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,003
you know,

365
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,800
we walked through the airport deed Delray,

366
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,330
who fucking murdered last night murder.
You hear me?

367
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,373
Murder.

368
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,720
Okay.

369
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,950
He was pointing out some store at the
airport that sells records and all this

370
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:59,980
shit. He's like, man, he's like, dude,
that starchy hills, you know, detox.

371
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,750
He fucking kills man. People go in
there and I just looked in, there I go,

372
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:06,630
that is just a bunch of shit I'm
going to have to throw out one day.

373
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,760
Okay,

374
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,680
I'm done dude. I'm not
taking anything, you know.

375
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,260
Well, I did that show like last week, uh,

376
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,600
at the Hooters upstairs in the big room.
When I left,

377
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:23,690
they tried to get me a fucking hat and
a t shirt. Say I'm all set. Thank you

378
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,583
all good.

379
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,800
Don't need that lane
around the fucking house.

380
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,860
I got so many God damn jackets.

381
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:34,440
I don't know how the fuck I
have enough fucking jackets.

382
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,330
I could close every homeless person.
That's roughly my size in Los Angeles.

383
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:42,940
The amount of jackets I have.
And um,

384
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,540
does anybody in, is there a
coat drive? It's fucking July.

385
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,690
Once the next coat drive I'm getting,
I'm going to have one winter coat,

386
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,100
one fucking spring code and then fucking
some piece of shit when it rains.

387
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,053
That's it.

388
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,700
Yeah.

389
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,350
When the fuck did I become
coat guy? I, I can't,

390
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,600
I don't even know.
I think I have like fucking 20 coats.

391
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,240
Got All his sports shit.
I'm done with it. I'm done.

392
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,790
I'm telling you right now. I want
to fucking dress like Malcolm Young,

393
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:18,480
rest his soul the rest of my life.
Jeans and a fucking plane t shirt.

394
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,500
You gotta get the plain t shirt. I'll
tell you why, even though you didn't ask,

395
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,870
is you don't have any emotional
attachment to it, right?

396
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,400
If it says the Adirondack, she like, oh,

397
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:34,360
that's where I went on my honeymoon
when I banged my wife up in the fucking

398
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:36,040
mountains.
And you can't get rid of it,

399
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,970
but if you fucked her in a plain
gray t shirt, you're not. You're not.

400
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:43,120
You don't remember that.

401
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,400
And then you know what?
You get rid of it.

402
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,200
Yeah.

403
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,010
That's what it's all about. This
said, bull of fucking vegetable soup.

404
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,243
MMM.

405
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,660
That's the age I'm at now.
People,

406
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,980
I'm 50 years old and I order a
soup and a salad and I eat it.

407
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,320
And then right afterwards
I feel like I need a nap.

408
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,940
Which is why you need ageless male.

409
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,640
You don't age naturally die when you're
supposed to and get the fuck out of the

410
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:23,450
way. All right, let me, um, maybe read
some advertising here for this week,

411
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:26,690
shall we? Shall We? Let me
read some advertising here. Um,

412
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,700
hotel tonight.

413
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,210
Okay.

414
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,170
Hotel tonight is the only booking
app you need on your phone.

415
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,050
What would,
if you want to book some other Shit,

416
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,920
what a book of fucking
stripper for a party.

417
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:45,210
I would think if there's an app for
that, you know, anyways, hotel tonight,

418
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:50,211
partners with the top rated hotels to
help them sell their unsold rooms and

419
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,500
passes those savings along to you,

420
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,150
which means you get great deals for uh,
for great rooms.

421
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,840
Unlike other hotel booking sites.
Hotel tonight

422
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,700
to net two,
not to ne,

423
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,320
Oh, I'm good. Phil Collins Song.

424
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,730
Okay, good. I make get right
to night to night. You can't

425
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,110
tell me someone was in the studio
going like, I don't know if Phil,

426
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:19,490
I don't think that just sounds annoying.
It does not sound like a fucking hit.

427
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,920
Unlike other hotel bookings hotel tonight.

428
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,040
Nay, nay, nay.

429
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,220
Oh, doesn't it? There's no fucking way
I'm singing that for the rest of this.

430
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:32,900
I apologize. Doesn't, doesn't have long,
endless list of a zillion hotel choices.

431
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:33,590
Instead,

432
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,590
hotel tonight shows you only the best
deals at the best hotels rooms or

433
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:41,780
categorize to help you find the
room that's just right for you.

434
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,360
It's like a top shelf one.
Okay.

435

game. As a World War II veteran, um,

you've definitely heard

you know the fun comfy undies and feel

perfect pair with a crowded store and

497
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,170
eventually sending
settling for good enough.

498
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,770
Me undies are made with a sustainably
sourced material from beechwood trees.

499
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:04,780
This underwear is made out of wood,

500
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,640
evidently in somehow it's
still nice against your
bulls. They're naturally soft.

501
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,641
Fiber makes a fabric that won't sag down
or write up unless you balls hang low.

502
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,580
Okay? You can't blame the
underwear, that shoe junk. Trust me.

503
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:22,090
Once you put on a pair, you'll get
it. Feel free to improvise here,

504
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:25,540
but what you love about me undies,
oh, I love the colorful way.

505
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,690
My nuts glow when I walk across the

let's give you guys a break
for me reading out loud.

520
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,250
Okay,

521
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,930
I'm going to go to our first question
here. Okay. Eastern European tour.

522
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,130
Uh,
good afternoon on the July 9th,

523
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:34,130
2000 18th podcasts and around 28 and a
half minutes in bill briefly mentions and

524
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:36,960
eastern European tour.

525
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,460
I was trying to locate specifics
on this and wasn't able to, uh,

526
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:42,294
to do so.

527
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,650
Do you have any information on this or
is it just a pipe dream at this stage?

528
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,080
Thanks. No, it's a real fucking tour.

529
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,540
Let's see here.
I don't want to name cities.

530
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,010
All right. Because I don't want
to get people all, you know,

531
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,930
thinking then I'm coming
in and then I don't,

532
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:01,960
okay.

533
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,080
Let me just see what I can do here.
Let me find a fucking email. Okay.

534
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,860
Why does it, why does it anything
with technology work for me?

535
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:14,070
Why can't I get up to the fucking
search bar here? There we go. Okay.

536
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,470
MMM.

537
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,780
Okay. Looking for Eastern
European tour, a bird,

538
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,240
a European tour. Oh no,
that's the other thing.

539
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,070
Come on, man. This was
supposed to be easy, man.

540
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,320
Okay.

541
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,020
All right. Dollar Shave
Club. Press itinerary.

542
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah,

543
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,410
no subject.
Is it this one?

544
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,570
Okay. These are the ones we were,
we were thinking about doing.

545
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,663
Okay.

546
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,140
I'm not going to say him because I
don't want you guys to get all fucking

547
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,570
excited and then I don't go.
All right. One of them rhymes.

548
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,940
Oh, is a hard one to Brian.
Um, uh, with Luda pest.

549
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,970
Another one,
Brian's with Rog.

550
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,560
Another one rhymes with a Sienna

551
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,590
for saw aunt Berlin.

552
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,200
Maybe I'm going to do Jeremy,
maybe Cologne, Slovenia,

553
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,620
Brussels.
Um,

554
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,200
and I think we're going to add some more
to that. I mean, it's maybe going to,

555
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,550
it's going to be in those areas.
Okay. Because here's the deal, dude.

556
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:37,310
If I get close to your fucking country,
you know,

557
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:41,570
just jump on a fucking train to go
over once your papers please. You know,

558
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,430
I mean, how fucking far am I supposed
to travel yet? Cons. We'll see.

559
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,960
We'll work it out. But I mean, I want
to do more dates than that. So, uh,

560
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,350
we'll see. And this guy, interestingly
loved, says Poland wants you

561
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,900
do your bill. My husband and I
have been fans for many years.

562
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:04,440
We love the podcast and of course you
specials and all the Larry's and creative

563
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:08,100
content that all things comedy is
putting out. Great stuff. Look at this.

564
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:13,350
All things comedy appealing to people
around the world, world, world, world.

565
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,900
Um, that's why we're crazy. Excited
about your upcoming Easter European tour.

566
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,680
We live in Europe,
uh,

567
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,580
Germany and Poland and think you should
consider Warsaw Poland as one of your

568
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:31,410
stops. There's a pretty lively English
language standup comedy scene here.

569
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:34,200
I love it.
Checkout a worldwide comedy,

570
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:39,201
facebook.com/worldwide comedy and
twitter.com/whatever the fuck that is.

571
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:44,100
Something about Warsaw for
some information. The food,

572
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:47,200
beer and vodka are great.
Oh

573
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,740
yeah,

574
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,220
you had me at beer and vodka.
Um,

575
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,960
you'll see the scars of World War Two
and Soviet occupation all over the place.

576
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,840
For example,
on the city streets and highways.

577
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,210
Driving can be a serious hazard.

578
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:05,900
A driving with bill special edition
episode would be really funny.

579
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:07,870
Okay.

580
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,510
I could possibly do that.
Um,

581
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,220
for some reason they wrote WRL like
roar claw is a great university.

582
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,980
I taught the civil war,
so wrong. Roar claw.

583
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,780
Okay.

584
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,470
He's a great university city
with an awesome history,

585
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:28,910
which we know interests you.

586
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,300
It used to be called Breslau and it was
one of the Nazi strongholds at the end

587
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:36,770
of World War II.

588
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:42,090
You can Google fet Sung Breslow or
CG of Breslov for some of the insane

589
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:46,930
backstory. I will definitely
be doing that. Uh, in fact,

590
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:49,930
the Nazis evacuated the city
as the allies were approaching,

591
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,920
they evacuated the citizens to Dresden,
Germany,

592
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:58,570
where they were mostly all
killed in allied firebombing.
Yeah, in Dresden. Yeah.

593
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,430
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

594
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:05,140
Whoever lost World War II was going
to be tried for war crimes. Um,

595
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,570
there was all kinds of evil done in that.
Also,

596
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:12,571
this is one of the cities where the
solidarity movement started in 1980 which

597
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:17,110
contributed to the collapse of
communism. Oh, I remember that guy.

598
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:20,390
That guy with the big mustache.
He,

599
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,160
he got you guys all mobilized over there.
I forget the guy's name.

600
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:26,820
Plus there were like 400 dwarf
statues hidden all around the city.

601
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,360
Weird but cool. Anyways, we hope
you'll consider adding Poland's.

602
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:34,140
You're eastern European tour. We wish you
the best. Thanks for the great content,

603
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,450
uh, you and the ATC network
or putting out we love it. Ps,

604
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,460
your name and Polish would be
either the hick or the solution.

605
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,970
Ah, fuck I can, I can eat.
Just buy those names alone.

606
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:52,830
I can hear the fucking weight.

607
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:54,990
Then I'm going to fucking be
putting on when I go over there,

608
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,000
I can't wait to do it.
I've never been there.

609
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
Um,
you know

610
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,960
I'm going to talk to my uh,

611
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:05,730
okay

612
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,100
to my agent again on
Monday about this shit.

613
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,860
I mean I might as well do as many as I
can. When the fuck am I ever going to be

614
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,210
back. All right. And uh,

615
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,151
so here's the deal.

616
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm going to go over there and all
I need is you can't spend a show up,

617
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,430
all right?

618
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,880
Cause I know the over there eating some
fucking bratwurst and fucking Poland in

619
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:29,610
front of three. God Damn people going.

620
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:33,810
Where were the ones that sent the emails?
Nobody else gave a fuck.

621
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,790
All right. Legal Zoom, everybody
becoming a successful business owner.

622
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,480
It doesn't just happen. It
takes hard work. God dammit.

623
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,230
You hear that ladies with all your bitch
moaning and complaining about how easy

624
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:50,070

626
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,920

let anything get in your way.

regulations she needs someone that has

629

Um, and lastly, but not

645
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:59,600
Mvmt you guys have heard
me talk about movement.

646
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,630
Okay.

647
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,110
You know those two college dropouts
that started their own watch company

648
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:08,370
movement watches start at just
95 bucks at a department store.

649
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,670
You're looking at four to
500 bucks movement figured
out that by selling online

650
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:18,120
they were able to cut out the middleman
and retail markup providing the best

651
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,370
possible price.
Classic design,

652
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:24,750
quality construction in styled minimalism,
minimalism,

653
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,620
movement, watches are all about looking
good and keeping it simple. Man.

654
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,600
Movement watches don't tell you how many
steps you've taken or blow your wrist

655
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:37,410
up with text messages,
parentheses you up.

656
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,610
Uh, it tells that that's probably the
worst example they could have done.

657
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:43,830
Cause that sounds like you're
going to get late. Uh, it,

658
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,060
it's time and it looks good doing it
tells time it looks good doing it.

659
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,051
If relevant.

660
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:53,310

intrusive on life with notifications,

text messages, email, et cetera. We, I
mean, you already have it on your phone.

662
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,240
Yeah,

663
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,920

a hat. As they say in the writer's room.

Okay.

670
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,450
I was actually going to order
a movie, hit him and the, uh,

671
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,670
the hotel room here and for whatever
fucking reason they want 24 99.

672
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,160
Yeah.

673
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,140
SECC has nobody's going
to the movies anymore,

674
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:36,310
so they're trying to make back the
fucking budget of the movie. Um,

675
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,310
I actually worked on a movie this week.

676
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:41,870
Okay.

677
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:46,130
Written by and directed by
the one and only Steve Byrne.

678
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,860
You got me a couple of days on his movie.

679
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,570
An old freckles went down there and,
uh,

680
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,130
I played a cunt, so it wasn't much
of a stretch. I wasn't really acting.

681
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,280
I just sort of did what
the fuck I normally do. Um,

682
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,141
anyways,
do you want,

683
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:11,450
the great thing about not drinking is
aside waking up fresh as a goddamn daisy.

684
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:15,440
I mean, my freckles glow when I
wake up when I'm not drinking is

685
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:16,790
okay.

686
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,180
I got on the plane and I landed
and I went down and I worked out.

687
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,110
Yeah.

688
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,850
And then took a fucking steam and
I'm knocking out my podcast here.

689
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,760
I would not have done this.
Granted,

690
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,300
I don't have any crazy stories
about going into bars and shit,

691
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,020
which of feeds the podcast,
you know,

692
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:40,520
but at some point I just have to
make a decision here. You know,

693
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,980
am I going to wake up sober

694
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,530
with a less funny podcast or
am I going to keep boozing

695
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,260
and continue to crush the podcast game?

696
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,690
No kidding.
Um,

697
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,110
I actually have no idea where
my podcast is in the overall I,

698
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,020
all these fucking people that do
podcasts like I'm the number one fucking,

699
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,030
but they been like,
everybody's fucking number one.

700
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,220
Everybody has a million fucking downloads.
I don't want to get it.

701
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,150
How can everybody be number one,
everybody's in the fucking top 10.

702
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,950
Then I had this guy on as a guest and
it put me in the top down and fucking

703
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,130
active.
Um,

704
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,140
anyways, what the fuck
was, I just look it up.

705
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,760
I want to look up that shit about
the fucking Nazis to World War II.

706
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,520
The, the, the fucking crimes
against the shit that you read.

707
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,610
Like the shit that American troops to,

708
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,620
I read this fucking thing and this guy
shot this Japanese soldier and like eat

709
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,540
the guy couldn't like fucking move.
I don't know if he's like paralyzing.

710
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:51,740
He had gold teeth and the dude was still
alive and the fucking guy took a knife

711
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:55,130
out, was digging the gold teeth out
of the guy's mouth while he was alive.

712
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,430
And the dude was screaming
in agony and the other,

713
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,760
another American soldier went up and just
shot the guy like Jesus Christ put him

714
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:05,600
out of his fucking misery.
Crazy.

715
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,483
You know what I mean?

716
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,760
But everybody makes movies and everybody
on one side is fucking evil and

717
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,710
everybody else, dude, you can't,

718
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,740
you can't be involved in that shit
with the people go fucking nuts.

719
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,960
You know?
Especially all it is is just,

720
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:25,040
I would think that once like hook out
mad I got at that fucking old lady who

721
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,180
gave me the flare chop.

722
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:31,990
Now imagine if I was man enough
to join the armed services,

723
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,330
right? Armed Forces, whatever
the fuck you call him.

724
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,140
And I'm out there on patrol and I
see one of my friends get killed.

725
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:42,800
Like what kind of fucking moody you
going to be in after that? You know,

726
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,300
it's fucking insane and I swear to God,

727
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:52,301
the more I watched the discovery channel
and the more I watched chimpanzees

728
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:55,520
behavior, I swear to God,
just watch those fuckers.

729
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,340
Watch what the fuck they do to each other.

730
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,330
I watch what they do to other monkeys and
shit. I'm telling you telling you this,

731
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,160
that's what we are. Whenever I watched
shit on TV, I put send these for years.

732
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:10,550
I just always think of this
fucking documentary that I
watched these chimpanzees

733
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,910
and like 10 of them ganged up on
the southern chimp. They fucking

734
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,290
fuck this thing up.
Did horrible things,

735
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,540
agonizing things to this monkey killed it.

736
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,200
Then afterwards they were all fucking
amped up and it was like they were all

737
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:27,230
talking shit about what they
did in the fight. So whatever.

738
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,090
I watch shit on TV and I see like,
you know,

739
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:33,570
Trump talk in this shit or that fat
fuck there in Korea run in his fucking,

740
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,370
I swear to God, he looks like
a giant piece of fucking you.

741
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,560
Every Toros Sushi. It's like from
the softest part of the tuna,

742
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,250
like melts in your mouth.
Like God helped that guy.

743
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,850
If he's ever in a plane crash that lands
in a snowy mountain and they got to

744
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:55,050
start eating people because that
guy is going to be a prime cut.

745
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:01,770
It's all fucking marbled. You know, he's
the boss's son. He's never done shit.

746
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,253
You know,

747
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,420
isn't it funny that he walks around
that army outfit and he's like fat?

748
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,923
You know?

749
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,430
Was that when you go to the,
you know,

750
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,760
those fat people that always wear workout
clothes, that old joke. Um, anyways,

751
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:21,210
here we go. Let's read another one
here. Uh, Africa, a Billy freckled fuck.

752
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,410
Longtime Fan. Love your work,
blah, blah, blah. Listen,

753
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,770
I know you're planning on touring eastern
Europe next year we got another one.

754
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,080
Uh, but how about a tour of
South Africa? At some point,

755
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,760
if you and the lovely Nia ever managed
to make your way to this side of the

756
00:45:37,761 --> 00:45:41,630
world, please don't hesitate
to contact. Also, always know,

757
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:46,280
always wanting to know if you are friends
with Bryan Cranston or not do to your

758
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:50,390
time together on breaking bad.
Thanks so much. And Go fuck yourself.

759
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,420
Ps when he going to be on Kona.
Again, a lot of questions. All right,

760
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:54,500
let's start with Africa.

761
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,350
I love to go over there and I
could tell you this right now.

762
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,380
There's no way I would go on one of
those fucking safaris in that open car.

763
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,680
As those lines walk up looking
at you. I know they, they,

764
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,570
they say that like those lions,

765
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:16,160
like they look at the car and the
person all is like one giant thing.

766
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,710
So that's why they don't just don't jump
up and just yank somebody off to truck.

767
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:24,260
Well one of these days,

768
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:28,100
one of those lines is going to figure it
out and they're going to yank somebody

769
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:31,700
off the truck and it ain't gonna be
fucking me. I can tell you that right now.

770
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,110
Do you ever see that fucking video?
Is that uh,

771
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,980
that poor woman as an Asian family,
she didn't want to,

772
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,420
she was driving through the safari.

773
00:46:41,421 --> 00:46:44,510
She didn't want to drive and she got
out and walked around the car and I'm

774
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:49,340
telling you, man, this tiger comes into
frame frame and grabs her and yanks.

775
00:46:49,341 --> 00:46:50,660
Like I couldn't Yank

776
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:52,843
like

777
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,040
dish rag out of frame
faster than this thing.

778
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:02,070
Took this 115 pound woman out of the
frame and then like her son or something

779
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:07,201
that didn't know what to do in this
fucking hero ran over there and then he

780
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:10,990
ended up getting killed. And the other
is mom got like mall or something.

781
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:13,410
It was fucking brutal.
Fucking brutal.

782
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:17,340
So I know you probably laugh and go and
film, you know, we have cities over here.

783
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:20,880
It's not just a bunch of Lions and
tigers fucking walking around. I know,

784
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:24,180
but I'm just saying the touristy
thing to go go over there. Your,

785
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,060
you basically your zoo is the jungle.

786
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,000
Unless I'm crazy.

787
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,700
I Dunno. Anyways. Um, what was the
other thing I always wanted to know?

788
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,180
If you are friends with Brian Crane?
I'm friendly with him.

789
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:42,750
The few times I've run into him.
Have I run into him since breaking bad?

790
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:44,430
I don't think I have during breaking bad,

791
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:47,850
I ran into him at a party
with a mutual friend.

792
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,470
Um,
yeah.

793
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,590
And I don't remember ever,
I don't ever remember us coming to blows.

794
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:00,920
So I would say that we are
very friendly, but we, uh,

795
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:04,450
we don't hang if that's
what your question is. Um,

796
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,390
what am I going to be on Conan? And
again, I don't know, hopefully soon.

797
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:13,080
I fucking love Conan. I love South
Africa and in love. Bryan Cranston. Me.

798
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,040
He went three for three
here. All right. The crazies.

799
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,850
Yeah.

800
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,650
Uh, the crazies. Hey Bill,

801
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,550
the crazy little thing about you getting
called the Republican Douche is that I

802
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:28,551
see just as many people on reddit and
Twitter accusing you of being a liberal

803
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:33,060
softy. Yes. And all of that is, is,

804
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,330
is just more evidence
of what a contact him.

805
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:42,310
All right. What? I'm in La, I make fun
of Hilary. What? I'm in a red state.

806
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:45,590
I make fun of Trump,
you know,

807
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,900
I don't understand being in front of a
group of people and just saying what they

808
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:53,810
already think.
Like where is the fun in that?

809
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,710
Say The opposite of what they think and
make them mad and see if you can get

810
00:48:57,711 --> 00:49:01,180
them to stay. Right. Anyways,

811
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:06,190
it seems like people just attack and
focus on only one thing they care about.

812
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,230
As you always say, as you
always say, I love you,

813
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:13,190
congratulate on Royal Albert Hall. It's
my dream to play trumpet there. Thanks.

814
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:17,120
To go fuck yourself. I hope
that dream comes true. Yeah. Um,

815
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,640
yeah,
I've been accused of,

816
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,753
yeah.

817
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,400
It all depends on what, what the
argument is. Yeah. I think, um,

818
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,070
yeah, I've been called a
red pill eating Republican.

819
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:32,904
I've been called

820
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,780
a liberal liberal,
a charge snowflake,

821
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:42,570
cut cold, all of that shit. And
I've been called a centrist.

822
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,820
I love the centrist one. Like,
isn't that the smart one?

823
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,970
Well you kinda in the middle. You lean
a little bit. I lean left. I think I do.

824
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:55,960
Anyway. So it all depends on
who the fuck I'm talking to.

825
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:59,560
It depends on how far left you are.
Um,

826
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,540
how far right you are. You probably
think I leaned way left. I don't know.

827
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,700
But a centrist did. Somebody like,
I don't know. I can be swayed.

828
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,720
You know,
you present a good fucking argument.

829
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,093
Yeah.

830
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,660
You know,
take a guy like Ted Nugent.

831
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,910
I don't agree with a lot of this
shit that that guy says, but he does.

832
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,050
He does say Shit on occasion.
I'm like that. I agree with,

833
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,220
I just don't write people off 100%,

834
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,013
you know?

835
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,440
And I also don't think that I have all
the fucking answers. So if that makes me,

836
00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:36,790
I don't know what the fuck that makes me.

837
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:43,150
He says centrist. Do you realize
how fucking Douchey that is?

838
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:47,680
That adults literally have to like it
come up with a label?

839
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:48,514
Everything.

840
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:55,190
What that really means is you don't
think the way I think and I can't fucking

841
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:55,641
handle it.

842
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:58,970
So I'm going to come up with a word that
is going to have some sort of negative

843
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,350
connotation. And I think you're so
weak as a person that it will affect,

844
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:08,180
I don't give a fuck what I really don't
give a shit. You're a centrist. Am I?

845
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:13,270
Okay. All right. You're a liberal
snowflake. Yeah. Okay. All right.

846
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,780
You're a Trump supporter for, how
can I find five? There you go.

847
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,260
Now go yell about that
to somebody at work.

848
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,973
MMM.

849
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,180
Anyways, documentary about
origin of soccer. Oh, by the way,

850
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:31,280
I learned more about
that World Cup trophy.

851
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:36,320
Somebody sent me this thing on Twitter.
Okay, so there's one World Cup trophy.

852
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,240
Okay.

853
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,290
And you're not allowed to have it
because it's worth like 20 million bucks.

854
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,740
So if you win it you,
they actually give you a replica of it.

855
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:47,420
This is what this person
was trying to tell me.

856
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,650
I don't know if any of this is true.

857
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:52,550
And then somebody else told me
that if you win like three of them,

858
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,930
you actually get to keep the fucking
thing in Brazil cast one and then they had

859
00:51:56,931 --> 00:52:01,850
to make another one now rather than just
telling you guys shit that I've heard.

860
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:05,570
I could actually look up World Cup trophy.

861
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,520
Yeah.

862
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,560
Which I can't believe how small it is.

863
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,280
Okay.

864
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,840
It's ridiculous. World Cup, trophy
history. Here we go. Ah Right.

865
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,970
And I'm going to click on it.
Let me do what everybody does.

866
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,050
When you search something.

867
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,493
MMM.

868
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,760
On the fucking Internet is you just take
the first, what the fuck is this thing?

869
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,350
Where the hell did this? Just
take me. Have you noticed now?

870
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,140
Like they just gives you one option.
You know they're paying,

871
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,570
people are paying for that.
Look at this.

872
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:42,350
It keeps taking me the same fucking site.
World Cup trophy,

873
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,530
his story search,
Google,

874
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,123
come on.

875
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,170
Yeah.

876
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,990
Keeps taking me this fucking website.
I'm not going to name the name of it.

877
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,980
Look at that. It just fucking
kicked me off. You fucking cons.

878
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,170
How much did they pay?

879
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:08,171
I can only go to U World Cup
trophy and a triple trophy

880
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,620
history search. Google.
There we go. All right.

881
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,970
It was a fucking glitch or something.
The World Cup is a gold trophy. Oh,

882
00:53:25,971 --> 00:53:29,390
it's actually made out of gold.
Ours is fake shit and wonders are so big.

883
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:34,550
Like the Stanley Cup is made
out of fucking aluminum.
Stainless steel maybe, uh,

884
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:39,580
is a gold trophy that is awarded to the
winners of the FIFA World Cup associated

885
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:44,030
bumper. Bubba. Since the advent
of the World Cup in 1932,

886
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:45,470
trophies have been used.

887
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:51,010
The jewels rimet trophy from 1930 to
1970 and the FIFA World Cup trophy from

888
00:53:52,671 --> 00:53:54,440
1974 to present day.

889
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:59,590
The first trophy originally named victory
bell later renamed in honor of Fifer

890
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:05,990
President Jules Rimet,
or is that use remat?

891
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,780
I have no idea.
Was made of gold plated,

892
00:54:08,781 --> 00:54:13,220
sterling silver and Lapis Lazuli Zuli,

893
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,410
whatever the fuck that is as depicted

894
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:23,930
and depicted Nike, the, the
Greek goddess of victory. Oh,

895
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:27,020
is that what the sneaker company has?
I didn't know that.

896
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:28,743
Okay.

897
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,530
Wait,
let's do a quick little aside here.

898
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:32,500
Okay.

899
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,060
In ancient Greek mythology,

900
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,550
okay.

901
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,610
Nick was a goddess who
personified victory.

902
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,250
Her Roman equivalent was Victoria.

903
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:46,730
She was variously described as the
daughter of the titan upon the gods.

904
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,850
This system, uh, uh, I, I have no idea.

905
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,880
I had no fucking idea.
Look at that.

906
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:57,240
Learning something that'd be even
bill can learn something. Anyways,

907
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:00,900
Brazil won the trophy outright
in 1970 prompting the,

908
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,440
the commissioning of the
replacement. Well, why did it,

909
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:08,090
how did they win it outright? They
just want it so many times like, hey,

910
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:10,950
just give to these fuckers with
second carton it across the world.

911
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:16,670
The original Jules room at trophy was
stolen in 1983 and never recovered.

912
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,460
What?
Yeah,

913
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,830
there's only one pro that's a drug.
Lord,

914
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,550
something fucking Pablo
Escobar had that or something.

915
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,300
The subsequent trophy called the fight
for World Cup trophy was introduced in

916
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:34,300
1974 made an 18 carat gold.

917
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:35,840
Yeah.

918
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,500
With is something basis, Dan. Okay,
now wait a second. Wait a second.

919
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:40,720
Okay.

920
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,400
World Cup trophy stolen.

921
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,930
Maybe it wasn't so fucking small. They
couldn't have stuck it under their shirt.

922
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,930
The theft of the jewels rimet trophy.

923
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,850
It was stolen in 1966 prior
to the 1966 world cup.

924
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,570
The trophy was later recovered. One man,
I thought they said they didn't get it.

925
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:08,440
One man, Steve Cook, a Barista
was convicted for being involved,

926
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:10,450
but other possible culprits is still a no.

927
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,090
You can't tell me that
guy's not a fucking legend.

928
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,450
Yeah.

929
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:18,180
Trophy place in a, how come that
hasn't been made into a movie?

930
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:23,160
Some sort of fucking comedy. What was
he some jerk off from a sports bar.

931
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,080
The football associated received
the cylinders. It's a theft.

932
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:28,430
On the March 20th Sunday,

933
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:32,600
March 20th when the guards began a noon
circuit around 1220 they noticed that

934
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:37,340
someone had forced open the display case
and the rear doors of the building and

935
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:38,540
stolen the trophy.

936
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:42,410
The wooden bar that held the trophy that
held the door closed was lying on the

937
00:56:42,411 --> 00:56:46,060
floor.
That's all they had to stop them.

938
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,100
These removed the screws and the bolts
that held the other side of the door.

939
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:52,610
Okay.

940
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,190
They went to Home Depot and
bought some screwdrivers in,

941
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:59,450
stole the biggest sports trophy in the
fucking world. What is simple time?

942
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,750
They had removed the pad lock
from the back of the display case,

943
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:05,540
taking the trophy and
left the way they came.

944
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:09,410
None of the guards had seen or
heard anything suspicious though.

945
00:57:09,411 --> 00:57:14,330
One of them reported that he had seen a
strange man by the public telephone when

946
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:18,560
he had visited the laboratory on the
first floor is those guys were fucking

947
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:23,090
offer Scotland Yard took control of the
case and gave it to the flying squad.

948
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,580
The flying squad?

949
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,533
Yeah.

950
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,570
What the fuck is that?
Sounds like a musical.

951
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:36,470
The flying squad also known as the robbery
squad is a bunch is a branch of this.

952
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,020
Okay.

953
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,900
The serious and organized crime command

954
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:47,790
did an eight year old name all this shit
with London's metropolitan police raw.

955
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,000
Is this serious?
It's not the,

956
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,310
it's not the frivolous crime command.

957
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:59,311
This is this serious and organized
crime squad purpose is to investigate

958
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:02,660
commercial armed and unarmed robbery is
along with the prevention investigators.

959
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,920
Who gives a fuck.
Sounds like they have uniforms.

960
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,583
Yeah.

961
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,720
Oh, then somebody, oh, that's
somebody. Actually they
ransom for the fucking thing.

962
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,740
On March 21st Joe Mirrors the chairman
and the football section received an

963
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:22,790
anonymous phone call.

964
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,170
The unknown man said that mirrors would
receive a parcel at Chelsea football

965
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,180
club. The next day the parcels
delivered to mirror his home.

966
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:33,500
It contained the removable lining from
the top of the trophy and a ransom note

967
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,460
that demanded 15,000 pounds

968
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,950
in $1 a one in five pound notes.
The letter stated that the FAA,

969
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,200
the FAA should place a code coded, add,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

970
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:50,034
blah.

971
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:51,320
Okay.

972
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,040
Uh, despite the warnings that
mirrors contacted the police

973
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:02,170
detective Charles Buggy of the flying
squad and gave the trophy lining and the

974
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:07,550
letter to him, police told mirrors
to place an ad and contacted a bank,

975
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:12,020
created a false ransom payment out of
bundles of ordinary paper with real money

976
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,090
only at the top and the bottom,

977
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,110
which replaced in a suitcase to police
officers were to act as mirrors,

978
00:59:18,111 --> 00:59:19,730
assistance and handing over the money

979
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,690
and went to Home Depot. Okay, so mirrors
was suffering from an asthma attack.

980
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,730
So his wife answered instead and
gave the phone to assist it. Mcphee,

981
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,730
oh,
McPhee Jackson was nervous,

982
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:39,080
but finally agreed to arrange a switch
and told fee to come to all you fucking

983
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:43,070
moron. And then he got caught.
But it isn't that something.

984
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,580
You see that you'll learn something
every god Damn Day, don't ya?

985
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,550
What a fucking dope.

986
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,400
Yeah.

987
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,950
It should have just kept the
God damn thing. Then you can't,

988
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:55,970
what are you gonna show your friends?

989
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:00,380
They're going to fucking open their
mouths trying to get laid. All right. Um,

990
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,930
anyways, documentary about the
origin of soccer. Hey Bill,

991
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:05,830
you're talking about the origin
of soccer last podcasting,

992
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,320
and I want to give you a recommendation
to watch wild in the streets.

993
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:14,390
It's the re the origin of all
football, including rugby,
soccer, and your football.

994
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,950
It is lit literally a type of
rugby played by an entire town,

995
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:22,700
north versus south.
The entire city is the field they play on.

996
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,220
Well worth the watch,
especially for sports fan.

997
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:29,990
I found it on Amazon fire slash
fire TV. Have a good day. All right,

998
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:33,500
I'll try to check that out. Lastly,
but not leastly classic movies.

999
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:39,000
Dear Billy dollars.
After he talked about La Mons last month,

1000
01:00:39,001 --> 01:00:41,550
I decided to watch the movie.
I really loved it.

1001
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,180
I never knew I needed to drive
through Europe till I saw that movie.

1002
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:49,200
I'm 22 and the first thing I noticed was
how differently it was pays compared to

1003
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:52,890
the schizophrenia stuff I grew up with.
It was very calming in a way.

1004
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,160
I was wondering if you could recommend
any good movies from that era.

1005
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,140
I'm going to keep watching McQueen movies,

1006
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,400
but I was hoping you could give more
titles from the era so I don't burn out.

1007
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:03,700
Okay.

1008
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,400
All of, all of his at once. Um,

1009
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,390
you can't go wrong with Steve McQueen.
You can't go wrong with Paul Newman. Um,

1010
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:14,740
obviously Paul Newman, you got
to, I would watch the hustler.

1011
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,580
MMM.

1012
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,700
I liked Hud. What else? Um,

1013
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:27,510
cool hand Luke. Uh, Steve McQueen.

1014
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:28,710
You got to go and you'll Brenner.

1015
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,580
You gotta go magnificent
seven Cincinnati kid bullet.

1016
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,390
MMM.

1017
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,430
And for those of you,
before you go see the rock movie,

1018
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,290
go watch the towering inferno.

1019
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,050
If you watch the towering inferno
and then you watch die hard,

1020
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:52,220
I think you'll see those two are
combined when they sold that movie,

1021
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:55,730
this the new rock movie as I feel
like it's those two movies combined.

1022
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,763
MMM.

1023
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,600
Wow. I haven't thought
about movies in a minute.

1024
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:05,950
What else did I like from back
then I liked all the clinics.

1025
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:10,930
Would Spaghetti Westerns, loved Charles
Bronson, anything with Lee Marvin and it,

1026
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,450
uh, the dirty dozen bridge on the river.

1027
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:20,250
Kwai Kelly's

1028
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,083
heroes.

1029
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,520
MMM.
The greatest scape,

1030
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,870
speaking of which,
do you know when I did Steve Burns movie,

1031
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,420
the character that I'm playing at one
point is potting golf balls in his office

1032
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:45,820
and somebody connected with the movie
was friends with the James Garner estate.

1033
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:51,110
Speaking of the greatest scape and
the [inaudible] was James Garner,

1034
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:55,020
scold potter and I, it was fucking
unbelievable. Cause you know,

1035
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,040
I always watch me TV and the Rockford
files is one of my favorite shows of all

1036
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:00,711
time.

1037
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:05,711
And I love it even more than I did when
I was a kid because I never understood

1038
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:08,943
like,

1039
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,730
I think losers too harsh a word,

1040
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:14,910
but like how much this guy was
struggling in life. He lived in a,

1041
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:19,020
on a trailer on the beach.
He had the Firebird,

1042
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:21,160
he didn't have the money for the trans-am.
Okay.

1043
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,790
And he couldn't sustain a relationship.
I mean the guy was a mess.

1044
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:30,030
He didn't like to fight.
I mean it was just fucking funny as hell.

1045
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:31,743
MMM.

1046
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:34,860
It's another one that I love,

1047
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,990
but I am right now I'm just burning
through that 77 sunset strip with Efram

1048
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:43,590
Zimbalist Jr. I just can't
get enough of that show. Um,

1049
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,850
it's just, it's that classic shit
where anytime a woman comes on screen,

1050
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,990
they play that fucking saxophone music
man. It's just fucking hilarious.

1051
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:58,280
F from smoking and like every other scene.
And I,

1052
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,960
and his drink is a, he likes
an old fashioned ry. And,

1053
01:04:02,961 --> 01:04:06,710
uh, like back then when they were
building a character, like they had,

1054
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:11,060
they have their drink and they had
to have a car and Efren symbolist his

1055
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:15,290
character in 77 sunset strip is,

1056
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,130
uh,

1057
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:21,130
he favors afford thunder
bird convertible and he big,

1058
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,840
and I even wa I've only seen season six,

1059
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,850
so I think that was in 1963
or 64 Thunderbird convertible.

1060
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:33,650
But I went online and I watched the intro
to all the different seasons and, um,

1061
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,970
he seems to have late fifties ones
because it ran from like 57 and 63.

1062
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:39,830
It was like six seasons
or something like that.

1063
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:44,960
So it'd be cool if I'm watching it and
he gets a new Thunderbird every year

1064
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:49,400
convertible. Um, and once
again, the restaurant,

1065
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,040
uh,

1066
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:55,040
this office that he's coming out of his
Dean Martin's Dino's that old restaurant

1067
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:59,690
that he had and, um,
which was on la Cienega.

1068
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:04,250
It was on sunset boulevard at the corner
of last Anegada on the southwest side

1069
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:05,084
of the street.

1070
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:06,550
MMM.

1071
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,760
40 fucking Badass.
Anyways,

1072
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,720
I'm an old man and I got
two shows to do here. Um,

1073
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:17,110
thank you to everybody that
came out to Portland last.

1074
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:20,890
I had such great shows and thank you to
everybody who's coming out to my shows

1075
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:24,160
tonight and Seattle and this
is one of my favorite cities.

1076
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:25,510
And I think the next time I come here,

1077
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:30,130
I'm going to try to do like
what I did was in San Francisco.

1078
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:34,050
I'm going to play a smaller venue and
just be here for a week and I'm gonna

1079
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:35,950
bring my wife and kid up here because,
uh,

1080
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,210
the lovely Nia always wanting
to go to Seattle and I've,

1081
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:42,460
I've never brought her
up here. And uh, I dunno,

1082
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:45,520
it's a shame cause it's so fucking close
and it just never seems to work out

1083
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,510
with their schedules.
So I think next time I might do a,

1084
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,250
one of my favorite theaters in the
country, which is the more theater,

1085
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:53,320
which for you rock fans,

1086
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,710
that's where Alison chains shot
that black and white concert film.

1087
01:05:56,711 --> 01:06:00,250
That's where pearl jam shot that video.
You know,

1088
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:03,250
we had a better climbed up the side
and dropped down into the crowd.

1089
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:07,360
Pohanka could get get to down.
Wham. A couple of partner
Pamper Africa now, right?

1090
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:12,190
Remember that's some, um, all right,
that's it. Go fuck yourselves.

1091
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:16,360
Congratulations to France. Went in the
World Cup. Congratulations to Croatia,

1092
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,750
England, Belgium, all you guys
that got down to the final four.

1093
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:20,710
It's fucking incredible.

1094
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:23,560
It's an incredible thing to watch and I
hope to go the next time there's a world

1095
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:27,040
cup. I'll check in on
you on Thursday. See it.
