1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,430
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:09,330
September 24th, 2012. What's going on?

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,550
How are you? How, how's your little
Monday doing? Where are you eat at work?

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,140
He's sitting in a cubicle. You're on
the treadmill. Did you call in sick?

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,820
Did you do that? Did you have the
right sound and your voice? Yeah. Hey,

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,500
it's Michael. Uh, I don't
know what happened, you know,

7
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,800
last night I wasn't feeling
so good and uh, you know,

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,700
you just fucking be here yourself going,
what am I doing? I can't just be like,

9
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,650
Hey, this is Michael. Listen, um, the job
is fucking sucking the soul out of me,

10
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:45,030
but I don't have any other
financial options. So, you know,

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,150
I'm going to keep working there, but
not today. How about that? All right.

12
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:49,800
Go Fuck Yourself.
We'll see on Tuesday.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,320
That'd be great.
If you could just be that honest.

14
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,030
It's still somehow earn a living,
you know,

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,280
somehow fucking still be asked to come
to work the next day. Uh, Michael,

16
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:07,281
can you come in here a wee some
concerns about some of the insubordinate

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,300
comments that you made?
What does that word even fucking mean?

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,330
This insubordinate means independent
thoughts. Is that what it is?

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,870
Some of your thoughts that
are outside the green.

20
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:23,670
All the thoughts that we told you to have.

21
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,670
You're not having any more
and that that concerns us.

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,490
You're always a guy who was thinking,
um,

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,460
what we were telling you to think
in the past and suddenly you're not.

24
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:36,930
And that concerns us and that concerns us.
So just to let you know,

25
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:41,070
you just went from the yellow list over
to the blue list and the next list is

26
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:43,800
the red list and those people go first.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,590
What's that? I'm talking
about FEMA camps. Yes I am.

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,533
Um,

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,310
that's something I looked up to reading
about those fucking lists that they have.

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,850
I wasn't a little, I wasn't fucking
reading about him. Did I read about him?

31
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,310
I just watched a couple of
youtube videos about it. You know,

32
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,260
it's funny about the fucking
new world order. You know,

33
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:09,261
what makes me chuckle about it
is it's completely on paper.

34
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,610
It's totally fucking necessary.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,140
I've come full circle. I understand
why I'm going to be eliminated.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,670
So if anybody in the fucking hood, a
cloaked hood or whatever, you know,

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,050
if you're listening in while you're
dripping fucking hot wax on a Goddamn

38
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,530
Maltese Falcon, whatever the fuck you
doing in your weird ass little ritual,

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,320
I don't need to be reeducated.
I get it.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,970
Just get on with the killing,
you know,

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,210
that'd be the only guy going to a death
camp, like playing a banjo, you know,

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,770
with a folk tune called I get it.

43
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,370
Um, no, I seriously, I was
reading all this shit about,

44
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:02,371
you know how in the UN there finally
talking about the population problem and a

45
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,470
lot of people are coming up with this
shit where they're just like, look,

46
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:10,060
we got to get rid of 90% of
the population, you know,

47
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,620
and to do it in a way that like,

48
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,813
you know,

49
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,800
okay,

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,250
does it make every other fucking genocide?
Like look,

51
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,423
okay,

52
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,630
what am I trying to say here?

53
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,110
Okay.

54
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,970
The only way you can fucking do that.

55
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,300
What am I trying to fucking
say here? Jesus Christ. Okay.
So thanks. Go. All right.

56
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,310
If everybody just has
one kid from here on out,

57
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:40,311
we could get the population down to like
three and a half billion by 2075 but I,

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,500
but the problem is, is like most things,
we just treated it like a term paper.

59
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:50,460
It's too fucking late. So you got other
people like, oh no, we got to fucking,

60
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:51,294
you know.

61
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,440
Yeah,

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,120
you got the other people
there acting like,

63
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:58,260
you know the host of that hoarder show
or they're just like throw it all out.

64
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,770
It's all shit. Right. I think that
that's what they're going to do.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,300
Okay.

66
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,160
So I guess if you want to survive,

67
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,880
what you have to do is you got to up what
you're bringing to the game, you know?

68
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,750
Cause if you're like me and you kind of
like the human equivalent to a stack of

69
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,700
newspapers with a dead cat underneath it,

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,510
you know, you, you're going to
bid a, you're going to be gout.

71
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,320
I'm going to be out the fucking window.
All right.

72
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,830
I wonder if they going to let
you choose how you want to die.

73
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,143
How would you do it?

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,633
Okay.

75
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,180
Yeah. What do I do? You know
what I would like? I'd like,

76
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,190
I would like to fucking be on some
sort of Bungee cord that goes fuck.

77
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,910
Instead of up and down, it goes
side to side and I just swing on it.

78
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,850
They bring me back. Oh, they got rob.

79
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,710
Oh giant sling shot and just get shot to
that giant TV at a cowboys game during

80
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:53,850
like a Monday night football game. You
know? No one that I'm going to die,

81
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:56,810
but I set it up like it's going to be
this stunt where I'm going to go over it,

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
you know?
And I just horrify some kids.

83
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:03,360
That'll be like my last thing is I bounced
off that turf right next to Tony Roma.

84
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,540
I'm sorry people.
I've been alone all fucking week.

85
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,090
This is the shit I'm thinking about.
This is the Monday morning podcast.

86
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:09,451
Everybody.

87
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:14,451
This is the uplifting MMP talking
about eliminating 90% of the people,

88
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,330
the world's population. As you sit
there eating a fucking eat Claire. Huh?

89
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,540
Who had one already who already had
a fucking eat Claire this week? Huh?

90
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,240
Who? I don't these, why Claire's,

91
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,520
who eats a fucking eclair?
You know what I mean?

92
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,300
[inaudible] fucking God damn.
TJ's in the middle of it. I mean,

93
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:40,470
if like it wasn't disgusting enough,
you got to get like a doughnut facial.

94
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,910
That's got to be like one of the,
you know,

95
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,070
like the low points when
you just have like total,

96
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,070
like just self hatred I
would think as a fat person.

97
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:54,030
If you just bought a dozen eclairs when
you're polishing off like the eighth or

98
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,700
ninth one, if you had a big
fuzzy beard, it's all in your,

99
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,850
and you look like you're in some
doughnut boot cocky movie. You just got,

100
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,170
he's got to be like, or what,
what happened? You know,

101
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,730
I used to climb trees.
I used to do cartwheels.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,250
Um, I'm going back to La Tomorrow. Man.
I had a great week of Caroline's. Uh,

103
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,990
I want to thank everybody.
Got Two more shows.

104
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:24,260
I'm recording this a Sunday afternoon
before I do my final two shows.

105
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,101
As you notice,

106
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:29,810
my voice is a little froggy yet out
from screaming like a Jack Ass all week.

107
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,680
The problem is, is I have the sensation
opening up for me and you know,

108
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,470
the way he screams as a feature act,

109
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:39,800
I have to go there as a headliner
and I have to yell even more.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,100
Um,
you know,

111
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,590
we've been having a real good time this
week giving each other shit about each

112
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:49,370
other's acts. The stuff we don't like
about it and both of our x got better.

113
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,610
You know, our friendships suffered
a little bit on a creative level,

114
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,410
but I think at the end of the day,
it's a nice thing.

115
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,850
I know what a lot of
you guys are thinking,

116
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:59,490
well why didn't you just have Joe come
over and do the fucking podcast? Ah,

117
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,890
because we drank until five in
the morning. That's why. Okay.

118
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,550
I just thought of a common courtesy.
You know, friend of friend,

119
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,930
when you drink with somebody
till five in the morning,

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,690
you don't ask them to drag their ass
out of bed and come in onto your podcast

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
for absolutely no fucking money.
Do you know what I mean?

122
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,580
Although I bet if I put a couple of
eclairs down, I bet Joe would show up.

123
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,460
You know? Oh, fucking
shoeless Joe. All right.

124
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,950
What else? Fucking Goddamn jets. One.

125
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,220
I don't have a TV so I have no
fucking idea. I didn't watch it.

126
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,870
It looks like the dolphins blew that one.
So they had their two in one.

127
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,200
I figured by the time you hear this,
the Patriots will be one and two.

128
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,360
I don't know how the Patriots are
going to be one of those teams.

129
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:48,110
You know that those jerk offs on ESPN
will be like, you know, I'll tell you,

130
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:51,680
I thought of Patriots. They're like
gotta be thick and which teams good.

131
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,780
We'll be showing up some borrow Alene
we'll give the steps first week.

132
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,700
I'll bleed. Who score like 48 it will
it move to d and you think it will cook?

133
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,750
Shut up. You fucking nerd. You know,

134
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,653
you know what I want.

135
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,870
I want well spoken people who actually
played the game to tell me what I should

136
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:12,570
be thinking.

137
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,990
I don't want to listen to somebody
who went to fucking journalism school.

138
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,150
All right. And was in chess
club telling me what, what,

139
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,530
what Tom Brady's got to be
thinking, you know what I mean? Oh,

140
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,350
I'm fucking grumpy. Um, I don't
even know what's going on.

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,560
I went to a fucking football game
last week, so I missed the Patriots,

142
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,680
blow it against Tampa Bay.
I still have that on my DVR.

143
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,690
Okay.

144
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,310
You liked that echo in this apartment,

145
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,710
in these sparsely
furnished apartment I have.

146
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,150
You know what's great about an echo in a
Roman makes it just makes you feel like

147
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,620
you're addressing a bunch of people.

148
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,693
Af

149
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,820
what's your country?

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,100
You know,

151
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,820
I think I could get one of those political
speeches, one of those raw, raw thanks.

152
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:00,990
Okay.

153
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,060
Today America,
is that across drugs

154
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,940
and if you look back at our
history in this country,

155
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,340
is that the fly by the choices that
we make? Would we have to cross drugs?

156
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,160
Thanks Frank. Makes
Carriage. Thanks. Conviction.

157
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
Well,
I believe,

158
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,040
am I fell out if he's just sitting
there staring at their shoes,

159
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,150
waiting for that fucking moment where
they know this supposed to clap.

160
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,690
Did I feel that we can rise
above today's challenges?

161
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,410
Because that's what American late,
Huh?

162
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,360
But nobody starts fucking clapping and
then you sit and they're gone. All right.

163
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,330
That's good. That's good. I got
through the first 10% of the speech.

164
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,710
Nobody's taking a shot at me,

165
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,150
so I haven't pissed off the loonie birds
or the people who employ me. Right.

166
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,550
I haven't pissed off the bankers of
the corporations and I even pissed off

167
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:06,030
fucking Eddie Earl fucking
Johnson from east Mississippi,

168
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,140
which coming up here with
his handmade fucking glock.

169
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,400
Is that what rednecks do not,
they just sit around all a widow,

170
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,180
[inaudible] widow and all day,
you know what their fucking weapons,

171
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,720
you know something guns or
like the comic book for like a,

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,690
for like rednecks.

173
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,410
You're like nerds always into like they
have like a comic book collection like

174
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:32,410
Anthony Cool.
Mia from the wonderful ONA program.

175
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,540
He's like a comic book nerd except he's,

176
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,310
he's into guns and instead of talking
about whether the whole could be captain

177
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:43,450
America, he talks about, oh, the
lovely Nia. Everybody hang on.

178
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,450
Hey Nia. Hey, I'm almost done recording
the podcast. Let me call you right back.

179
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,550
Bye Bye. See that? That was a
little white lie. Not almost done.

180
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:57,460
I'm only fucking 10 minutes
then that's what you gotta do.

181
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,790
That's what you gotta do to keep
a relationship going. You know,

182
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,220
you don't tell big lies,
but a bunch of little ones

183
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,530
going to be there in five minutes.
How many times you tell that way,

184
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,100
Huh? Absolutely. Yes.
I was listening to you

185
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,470
while you were talking about how your mom,

186
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:24,940
I don't know why you fucking coming at
me, right? We've all done that shit.

187
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,580
You know I did this morning. There's
so much of a fucking sports nerd. I am.

188
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,730
I just wrote down all the
fucking teams that I've seen.

189
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,530
People seem to be interested
in that. Well, who's kid?
Who's kidding? Who Others?

190
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:39,970
Fucking sports nerds. Um,
what the hell is it here?

191
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,820
I only need to see for more professional
teams. 14 more and I'm done.

192
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,280
I've seen all the fucking baseball teams.
I've seen all but five,

193
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,680
right?

194
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,230
All but football teams and I'm going to
see three of them in the next fucking

195
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,500
month or so. So I'll have
one more. Their hockey.

196
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,390
I got three more to see Ottawa.

197
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,350
The hurricanes in the
lightening otherwise known is,

198
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,210
Oh gee. And judge, who the fuck wants
to go to any of those places? Ottawa.

199
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,340
Huh? You're halfway to Toronto. Um,

200
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,180
the hurricanes and the lightening get
assist. That's just not going to happen.

201
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,700
And then basketball,
I got the dirty south.

202
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,890
I don't know when the fucking want to see,
have the grizzlies,

203
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:30,190
the bobcat's the fucking magic.

204
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,040
I never go down south, right? The Hornets

205
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,910
at the Spurs and the sons
and then the raptors. Really,

206
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,880
I'm going to go all the way to
Toronto to go see a fucking CBA team.

207
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,590
These last few are going to be rough.
They're going to be rough. And, um,

208
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,220
I wonder what's going to happen
when I finally complete this goal.

209
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,450
Am I going to have the high five myself
for going to all these events by myself?

210
00:12:57,451 --> 00:13:00,720
Isn't it rather sad when you
think about it? Even nerds,

211
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:04,080
when they go to the fucking comic cons,
they got someone to go with, right?

212
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,110
Drive next week, sit next to each other
as they drive down to the fucking thing.

213
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,120
Um, all right, let's do a little
advertising. Shall We? People,

214
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,870
some starting to fucking sweat
here had opened a window.

215
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,300
I hope I'm not being too Goddamn
loud. What are you going to do? Huh?

216
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,190
Yell at me. Hey, fucking keep it down.
Yeah, you fucking keep it down. Um,

222
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,390
You don't care about that kid. You
probably think that Kit's ugly, right?

223
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,580
Why do you want to go down
and listen to that dumps?

224

Stories run into that person
who was sitting there. You know,

you haven't seen him since high school.

226
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,680
Why wouldn't it be great if you could just
stay in your own place where you live?

227
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,300
Just print out your own steps. What if
you got a little scale? You could, oh,

way it, right? He bought a little,

229
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:06,920
a little stamp on it.

230
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,450
You take it out to the post office and
you tell that psycho to pick the damn

231
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,970
thing up and take it back
to the place where he works.

232
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,430

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,410
[inaudible] dot com. Sorry, I just got
distracted by the phone. So anyways,

250
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,140
back to the Goddamn podcasts here.
Sorry.

251
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,820
I actually had to take
that fucking phone call,

252
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,690
but through the wonder
of the pause button. Um,

253
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,590
I can't wait to get the fuck out of New
York. I got to tell you something. This,

254
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,640
I can't see.

255
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,020
Stay in shape in this fucking city,
especially when you're going out,

256
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:38,800
God damn drinking and then you fucking
walk home when you get the slice of pizza

257
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:43,090
or a fucking Goddamn Bacon,
egg and cheese. You know,

258
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,230
it's amazing that everybody in this
city doesn't weigh nine zillion pounds.

259
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:51,850
I guess it cause you walk around
so much, you know, I dunno.

260
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,190
I have to give a shout out to the,
uh,

261
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,810
sort of like dictate or light that they
have here. Um, what's his name? Bloomberg.

262
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,730
You know that guy,

263
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:04,330
you know who are legally you can only
have two terms and somehow he got around

264
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:08,020
it and he's in his fucking third
term. Basically. He's going to leave.

265
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,370
He's going to step down being mayor when
he's God damn ready. This motherfucker,

266
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,560
he's taken away. He puts seats in the
middle of the street and Times Square.

267
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,340
He did it down there. Macy's, the
old Herald Square. All right man.

268
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,120
I came right right back.
Huh? Ah, AH, right.

269
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,080
Harold Square and a and then I'll
know all these other fucking streets.

270
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:34,081
He just lets people kind of park did
in the second lane over from the curb.

271
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,670
And then the other lane is like a,
a bike lane.

272
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,120
I guess he just doesn't want
people driving around anymore.

273
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,730
Either that or he's aware that the world
population is going to be reduced by

274
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:50,060
90% and he's getting the
jump just going like,

275
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,570
well we don't need all
these fucking leads.

276
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,780
You don't need all this shit. You
know, we'll just put some seats.

277
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,540
We'll put some sun chairs right in
the middle of fucking times square.

278
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,590
Maybe you know something. Maybe
he's trying to warn us, you know,

279
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,800
but if he warns us,
they're going to kill his entire family.

280
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:13,400
So these are the little hints that
he's giving us these little things.

281
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:17,090
He used his fucking money to stay in
office, to give us the hint that the, uh,

282
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,710
the extermination is
coming, right. See, this is,

283
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:26,000
this is why I need is so good for me and
having a dog when I'm around people and

284
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,980
I, you know, you just have,
you have great thoughts.

285
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,520
This is how you become the Unabomber.
You just fucking hang out with yourself.

286
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,810
It only takes a good eight days,
eight days just slowly go nuts.

287
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,440
You start,
you just start thinking about a,

288
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
I don't know why you think about
how you'd think about dying.

289
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,973
Okay?

290
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,520
Thinking about that shit. This is just,
this is fucking depressing. You know,

291
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:52,740
it'd be great if I watched some football.
I could talk about that.

292
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,660
I have absolutely nothing to talk about.

293
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,440
I can just riff about the fucking bare
walls in my fucking apartment here.

294
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,700
Would you guys be upset with me if I just
broke down and started crying here on

295
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,320
the podcast?
Would you do that?

296
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:04,980
Oh,

297
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,040
here's something for you made you came
by with some of the cities I'm going to

298
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,730
be performing in next
year. Next year, baby.

299
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,970
Would you like to hear him?
Would you like a list of some of them?

300
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,400
I got and let me see. Let me see
if there's some here that I've, uh,

301
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,990
haven't been to in awhile.
Why do we got here? Oh No,

302
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:27,090
I've been all of these fucking cities.
Oh,

303
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:30,960
I'm finally maybe going to have
a Vegas night. That'll be great.

304
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,740
Why don't you guys come out and see me
in Vegas? Come out there with your boys.

305
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:38,880
Get drunk, get a fucking whore. Right?

306
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,070
Couple of call girls

307
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,080
luck. Be a lady two
nights. Put on a condom.

308
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:46,950
That's right.

309
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,300
And even afterwards you jump in the
shower and wash your crutch real good.

310
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,950
You should've just had her
blow Ya. Ah, you fucking nuts.

311
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,350
Why'd you go inside?

312
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,610
Who fucking knows what's
in that fucking coach. See,

313
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,380
this is why I have to close
the window so I can't do this.

314
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,400
People have kids in this building.

315
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,940
All right.

316
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,730
I'll tell you this.
Water is Poland.

317
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:17,910
Spring water that was probably bottled
nine years ago and put in a warehouse is

318
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:21,660
absolutely fucking delicious.
How do they keep the algae off of it?

319
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,890
Do you know my, I have a fucking, um,

320
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,790
I have a water fountain and my front yard
and I know what you're thinking. Jesus,

321
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,390
your house must be amazing. It isn't.
And neither is the water fountain.

322
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:35,590
It's this little douchey.
It's like,

323
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,160
it's like somewhere between like
a fucking bird bath and something.

324
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,720
Jesus would wash his, you know,
wash maybe your feeding. Right.

325
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,070
He wouldn't wash his feet because that
would actually be doing something for

326
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,160
himself, which he never did. He
never did anything for himself.

327
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:54,570
He did it all for you. And thanks
a lot for not appreciating them.

328
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,980
If you turn your pages, oh, I
was going to go to church today.

329
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,720
Okay.

330
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,550
I was actually going to do
that. Why don't I go? Cause I,

331
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,120
cause I didn't get up Til fucking 12,
like doing that every once in a while,

332
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,283
just going,

333
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,790
going down there and remembering,

334
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,580
then I'm going to go to
some fiery fucking grave.

335
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,553
MMM.

336
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:16,980
So anyways,

337
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,640
so I got this little stupid glorified
bird bath if they call in a fountain.

338
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,410
And uh, I, I just feel like for
me, I can't keep the thing clean,

339
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,660
which just algae all
over the fucking place.

340
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,840
He's got damn mosquitoes
laying eggs in there.

341
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,800
So then I got to go out and go buy all
this fucking poison and stick it in the

342
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,634
water.

343
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,430
Okay.

344
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,160
You know, and then what happened since
some other animal comes by and goes,

345
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:41,690
Oh wow,
look at the god damn water.

346
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:46,280
I think I'll have a drink and then I
fucking whacked this skunk or a raccoon or

347
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:50,110
some other vomit.
You know,

348
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,550
technically those things are
vomit. I know. Yeah. What's
his face you sending me?

349
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:59,290
Sam gave that gave that word a bad name.
Well she is a rabbit. Considered a vomit.

350
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,720
Maybe it is. I was just told, you
know, if he had hair, you are a mammal.

351
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,870
I didn't know what farming is.
Farming like a racial slur for a mammal.

352
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:09,980
Okay.

353
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,780
Does that word mean midget in their world?
Cause I know like a skunk possum.

354
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,693
Okay.

355
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,840
What else does he have? Raccoon. Those
are all varmints like when you're,

356
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:25,820
when you're a redneck or a
serial killer, you know, that's,

357
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:29,590
that's what you start with except
rednecks for the most part.

358
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:34,180
They stop at like elk where if you're a,
you're a serial killer, you keep going.

359
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,880
But I don't think you work your way
up to elk. You know, I think you, you,

360
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,160
you kill like a,
uh,

361
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,060
like an adolescent bear and then you
kill a fat person and then that's

362
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,240
okay.

363
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,860
That's the off ramp you take.
Right.

364
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,900
Um, I am a fucking minutes. Am
I in, what am I talking about?

365
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,540
Oh Jesus. 22 fucking minutes in. Can
I, can I put out an RFP this week?

366
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,160
Is that good?
You know,

367
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:09,250
it'd be great if somebody has to fucking
question and Nia and then I could do

368
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:12,620
another one of those epilogues and then
I'll fucking splice it back on like raw

369
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:15,430
Maria attaching a limb.
Would that be phenomenal?

370
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,330
You can't believe the shit that
I watched this week on Youtube.

371
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,440
I watched some shit about some soldiers
coming back from Iraq talking about all

372
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,630
the horrible stuff they did.
Take them metals off,

373
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:29,700
throwing them and that type of shit.
And uh,

374
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,400
uh, and, and you know, I don't know,
just can't wrap my fucking head around.

375
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,070
It's too much, too much to take in. And
that's thing I needed to watch football.

376
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,650
I needed a little bread and circus SEL
expression goes right whenever the people

377
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:47,440
are ready to revolt against the king and
they sent out some bread and they sent

378
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:50,650
some tumblers down there and some people
to tell jokes and everybody got shit

379
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:54,370
faced at bellies were full of bread and
they're like, Eh, the kings are right.

380
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,170
Well we'll attack the castle tomorrow,
right.

381
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,150
Maybe sat down a couple of harlots.
Isn't that what they did or did it,

382
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,270
am I remembering like an episode
of like a game of Thrones?

383
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,150
I want to start watching that show.

384
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,190
I watched a couple episodes in that
little kid is just so fucking evil, man.

385
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,510
You know, it's like a whole nother
level, like a children of the corn,

386
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,840
that kid,
that little bastard.

387
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,930
Is there anything more hateable
then I'll kid in power. You know,

388
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,780
I wonder if they got whacked more
than an adult. I'm an adult GI.

389
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:36,910
You actually, you can eat at least think
that maybe they worked to get the job,

390
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:40,800
but you know when you sit in
there taking fucking, you know,

391
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,750
some eight year old kid with his head
is fucking voice hasn't even changed.

392
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,500
I have to learn how to
scream properly on stage.

393
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,200
Fucking voice gets like this
every guardian weekend. Wow.

394
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,240
Let's read some more fucking
advertising for Christ's sake.

395
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,650
At least I can get that in.
Right.

396
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,780
I'll get that in before this thing
slowly Peters out. You know, actually,

397
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,480
you know when you think about is it just
kind of a nice way to start the week?

398
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:05,961
I feel like,

399
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,990
you know what I feel I'm speaking in the
same voice like someone speaks and then

400
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:10,340
like the end of a yoga class.

401
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,990
I hope you guys all have a wonderful week
and just remember some of the lessons

402
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:19,010
that you've learned over the
last hour connecting, letting go,

403
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,660
getting in touch with that voice inside
you. I'm sorry. I know this is creepy.

404
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,790
All right. He voice everybody. Would
you like to turn your life around?

405
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:32,540
Would you like to start a business without
having to actually have a place where

406
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,460
it exists?
When that be awesome?

407
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:37,490
Wouldn't be great if you could act and
make it sound like you actually had an

408
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:40,010
office. Well, he voice
gives you that ability.

409
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,240
You don't have to buy another cell phone
because with the wonder of iie voice,

410
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,890
you can get a bunch of cell phone numbers
for your cell phone. And once again,

411
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:52,850
I forget what the word is. Why do I
always want to say viral phone numbers?

412
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,450
Why don't I write it down
on this copy virtual,

413
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,590
you can get bunch of
virtual phone numbers.

414
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,930
You can walk up to somebody with
the cell phone that has a number,

415
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,640
another number to it and say,
this is my business number. Okay.

416
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,410
And then they think that call in
an office because they also have a,

417
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,790
they have professional lab voiceover
actors for your answering machine.

418
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,730
They'll pick it up and make it
seem like you have some James Bond,

419
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,680
maybe partner or some sexy
coworker or something like that.

420
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,630
They get called forwarding toll free
1-800-NUMBERS. Um, automatic attendant,

421
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:32,260
advanced voicemail, voicemail,
the text voice mail, the email.

422
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,850
Uh, he voice is perfect for
business, for the business,

423
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:39,730
for a business person on the move.

427
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:57,590
that's tremendous. It really is
tremendous. I wish they had that one.

428
00:25:57,591 --> 00:26:00,620
I was starting now, but you
know, then again, I didn't
have an idea for a business.

429
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,220
I wish I could utilize that back
in the day when I wasn't smart.

430
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,270
What do you guys think about the
Patriots? Raven's tonight? You know,

431
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,830
what do you think?
What do you think?

432
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,700
I'm worried that Tom Brady
is going to get hurt tonight.

433
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,240
I gotta be honest with you. We got a
rookie protecting the fuck and blindside.

434
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,960
I don't like it. I don't like
it. We're good against the run,

435
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,810
but all they got to do
old Joe Flacco himself.

436
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,530
If he finally plays up to his potential,
all right.

437
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,470
They only got to do is just
go into the hurry up offense.

438
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,730
It's all they got to do when they get
to you got to go right down the goddamn

439
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,550
field. Um, all right,
let's read some fucking a,

440
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,250
let's read some questions for this week.
We're on the,

441
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,250
we're on this side of the half hour
and I'm already into the questions.

442
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,830
Can you believe that?
I know what you're not.

443
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,890
I know it was something that you can
absolutely believe is that I can't find

444
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:57,590
where the fuck the questions are in the
God damn podcast. Oh, there they are.

445
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,551
All right.
Oh,

446
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,730
he's a pet peeve of mine in New
York that I completely forgot about.

447
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,820
When you walk down the street, I'm
like, how fucking angry you can get,

448
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,150
you know when you walk in behind somebody
and you try and go past them cause

449
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:15,600
they're walking too slow and they
serpentine down the sidewalk.

450
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,671
It's like they're,

451
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:20,550
they're either doing it on purpose to
their fucking equilibrium is off and you

452
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,620
just want to punch him in the
back of every time you go left,

453
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:24,360
they start going life, he cut back. Right.

454
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,920
They need you to that fucking evil
exhale and they're fucking ear and it

455
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:31,860
startles him. You know, if it was a movie,

456
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:35,610
they drop a bag and a grapefruit
would roll out. So he's a great thing.

457
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,150
Great Visual and movies to let people
know that that character was startled

458
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:43,380
because they'd drop the bag of fruit.
Yeah. And it's always rollable fruit.

459
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,120
It's never a banana.
It would just fall.

460
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:49,410
They're like a fucking receiver
off a God damn phone. Um,

461
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,310
and then also how when you walking down
the street and a lovely ladies coming

462
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,670
your way and there's not enough room
for both. Yeah. You start to turn right,

463
00:27:56,671 --> 00:28:01,230
you start to turn and she doesn't turn
it all like she's a goddess. You know,

464
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,440
it's just how far do I got to take
this gentlemanly thing? Why don't you,

465
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,630
how come I have to adjust my
body? 100%. You don't even,

466
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,300
they don't even fucking look at you.
They just like stare straight ahead.

467
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,680
You know what I used to do in New York?

468
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:18,240
I had this passive aggressive fucking
move that I would do. I had a, um,

469
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,580
you always have like a bag.
If you're going to be out for a while,

470
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,570
you know you don't have a car,

471
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,640
so you get all your shit
and like a fucking backpack.

472
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,300
I'd have it slung over one shoulder and
if somebody was not going to get out of

473
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:31,470
my fucking way as or more isn't even
making an attempt to adjust their body as

474
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:35,130
they were walking by me and I got
to do all the fucking moving, right.

475
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,370
Like this unhealthy fucking relationship.

476
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,880
What I do is right as they're
about ready to pass me,

477
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,170
I'd have my bag on my right
shoulder there on my left.

478
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,240
What I would do is write
as they go and buy me,

479
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,700
I would turn around and
look over my right shoulder,

480
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:54,510
turning my back and whacking them with
the bag and then I'd immediately turn

481
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,790
around, be like, oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry about that. You know,

482
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,490
totally fucking passive aggressive.
That's how,

483
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:04,491
that's how I handled that shit cause that
wasn't man enough to just punch him in

484
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:08,290
the face. Um, all right,

485
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,840
here's one from a lady.
Hey Bill,

486
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:15,540
what kind of Sunscreen do you use?
Um,

487
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,280
I unfortunately don't really use
sunscreen when I do use it. Uh,

488
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:25,080
I don't go higher than 50. If you
try to use, when I use the 100,

489
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,660
it's so thick.
It like pulls my arm hair off.

490
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,700
It feels like glue,
you know,

491
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,460
sunscreen. A hundred fields
like glue, but I'll use 50,

492
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:43,461
35 but the key is you got to wear a hat
because you can't put sunscreen above

493
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:48,100
your eyes cause it drips down
and he gets all stinky. You know,

494
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,210
I don't put it on my face too
much. I got, I got a B in a hat.

495
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,700
I think I'm all right. Um, I don't know.

496
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,510
Does that answer your question?

497
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:03,430
We just really saying you're a pasty
motherfucker. Nah, I know you use it.

498
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,310
Are you a fellow red head? Is that
what you are? I don't fucking know.

499
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,490
Um, a lady roommate. Hey
Bill, huge fan of the show.

500
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:16,160
Wanted to see if you had any
advice for this situation.

501
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:19,100
I found myself in a
little over a month ago.

502
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,740
I moved to Phoenix and moved
in with the friend of Iad.

503
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:27,500
You go up camelback mountain yet? That's
a fucking great hike. You got to go up.

504
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:29,810
That one.
Somebody dies up there every fucking year,

505
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,320
which always cracks me up to be
like alone in the wilderness.

506
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:36,380
While you can actually see
buildings in the distance,

507
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,350
that's gotta be so frustrating.
Um,

508
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,790
little ugly ass fucking road runners.
All right. A little over a month ago,

509
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:47,820
I moved to Phoenix and moved
in with a friend from college.

510
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,440
No real problems there,

511
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,880
but he did have a female college
age roommate that he got along with.

512
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,720
So we ended up setting settling
on a three bedroom. All right,

513
00:30:57,721 --> 00:31:00,360
so it's two dudes and a chick.
She's already like a Sitcom.

514
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,310
This is like fucking
reverse three's company.

515
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,160
A Nunga models
will,

516
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,800
it gives us,

517
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,950
I remember I've fucking, America was just
like that, you know? Nice and simple.

518
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,220
I guess it was probably fucked up then.

519
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,770
I was just too young to notice
sitting there eating a popsicle.

520
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,790
Well look, is this, ah
Huh. Please go bloody dude.

521
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,730
You do. Boop. Larry's
upstairs. 50 years old.

522
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:29,550
Fucking everything that
moves. Um, all right.

523
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,390
I only know a few people in town
and my work schedule is grueling.

524
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,130
It makes it really hard to meet to too
many people over the course of the week.

525
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:38,551
All right,

526
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:41,730
so you're setting up your excuse for
why you're already fucking your friends

527
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:46,200
friend. All right. You know, I work a
lot. I can't get to meet people. Uh,

528
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,230
why go out for pussy when it's right next
door? I get it buddy. I get it. You know,

529
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,290
it's discovery channel.
Does the line go after the toughest zebra?

530
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,850
The fucking wounded one of
the little baby one. My,

531
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,560
the one walking around wearing
the fucking juicy shorts. Um,

532
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,730
I'm sure by now you've pinpointed the
key word in the above paragraph. Female.

533
00:32:08,731 --> 00:32:12,630
Yes I have sir. Yes, I have. So
he can see where this is going.

534
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,940
My second weekend here,

535
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
we all go out get sloppy jalopy drunk
and she informs me that she broke up with

536
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:24,060
their boyfriend of five
years. Oh, wonderful.

537
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,410
So of course I do the gentlemanly
thing and fuck your brains out.

538
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,320
Oh, he goes, so of course, yeah,

539
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:36,321
I do the gentleman thing and fuck her
brains out or flop around like a dead fish

540
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:41,240
on top of her. Um, it's one of
too, once I'm done, I leave,

541
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:46,270
I go to my room and we don't mention and
we don't mention you don't mention it

542
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,690
in the morning and it's
not awkward at all. Ah,

543
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,460
if I had the Allah your song,
Oh, that's fucking great.

544
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,370
Would you guys look down at me if I
told you that I was just jealous of this

545
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:03,070
person right now?
That's fucking perfect.

546
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,170
And the hardest thing is going to be for
you to not fuck this up for you not to

547
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:10,450
develop failing's.
Okay.

548
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,450
Yeah.

549
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,230
You know, that's going to be a hard
one. But if you could somehow do it,

550
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:19,240
if you could somehow keep
yourself separated, you know,

551
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,720
you could just, Eh, it would be like a,

552
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,820
it'd be like stamps.com having the
post office and you fucking apartment.

553
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:32,140
Now you've got the post up your apartment
and now you have this blow job machine

554
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,690
also there. I mean it's
just tremendous, you know,

555
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,030
and then all you gotta
do is just decide what,

556
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,320
what kind of food you're always
going out for and you really like,

557
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,820
and you buy that appliance speed, a Panini
maker or a fucking cappuccino maker.

558
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,470
You got that stamps.com and the blowjob
machine down the hall and I tell you

559
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,390
that's it. Get the NFL
package, call it a life.

560
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,410
Um, so anyways, he goes, well,

561
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,260
we've gone about doing
this for a few weeks now,

562
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:09,290
but since I'm never home during the
week and she works during the day on

563
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:12,220
weekends, we don't exactly see
each other. And when we do, we,

564
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:16,530
we literally never say anything about
it or hint added at all, et Cetera.

565
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,290
Don't please don't fuck this up.

566
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,520
Please don't fuck this up. Okay? He says,

567
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:29,521
my question being as this is the first
time something like this has happened,

568
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,680
is this a time bomb waiting to happen?

569
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,860
We're all the crazy is going to come
flying out like the Ark of the covenant or

570
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,610
she just rebounding.

571
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:43,780
And I'm the free and clear until I
settle in and find something else.

572
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,000
Keep in mind, keep in mind that Jesus
cries. Sorry, I didn't go to church today.

573
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,980
Has died for rose and
is risen from the grave.

574
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,130
He did it all for you.

575
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,580
There's no way for you to thank him

576
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,410
once you give us a bunch of money.
Um,

577
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,600
keep in mind I've never been accused of
being good looking and she's pretty cute

578
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,640
with the grade a ass on her.

579
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,080
Any advice is appreciated and
I guess go fuck yourself. Um,

580
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,460
okay. All right. You did
the right thing. You know,

581
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:24,070
you've got a great situation and
you don't want to fuck it up.

582
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,060
Okay?

583
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,370
You know,

584
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,160
this is like the first time I went
deep sea fishing and I got a bite and I

585
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,440
looked at the dude next to me,
my doing it right. What do I do?

586
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,960
And I got to let it run a little bit.
Let it run a little bit.

587
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,960
Ne bringing it right.
You're doing the same thing all.

588
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,970
So what is your question here?
Is this a time what this is?

589
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,040
Okay. There's, there's the wildcard
that she's a psycho, but she, she,

590
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:49,320
she would have shown her colors by now.
I would think if she was a psycho,

591
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,990
you know, there would have been some
sort of, you know, God, you work so much,

592
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:59,991
I don't get to see you or
you would have to do on that,

593
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:06,000
you know, fucking twisting your arm hair
or doing something fucking annoying.

594
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,810
Some sort of annoying sort of touching.
Right. So she hasn't done that.

595
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,350
She's totally putting out the vibe

596
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,453
that

597
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,150
she's basically in the mindset.

598
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,930
It's this thing seems like it's
exactly what it is. You know,

599
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,860
she was in a relationship for
five years, five years, man.

600
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:28,140
She's got to decompress from that.
All right.

601
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,450
She likes to go out and get hammered and
get fucked and go to bed and not see a

602
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:37,790
dumb ass for the whole. All right.
Just keep it at that. This is the deal.

603
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,540
You don't have to bring it up either.
You don't have a bring it up either.

604
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,400
Just keep it the way it is. All
right. If she's barely talking to you,

605
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,210
you barely talked to her and he just have
fun with it and this is another thing

606
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:53,240
you do. All right. Have
Fun with this shit.

607
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,440
What is some things that you always wanted
to do with the woman and you haven't

608
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:02,340
done yet? This is the girl
you do it with. All right,

609
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,820
and she's going to probably do it with
youtube because she doesn't give a fuck

610
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:10,380
about you, which is a great thing.
What you have, sir is a fuck buddy.

611
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,940
Congratulations. This is your first
one. This is what men dream of.

612
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,720
This is what men really want. This is
what we want for Christmas. You know?

613
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,940
If we could just have a fuck buddy,

614
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,710
somebody who was clean with no diseases,
you know,

615
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,030
and somehow then had this pill they
could give you that you drank, you know,

616
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:34,000
you're washed it down and it got
rid of any sort of fucking guilt.

617
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,750
It will be perfect.
But just single dudes so there's no guilt.

618
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:42,670
So my thing is just don't, don't open
your mouth and fuck this thing up.

619
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,010
All right? You got a great thing going.
Okay. Just keep doing what you're doing.

620
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,890
And uh, the only thing I would correct
is this whole thing where you say,

621
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:55,120
you know, I'm not that good looking a
guy, you know, work on your self esteem.

622
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,390
She's pretty cute. Hey, you know,
good for her. She's got a nice ass.

623
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:05,140
Why don't you go fucking do some to it,
but not during the week.

624
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,070
No fucking during the week you focus on
your job, you have a great fucking time.

625
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,300
And I know it,
you know,

626
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,890
I guess eventually if you do meet somebody
and you start bringing them around,

627
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,980
there's, there is a potential, but uh,
you just got to nip that shit in the,

628
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:24,220
but I guess you've actually
met somebody that you liked,

629
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,873
uh,

630
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:31,540
at Jesus and he says, yeah,
I didn't think about that.

631
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,350
All right. First, first things first
before we even get over to her.

632
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,530
Uh, I mean, does it okay. Whole
new can of worms here, dude.

633
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,670
You have to be cool first and foremost.
All right. Because eventually,

634
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,970
you know,
if she meets some other dude,

635
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,670
you got to make sure that
you're not going to flip out.

636
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,190
So do not develop any
feelings for this girl.

637
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,670
And the only way you're not going to
develop any feelings for this girl is if

638
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,190
you see her once a fucking
week and your Banger, okay?

639
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,700
You don't want to know how many
brothers and sisters she has, right?

640
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,880
It's like reservoir dogs. You guys
shouldn't even know each other's names.

641
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,470
Tell me your name though to be a fucking,
I don't want any name. Yeah, you don't.

642
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,710
You don't. You want that? All right. All
right. You fucking Mr Pink or whatever.

643
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:22,240
She's missed a blonde or
Mrs Blonde. Uh, sorry.

644
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,130
Um, that's the only thing
you got to worry about.

645
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,430
All right.
So,

646
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,450
and I've learned to just be totally
fucking up front and honest self.

647
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,170
I got some new girlfriend. I would just
tell her what's up. So what's your deal?

648
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:41,890
Yeah, I'm single. I'm kind of banging my
fucking roommate once a week, you know,

649
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:45,370
we don't, you know, it's just
sort of a fuck buddy. Think. Oh,

650
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:48,580
does that make you
uncomfortable? Well, all right,

651
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,980
well then this relationship isn't
going to work because you're already

652
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:55,660
uncomfortable with me.
Now if I got feelings for you,

653
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,640
I wouldn't keep banging her,
but you know,

654
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,330
I'm not taking it off the table
after one fucking trip to Applebee's,

655
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,490
Jesus Christ free pussy. That's
like free shoes for you, right?

656
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,840
You know, I dunno. That's all I all I can
tell you, dude, you can't control her.

657
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,850
Who gives a fuck?
Dude?

658
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,160
Some day you're going to be 50 and you
gotta be married and she's going to be

659
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:20,410
bitching at you about something needy.
If you love her,

660
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,540
you at some point you just
can be reminiscent going,

661
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:26,560
you know when my life was the greatest
was when I had that little fucking

662
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,170
goddamn three bedroom apartment.

663
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,190
All I had to do was make this amount of
money a week and I had some chick once a

664
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,630
week with just fuck my brains out and
not talk to me for the other six days.

665
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,250
Goddamn dream. You got to dream, sir.
All right, and I don't know where,

666
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,620
but enjoy it while it lasts.
Okay.

667
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,960
I hope I answered your question. I really
do. You're in a hell of a situation.

668
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,460
Enjoy it. All right. Kudos
to you. I am jealous.

669
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,190
All right. Never by the largest
bottle of fucking water.

670
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,330
You bring it back down at
splashes in your face. All right,

671
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,940
next one here.
You know,

672
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:12,220
I was actually just thinking about
that whole new world order thing.

673
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,231
The new world order.

674
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:17,650
Say they say they're going to get the
population down to fucking 90% I know you

675
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:20,110
guys are flipping out.
How do you even do that?

676
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,370
Dino does the whole world,
just all,

677
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:29,650
somehow the world leaders
all finally agree. All right,

678
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,920
we're all doing the same thing.
Starting,

679
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,890
we're all going to kill
90% of our citizens.

680
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,260
Like how would you even begin?

681
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,840
How would you even begin that endeavor?

682
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,423
Okay,

683
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,400
well we just knocking
door to door. Hey, guess,

684
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,290
guess who's not on the right
list? Come on, pack up your stuff.

685
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,360
Oh, who gives a shit? Alright,
plowing ahead here. Um,

686
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,570
dad's getting a little too comfortable.
Hey Bill.

687
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,750
My brother and I live in our father's
house and recently he decided it's okay to

688
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:14,900
walk around the house and nothing
but sweatpants when he comes home.

689
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,520
He's gotten pretty fat over
the last couple of months
and it's pretty disgusting

690
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,450
to see. Is a euro giggly, you mean?

691
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:29,050
Gigli hairy stomach and tits around
while I'm trying to watch TV or work at

692
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:33,950
home. He also tells me what to do even
though he's kind of a piece of shit.

693
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,301
Uh,

694
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:40,301
he's a ta easy type that would get mad
if you confronted him and start wearing

695
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:41,960
almost nothing at all.

696
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,800
Okay.

697
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,810
Um, oh, nothing all the
time or worse somehow.

698
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,860
What should I do?

699
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,560
Okay.

700
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,130
Um, well, I don't know. Write a
song called Dad. Put your shirt on.

701
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:57,540
I don't fucking know. First of
all, you don't, you gotta do,

702
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,900
you got to get over yo this,
this whole, this whole fucking

703
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,250
okay.

704
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,560
Fear of confronting your dad.
You just got to get over it.

705
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,460
Just confront the guy and if he
starts walking around in his bbds,

706
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,890
you guys just sit around you
and your brother, your sister,

707
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:16,690
he just ridiculed them. Just
start chanting Tba Shit,
Todd by shit. Something.

708
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,140
I don't know what to tell you. You
know, why don't you just say Ya.

709
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,831
Ah,
how would you do it?

710
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:28,440
Maybe just act like you're giving them
a compliment when you're insulting him.

711
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,640
Okay.

712
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,970
Wait, just comes walking in.
Just be like, Hey, nice tits.

713
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:35,760
Okay.

714
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,650
And then as he goes to fucking respond,
you do,

715
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:41,250
you just sing that song that
doesn't exist yet. Eight day. Ah,

716
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,170
you just fucking walk away
and don't listen to him.

717
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,710
Yeah.

718
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,460
That's got to be the greatest
set of Harry tits I've seen. Bup,

719
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,300
bup, bup, bup. Booboo. You know,
just start making songs up.

720
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,630
Oh, theory is, oh, thank God. You know.

721
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,440
Thank God I was worrying that I wasn't
going to get to see you half naked today.

722
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,720
This is awesome tech.
Could you do me a favor?

723
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:06,460
I know you've done so many
wonderful things to me.

724
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,160
Is there any way you could get fatter?
You know,

725
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,840
could I buy some Rogaine
and just, you know, have you
sprinkle it on your fucking,

726
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,100
just so you can be even more sweating and
Harrigan fat. Could you do that for me?

727
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:21,010
Dead. That's awesome. You know,

728
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,980
do you have any consideration
for mom whatsoever?

729
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,410
She must have been attracted to you
at some point, right? Are you so fat?

730
00:44:29,411 --> 00:44:32,610
You can't even wear a hoodie.
Just just to just roast the guy.

731
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,333
Okay.

732
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,090
All right. Here we go. Let's
just fucking plow ahead here.

733
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,420
Yeah, why don't you do that, right? Some
old school jokes, although she had ted,

734
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:46,460
so you get fucking beat, but
not, but do we just fill it in?

735
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,740
I'm turning old friend into
girlfriend. All right. Wait a minute.

736
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,380
I already read that one. Oh, this
is a new one. All right, Bill.

737
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:58,430
Loved the podcast would really
like yours and knee as if possible.

738
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,400
Thoughts on the subject. Oh,
you want Nia? She's not here. I,

739
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:06,470
it might be time for another
little fucking MMP epilogue.

740
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,710
I'll see if she's up for it.
I'm only in town for a day and a half.

741
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:13,540
I don't know if I have to. You
know what? I'll do another one.

742
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:18,100
You guys liked the last one so much.
All right. Here we go. There's a girl,

743
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,820
there's a girl. I know where the
hipsters go called cunty but dude,

744
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,880
twist, twist. Um,

745
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,160
I should really hand out a free
DVD for everybody knows that song,

746
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:32,440
but I won't because there's too
many Flintstone fans out there.

747
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,020
That was the bed rock song.
Um,

748
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,750
there's a girl I'd been friends
with for over a decade now.

749
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,770
We met in college and for
about a year or two back then,

750
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,580
I would have considered her
one of my closest friends here.

751
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:47,740
We start reading and you're just not
even listening to what you're saying.

752
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:52,240
You guys mind if I go back, is
this a guy? What are we doing here?

753
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,940
Um, there's a girl I'd been
friends with for over a decade now.

754
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:58,480
We've met in college and for about
a year or two back then I would have

755
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:01,060
considered her one of my closest friends.
Um,

756
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,190
during that whole time
she had a boyfriend.

757
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:07,000
So I never thought about making a move
and lack the confidence to do so anyway.

758
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,740
As time went on,

759
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:12,490
we gradually lost contact until
recently when I found her on Facebook.

760
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,300
Well how did you do that until recently
when you searched her on Facebook?

761
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:19,630
Cause you would thinking about
her if he just said that,

762
00:46:19,631 --> 00:46:23,710
that would have been so much less creepier
than to say who until recently what I

763
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,820
found her on Facebook. Oh
Hey, you kind of did say that.

764
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,170
Am I even listening to what I'm saying?
I'm sorry sir. I'm an asshole. Anyways,

765
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:36,070
plowing ahead and we spoke for
the first time in eight years.

766
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,690
We live in the same city, so I suggested
we get together and catch up. Um,

767
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,770
which she is enthusiastic
about and is going in,

768
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:47,980
is going to happen sometime soon.
Now for the details.

769
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:51,700
We are both single and 30 years old.
She is recently divorced.

770
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:56,110
No kids clean break with little
or to no drama. She's beautiful.

771
00:46:56,111 --> 00:47:00,340
And honestly one of the nicest people
I've ever met back when we were close I

772
00:47:00,341 --> 00:47:03,220
was okay looking but
extremely skinny and shy.

773
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:08,221
Since then I put on about 25 to 30 pounds
of fat and muscle distributed pretty

774
00:47:09,131 --> 00:47:13,030
evenly. I like this guy, he's honest.
Uh, so I'm looking much better.

775
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,870
Um, and that has boosted
my confidence, my question.

776
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:23,190
She is only know me as the friend zone
guy but does eight years with no count a

777
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:26,070
racist? Yes. Um,

778
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,990
and do you think I might
have a shot with her? Yes.

779
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,120
And any advice about how to go about and
how to act and what to say on the night

780
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:37,630
we catch up would be greatly
appreciated. Thanks in advance. GS.

781
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,980
One thing may be an issue here.
She doesn't have herpes does she?

782
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,040
Um,
after I suggested a ketchup,

783
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,370
I checked out her Facebook page and
it turns out that she changed her,

784
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:53,371
set their status from married to
single only a day or two earlier,

785
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:57,190
but in real life, she said she'd
been single for a few months.

786
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:02,590
So that was inadvertent,
rotten timing on my part.

787
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:06,600
Hopefully I don't come across as tankless,
opportunistic douchebag.

788
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,490
No, dude, you're fucking
overthinking that.

789
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,930
Unless she was sitting there
watching her Facebook page every day,

790
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:18,340
like a fucking day trader waiting
for her to get through that divorce,

791
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,430
then it would be creepy. But other
than that, no. Dude, you're a good guy.

792
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,790
Sounded good guy. Anyways. All right, so
what is your question? Okay, yeah. Dude,

793
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:29,560
you're not in the friend
zone anymore. You're a whole
new guy. Okay. You like the,

794
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:32,650
uh, you, you know, it's like, yeah,
yeah. To make over. He got some fucking,

795
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,970
he got a little brown going and
you got some confidence. Um,

796
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:42,550
you definitely have a shot with her. She
probably was Dayton asshole's back then.

797
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,550
And when she's going through that shit,

798
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,300
she was probably thinking,
you know,

799
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:50,060
at this time around I'm
going to get a nice guy, you
know, I should have got with,

800
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,710
he was just the nicest guy and for
some reason I just never fucking blah,

801
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,270
blah blah.
And we were such good friends.

802
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,510
She probably had that conversation and
when she got to the part where she said,

803
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,580
and we were such good friends,

804
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,960
she class both of her girlfriends
hands and her hands, you know,

805
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,410
and there's probably some crumpled up
tissues in her lap as like, you know,

806
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,640
she was getting through her divorce.
Oh look at me painting a picture.

807
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:18,200
I think you're in there. All right.
Now don't overthink this shit.

808
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,753
Okay.

809
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,330
Because you're acting like this girl's
already the one you don't fucking know.

810
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:24,410
You haven't seen her in eight years.

811
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:27,320
So just walk in there
fucking and have a good time.

812
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:33,020
Throw your Dick on the table and ask her
how she's been. What's up sweetheart?

813
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,870
The fucker you've been doing
for the last decade. Huh?

814
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,420
A couple more drinks over here.
Sorry.

815
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,150
Jokes into of the
podcast. Sorry people. Um,

816
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,973
okay.

817
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:50,390
Yeah, that's what I would do.
Or you're funny. Make a laugh.

818
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:52,790
I'd always works.

819
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,040
Okay.

820
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,590
Tell us she looks good. Just,
Oh, look at you. You look great.

821
00:49:57,591 --> 00:49:59,720
Give her a nice hug or something.
You know, if she goes for the hug,

822
00:49:59,721 --> 00:50:00,554
give her a hug.

823
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:06,290
Oh my God. That's the big thing. When you
walk in, do not fucking shake our hand.

824
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:11,060
Do not shake her hand. Don't go for
the hug. If you're not a good hugger,

825
00:50:11,061 --> 00:50:14,690
but do not shake her hand.
Oh, if you're not a hugger,

826
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,610
then what the fuck are you going to do?
You gotta Hogrefe this is what you do.

827
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,620
You fucking act like Deniro in Goodfellas
after the lift one's a heist or

828
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:29,130
whatever the fuck it was. [inaudible]
Yo, come here, Yo God damn.

829
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,040
You got to have that fucking vibe.

830
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,550
Come make Yo. That's what you do.
What's the matter with you? Um, yeah,

831
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:38,390
just have her bring it in.

832
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,320
You're a nice fucking hug and you have a
couple of drinks. You know what I mean?

833
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,360
Let's see what happens. Just
don't, don't overthink it.

834
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:50,240
You're gonna end up psyching yourself up.
That's the only thing.

835
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,590
What the hell else did I want
to talk about? Oh, this week,
everybody this week. Oh,

836
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,700
Billy red face.

837
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,870
He's winding up in New York and then
I'm going down to Jacksonville, Florida,

838
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:03,380
Jacksonville, Florida. Everybody going
to go down there and watch the people,

839
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:06,110
rest of some gators. Um, I've
actually never been there.

840
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,810
Only thing I know about Jacksonville
is they have the Jaguars,

841
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,340
which I'm going to the game on Sunday.

842
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:14,240
And then they also have a Florida
plays Georgia there every year.

843
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:19,241
The biggest cocktail party in the
universities say stadium holds like 60,000

844
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:22,870
people in like fucking 800,000
people show up just to tailgate.

845
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,830
I imagine they make most of their
fucking money for the year. Um,

846
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,220
sounds pretty awesome.
So some of these already reached out,

847
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,440
said they'd take me shooting. I
want to go skeet shooting. You know,

848
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,390
I want to do something like that. I want
to do something fucking real. Goddamn.

849
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,270
Rednecky I went to fucking the
drag strip last week. Why not?

850
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:47,990
You're in Jacksonville when? In Rome.
Um, so I'll be at the comedy zone.

851
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:51,620
Tickets are going fast. Everybody,
believe it or not, never been there.

852
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:56,540
They're going fast. Maybe the yell at me
for calling, making fun of this city. Um,

853
00:51:56,541 --> 00:52:01,460
and then the week after that
I go to Cincinnati baby.

854
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,200
If you ever wondered,
I wonder what ever became of me.

855
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,820
I'm telling jokes and a fucking mall,

856
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,890
a fucking strip mall in Cincinnati.
Um,

857
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,390
and then what do I go after that?

858
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:22,391
Then I come back to New York and
then I go to Australia to play the,

859
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,750
uh, the Opera House. You
know when they show up,

860
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,590
whenever they show pictures of
Sydney and they got that little,

861
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,650
a little clam shell thing,
they get a little club in there,

862
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:35,210
like a 400 seater and I'm
doing a, I'm doing three,
three nights there, I believe.

863
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,430
And then I'm doing some big
comedy festival out there.

864
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:38,540
I'm really excited about it.

865
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,900
And then I'm gonna stay for an extra
couple of days and believe it or not,

866
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,490
I think I'm going to go snorkeling
in the Great Barrier Reef.

867
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,230
Why wouldn't you? Because you
don't want to get eaten by a shark.

868
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,990
That's my big thing. I go, I don't
want to get eaten by a fucking shark.

869
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,760
A great white shark is what?
And the guy,

870
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,550
oh know that water's too hot
for great whites. Oh good.

871
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,620
So the other thousand species of sharks,

872
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:04,520
those are the only ones that got
to worry about hammerheads, tigers.

873
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:06,050
They got Barracuda out there.

874
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,860
First of all I want to do is take the
boat out and look at, and I'm like, no,

875
00:53:09,861 --> 00:53:12,950
you gotta stick your faith in
the water and see all the colors.

876
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,920
So I'm going to do it. I'm gonna
roll the dice. You know why?

877
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:19,940
Because people do it every
fucking day and they don't die.

878
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,840
Every once in a while somebody dies.
So,

879
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:30,480
so why not you bill? That's what I
always come back to. Oh, gives a shit.

880
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:31,560
What would you rather do?

881
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:36,900
Would you rather be in an underwater
die in an underwater like wonderland

882
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,100
getting ripped to shreds
by some monster or a

883
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,490
die slowly in a FEMA camp smell and other
people's feet? I mean it's, it's just,

884
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:49,980
it's just no good way to go unless
you go when you sleep, you know,

885
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,660
with headphones on listening to the
Lake parade music will not be nice.

886
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,310
Um, all right. What do we got here?
Overrated. Underrated for this week, Bill.

887
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:02,460
Huge Fan.
First off,

888
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,690
get the fuck back to Melbourne again.
What's with this Cindy? Sydney bullshit.

889
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,470
Uh, Sydney only bullshit. Well,

890
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:13,080
I've never performed or I guess
I did Melbourne at one time,

891
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:15,180
but that was a comedy central thing.
Anyways,

892
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:19,970
I have a couple of hundred
raids for you. First. Uh,

893
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:25,010
first underrated rapping over heavy guitar
riffs and rap songs with Guitar Solos

894
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:29,300
in them. Why the hell isn't
anyone doing this anymore?

895
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:33,060
While I was listening to some old run
DMC songs like raising hell and tougher

896
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,960
than leather and that shit is the tits.
Secondly,

897
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,960
underrated Patrice O'Neil.
Sadly,

898
00:54:39,961 --> 00:54:42,450
I never saw any of his
stuff until he passed.

899
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,820
Fucking shattered about that card is
elephant in the room special and it's

900
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:52,590
fucking epic. Clearly one of the best.
We'll be buying his entire catalog asap.

901
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,680
Well that's awesome man. Um, yeah, he was,

902
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,900
he was just getting
known by the massive sea,

903
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:02,460
but he was not underrated with fellow
comedians. Believe me. Believe me.

904
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:06,050
Um, so yeah, if you buy 'em,

905
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,010
if you by Mr p, all the proceeds
goes to a, goes to his mom.

906
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:15,120
So that's a cool thing to do. And
uh, yeah man, he, he's unreal.

907
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,170
I still can't talk about
that shit. Anyways, plowing,

908
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,920
he had the Monday morning podcast. This
is what it's banned people 55 minutes,

909
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,110
55 minutes.

910
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,290
That's what you get in this week as
they sit in my God damn hot apartment.

911
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,130
But you know something,

912
00:55:29,131 --> 00:55:32,580
you're going to get the epilogue when
Nia answers whatever the hell that

913
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:36,810
question wasn't. Want to thank all you
guys for listening and uh, and seriously,

914
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,010
no bullshit.
Not Joking here.

915
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:40,950
I want to thank everybody for
coming out to these shows. You know,

916
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:44,190
I had eight shows here in Caroline's
and they've all been packed.

917
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,010
I went to two cities that
I've, you know, Orlando,

918
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,990
I never performed in the
old packed all weekend.

919
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:53,610
Charlotte was all packed and I'm hearing
that Jacksonville and Cincinnati is,

920
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:58,200
uh, is, is looking like it's going to
be the same thing. So, uh, you know,

921
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,140
just fucking unreal. It's
unreal. You know what I mean?

922
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:03,540
It's one of those deals where
every time you go into the club,

923
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:05,910
you PK hit your head in going like,

924
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:08,490
is this the show where it all
starts going back the other way?

925
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:10,320
And you see it's all the way to the back.
You're like,

926
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:14,700
thank God fooled them for another
day. Um, so I was seriously,

927
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:18,270
I want to thank everybody
who's come out and, uh,

928
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:19,890
I'm feeling great about my new hour.

929
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,130
I'm actually going to be taping
something for comedy central.

930
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,170
I'm doing that night
night of too many things.

931
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,043
Stars.

932
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,070
I know that is the worst name ever.

933
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,680
There's just too many stars. Was joking
with the Gao book me. I was like, okay.

934
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,060
They said if they said night of too many
Douche bags, I would have been all over.

935
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:46,350
But uh, I dunno. Ever Deli, it's
booked by this major guy in.

936
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:50,430
It's some guy that I should know and
it'd be a good thing if I did it for the

937
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,050
career. So you know, I got to do it.

938
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,180
I've got to jump on another
Goddamn plane right now.

939
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:57,810
I'm thinking about which bits, what
bit for my new hour am I going to burn?

940
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,530
I think I'm going to do the Steve
jobs bit. That's the game plan.

941
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:06,120
I'm going to do that one because I don't
think that that has enough legs until

942
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:09,300
my next special, it might, if I
can tag it on to something else,

943
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:14,810
I'm going to put it out there at the risk
of offending a bunch of fucking nerds

944
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:17,100
who were into technology.

945
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,970
I always think no matter
how fucking offensive I get,

946
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:24,900
the fact that you can just see through
to how fucking uninformed or stupid I am,

947
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,290
depending on how you read me
that that kind of, you know,

948
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,090
take some of the sting out of it.
Right.

949
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,910
Did I already begin the apology
for what the fuck I'm going to say?

950
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:37,380
I think I did. Alright, Dennis, a podcast.

951
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:42,180
You guys follow me on Twitter? No thing
that I said, I'd never do. I never tweet.

952
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,580
I actually, I'm Nia sent
me a clip of the, uh,

953
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,190
the official trailer for
the movie standup guys.

954
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,790
Do you remember back in April? I, I, um,

955
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,940
didn't do a podcast or I'm on a Monday
and it was really late and I said one day

956
00:57:59,131 --> 00:58:03,090
I would tell you I would give you a
great excuse as opposed to all the other

957
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:03,240
weeks

958
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,860
when it's late,
just because I'm an idiot.

959
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:08,190
A one of those weeks I was
shooting those scenes in the,

960
00:58:08,191 --> 00:58:10,230
and that movie stars a Alpa Chino,

961
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:15,060
Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin and I'm,
yeah.

962
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,450
So I was laughing when everyone's like,
where the fuck a podcast,

963
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:22,170
you fucking piece of shit. And
I so wanted to be like, well,

964
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,200
I had to do some scenes with some
of the greatest actors of all time.

965
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:31,350
Sorry, I'm late. You know, granted,
I only have a couple of words,

966
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:36,090
but it's big to me. Um, so
anyways, the, the official trailer,

967
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:40,680
if you're, if you're, um, do you
sign up for me on Twitter? Um,

968
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,930
you can see it or you can just go
on fucking youtube. Who's kid? No,

969
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,720
I'm just trying to get
more Twitter followers.

970
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:48,150
If you're already listening to this
shit that you need to be over there too.

971
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,990
You don't, it's redundant. It's like
I have your cell phone number now.

972
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:55,230
I'm asking for your home phone number.
You know what? Don't follow me on Twitter.

973
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,280
How about that? All right. That's the
podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves.

974
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:04,410
Um, I'm really hoping my patriots are
going to win this week. I'm actually

975
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,060
watching the patriots in a different
way this year because I don't,

976
00:59:08,061 --> 00:59:09,110
I don't think we're good enough.

977
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,080
I just don't think anybody in the AFC
is good enough to fuck with the NFC.

978
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:16,490
Although the 40 niners lost to the
vikings today. So who knows? Who knows?

979
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,640
Um,
but I'm just excited to watch,

980
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:24,170
hopefully the development of a,
a chat channel Jones.

981
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:27,230
I just hope he turns into a
first ballot hall of fame,

982
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:32,180
defensive absolute fucking nightmare for
the other team that just comes in and

983
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:36,440
just disrupts every pass play. Just
something that we, we've never had.

984
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,010
We've never had. The closest thing we
had to that was Andre tip it, you know,

985
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,860
and he was aligned back.
We've had some great linebackers,

986
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:46,940
Bruschi verbal and all those
guys. Willie McGinest, you know,

987
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,100
but we've never had a hall of fame.

988
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,500
I don't think we ever had
nick [inaudible]. He's
the only one we ever had.

989
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,790
We traded him to Miami because we thought
he was too small. And he was like,

990
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,810
I'll show you too small.

991
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,470

to back Superbowls. Go Fuck Yourself.

992
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,350
Thank you for the hall of fame
jacket. Um, all right, that's it.

993
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,300
I'll talk to you guys next week.
Go Fuck Yourself.
