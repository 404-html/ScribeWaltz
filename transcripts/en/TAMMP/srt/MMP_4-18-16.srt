1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:01,831

2
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:05,160
what's going on is bill burn is time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,700
April 18th, 2016 what's
going on, dude? Hawaii.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,460
Um, I don't know. I don't even know why.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,810
I don't even know where to
start on this fucker one. Um,

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,390
how do you begin? This one is
still be sensitive, sensitive.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,760
There's so many sensitive
stories out there.

8
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:29,770
Everyone there is when there's feelings,
they're uninformed

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,270
or you tried to approach this,
um,

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,300
this fucking lay down at the
zoo in Palm Beach, Florida.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,090
Rest his soul got attacked and killed,

12
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:49,050
got mauled a by a fucking tiger,

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,020
sometimes referred to as
the tiger whisper, Yadda,
Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda,

14
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,920
Yadda, Yadda, and all that fucking
shit. These, I don't know what it is

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,420
about people who fall in
love with wild animals.

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,110
There's nothing you can do to cure it.
It's fucking,

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,170
it doesn't give a fuck about you.
It's not a dog,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,210
you know,
fallen in love with a wild animal.

19
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,860
It's like falling in love with a stripper.

20
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,220
Yeah. It's just not gonna end.
Well, it's not gonna end well,

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,580
fucking unbelievable. Then there's
another story. This fucking scout leader,

22
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:37,320
it takes a bunch of boy scouts, takes a
bunch of children into the fucking woods.

23
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:41,100
He goes into a cave and there's
a fucking bear in there,

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,540
fill the whole story's always an amazing
that the boy scouts kept their fucking

25
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,380
cool.
That guy knew.

26
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:53,970
The scout leader knew that he pulled his
shirt up over his face and then curled

27
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,930
up into the fetal position, which I guess
is the international bear signal like,

28
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,270
hey man,
I don't want any part of this man.

29
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,940
And then the bear loss
interest in walked away.

30
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,680
But at no point during all
of this does anybody say,

31
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,603
hey,

32
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,960
the fuck are you bringing a bunch of
kids around with his bears just walking

33
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:17,950
around. It's bad enough if you
take your kids to the fucking zoo,

34
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,930
the amount of times these God damn
things get loose. Or at the very least,

35
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,630
some fatty is going to walk
up to some polar bear cage.

36
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:27,810
Go over the fucking thing and stand there,
you know,

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,810
and then get fucking snatched by
this thing. And what is she saying?

38
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,750
What for you to fucking blow
your brains out. You Dope. Right.

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,920
So I'm not saying the lady who died in
Florida was a dope. I'm just saying that,

40
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,220
um,
I don't know.

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,010
You Insert yourself into this situation
and there's no good way to insert

42
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,400
yourself into a mauling to death by
tiger cause you knew what that means.

43
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,080
There was also, they always just say
malt. You know, like it came up like,

44
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,010
like some prisons shit and just
stuck you with the shank. It didn't,

45
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,050
it fucking crushed your neck and then
it started feeding on your energy.

46
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,050
That's fucking brutal.

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,533
Okay.

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,210
Hang on a second. Nia. Yeah. Okay.

49
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,460
What are you doing? You coming in?
No. All right. Did you lock me in?

50
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,293
No.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,250
Okay. Sorry. She just goes, she
freaking me out. They're like,

52
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,490
well I got these new locks on the door.
I thought she was locking the door.

53
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:35,880
It's still early here and I just woke
her up so she's going to be a little

54
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,060
grumpy. Nia, you want to come
in on the podcast? Let me know.

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,550
Oh, that's silence spoke volumes.
You know, I'll tell you right now,

56
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,490
getting married is kind of like a
falling in love with a wild animal.

57
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,330
Yeah.

58
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,740
You know as much as you love them, don't
get too close to the fucking end. Close.

59
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:56,574
Yeah.

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,380
Okay.

61
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,930
Um, yeah. Let me get back to it.

62
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,340
Why the fuck would you take
a bunch of kids out like no.

63
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,720
At no point does anybody addressed at
this guy took a bunch of fucking children

64
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:10,130
out to where there's bears and then they
watched him get fucking mauled for half

65
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:14,300
a second before he took his Izod
Aggie and yanked it over his head.

66
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,950
That's what you're supposed to do.

67
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,660
How have I been on the earth this long
and not known that that's what you do

68
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,770
when you run into the bear?

69
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,330
Is it because I'm not in scouting or is
it because most people are smart enough

70
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,920
to not be around bears?

71
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:31,340
To not reenact the fucking scene
from the Leonardo Dicaprio movie?

72
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,760
What was it called, the ray content?
I don't even, what the fuck it is.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,300
The revelent, the irrelevant,
whatever the fuck it was called.

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,780
I hate when they take some big word that
already exist and just makes you feel

75
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,500
like it's like, did they make
that word up? And it's like,
no, that word is existed.

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,390
The revenant,
right.

77
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,380
That word is existed your entire life.

78
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,590
Just you and everybody you know is too
dumb to walk around and use it on a daily

79
00:04:56,691 --> 00:05:01,430
basis and yeah, that's, it's a sad
feeling. Just sad fucking feeling. Um,

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,570
I forget what I was looking.
Oh yeah.

81
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,700
What to do if a bear attack shoe,

82
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,261
I can tell you right now,

83
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:12,770
this is going to be 99.9% white
people looking the shit up.

84
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:14,770
Yes.

85
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,160
Where the dubs that go out there,
I hate to do def jam material,

86
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,270
but it's fucking true.

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,280
Okay.

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Jesus fucking Christ 2016 and
he get mauled by a grizzly bear.

89
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,890
There's no excuse for that. And
you know how, you know, hallmark,

90
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:34,020
does it make a card?
Fourth Day you go,

91
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,530
you can go through all of
that whole sympathy section.
Sorry for your loss. Sorry.

92
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:43,320
You got this disease. Sorry, I was
a Douche yesterday. There's no, wow.

93
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,850
Fucking sorry. You got mauled by a
bear. They don't because it happens so,

94
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,960
so little. So few times.
There's no reason for it.

95
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,020
They should really make one of
those and make it even better.

96
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,610
It should like rhyme.
I hate to look,

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,000
I hate to stay on your face.
Got Mauled by a bear.

98
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,650
I'm really fucking sorry.
Uh,

99
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,170
I know something about a trolley. Go
Fuck Yourself. I hope you feel better.

100
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,260
Tension all zookeepers out there.
Uh, those are not your friends. Uh,

101
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:24,370
and they don't want to be there. And I
think a lot of them realize the situation.

102
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,190
They're not just sitting there fucking
waiting for you to give him another

103
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:29,650
fucking pile of Cube steaks.
They're sitting there,

104
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,390
even if they were born in captivity,

105
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,320
I guaran fucking tee you that they are
sitting there with this strange feeling

106
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:39,460
that there has to be more than
this. Look at me to look. I mean,

107
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:43,010
if you're a fucking tiger, even you're
a tiger born into captivity, right?

108
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,380
You're rolling around with somebody
dressed in a safari outfit. Okay.

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,280
And you bond with that person like
it's your fucking mother. Right.

110
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,570
It's some fucking point.

111
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,400
Okay.

112
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,550
It's some point,
you know,

113
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,360
just your ego alone with all those people
showing up just to look at you taking

114
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:02,660
your picture. This no weed, no. There's no
way to keep you four feet on the ground,

115
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,820
you know, and not be like, dude, uh,

116
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,670
why am I in a cage right now when
everybody's coming up? You know,

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,030
all I do is lay around every day and these
people can't get enough looking at me.

118
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,590
I mean, man, I, I'm the fucking
Shit, you know? And you just start,

119
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,470
you ego just goes fucking crate lane.
Then you start looking like, you know,

120
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:28,030
I don't know, you'd start testing.
They come in a little bit,

121
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:28,930
you give him a little growl,

122
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:32,800
you see it in their face and they get
some broom handle and get back and back,

123
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,030
right? You just Sorta, you know,

124
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,030
first time with your park
test the strength of that.

125
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,470
Okay.

126
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,170
Fucking little broom handle. Like,
dude, I could snap that thing.

127
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,480
This guy's fucking shoulders, guys, a
pussy, what? They're doing, tiger pushup.

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
And then one day you just like,
you know what?

129
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,290
As much as I'm enjoying
this fucking raw meat.

130
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,800
I have it every day and I need to
switch up the Diet, you know? Oh,

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,760
but I mall you and a usually
a belt is some dental floss.

132
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,330
I know, I know what you're thinking
right now. You probably think it build.

133
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,460
This is really fucking insensitive.
Well you know what,

134
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,080
this is how I deal with sad shit.

135
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,260
I joke around about it cause I don't
feel like they get about everybody that

136
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,370
loved that woman that now
can never see her again.

137
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,950
So I mean what am I supposed to do?

138
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:22,951
And then also I like to feel that I'm
being responsible by giving you some tips

139
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:27,820
on how not to a, yeah. You know, you
don't get good mauled to death by a bear.

140
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,520
I just don't understand that.

141
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:33,640
Like what's so fucking funny
about these goddamn scouts,

142
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,110
it's like why didn't he
just go in the woods?

143
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,850
You don't have to go into
the Goddamn wilderness. No,

144
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,350
fuck brings a bunch of kids out there.
I'll tell you,

145
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,630
it brings a bunch of kids out there,
kind of guy that goes on,

146
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,580
just walks into a fucking cave,
gets mauled by a fucking bitch.

147
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,660
Who the fuck walks into a cave in the
middle of the forest? What kind of it?

148
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,950
I mean, I'm not in scouting. I never was.
I can't start a fire without a match.

149
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,060
But I can tell you right now,

150
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,750
my general instincts say
is that says that you know,

151
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,320
okay,

152
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,820
there's no apartment buildings out in the
fucking forest. Okay, so a cave is like,

153
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:12,900
that's like a townhouse in Brooklyn.
You know?

154
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,010
Definitely people have to fucking
digging holes in the Goddamn ground,

155
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,970
curling up to hibernate and that.
Here's a fucking cave. All right,

156
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:24,390
so you think everybody who lives
out there, that's like fucking,

157
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,380
that's like Beverly hills level property.
So who's going to get it?

158
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,060
The strongest sick is craziest
motherfucker out there and that's a bear.

159
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:33,841
You know,

160
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,870
you're not going to walk in there and
there's going to be a little fox in there

161
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:39,930
like it isn't.
It's going to be some fucking,

162
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,490
it's going to be the king of the forest.
Which is a bear as far as I know.

163
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,180
Although I did see a mountain lion
give it a couple of fucking, you know,

164
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,350
Pernell Whitaker is, you
know, memo fast. That guy was,

165
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:55,830
they would just fucking right on top of
his head and the bear just sat there and

166
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:56,664
taking,
you know,

167
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,480
he had like the head movement of light
of late Mike Tyson rather than early and

168
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:05,460
he just took a few and then he just
sorta started running away was a sad day,

169
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,890
you know? Um, anyways,

170
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,000
just imagine if you ran into a
badger or a fucking wolverine.

171
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,190
Those lunatics.

172
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,750
Okay.

173
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,070
Badges and Wolverine still like the Irish
and the Scottish of the fuck at forest.

174
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,993
You know what I mean?

175
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,600
Okay.

176
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,230
Those things don't even quit.
Even, even if they're losing it,

177
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,530
they just got that. I don't give a
fuck, you know, blood all over the face.

178
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,210
They're not stopping.
They're going to keep coming.

179
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,880
Just like the Irish and the
Scottish fucking loaded ticks.

180
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,490
You don't want any part, any
part of that? Well, you know,

181
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,340
I don't know oil.
You know what?

182
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,810
I never even look to say Kate
impairing counters and back country.

183
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:50,680
If you encounter a bear on the
trail or in your campsite. Yeah.

184
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:53,740
Cause you're cooking food basically
the dinner bell of anything.

185
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:54,574
But then fucking,

186
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,220
yeah.

187
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,670
Oh my God. Look at this size
of this fucking bear. Oh,

188
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,430
there's a lady fucking walk in and
there's a bear in the background.

189
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,560
Guess what color she is. All
right. Be Safe and bear habitat.

190
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,660
Oh God. This is the first sentence.
The level, I mean, as dumb as I, uh,

191
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,900
the level of dopes that have to become
to this website. Listen to this.

192
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:21,220
Just the first sentence.
It's normal. It's normal to,

193
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,830
I said normal. It's normal to be
frightened when you encounter a bear.

194
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,310
That's how this, this is,
this is the jump off point.

195
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,240
The reality is that most
encounters with bears rarely,

196
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:37,470
rarely lead to aggressive behavior.
And attacks are even rarer. Yeah.

197
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:42,240
They go sucking into the forest.
I mean it happens,

198
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:44,910
but generally is,
here's a great lie.

199
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,040
They're actually more afraid of
you then you are of them. Yeah.

200
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,080
And what do they do when they get,
when they're afraid.

201
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,203
Okay.

202
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,470
They either take off running
or they fucking mall you to
death. I think though, a,

203
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,400
you know, here's a bonus. The threat
is gone and now I have a midday snack.

204
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,960
A remember it? Most bears preferred
to avoid contact with humans.

205
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,250
That's hilarious. They're
like the champion that doesn't
want to fight. You know,

206
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:16,030
just trying to hold on to the belt back
pedal in the entire time until your

207
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:16,331
corner.

208
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:20,500
The fucking thing in any bear you do see
is probably just as frightened as you

209
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,270
are there.
It is every fucking,

210
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,913
yeah.

211
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,610
You know what it is that bears
don't have access to a mirror.

212
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,130
They're living in their heads. You know,
they're out there by themselves, you know,

213
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,990
talking to themselves account man.
You know,

214
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,130
I'd love to find a cave or some shit,
man. Right? And all of a sudden,

215
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:46,090
so they finally find it. Nobody else
is in here. You can fucking chill out,

216
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,150
put an l shaped couch over here,
get a flat screen.

217
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:52,420
And all of a sudden this fucking guy
comes walking in and his God damn shorts.

218
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,060
You know what he's thinking?
He's thinking to catch a predator.

219
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,750
He's probably seen that show too.
He comes as fucking pedophile.

220
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,610
The bear thinks he's going
to get fucked in the ass.

221
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,500
And next thing you know he's on top of
this guy or I and a fucking dude stodge

222
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:07,360
Yank and his shirt over his head. And
then the bears like, what the fuck?

223
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,070
Sky's a bottom. You know, I thought
this guy was trying to rape me.

224
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,530
Now all of a sudden he's acting
like we'll make it love here.

225
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,560
And he's been all submissive.
This is fucking weird in me out.

226
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,540
What if he tells his friends the bears
all homophobic and then he kills him and

227
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,350
why? You know what? And there's a bunch
of little kids watching it. All right?

228
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,420
And that's what camping is.
And I think, you know what?

229
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,250
I have to haven't worked
that out right there.

230
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:33,980
I think scouring should be illegal. You
know what I mean? We want to get there.

231
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:34,990
Well first of all,
you know,

232
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:37,570
dressed in those little boys up
like little French maid's, you know,

233
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,180
the will scarfs running around.
I mean it's just a, yeah.

234
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:45,040
Wonder why he got all
the sexual predators, sex
predators, sexual predators.

235
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,830
I don't. A sexual chocolate, um, anyways,

236
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:51,550
remained as composed as possible
and follow these simple guidelines.

237
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:55,150
Whenever you're in bear country,
soon you will,

238
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,530
you two will have more composure when
citing a bear because you know what to do

239
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,890
a scream bloody murder and
running the other direction.

240
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,100
And actually it's the exact
opposite of what you want to do.

241
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:10,240
You want to remain calm and take a step
towards the beer that shows a level of

242
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,140
confidence.

243
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:12,940
Okay.

244
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,020
Fucking dope. All right. First
one, avoid. Avoid, avoid.

245
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,530
Yeah.
Light by staying in civilization,

246
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,780
the best way to prevent an unpleasant
and unpleasant bear encounter is to avoid

247
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,680
them all together.

248
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
Bears usually avoid people and most
people don't even know when they,

249
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,100
they've come close to a bear.
Exactly.

250
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,550
To ensure a surprise or an to ensure a
surprise or unpleasant encounter with the

251
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,540
bear doesn't occur.

252
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Avoid moving through bear habitats
silently and alone traveling groups.

253
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,320
The larger the better.

254
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,390
And make lots of noise by talking or
singing and put the iPod and pay attention

255
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,180
to your surroundings. Ah, Jesus Christ.

256
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:58,380
I don't know about that.

257
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,010
What if the bears having a slow fucking
couple of days and is hungry and you

258
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,200
start seeing, oh, I'm saying I get it.

259
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,180
The ranger school Beto Beto Zip,
Betty Doe,

260
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,930
Dad, Zip, Ada, you know, in the
bear starts sticking you like,

261
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:19,980
you know what? I think it's worth
the risk. Even though I'm scared.

262
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,940
I think I could take that fucking
hundred 40 pounds. Dope. All right.

263
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:27,570
When it happens, she how
they wrote down. Instead it,

264
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:31,050
when you're getting mauled by the bear
and you feel its breadth in his fucking

265
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,030
incisors ripping at your
neck when it happens. That's
another way of saying that,

266
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,970
uh,
remain calm and ready.

267
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:43,200
Your bear spray or other deterrent,
what is it?

268
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:46,980
Your underarm hair, uh, stay
together. If you're in a group,

269
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:50,280
you will appear larger and more
intimidating. If you stick together,

270
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,400
try to figure out whether the bear
is a grizzly or a black bear. Hey,

271
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,590
that thing running that
is 40 miles an hour.

272
00:15:56,591 --> 00:16:01,120
If you had a dog that's over fucking over
trying to figure out whether the bears,

273
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:02,260
uh,
grizzly or a black bear.

274
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,220
As you will see below grizzly bears and
black bears tend to behave differently

275
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:07,300
in a given situation.

276
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,210
So it helps to know which species
you're dealing with as it's running.

277
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:13,660
After you give me a fucking break,
I just click here to see the difference.

278
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,470
Okay.

279
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,290
Bears at a distance,
dude. It's a fucking bear.

280
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,600
Yeah.

281
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,010
Look at these fucking things.

282
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,090
Okay

283
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,370
Dude.

284
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,850
The fact that one of these things could
pick up Lawrence Taylor at the height of

285
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:31,410
his fucking career and throw
him through the uprights. You

286
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,660
okay?

287
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,350
Get bear smart societies.
These fucking people like I don't get it.

288
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,590
I mean there has to be, why can't
you just go out in your backyard?

289
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:43,380
Just set up a tent. I mean
you, you are still outside.

290
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,020
As long as you don't go inside,
you are camping.

291
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,300
Okay?

292
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,290
It's not the same thing, man. I got
to get out there with his bears.

293
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,790
I know what to do. Right? If
it's a black bear, black bear,

294
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,850
they usually lead with the left.
You know what I mean?

295
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,910
The traditional put a grizzlies,
a south park,

296
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,380
so it's going to be a little bit weird.

297
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:06,620
They definitely have a reach advantage
considering when they stand up.

298
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:07,940
They're about eight feet tall.

299
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,170
So what you want to do is you want
to stay outside his wheelhouse. Okay.

300
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:15,170
And you want, you want to circle
away from his power pantry.

301
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,590
You want to circle to your left,
staying away.

302
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,790
The grizzlies want to load up that
left that go for the big shot.

303
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,720
They try to steal around.
I don't know. Sorry.

304
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:31,280
My am I beating this to death here?
I'm just, there's no fucking reason.

305
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,990
There's no reason to get killed by a
tiger in the United States of America.

306
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,100
They don't live here.

307
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,720
They're only one place there
at the fucking zoo at uh,

308
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,530
you know they're in cages self.

309
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:52,110
At some point you went into
the fucking thing. You did.
You just see, I don't know.

310
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,720
Oh my God. What is the fucking thought
when you get yanked in the second Uga?

311
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,140
Oh No, it's got to be it. Oh No.

312
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,490
Make it quick. I mean, just shit that
would go through your head. I'm sorry.

313
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:10,200
This is getting fucking morbid. Um,
so anyways, my condolences to the,

314
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,034
uh,

315
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,210
friends of families or the lady down there
in Florida and my condolences to the,

316
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:18,480
uh, the guy with the members only jacket
that he yanked up over his fucking head.

317
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,200
Uh, you know, good on
you, sir. I hope you,

318
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,110
I wish you more luck as you bring
children into the fucking woods.

319
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,350
Fucking idiot.

320
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,420
What is it about putting on a fucking
uniform that all of a sudden you think you

321
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,970
know something? I just don't
get it. Oh, I am. You know,

322
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,970
I have all my badges on my shirt.
I had been trained

323
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,480
for, he's a jolly good, fair.
That's where they should be singly.

324
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:51,480
This the thing that, you know,
we're never going to see you again.

325
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:52,830
Music right before you go into the woods,

326
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:57,720
just to fucking reminds you of what
you're walking into. Um, anyways,

327
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,190
so, hey, um, the official,

328
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:05,140
finally the official Lau,
um,

329
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,230
I'm allowed to finally say it.

330
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,380
F is for family has been
picked up for a second season.

331
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,780
Um, I actually got the news back in
January, but for whatever reason,

332
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,550
the way Netflix promote stuff,

333
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:21,390
which I would never question considering
they're dominating the universe.

334
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,850
They wanted to wait until last
Friday. So it is now official. Uh,

335
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,590
we are working right now. That's the
stuff I've been alluding to that, uh,

336
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:33,450
I've been working on. And
um, uh, what was I gonna say?

337
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,313
Uh,

338
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,060
actually this weekend I was writing
an episode so I missed all the fucking

339
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:40,920
hockey I saw.

340
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,560
The series that I'm watching is
Saint Louis first, the Black Hawks.

341
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,030
And when I saw game too,

342
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,930
I threw in the fucking
towel. I was like, that's it.

343
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,820
He gave a game to the Black Hawk. She
cannot give a game to the hawks. You know,

344
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,100
you had your foot on their fucking neck.
He had the gall,

345
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,050
the goal was fucking
called back or whatever.

346
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:05,470
I can't remember what happened to gold
got called back, right. Or terrorists,

347
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,160
ankles goal got called back
and then it's just like,

348
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:11,110
that coach should have gone down the
bench. No, let down. No let down.

349
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,160
Right.
What do they do?

350
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,820
They go out there that pissed terrorist
Sanko takes a stupid fucking penalty.

351
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,450
The Blackhawks score the goal and they
steal the fucking game and I was just

352
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:23,250
like, and I was texting
my buddy. I was like,

353
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:27,510
that right there is why the Blackhawks
win every fucking year in St Louis loses

354
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,160
every fucking year.
Whatever.

355
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:34,110
The Blackhawks have that ability to
remain calm when they're down Saint Louis

356
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,920
for my whole fucking life
has never had that right.

357
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,610
The right after I said all of that shit.
What are they doing?

358
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,550
Game three I didn't see the game.
I just looked at the highlights.

359
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,450
You know they fucking took three
quick penalties in the first period.

360
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,650
Chicago scored on the first, on the
first one. If I was watching that game,

361
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,090
I'd be like, here we go, here we go.

362
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,030
Chicago is going to win like the next
for the next four to five and they didn't

363
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:01,840
give him digging. Even Saint Louis Seal
right there. Fred St Louis came back,

364
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:06,160
tied it up one one. Chicago scores a
goal in the second period, two to one.

365
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,020
They're going into the third period
in Chicago. This is always said,

366
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,260
you know,
it's over for the blues.

367
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,670
It's always been that way since I don't
know how long it's been going on forever

368
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,710
now. Like the Blackhawks will
give my whole life to mean shit.

369
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:23,560
They went through a nice drug to,
but like the new black hawks,

370
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,360
like this series is over and
fucking Saint Louis came back,

371
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:30,250
tied it up to two and
then went ahead three,

372
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:35,251
two with like six minutes left and a so
a big congratulations to a the St Louis

373
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,550
Blues,
that huge fucking victory.

374
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:42,510
And I can't wait to see the next game
cause I know the Blackhawks and act in it

375
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,600
and I just got to go out like that. Right.
You know, they're going to tie it up.

376
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,590
They're going to go into St Louis. This
might go a, I don't know, may go seven.

377
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,430
I'm hoping for seven. You know,
I don't give a shit, but I'm,

378
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:58,510
I'm pulling for Saint Louis. I think
they're my team over Dallas. Just because,

379
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:01,450
you know, Dallas was
the north stars, right?

380
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,800
They've only been Dallas stars for
like, what, like 20 years. Eh. You know,

381
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,530
I mean those people down there, but they
have a bunch of cowboys who's kid too,

382
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,040
you know,
they getting plastic surgery yet.

383
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,050
How they got their oil welding
whites wearing too much makeup.

384
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,680
I mean the different Dallas, the big D,
it's a football town to football state.

385
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,700
I love the fucking stars.
I love the people on the stars.

386
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:25,860
But like I also like their
fucking college. They got
Celtic colors. I like to,

387
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,150
I still like to stars,
but you know, I think,

388
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:31,270
I don't think it's time for the blues.
They've been around since 67.

389
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,240
They never won shit.
So that's the team I'm pulling for GPL.

390
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,990
How you not for the Boston Bruins
because we didn't make the playlists.

391
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,893
Um,

392
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,600
but who would've thought a Blackhawks sit
down two games to one to the blues and

393
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:50,920
the Kings are down o two
to the San Jose sharks.

394
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,443
Um,

395
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,800
and actually a buddy of mine who writes
onF is for family before this all

396
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:59,410
started. He goes, I don't
give a fuck. He goes,

397
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,100
the Stanley Cup goes through Chicago or
la. And that's what everybody was saying.

398
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:03,251
Now,

399
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:07,090
granted we're only a couple of games in
here and granted the kings are playing

400
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,640
the sharks and,
and you know,

401
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:13,840
the sharks are like the San Diego
chargers if they were skates, you know,

402
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,870
every year coming out having
this wonderful fucking
regular season and then they

403
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:22,590
go in the playoffs and they just
shit the bed. So we'll seek,

404
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,480
they were up two games to none.
Um,

405
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,380
I think game for if you haven't
been watching as Tuesday night, uh,

406
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,260
the Black Hawks first, the blue. So I
would definitely be checking that out.

407
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,730
And um, I think that's it. I think
that's all I had on hockey. Right?

408
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,940
My Celtics, I watched them lose
game one, but I'm just so psyched.

409
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:42,790
They're in the fucking playoffs
and now they're a young team.

410
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,040
They should have won the game. They
should have been able to close it out,

411
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,570
but they didn't, but they hung in there.
They got high that just a little young.

412
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:49,910
Okay.

413
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,710
They just got to learn how to fucking
a filler that hopefully, you know what,

414
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,290
what I'm getting, I'm hoping, I'm
hoping that we get Kevin Durant.

415
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,540
He would be a great fucking Celtic. Uh,
whether he does that or not, I mean,

416
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,200
there's always someplace,
uh, you know, what's this?

417
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:10,680
This is the most crucial time
and I,

418
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:15,681
since I can remember for the Los Angeles
Lakers with Colby just fucking retired.

419
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,160
Okay. Their owner fucking
died to now they got the sun.

420
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,130
Okay.

421
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,270
Fuck head that he is sorry that it
had nothing to do with the Lakers.

422
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,890
I was just quoting.
What movie was that?

423
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:31,930
And then your son Fuck head that is left.

424
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:34,620
Is drivers less true romance.
Um,

425
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,480
okay.

426
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,220
Yeah.
They have to make something happen.

427
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,440
They got to throw their fucking
money around. I don't know.

428
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:43,950
They don't have the coach. They don't
have it. This could be for the first time.

429
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:47,970
You realize that the Lakers have one more
fucking championships since 1970 than

430
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:49,970
any other team in any other major sports.

431
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,583
MMM.

432
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,590
So I got to respect what they've done
more so than what anybody else has done

433
00:24:56,591 --> 00:25:00,700
prior to that. Because prior to
that was the 23 skidoo years.

434
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:04,690
Where did the shit was in fucking
basically black and white, you know,

435
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,700
segregated leagues. The Stanley Cup
was the size of a shot glass, you know,

436
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:13,540
the Celtics used to when that would be
like fucking five white guys against five

437
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:16,870
white guys or maybe five
against four white guys.

438
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:19,240
And then Bill Russell was out there.
You know what I mean? It's just,

439
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:23,200
it's just a completely
different time, you know? Um,

440
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,080
okay.

441
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,920
I Dunno. We'll see. So anyways, let me do
a little bit of advertising here. Sorry,

442
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:31,860
my brain's all over the place and I just
still can't get over how fucking people

443
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:36,861
get mauled 20 1620 fucking 16 I mean to
get mauled to death by a fucking tiger

444
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:43,140
in 2016 it's,
it's like,

445
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,003
okay,

446
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,023
I don't I to take a,

447
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,740
I think the probability of getting
run over by a stage coach is,

448
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,610
is just as probable like helping
people gain on, I got to look that up.

449
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,590
Death by stage coach is, you know,
this can be somebody, some wow.

450
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,190
Which show in Oklahoma fell off
the chuck wagon. Okay. You know,

451
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,080
what's going to be a guy too,

452
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:12,081
man killed under stage coach.

453
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,480
Let's see if we get to see we're getting
did you mean man killed under stage?

454
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:21,930
Coach? One word. I guess
I did. Unsettling events.

455
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,640
Stagecoach robberies,

456
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,120
police id man killed in Stowe crash.

457
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,720
Okay.

458
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,300
Fatal crash on stagecoach road,

459
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,770
72 year old man was killed Sunday morning
after a crash in West Lake township.

460
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:39,860
I know,
authority said.

461
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,290
Okay.

462
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,260
A vehicle traveling
northbound on coach Rowe job,

463
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,210
I guess it doesn't happen and whatever.

464
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,340
Somebody get kicked by a
horse or something stupid.

465
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,290
Something that should be
happening during this time,

466
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,710
but why can't you just admit that you
are wrong? All right, I was wrong.

467
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,970
It's more probable to get mauled to
death by a tiger. All right, let's uh,

468
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,500
let's do read some of the advertising
here. I do always shave club, everybody.

469
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,030
Dollar Shave club.com as a special
offer to new members who join today.

470
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:13,070
You get a free month of the executive
razor when you buy a tube of doctor

471
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,480
cabbies.
Easy shape.

472
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,420
This is the first time they've
ever done something like this.

473
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,360
And once you try dollar shave club.com,
you'll be,

474
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,710
you'll become a proud member like millions
of others just puffing your chest out.

475
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,260
As you walk down the street.
I get cheap razors.

476
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,120
What are you doing with your life?

477
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,440
One reason is because they deliver amazing
razors right to your door for third

478
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:37,290
of the price of what the greedy
razor corporations charge.

479
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,690
That means when you join it DSC,

480
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,230
you can afford to shave with a
fresh blade anytime you want,

481
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,880
which feels fantastic.
You feel like you're running a bank right?

482
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,740
Um, you get a first class shave when use
the executive blade without hurting your

483
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:53,340
wallet.

484
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,740
Another reason is Dr Carver's shave
butter can't believe it's not Garvey's.

485
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,620
Um,

486
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,330
using it with the executive makes the
blade glide gently for the smoothest shave

487
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:05,530
ever.
Dr Carver's shave butter.

488
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:09,300
If doctor [inaudible] isn't
your average shave cream,

489
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,350
it's a unique conditioning formula
with high quality natural ingredients,

490
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:18,240
leaving your skin feeling unbelievably
smooth and soft. And right now,

491
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:22,500
new members who buy a tube of the shave
butter, get the executive razor for free.

492
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,120
Uh,
they've never done this before.

493
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,900
Take advantage of it and it's only
available by going to dollar shave

494
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:32,901
club.com/bird that's dollar shave
club.com/burr that Jesus Christ,

495
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:36,930
how many have I got this
week? Alright, trunk club,

496
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,670
Trunk Club Trunk Club was started
to solve a simple problem.

497
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,270
Shopping for clothes in stores
is overwhelming and inconvenient.

498
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:48,390
It's not overwhelming. It's
sucks. Who wants to do that?

499
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,590
At least I don't. I don't want to fucking
do that. So if I don't want to do that,

500
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:55,230
then I assume everybody else does it.
Thank God for Trunk Club.

501
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,530
Cause with trunk club you'll discover
great clothes that are perfect for you.

502
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,360
Oh if you look at this shirt
without ever having to go shopping,

503
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,840

experts,

504
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:10,440
service and unparalleled convenience
to deliver a highly personalized

505
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,330
personalized experience
that helps you look.

506
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:15,270
Your best trunk club is
not a subscription service.

507
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:19,590
We send you clothes only when you
ask zero sign up or monthly fees.

508
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,530
He can't, he can't ask for anything
more than that. Look at that. You know,

509
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,790
they'll send you a
shirt whenever you want.

510
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,930
We sent trucks refrained
from saying boxes,

511
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,200
alludes to subscription service. I
didn't. I said, what the fuck you wrote?

512
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:36,750
Why would you put that sentence in the
copy? You know, I'm going to read it. Uh,

513
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:40,950
don't talk about price.
Talk about quality. Hey,

514
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,620
don't tell me what the fuck to do.
I'm reading. Why don't you just write?

515
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:45,930
What the fuck you want me to read?
You assholes.

516
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,040
How did this go from copy to
them wagging their finger at me?

517
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,790
I'll talk about what the fuck
I want to talk about. You know,

518
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:57,570
if you want to go to the fucking mall,
this is a great thing. Okay. They got it.

519
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,000
I mean, I can paraphrase all of this day
of an expert stylist. In other words,

520
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,540
someone who eventually we'll actually
get paid a decent amount of money to pick

521
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,970
up these clothes,
but right now they're new to the business,

522
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,230
so take advantage of their talents while
they still work for trunk club. Okay.

523
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,100
You tell them your basic styles.
I like concert tee shirts and flip flops,

524
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,300
whatever your fucking deal is,

525
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,850
and then they'll get somebody go
out and they pull a bunch of shit.

526
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,640
They stick it in the trunk, they sent
it to you. You keep what you want.

527
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:23,020
You take everything else you don't want.

528
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,930
You throw it back in the fucking trunk
and you send it back to them and that's

529
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:26,350
it,

530
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,900
and they don't send you any more shit
until you ask them to because it's not a

531
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:32,290
subscription service. All right. If
you'd like to take advantage of this,

532
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,680
go to fucking whatever the hell it is.
Trunk Club

533
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,560
please. No mention of competitors. I
don't even understand this. There's,

534
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,880
this is like a,

535
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,970
yeah,

536
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,520
this was more a letter giving me
shit for what I've been doing.

537
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:50,561
All right.

538
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:54,730
I'm going to say it's trunk club.com/birth
that's what I would go with a MVMT

539
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,740
watches.
You know,

540
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:59,970
it's been a few weeks now since I
cracked open these sharp looking, ah,

541
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,790
Jesus Christ.
Why do they keep doing this to me?

542
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,240
Why do they keep pumping?

543
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,820
Probably sent this copy out
to every person with the
podcast and everybody goes,

544
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:11,001
you know,

545
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:14,450
it's been a few weeks since I cracked
open these sharp looking movement watch

546
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:17,000
boxes. I did. I saw him the fucking great.

547
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:18,890
They looked like expensive
watches and you know,

548
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:21,260
but I am a fucking 48 year old man,

549
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:23,660
so I have an expensive watch and
I'm going to continue wearing that.

550
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,620
If I was in my twenties or early
thirties if I'd gone through a divorce,

551
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,630
these are the fucking watch for you.
Okay?

552
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:33,800
So you can still attract some
expensive tail. All right. Without,

553
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,440
you know you're still have money to
buy her a drink. That's basically it.

554
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,250
All right.

555
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,070
If you haven't had a chance to experience
how movement watched fits around your

556
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:40,610
wrist,

557
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,930
this is the chance movement watches start
at just $95 seat when movement cut out

558
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:47,390
the middle man with the
huge big bank brand markups,

559
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,360
the price of a stylish watch,
finally got affordable.

560
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,280
Imagine that exclamation point.

561
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,990
A watch with the department store quality
for a fraction of the price. Okay?

562
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,580
So if you want one of those
things, go to MVMT. Um,

563
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,110
MVMT watches.com/bar and they'll give
you 15% off your entire purchase.

564
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:10,610

585
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,010
You know, fucking, you know,

586
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,150
attacked by a bear in the wilderness
as you're walking around with fucking

587
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,710
20 children that aren't yours.
I mean,

588
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:51,780
that sounds like an episode of law and
order. Boop, boop, boop, boop. Ooh.

589
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,050
Like what the fuck were you doing out with
the, with all of those kids? I found a,

590
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,970
um,
all right.

591
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,260
My gym got delayed by some bullshit,
you know,

592
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,030
not some bullshit, just some shit. And I'm
just like, now do it. Right. They're like,

593
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:11,180
we can do it this way or we can do it the
right way. I might do it the right way.

594
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,570
So,
um,

595
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,620
I have not been working out and I've been
eating like shit because I'm just like,

596
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,750
well, the second the gyms there, I'm going
to fucking go like a madman. But, uh,

597
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,450
Jim is taking longer than I
thought and uh, you know, oh,

598
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,500
Billy started it looked
like some overcooked mashed
potatoes and I'm not liking,

599
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,410
I'm not liking it one bit. Um, all
right, let's, let's do some reads here.

600
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,050
Let's do some reads. Oh, you know what,

601
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:34,960
I didn't talk about any of the
other playoff series. Did I?

602
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,010
I think you of the other NHL once the,
uh,

603
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,020
the filthy flyers it down to Oh to the
Washington capitals and uh, they are,

604
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,890
they are the perennial favorites to
the, uh, the eastern conference. Uh,

605
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,023
c real quick.

606
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,770
Tampa Bay lightning leads Detroit
to one Detroit one the last one.

607
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,580
They fucking red backs up against
the ropes. Big victory there.

608
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,340
Islanders over Florida,
two games to one.

609
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:03,810
Nashville's up two games to none of a
fucking Anaheim. Oh, this sucks. Bad.

610
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,120
Fucking the kings and the ducks
are going to get knocked out.

611
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:08,850
No playoff hockey for oh
fucking freckles out here.

612
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,690
Dallas is up two games to none.
Um,

613
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,370
I'm completely in the dark with all of
this bullshit cause I'm going to be in a

614
00:35:17,371 --> 00:35:20,160
writer's room. I'm in, in the
writer's room for the next olds,

615
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,120
18 weeks total to write the uh, the
second season. And uh, believe it or not,

616
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,370
I'm actually finding that I
love being in the writer's room.

617
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,170
I thought it was something that I was
not going to enjoy because of the freedom

618
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,340
that it has as a comedian,

619
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:35,190
but it turns out I really like writing
scripts and I like writing dialogue and

620
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:37,180
all of that Shit and uh,

621
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,420
we're having a great time and I think
you guys hopefully are going to enjoy it.

622
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:43,220
So now your next question should be built.
How many episodes did they give you?

623
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:47,860
A 10 10 episodes for season two.

624
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,530
And when is it going to be at?
When is it going to come out?

625
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:55,450
Probably this time next year. It's
animation. That's how long it takes.

626
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,910
Um, I think they're saying may of next
year is when it comes out, unfortunately.

627
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,100
But uh, that's how it works. But
it's going to be worth the wait.

628
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,550
But I hope that now that we're kind
of going, that once we do this,

629
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:09,730
when we can immediately go into season
three, I don't know how it fucking works.

630
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,770
I guess that wouldn't make sense.

631
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:13,480
They got to see how many
people watch season two.

632
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,763
I Dunno.

633
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,440
I think by the time we finished
season five, I'll be 60.
That's what I'm guessing.

634
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:24,450
All right, let's do some questions
here for the week. Uh, come to Prague,

635
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,880
come to Prague. Um, I'd like to go cry.
Hey Billy wing nut. Just so you know,

636
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:32,400
we started using your
songs at circle time.

637
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,390
Circle time is every morning
at nine 15 after yoga.

638
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,750
Is it his songs and words
and learning English.

639
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,640
All the kids singing our check
kids please come to Prague.

640
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,730
The fuck is circle time
sounds oddly filthy.

641
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,470
Uh,
circle time.

642
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,743
Prague,

643
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,500
Prague, link, linguistics circle homepage,

644
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,230
the fuck. And I didn't know what
that means. I can't tell you this.

645
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:14,670
So I've stuck with the French have 51
fucking days and now it's starting to just

646
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,380
be in my head. I still can't speak it.
Well, if somebody is speaking it, I,

647
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,930
I pick out a few words, but like reading
it, I'm crushing it. Reading, I read,

648
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,470
I transcribed this whole fucking article
about the pope saying that, you know,

649
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,800
as much as the Catholic church
has been against condoms,

650
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,560
there are certain instances,
you know, that they don't
think it's bad to use them.

651
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,080
Um, you know, especially preventing, um,

652
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,210
the spread of HIV, aids,
whatever, you know, and they
said something about, you know,

653
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:50,750
unprotected sex with male prostitutes.
I think that that's what it said.

654
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,510
I couldn't tell if it was that
or men going to prostitutes.

655
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,940
I couldn't quite get the translation.
So, uh, I'm sticking with it. And, um,

656
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,780
cause on dual lingo to a fee,
if you do a hundred days in a row,

657
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,690
they give you a couple of trinkets,
whatever the fuck that means. So I'm,

658
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,230
I'm over the hump of Brian
Downhill now. And, um,

659
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,890
I dunno,
I just think I'm really doing it.

660
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,710
Not only did I want to learn how to do it,
but I just think it's funny.

661
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:20,711
If someone is dumb as me
becomes completely fluent in
French and then that gives

662
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:25,670
me the opportunity to go to France or
go to Montreal and act like the dumb

663
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:29,090
American and then listen to what they're
saying about me and then just fucking

664
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:32,660
hit him over the head with some fucking,
I can't say perfect French,

665
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:36,140
but like fluent French
just watched their fucking,

666
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:39,170
the little fucking pocket squares
get all fucking in a bunch.

667
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,130
That's why I'm doing it. I'm
doing it. I was going to take,

668
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:44,240
I don't know how long
it's going to take me,

669
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,500
just I want to have that moment just
once in my life or I could just sit there

670
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,680
and have somebody trashing
me in a different language
and they don't know that I

671
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:52,430
can hear everything.

672
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,100
I understand everything that they're
saying just so I can look at him and then

673
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:57,680
fucking come back and I'm like, dude,
DVD. But did they basically saying like,

674
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,370
I know exactly what the fuck did you
said? Right. I'm all right. Sorry.

675
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,540
Most people want to learn it so they
can communicate. Not me, not me.

676
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,090
I want to do it so I can have an
argument on the other side of the world.

677
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,300
What does that say about me?
All right. A cooking question.

678
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,210
Do your Billy the butter basting bitch.

679
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,720
Ah,
that was

680
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,040
a good, oh, say there you go.
There you go. Something original.

681
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,730
I liked that. Made fun of my cooking.
You kept the alliteration going.

682
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,470
You called me a bitch in
the it. I give that one four
stars. Four stars. All right.

683
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,900
Uh, anyways, uh, I am a huge
fan and I blah, blah, blah,
Blah Blah and Yada, Yada, Yada.

684
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:40,930
My question is, thank you for blowing
through all that. My question is,

685
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,540
you used to talk about
cooking all of the time,

686
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,070
but now you're rarely do what gives.
Did you stop cooking? Uh, if not,

687
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,860
what have you made lately?
Please make more cooking videos.

688
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:55,420
Like the pie crust one you made. I need
something new to choke off too. Thanks.

689
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:59,740
And Go fuck yourself. Um, yeah,
I haven't been cooking. I've, um,

690
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,670
when I,
uh,

691
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,270
when we write these episodes for Apis
for family, I'm so fucking relieved.

692
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,950
I can finally talk about this shit. Um,
it consumes my life. I mean, I basically,

693
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:16,240
I go in at 10 30 every morning. There's
usually some other bullshit I have to do.

694
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:20,770
So I'm usually there by 10 in the morning
and then we fucking write all day till

695
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:25,030
about seven. And by the end
of it, I just come home.

696
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,230
I Pour Scotch, I stare at
the wall, I fall asleep,

697
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,430
my dog wakes me up at seven.
I take her for a walk,

698
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,500
I come home,
I have breakfast,

699
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,500
I try to bang out a podcast and
maybe do a little bit of French,

700
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:43,030
and then I go right back to
work. So I don't have time
to fucking do anything. Um,

701
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,200
you know, I should do, I should start
using blue apron. You know, Michelle,

702
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:53,050
Mark Marin, he actually
cooked a meal on it. It looked
fucking delicious. Um, but I,

703
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,340
uh, I should really start doing
something like that because I have,

704
00:40:56,341 --> 00:41:00,520
I been eating like a sort of in
a good way and sort of bad way.

705
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,520
I had the best mother fucking Burger
I've ever had in Los Angeles and that is

706
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:10,300
saying something and if you'd like to
know where to go the next time you see me

707
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,630
when you're in Los Angeles, if you ask
me, I will tell you where the places,

708
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,250
but I'm not saying it on a podcast because
I hate when Anthony Bordain does that

709
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:22,450
and this is cool fucking spot. And
then he makes it, he makes it fucking,

710
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,580
you know,
every Tom,

711
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:27,550
Dick and Harry's got to go out there
and then it comes under new management.

712
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,890
The whole thing gets fucked up.
So,

713
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,530
or even if I'm out on the
road from on the road,

714
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:37,550
just yell it out during my shelf. You,
Hey, Barb is flawed. You are now like,

715
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:38,780
you know, you bought a
ticket, I'll tell you.

716
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:43,250
Then he listened to this podcast for free.
You don't get the information.

717
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,940
Oh, is it delicious? The fries
were okay. The soda was, you know,

718
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
they had the Mexican fucking coke and
the fan to orange with the real sugar and

719
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,240
credible, credible tasting that's
west where this country is right now,

720
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,410
Coca Cola is made better in Mexico
than it is in the United States.

721
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:02,900
What does that say about us?
You know, and as Donald Trump,

722
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:07,250
Hillary Clinton or fucking Bernie Sanders
even approach that at any point during

723
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:11,390
the this, this campaign they might
have. Lord knows I'm not watching.

724
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,650
All right?
So I'm no where I last left.

725
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,130
I was trying to learn how to make
Gnocchi and I failed miserably.

726
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:23,120
And my own wife, the woman who's
supposed to love me unconditionally,

727
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,840
sickness and health and good times
and in bad. And when I made Gnocchi,

728
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,860
it was a bad time. And what did
she do? Did she stick by me?

729
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,240
Did she say it's okay and rub my
head? Nope. You know what she said?

730
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,360
She leaned over and she goes,
hey. And I was like, what?

731
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,780
She got right mayor and she goes,
you should make pasta anymore.

732
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,120
She said, you shouldn't make
pasta anymore. You know,

733
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,040
maybe she knows me well enough to know
that when somebody says something like

734
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,600
that to me, that just
makes me go, all right,

735
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:57,590
I'm going to fucking master this shit.
You know? I mean, it's not like, you know,

736
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,490
somebody says you shouldn't sing anymore.
Well, you should dance anymore. I mean,

737
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,390
I understand that. I mean, I fucking,
there's just certain things, but I mean,

738
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,070
cooking, it's just one of those things.
So you just do it. You'll learn.

739
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:13,220
He can learn how to do it. Like all
these fucking people on the food network,

740
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:16,310
they don't have any, they don't have any
talent. It's just, they just, you know,

741
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,680
they didn't have any friends
and they just fucking, you know,

742
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:23,600
they started off making cereal and then
they just kept progressing. I'm kidding.

743
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,940
I know it's an art form,
right? To fucking relax. Okay.

744
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,560
Put your apron back on and go fucking
make a souffle. All right. So, um, yeah,

745
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:34,010
so I'm kind of stuck on that. But the next
time I go to New York, I met somebody,

746
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,670
um, and met somebody. It's very special.

747
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,930
I met somebody in New York,
uh,

748
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,260
a chef at this Italian restaurant.
He told me, he's like the real deal,

749
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:48,050
like right off the boats and anytime
you come to New York he goes,

750
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:50,510
I'll show you how to make pasta
from scratch, blah blah blah blah,

751
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:54,650
because I took a pasta
making class and uh, uh,

752
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,590
they were supposed to then email a bunch
of shit to help you out and they never

753
00:43:57,591 --> 00:44:00,830
had any follow through. And then I waited
too long to try it again. And I finally,

754
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,580
I kind of forgot some
of the tricks. So, um,

755
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,640
that's where I met with the cooking thing.
And,

756
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,770
and as far as making
like the cooking videos,

757
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,440
I did the pie crusting cause
that was another thing. I
just thought it was funny.

758
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,300
Someone like me knows how
to do something like that,

759
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:16,760
but like I can't cook better than
most of the people out there,

760
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,700
so I don't understand the
point of it. Um, maybe if I,

761
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,640
if I learn how to make Gnocchi,
I'll teach you guys how to do it,

762
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,990
but I'll have to do it for a long time
before I feel like confident enough to

763
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:29,990
make a video. Maybe if I fuck it up,
it'll be funny. I have no idea. All right,

764
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,480
let's, let's keep reading here,
shall we? Okay. All right. Garden.

765
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,920
Do we topsoil,

766
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,440
one of my favorite things you use to
talk about was your garden and your steps

767
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,790
towards getting off the grid.

768
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,600
My question is do you still have a garden
and are you still taking steps to get

769
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,810
off yourself off the grid?
Um,

770
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,690
I mean I have a lemon and a lime
tree so I'll never get scurvy.

771
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,553
MMM,

772
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,970
no,
I just,

773
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,840
the level of like commitment that that
takes and you have to have like a fucking

774
00:45:04,841 --> 00:45:07,450
hen house and shit. You know, I don't,

775
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:11,140
I don't have time to become Mr. Green
jeans and then what do I have to have a

776
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,360
hen house guy?
I have to have the chicken guy.

777
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:14,780
Okay.

778
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,530
You know what I mean?
It's like as you accumulate shit,

779
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,720
then you have to get the something guy,
right.

780
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,280
Okay.

781
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,730
Yeah. You buy a fucking house. She
immediately, you'd have a plumber,

782
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,540
you got to have a fucking electrician,
you know, you've got to have a,

783
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,880
basically a handyman. Okay. Then what?

784
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:35,020
Then you have a garden and you got to
have a fucking landscape or gardening guy

785
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,930
because you're too busy doing whatever
you do for a fucking crook, a living.

786
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,160
You get a pool, you need the pool
guy, you know, you get a dog,

787
00:45:43,161 --> 00:45:46,160
you got the fucking dog guy,
the vet guy, all of that shit.

788
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:49,070
It's just more money flying out
of your fucking wallet. And, um,

789
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,200
I am very envious of people that have
their own gardens and that type of shit.

790
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:58,710
But, uh, I, you know, I have
my little piece of fucking

791
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:04,340
La out here, which is not much.
We all live on top of each.

792
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:07,430
I'm literally looking out my window right
now and I see the roof of the person's

793
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:12,080
house next to me and that's just
basically how it works, you know?

794
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,190
And I look out the back,

795
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,950
I look out my back window and
I see the apartment buildings,

796
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:18,320
the back of the apartment
buildings from the street over.

797
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,760
It's really not a place to plant some
turnips, although I wish there was.

798
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,910
And I don't think that could really get
away with like having fucking chickens

799
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:29,400
and shit. Some rooster crowing
every morning cause uh,

800
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:33,290
the noise ordinance is noise is not
supposed to leave your property.

801
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,930
Although most people the second
they turn on their stereo,

802
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,470
they break that fucking thing.
But um, I would love to do it.

803
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:44,120
I'd love to get solar panels and be
off the grid, but she really can't be,

804
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:47,180
still have to give them a
little bit of money. I forget.

805
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:49,650
I don't know how it works, but they
have some, so I know how it works.

806
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:52,760
The president makes 400 grand a year,
so he, they go, yeah listen, fuck,

807
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:56,840
oh he want the second term, make this
a law. We should make it a lot. Right.

808
00:46:56,841 --> 00:46:57,351
Next thing you know,

809
00:46:57,351 --> 00:47:00,050
it's a lot cause there's people
live in the middle of nowhere.

810
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,910
The electric company finds
him and then they like,

811
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:05,990
they show him and like you have to
give us money every month, which is,

812
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,900
I just don't understand how that is legal
that goes around so many things that

813
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:15,440
this country is allegedly about.
Someone would force you.

814
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,460
I understand taxes. So like,
yeah dude, you want to live here?

815
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,230
You've got to kick in for the puddles.
I get that.

816
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:25,130
But you have to buy power from
this fucking noise. Don't fuck off.

817
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,790
But that's not how it works. It's not how
it works. If you guys know how to do it,

818
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:30,130
if you how to get off the grid,

819
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,160
by all mean not because I
want to be off the grid. No,

820
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:36,220
cause I give a fuck that I give
money to the power companies. I just,

821
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,750
you know when the shit hits the fan,

822
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,440
I would like to be that beacon of light
that all the zombies run too. Right?

823
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,180
He's still got a flat screen.
Um, alright. Girlfriends. Wait.

824
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,580
Oh Jesus. Here we go. Dear Bill,

825
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,890
I'm a 21 year old guy and my
girlfriend is 20 we've been taped.

826
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,920
We've been talking for about six months
now and we just recently decided to make

827
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:04,570
it official. Now here's the part where
I need your expert advice. Oh Jesus.

828
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:08,080
How should I go about telling her?
I think she needs to lose weight.

829
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:12,460
She's not a fat ass by no means, but
she could lose a few pounds. Now.

830
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:15,790
I sound now I sound like an ass.
I know. I sound like an Asshole,

831
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:16,900
I think is what he's supposed to say.

832
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,160
Okay.

833
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,420
Yeah,
I know I sound like an asshole,

834
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:24,100
but I care about her and want to see her
be more confident. Thanks for the help.

835
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,800
I enjoyed the show in Long Beach.
Um,

836
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:30,530
okay.

837
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,340
How do you say she could lose
it there? There is no way. Uh,

838
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:36,550
what I would do is I would
get yourself in great shape.

839
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,700
Okay.

840
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,910
And start getting her into hiking
with you and like, uh, you know,

841
00:48:40,911 --> 00:48:44,570
but you can't make somebody work out.
You can't make somebody get in shape.

842
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:48,470
They either want to do it or they don't.
And um,

843
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,870
you know, that's like a
major, major, major fucking

844
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:54,610
okay.

845
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,260
You know, you tell telling
a woman she needs to lose a
few pounds, just like that.

846
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:01,990
That's, that's the female equivalent
of them saying to you like, you know,

847
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:02,980
your Dick could be a little bit

848
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,853
beggar.

849
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,020
It's devastating.
Um,

850
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:10,370
yeah,

851
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,330
I wouldn't say it to her, but uh, you
know, you also got to think, you know,

852
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:15,800
at 20 if they could lose,

853
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,540
if they're already getting out of
shape at 20 years of age, you know,

854
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:21,900
okay,

855
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,870
then what? Then they have a couple of
kids that going to be a fucking house.

856
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:26,130
I mean,
that's just something you get,

857
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:30,150
you gotta be honest about if someone
doesn't take care of themselves,

858
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,150
you know,
and this works both ways too late ladies.

859
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:35,940
Like if you're with some guy and he's in
his twenties and he's sitting there and

860
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:38,910
he's already getting Mantech,
it's, it's not going to get better.

861
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,070
And you got to sit there in,
in and really just be like,

862
00:49:44,071 --> 00:49:46,230
how much do I love this person?

863
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:49,140
Because I'm going to watch them
slowly eat themselves to death.

864
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,580
Cause that's what you're
doing. And unfortunately, um,

865
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,300
you chicken start coming home
to roost in your forties,

866
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,810
whatever the fuck you did,

867
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:02,760
whenever you will start to go off the
rails at 16 or 17 with drinking, drugging,

868
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:03,750
eating or whatever,

869
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:08,610
right around when you get to your
forties is when the first like,

870
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,220
like God damn that happened to him.
I thought that was some old man shit.

871
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:13,911
And you're like,
oh wait,

872
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:17,180
we're in our forties because you'll
still feel like you're in your 20 self.

873
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,213
MMM.

874
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,840
I Dunno. I would go a positive route. I
would just tell her how I would tell her,

875
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,620
uh, oh, we tell her how good she looked
at me. That's just fucking, I don't,

876
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,570
there's no way to do it that that is,
there's no,

877
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,190
that's a fortress in, there's no
door in. You know what I mean?

878
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,760
There's no door in on that one. You just
have to just, if you're going to say it,

879
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:42,050
if he just fucking say it,

880
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,060
then you're really risking
hurting her really bad.

881
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,870
You know what I mean? Um, any
who wants to do you don't,

882
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,420
you don't want to fucking do that.
You know?

883
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,820
I wonder if women ever
feel that way about guys.

884
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,830
Like if there's anything like
this, like, you know what?

885
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:01,130
You just can't say that to a guy
because that will hurt them too much.

886
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,880
Do they ever think shit like that?
I think shit like that with women.

887
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:08,640
There's just certain things you just,
you just don't fucking say like,

888
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,040
what does it all I'm going to do is hurt
her in ruiner for the next person when

889
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:17,000
she fucking eventually comes
to her senses and dumps me. Um,

890
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,150
and then you'll be that, you know
what this guy said to me one time,

891
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,050
yeah,

892
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,370
we were going into a weapon

893
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:31,600
and I ordered a double cheeseburger.
Any interrupted? He said, no, no, no.

894
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,150
She wants to single,

895
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,980
you know,
being that guy.

896
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,080
Um, no, I don't know. I don't know what
to tell you. I can't tell you this though.

897
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:46,030
I feel like when you are,
you know,

898
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,780
aside from just all wanting it to
yourself to try to stay in shape,

899
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:50,160
when you were in a
relationship with someone,

900
00:51:50,161 --> 00:51:54,240
did just fucking let yourself
go and just become a fat fuck.

901
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,200
And you know,

902
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,820
do you just not have the consideration
that somebody is sort of obligated to

903
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:04,290
have sex with you to just try and remotely
keep yourself looking halfway decent?

904
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,770
It's really a selfish fucking thing,
you know?

905
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,500
But we live in the age of,
um,

906
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,330
a lot of times the victim is,
is the,

907
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,970
is not as is considered
like the antagonizer. Yeah.

908
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,143
You know what I mean?

909
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,570
I would never do that to me.

910
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:25,150
I wouldn't ever just fucking
put on a hundred fucking pounds,

911
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,340
just come waddling into the
fucking bedroom, you know,

912
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:34,390
rollover on top of her since she
would be completely grossed out.

913
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:39,391
And every woman listening to this probably
just went picture that me a hundred

914
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,890
pounds heavier, naked,
sweating on my upper lip.

915
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:49,560
Crawling into fucking bed. Yeah, exactly.
Isn't that disgusting? Well, that,

916
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,110
that's a two way street sweetheart.
You know,

917
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:56,050
we don't want to see you come fucking
waddling in under the room. You know,

918
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:59,290
your hips taken out the fucking door
jam. You know what I mean? It's just,

919
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:03,220
it's not a, it's not
fair to you, the person,

920
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:05,411
you know,

921
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:08,170
when you really look at it and nobody
understands that more than gay guys.

922
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,980
I would say that gay guys have the most
respect for the fact that someone's

923
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,700
going to hook up with them.
You know what I mean?

924
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,780
I wonder if that pound for pound in the
best fucking shape than anybody else or

925
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:26,820
is it because they're trying to
attract guys and they know guys are,

926
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:30,030
I can't even say that shallow cause they
always say that guy's a shallow when it

927
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:33,120
comes to that. We are, but like you
fucking hold up something shiny.

928
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:36,330
A woman's like, I didn't want that.
You know, they're just as bad. Right.

929
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,450
Oh Christ. I'm all over the map. All
right. On trial for a joke. All right,

930
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:43,140
Bill,

931
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,730
did you hear about the entertainer who
might get prosecuted for his poem that

932
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:51,760
trashed ahead of State?
Oh, what country? Uh,

933
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,920
they're calling him a comic, but I
think maybe Europe's version of a comic,

934
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:00,420
not the traditional standup ball. Depends
on where you go in Europe. Europe is a,

935
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:04,660
uh, you know, it's not the
biggest continent, but that's all.

936
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,920
It's a long fucking trip
from Paris over to Moscow.

937
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,930
I think Moscow was technically
still in Europe, isn't,

938
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:14,190
I know the west coast of Russia is now,

939
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,990
he sucked getting into the eastern
Europe and you know, I mean they,

940
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:18,240
they still had vampires out there.

941
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,020
So you can only imagine how that would
affect the artist standup comedy.

942
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,700
I don't know what I'm talking about.
All right.

943
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:28,820
And Angela Merkel gave the go ahead to
the Turkish prime minister to make an

944
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:31,194
inquiry,

945
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,640
which basically means put on trial
all because of a stupid poem.

946
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,370
Thoughts. I hate when people
do that. Thoughts. Hmm.

947
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,740
Talk about that. Um, yeah,

948
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:47,220
it lists a bunch of countries that are
just getting their first taste of standup

949
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:51,660
comic. It's comedy and they are going
through their Lenny Bruce years.

950
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:56,730
Um, which is what happens that happened.
Lenny Bruce, he was put on trial,

951
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:59,640
he was arrested for obscenity
and all of that type of stuff.

952
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,170
This is what happens.

953
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:06,710
And once the government realizes that
it's just jokes and that a standup comic

954
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:13,800
doing an hour on jokes is not going to
cause a revolution and that they can

955
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:18,801
relax and continue to fuck over their
own countrymen and sleep well at night

956
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:22,740
doing it, then they usually
ease up on it. And, uh,

957
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:27,180
people are allowed to, you
know, do stand up comedy.

958
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:32,070
Like what's funny now is what's happening
is there's this new, you know, sort of,

959
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,640
I dunno what you would call it,
Lenny Bruce time,

960
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:38,430
but it's just more through
people in the crowd. Dope.

961
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:41,220
But it's not the government anymore,
so it's really no big deal. It's just,

962
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:46,020
you know, people with agendas and
websites and shit like that, you know,

963
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,680
clickbait, clickbait
people. Right. All right.

964
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:54,270
Boyfriend wants to have
sex with other girls. Um,

965
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:58,170
I wonder if there's a way to basically
support that person. Angela Merkel,

966
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:02,820
can I help pay for the lawyer kick in,
you know, all the comics around the world.

967
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:06,120
Take fucking throw 20 bucks at it and uh,

968
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:10,230
they could tie it up in the
Turkish courts. Can that
happen? I don't fucking know.

969
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,520
Oh, you know what, I'm
going to look that up.

970
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:13,320
I'm glad you brought that to my attention.

971
00:56:13,321 --> 00:56:15,420
I know that there was some
somebody in in Canada,

972
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:18,210
the same thing happen and it's one of
those things where it's like you want to

973
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:18,811
talk about it,

974
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:23,330
but you also don't want to feed
that fucking beast and give all,

975
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:26,220
all types of a notoriety.
But then you're also going,

976
00:56:26,221 --> 00:56:28,170
well that's a fellow comic
going through that Shit.

977
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,380
There's gotta be a way in a stealth
way to hopefully put that fire up.

978
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,260
Um, you know, when I was in India, the
podcast I did, the guys over there,

979
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:39,120
they were going through some
shit because they had a row,

980
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,430
they did a roast and everything was fine.

981
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:44,670
Everybody laughed and then they
put it up on youtube and you know,

982
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:48,170
there's like 40 million
different religions there
and somebody complained and

983
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:50,563
you know,

984
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,840
they were in a, definitely a, a, what's
the word I should use? They were in a,

985
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,640
they weren't a situation over there
when I, you know, which is hilarious.

986
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,110
Then a pluck of walking down
the street with them. Yeah.

987
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,733
Yeah.

988
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,990
Like, how am I going to get fucking
arrested because I'm with you guys.

989
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:12,020
You know what's fucked up? I only spent
24 hours in India and I already miss it.

990
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:13,040
I really want to go back.

991
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:16,700
I had such a good time in the 24 hours
despite the fact I had to get a piece of

992
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:19,320
paper to leave, which was
really fucking creepy. But um,

993
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:21,210
okay.

994
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,070
And that was weird and I,
I didn't,

995
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,620
I didn't know what I was thought I
was going to think when I went there,

996
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:29,490
but I felt an odd connection
when I went there. Um,

997
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,960
which is one of the coolest things
when you travel. Like when you,

998
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:34,110
you go every place you go to,

999
00:57:34,111 --> 00:57:35,640
it's going to be great when
you actually go to a place.

1000
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:40,070
Like why is this fucking place
feeling like, uh, like feeling like,

1001
00:57:40,071 --> 00:57:40,920
oh like a home.

1002
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:45,300
Like I relate to these people more so
than a lot of countries I've been to.

1003
00:57:45,301 --> 00:57:46,380
I was over there going like,
God,

1004
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:49,290
that guy reminds me of rich foss maybe
cause I hung out with a bunch of comics.

1005
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:53,670
I had no idea. Anyways, boyfriend
wants to have sex with other girls.

1006
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,020
Hi Bill. Hi Bill. Um,

1007
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,150
my boyfriend and I had been
together for over two years.

1008
00:58:00,151 --> 00:58:03,390
Recently we had broken up for
a little less than a month,

1009
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,650
but we started talking again.

1010
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:08,160
We broke up because of though he
loves me and wants to be with me.

1011
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:14,580
[inaudible] he still wants
to have sex with other girls.

1012
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,450
Our sex life isn't a problem
because we fuck on a daily basis.

1013
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,680
Most of the twice a day she
was supposed to write time.

1014
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,780
She was supposed to write time
most of the time, twice a day.

1015
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:27,840
And he always says on the best
people ever slash we'll have,

1016
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:32,220
he also believes that there is a very
slim possibility that there might be

1017
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:36,150
something better for him and then he
wants to experience other people before

1018
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:39,780
possibly spending the rest of his
life with me. He's 25 years old,

1019
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,040
so he is pretty scared about staying
with one person for the rest of his life.

1020
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,160
We are both not ready for marriage
or that type of relationship,

1021
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:51,150
but I feel that ending a two and a half
year relationship over his urges isn't

1022
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:54,840
the right thing. Especially since he
still loves me and wants to be with me.

1023
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,340
He's pretty unhappy,

1024
00:58:56,341 --> 00:59:00,720
but he knows that being with other people
won't help because he will feel the

1025
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:04,870
exact same way as he does.
Now. He tells me that they,

1026
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:08,070
I am amazing and beautiful and he
wants to have a perfect relationship,

1027
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,730
so I don't understand why he wants to
leave that for something that is most

1028
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:13,590
likely going to be shittier.

1029
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,910
I can't go through another breakup
with him because it was horrible. Uh,

1030
00:59:17,911 --> 00:59:21,930
while we were broken up, he did have sex
with one girl and talk multiple girls,

1031
00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:25,950
but he didn't feel any better and he was
still unhappy without me, please help.

1032
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,870
I don't know what to do and maybe this
can help them as well. Thanks a bunch.

1033
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:34,140
Ah, well first of all, I'm not a fucking
relationship expert, but a, first of all,

1034
00:59:34,141 --> 00:59:36,120
I've got to give him Kudos
for just being honest,

1035
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:41,300
saying that this is what I want to do.
Um,

1036
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,890
well I'll talk to you cause he, you, he
didn't write it. So I would just say that,

1037
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:47,783
um,

1038
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:53,580
unfortunately this is
where he is at 25 and um,

1039
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:54,480
you are not.

1040
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:59,400
So if he wants to fucking go out and
do whatever the fuck he wants to do,

1041
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,150
you know, let them and then I think
you should get on with your life.

1042
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:07,560
But I don't think it's healthy
for you to have him keep,

1043
01:00:07,561 --> 01:00:11,460
keep calling you during this time when
he's out there fucking other people but

1044
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:13,170
still fucking with your emotions.

1045
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:18,830
So I think you let them go and let them
go do whatever the fuck he wants to do

1046
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:22,560
and, but there's, you don't
have any contact with them. Um,

1047
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,030
that might be a guy thing where you,
you need some sort of closure,

1048
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:29,970
Assam Shit and gradually talk and then
talk less and less and less. I don't know.

1049
01:00:29,971 --> 01:00:34,230
I'm a fucking psycho when it comes to
that shit. So that's what I would do.

1050
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,050
Um,
I would say at this point,

1051
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:39,750
what he's doing is he's trying
to do what's right for him.

1052
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:43,440
So you have to do what's right for you.
Um,

1053
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,410
he's putting himself
first and his wants first,

1054
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:51,340
so you should do the same
thing and there's nothing
wrong with what he's doing.

1055
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,090
Um,

1056
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:55,120
he could have fucking lied and said that
he didn't have urges and then gone and

1057
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:59,800
fucked around and you know,
I don't,

1058
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:03,310
no matter what, he was going to end up
hurting yet, but he did it. He did it.

1059
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,770
He did it the right way.
He told you he broke up with you and um,

1060
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:10,830
okay.

1061
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,480
Yeah,
he's got to go figure some shit out.

1062
01:01:12,481 --> 01:01:15,930
But I don't think he needs to be calling
you up and talking to you after a month

1063
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,380
and getting your heart going
again and giving you hope.

1064
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,900
But I don't know where they want
to do, but I do love you. But

1065
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,110
yeah, go fuck yourself with your
wishy washy shit. All right. You know.

1066
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,100
Okay.

1067
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,210
You're beautiful. You're young. You got
your whole life ahead of Ya. You know,

1068
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:39,870
fuck them. Just fucking, I dunno.

1069
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:44,790
Why don't you have a little you time
over the next two to three months,

1070
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:47,670
see where you're at. Make a little list,
figuring out what you want out of life.

1071
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,090
You know, who knows, who
knows? Maybe he'll come back
to you and be like, you know,

1072
01:01:51,091 --> 01:01:53,760
and it sucked and you want to take
them back. Maybe you won't, but a,

1073
01:01:53,761 --> 01:01:56,910
I think you need to focus on
yourself and not him. That's a,

1074
01:01:56,911 --> 01:02:00,540
that's what I would do. Um, cause
you didn't pull the trigger. He did.

1075
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:03,420
So there's no guilt on your end,
but um,

1076
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,560
it's a shitty thing to do to do that to
somebody and then come back like a month

1077
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,310
later and can drag you through
that hell all over again,

1078
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:15,120
but then not get back with you and make
some sort of a commitment to just go

1079
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:15,990
back and be like,

1080
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:20,480
Ooh, you know, hooked up with
one person. I still miss you.

1081
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,720
You know, cause then you're going to
be like, yeah. So what does that mean?

1082
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:26,240
Does that mean he loves me? And you got
to sit there playing that mental tennis,

1083
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:30,860
fuck all that. Fuck all that. Yeah.
Right. They're wishy washy. We'll see ya.

1084
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:36,570
Just tell him what you need. You need,
yeah, 100% commitment. That's it.

1085
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,690
You're either in it or you're out of it.
I respect you.

1086
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:41,910
The fact that you're honest,
but you know,

1087
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:46,440
I know I don't need you fucking hemming
and hawing every fucking four weeks

1088
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:50,370
dragging me back down to that emotional
pit. I'm done. Get on with your life.

1089
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,050
That's what I would do, you
know, as fucking jackass.

1090
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:56,520
And then the second you're
getting on with your life,

1091
01:02:56,521 --> 01:03:00,150
he won't want to lose you and then he'll
come back and just so we won't lose one

1092
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,240
of those fucking guys.
That's what I'm thinking. Um,

1093
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:04,580
okay.

1094
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,010
Yeah, I would, I would get on with
your life. That's what I would do.

1095
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,470
I hope that's good advice.
I had no idea. All right,

1096
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:11,640
that's the podcast for this week.

1097
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:14,340
Thank you guys for listening and thank
you to everybody from the bottom of my

1098
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:18,090
hat who watched the first
season of f is for family. Uh,

1099
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,260
we're really going to try to outdo what
we did in the first season and, uh,

1100
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,300
try and make them as funny as possible.
All right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves.

1101
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,720
And I'll check an audio on Thursday.
See Him.
