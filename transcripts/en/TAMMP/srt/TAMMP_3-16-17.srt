00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,880

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,360
I don't it fucking works. But um, yeah,

6
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm just here to check in on you
just fully the fucking half an hour.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,110
I hope you guys enjoyed the very special
edition to the Monday morning podcast

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:36,040
that was put out yesterday
with, uh, the great,

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,260
the Great Jim Norton promoting his new
standup special that you can watch now on

10
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:45,730
Netflix. Mouthful of shame. And I've
heard nothing but great things about it.

11
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:50,320
I have yet to see it
because, uh, you know,

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,180
I only got so much fucking time now
with the little kiddo running around who

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,480
just get,
just keeps getting better every day.

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,400
Just keeps getting better every day.

15
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:00,190
I don't know what the fuck people
complain about, about having a kid.

16
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:03,860
It's fucking awesome. Oh,
it good. You're good to go.

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,340
As opposed to watch sitting
alone in your apartment.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,770
All of free time in the fucking world.
Slowly drinking yourself to death.

19
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,400
Cause I'll tell you,
I've been up both sides of the fence,

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,780
like in this side a little better.
Not saying every once in a while,

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,250
every once in a while I don't have visit.

22
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:29,251
My old friends did my fucking 83
76 years level bar that I have.

23
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,111
I always throw it.

24
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:35,740
I always give a shout out to the 83 76
and because everybody talks about the 96

25
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:39,550
bowls and everybody talks
about the 27 Yankees.

26
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:43,010
What about the 1983 Philadelphia?
76 years.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,510
I would love to throw
the 86 Celtics in there,

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,920
but the fucking Lakers choked against
the Houston Rockets. So I mean,

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,830
sort of a a,

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,340
you know when in the 80s it didn't mean
you didn't really feel like you won a

31
00:01:57,341 --> 00:02:01,860
championship. Lsu beat the Celtics and
the Lakers. That's basically it. That's,

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,950
that's my, you know, no disrespect to Rau.

33
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,100
Fucking Samson.
No fucking disrespect.

34
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,110
Do Chemo Olijahwaun Lucy on the team yet
or are they a fucking treating all tree

35
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,720
rounds was Atlanta.
I don't remember.

36
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,420
They had very similar uniforms
in my memory bank. In fact,

37
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:23,230
I think they had the exact same colors,
just Houston Rockets was less busy.

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,760
More traditional like the Detroit Red
Wings, jersey, simple red and white,

39
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,580
Toronto, blue and white. It's it.
It's over. These are our colors.

40
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,230
Fuck you somebody.

41
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,040
Please explain to me how the Tampa Bay
fucking lightning also can wear blue and

42
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,100
white. I don't understand that. You know,

43
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,250
it's like the Pittsburgh penguins when
they came back white or black and gold.

44
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:46,240
It's like,
what the fuck?

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,890
Barden Nick told me that the original
fucking hockey team in Pittsburgh did wear

46
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:54,880
black and gold, but then yeah, but then
you folded and you left it on the table.

47
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,980
It's like when you don't
renew your fucking website,

48
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,720
somebody else who's going get it. Um,
I don't know what I'm talking about.

49
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,920
All I know is I have to plow through this
next fucking half an hour just to see

50
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,440
how you're doing. Whatever. Maybe I'm
going to catch you on the ride home.

51
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,720
You know, worst case scenario,
you got one fucking day left.

52
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,680
Use a sick day, take a three
day weekend. You know, you know,

53
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,630
I was actually thinking now is
this is the time of year where, uh,

54
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,450
the spring break,
I wonder what kids do nowadays.

55
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:29,950
It's gotta be a way where they can
get out of the view of the constant

56
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,890
surveillance of your parents.
Now,

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,100
you know what I mean?
Jesus Christ.

58
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,990
By the time my daughter
gets to that fucking age,

59
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:42,991
I'll probably be able to have a drone
hovering over her for her the entire

60
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:47,710
fucking existence.
I'll just shout down from the sky,

61
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,510
you know? [inaudible] don't go to
that party. Just freaking around.

62
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,010
She'd be looking up like dad,

63
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,393
oh,

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,220
so sick of my dad hovering over me in a
hoe and a fucking whatever the fuck it's

65
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:04,670
called. That will literally
be helicopter parenting.

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,550
No,
it's fucking drones.

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,550
I went to something recently and I guess
the gift bag was a drone. It's like,

68
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:15,090
why would you give people a six
it's not intrusive enough.

69
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:20,070
All this fucking technology that all these
fucking Weirdos, you know what I mean?

70
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,920
I want to know the first time a drone
is going to seriously give somebody's

71
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:30,480
brain damage because the operator was
trying to jerk off while they were trying

72
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:31,330
to operate it

73
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,010
is they'll hovering over
somebody's fucking house, you know,

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,610
trying to come down here, the bathroom,
this already perverts doing that

75
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,020
perverts fascinate me,
but the fascinating music,

76
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,750
why can't you just walk up and say hello?
They can't do it,

77
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,140
but then they have these needs, right. So
then they got to peek around the corner.

78
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,270
You know, speaking of
Pekin, peaky blinders,

79
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,860
what are my favorite fucking shows? It's
coming over the last five years. Um,

80
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,430
I was on a,
uh,

81
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,660
an airplane flying back from Austin,

82
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,720
from the south by southwest festival.
Uh,

83
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,330
which I can't tell you another time
when you would not want to be in Austin.

84
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,770
You know? I mean, it's great for films
and that type of Shit, but it's just like,

85
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,770
I don't know, man. I don't know
what happened to that city.

86
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,860
I've been going there for the last 20
years. It just gets more and more crowded.

87
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:30,861
It's like a bunch of sweaty
hippies with la level traffic.

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,770
That's what south by southwest is.
And I don't know what it is.

89
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:37,950
Every white person in
Austin during that week,

90
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:41,220
they all look like they play hacky sack.
You know,

91
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,840
I don't know if there's just
something about the, uh,

92
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,200
the disheveled on purpose colleged
age white kid that I know.

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,520
Even when I went to college,
I wasn't like that, you know,

94
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,570
fucking combed my hair when
I still had hair. Right.

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,170
I didn't try to fucking look
like I lived out on the street.

96
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,670
It was like a big guy thing back then
to try to look all fucking disheveled.

97
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:11,090
Like I could barely take care of myself,
but look at my college id.

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,750
Look at my crazy picture. Take
Dude, you did. All of the sudden,

99
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,800
this whole fucking thing is on purpose.
The end of the fucking day.

100
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,580
If your back's against the wall, you
can call your mom and dad. All right,

101
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:26,300
so fucking comb your hair and put it on
a clean shirt. All right. You can't, oh,

102
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:30,620
I'm sorry. What did I say?
All of that. Anyways, I, um,

103
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,961
this was my day.

104
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:37,010
I actually was flying out there at that
day to do the all things comedy podcast

105
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:41,960
and then fly right back.
So I, uh, I'm like,

106
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,471
this is great.

107
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,110
I've always wanted to go to the airport
and just have like nothing and just walk

108
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,570
in, you know, like Leonardo Dicaprio
in catch me if you came every,

109
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,370
just come fucking walking in
wearing this little fucking,

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,340
I know how to fly a plane outfit.
That's what the fuck I wanted to do,

111
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,030
minus that outfit. So I put
on sweatpants, you know,

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,480
and I would have a fucking tee shirt
jacket and I had my change of clothes and

113
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:06,920
toiletries in this backpack and
that was fucking it. All right.

114
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,130
Went in there like a Goddamn drifter and
I get all the way to the airport and I

115
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:17,000
realize I forgot my fucking wallet.
Right.

116
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,940
So I can't get on the fucking plane
cause I don't have any form of

117
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,810
identification. I don't have my
college id man from back in the day.

118
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,270
And, um, what did I have?

119
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,240
Um,
I ended up having to go.

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,800
Yeah,

121
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,960
I didn't know what to do. I was
like, I'm going to miss this fucking,

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,410
and I'm actually thinking now that my dad
actually did grow my hair out a little

123
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,050
bit in college,
but I still dress respectfully.

124
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,190
Maybe I was a hybrid. I can't fucking
remember. It was so fucking long ago.

125
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,010
Anyways,
so I fucking get to the airport.

126
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,520
I don't have my God damn id and I don't
know what the fuck to do and I have to

127
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:54,354
make this,

128
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,980
this podcast cause his advertisers
and all that type of shit.

129
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:00,600
You can't say this is the lineup.

130
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,240
This is the projected amount of
people that are going to listen.

131
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:07,620
It's a business and then not show up
and take the fucking money. So, uh,

132
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,360
I didn't know what to
do. So I ended up, uh,

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,270
the first time ever I flew private
and blue a fucking ton of cash.

134
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,720
So I'm going to be playing a bunch of
casinos coming up to make up for the money

135
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,400
that I,
uh,

136
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,850
that I spent on that I flew out of
Van Nuys like a fucking rock star,

137
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,840
lit up my card, literally glowing in
my pocket. I had to fucking drive home,

138
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,090
get my wallet, fly out, you know,

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,120
drive out there and then sit there and
then talk to these fucking savages.

140
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,240
Just being like, oh, you need
a plane right now. Ah, really?

141
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,090
That'll be 1 million bucks.
And I'm like,

142
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,230
fuck you wind up calling somebody else.
And they're like,

143
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,300
it'll be a half a million.
I'm like, fuck you.

144
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,990
And all you do is you just keep calling
people and after awhile you just start

145
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,820
numbers and um,
I got it.

146
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,700
I got a way the fuck down for
whatever they first quoted me.

147
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,090
I have that got it down to half that,

148
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:08,450
but it's still cost to
Fuckin zillion bucks. So a,

149
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,460
I get on the plane talking to the
pilots to like right fucking there was a

150
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,680
smaller plane, like when I
went to take a Piss, I'm like,

151
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,540
do you guys have a bathroom here?
They're like, yeah, they do.

152
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,170
And they had to move to snacks and then
they closed it a little door and I'm

153
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:24,630
taking a piss right on the
other side of the fucking door.

154
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,870
And like you can't stand up in the plane.
So I am Standup,

155
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,140
but I'm acting like I have osteoporosis
and I'm trying to take a fucking piss.

156
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,240
And this does an angle you have to be
at so you don't piss on your own fucking

157
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:39,841
sweatpants.

158
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:43,530
But eventually the velocity of the urine
coming out of your Dick is going to

159
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,870
slow down and it's going to
come towards your clothes.

160
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,990
So then he got to make a decision. What
am I going? How am I going to do this?

161
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,370
How far down am I going to pull my pants?
What the fuck's going on?

162
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,940
Like that weird kid. Remember that weird
kid when you were in elementary school,

163
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,750
you went in to take a piss and the kid
had his pants all the way down around his

164
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,590
ankles. It's like, why didn't
you just fucking unzip you fly,

165
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,060
you know what's going on here?

166
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,470
And then the whole time I'm just
thinking like, how is this better?

167
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,160
They'd fly in on a commercial airline.
I don't get it. You know, if you,

168
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:20,490
you're flying business of first,
if you bump yourself up, uh, the,

169
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:23,280
I am one and done on that shit.
I just think it's the,

170
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,530
it's a colossal fucking waste of money.

171
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,090
And I have the glowing fucking
credit card right now to prove it.

172
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,750
And um,
there's just no money in it.

173
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,350
The fucking people who rent the
plains of barely making any money,

174
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,780
the pilots don't make any money.
All the pilots,

175
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:44,640
one eventually fly for commercial,
a commercial airline, right? I mean,

176
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:46,980
there's still flying commercial private,
but they want to fly for like, you know,

177
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,630
one of the major airlines
is what I'm trying to say.

178
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,630
So one of the pilots came back and
he's talking to me. He goes, yeah,

179
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,850
we got some beers here. And I'm
like, I'm on the wagon. But I'm like,

180
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,400
well what the fuck? I spent all
this money. I got to have a beer.

181
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:00,790
So I drank a cores light like the
white trash cunt that I am. And um,

182
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,410
he's sitting there talking to me and uh,

183
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,620
I'm all fascinated with the hall,
the aviation aspects of it.

184
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:12,420
And I'm sitting there looking at the guy
and he had a tear in his slacks, right?

185
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:17,130
It, his knee. Like there was a
like a, like a vertical slice.

186
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,700
Like he was in a knife fight and
just so many sliced it a little bit.

187
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,120
And I was just going like,
there's no fucking money in this.

188
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,180
What this guy's doing right now define
the law of gravity getting me from Los

189
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,290
Angeles to Austin. He doesn't
get lost. He knows where to go.

190
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,500
He knows what altitude to fly out.
We had a nice fucking landing

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,540
when my life is literally in this guy's
hand and they don't pay this guy enough

192
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:47,541
money that he can fly this fucking jet
without a pair of pants that have fucking

193
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:52,560
ripped. You know, maybe that's why
all those kids fucking annoyed me.

194
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,910
You notice I didn't fit,
you know when I was in Austin,

195
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,100
cause I'm seeing a guy who
actually really is struggling.

196
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:03,990
It's line of fucking jet and he has
fucking ripped slacks. Who knows?

197
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:07,200
Maybe you just had a rough night. Hey had
a rough one. Maybe you just passed out.

198
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,800
I don't fucking know. Anyways,
um, I remember when I was in,

199
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:16,380
in college and uh, yeah, like I, I d
I was never that fucking rebel guy.

200
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,510
I remember walking by this chick one time
and I just had like mainstream clothes

201
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:23,940
on.
I had like a polo shirt and regular shit.

202
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:27,630
I remember I walked by and she
just goes, Ooh, hot labels.

203
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,763
Okay.

204
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,840
I just want to be like,

205
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,220
you fucking golf con you look like
every other fucking golf caught here.

206
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:40,100
Do you guys all,
I don't know what fucking every black,

207
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,010
everything painted black store.
You fucking walking.

208
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,630
You all have the same fucking makeup.
You all have the same fucking lipstick.

209
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,480
Yeah. It just, you know, cause
there's no golf food court.

210
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,210
You feel like you're out of year out
of the reach of the corporations.

211
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,680
I'll never forget that. Ooh, hot labels.

212
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,770
And I kind of liked her too, cause a lot
of those got chicks with cute, you know,

213
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:07,910
if you could get past the fucking,
you know, now a days I would actually,

214
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:12,500
I would totally steer clear of them
knowing what I know. It's like, Oh God,

215
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,410
let me, I would have one question. Do
you or do you not hate your parents?

216
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,750
You do and see Ya.
I'm not fucking going through that shit.

217
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,180
Those fucking long talks about everything
that they did to you. You know, Eh,

218
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,310
you know what my parents did shit to,
you know,

219
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,620
and I'm a parent now and I'm
going to do shit. You know?

220
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,700
That doesn't mean you got to fucking walk
around dressed like you were in awake.

221
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,963
Okay.

222
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,660
That'd be why you dressed like that
cause you got bullied. Now look at you.

223
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,660
Now you're just bringing
this shit onto yourself.

224
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,590
What are you waiting for bullies to
become enlightened and be like, oh,

225
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:53,380
I guess people have the right to be
different. It's not going to happen.

226
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,380
So at the very least,
if you're going to walk around like that,

227
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,930
it at least at some point
take the makeup off,

228
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,670
going to a Dojo and learn some fucking
MMA shit so you can protect yourself.

229
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,670
So I guess in the end of the day,
I'm not really attack and golf people.

230
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:11,290
I'm really saying, hello, fuck
her. She's still judged me.

231
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,430
Right? Ooh, hot labels.

232
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,510
I was sipping on those things where you
walk and he kind of stopped for half a

233
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:23,530
second and then you is, is it worth it?
It's not worth it. And I just kept going.

234
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,560
I forget what her fucking name was.

235
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,100
It was either Natasha a brook,

236
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,990
which was always a fucking hot
girl name when I was growing up.

237
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,590
Yeah,

238
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,690
I never really saw a brook that wasn't
good looking. Natasha's were good looking.

239
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,850
Debbie's Debbie's. We'll fun. Debbie's,

240
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:48,930
we'll find girl weird like do you
give you give a fucking person a name,

241
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,950
you know what I mean? It was like
bill, you know, just blending in.

242
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,010
Bill lost in the crowd.

243
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,420
Yeah.

244
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,200
Oh, mainstream bill with this corporate
clothes. Just walking down the street.

245
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:08,410
I did have the red afro for a while
when I got into fucking radio.

246
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,310
I fucking grew it out a little bit and uh,

247
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,520
I think I had the beard all that's when
I got into drums and I was trying to be

248
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:19,240
in a band and that's what I was trying
to grow my hair out and it just went out.

249
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,960
Which would have been cool in the sixties
or seventies I would have looked like

250
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:27,010
Bernie for Brent to 22 but
by the 80s it wasn't cool.

251
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,740
You had to have the law on fucking hand.
Just never worked for me.

252
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,630
The comedy gods, they just pulled
me in. It's like, listen bill,

253
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,800
you'll look like a douche
no matter what you do. Okay.

254
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,410
You're not a good looking guy. You
look like a fucking freak. Okay.

255
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,500
The only hope for you
is to stand on stage.

256
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,010
And make fun of yourself and make a
little bit of money. Why don't you,

257
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:55,630
why don't you cash in on your Orange Afro?
You know,

258
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,390
I think that that's what was going on.
And eventually I, I, that's what I did.

259
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,740
That is exactly what I did.

260
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,410
And then when I was making enough money
in the business, uh, the comedy, God said,

261
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:10,360
okay, you don't need your orange afro
anymore. And they took it from me. Um,

262
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,600
I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about. Oh,

263
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,600
I know what I wanted to
bring up two weeks in a row.

264
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,530
I'm going to give you a great movie.
I told you I saw Jordan peals get out,

265
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,810
which is so fucking such you a
great movie. And so, you know,

266
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,430
different from everything
else that's out there.

267
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:31,390
I'm actually going to win
joy watching Hollywood now.

268
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,220
Try to rip that movie off.

269
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,260
It's like get out meets people who
don't know how to make a get out.

270
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,500
I think they're going to
do the Latino version. Um,

271
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,500
however you say get out in a Latino,
you know,

272
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,620
Serato Vamanos I don't
what the fuck you say?

273
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,950
I'm starting to remember sesame street
and we had to enter and exit ibn though

274
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,890
sat out. Oh, that was close. I don't
fucking room. I don't know. You know,

275
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:01,440
whatever this is.

276
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,940
Some fucking white guy will get a resent
a stone and he'll figure out how to say

277
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,560
it. Not Try to rip off that
movie. That was a great movie.

278
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:14,300
And this week, um, I was on the
plane ride back from Austin.

279
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:14,841
Wait a minute,

280
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:19,841
typing in my password and I saw the guy
from peaky blinders killing and Murphy

281
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,640
don't know nothing about no robbery.
Oh fuck you with the fucking password.

282
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,140
Hang on second.
God dammit.

283
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,480
There we go. It's called, I don't,
I hope I say this right. It's um,

284
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,450
anthropoid a n t h r o p. O, I. D.

285
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,070
And it's based on,

286
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:48,071
they say the extraordinary true
story of operation anthropoid uh,

287
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,200
the World War Two mission to attempt
to assassinate ss General Reinhard

288
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,210
Heydrich. Um, and what I love is it,

289
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,160
it's a story I never heard.
You know,

290
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,900
granted I don't fucking read and it
takes place in a checklist of Aki and

291
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:10,700
Prague. And I had no idea. I
knew that Germany, you know,

292
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:14,390
they lost I guess
Austria in World War One.

293
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:20,060
And then, uh, you know, a star came back
and he's just like on TV should have that.

294
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,920
And then he just took fucking Austria

295
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,090
and nobody in Europe did anything.
And everyone's just like, wow,

296
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:26,850
well maybe that's,

297
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,840
maybe they'll just be happy with that
and we won't get involved in this fucking

298
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:33,780
world war thing again. And then I
thought he went immediately to Poland,

299
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,680
but evidently, oh, fucking evil.

300
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:42,681
Charlie Chaplin himself went to a
checklist of Archaea I had no idea and uh,

301
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,140
made me want to read up
on the subject and um,

302
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,700
it's a fucking amazing,
amazing movie. And a,

303
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:54,420
it's one of those movies where,
uh, what they're talking about,

304
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,510
the behavior was so heroic
as you're watching it,

305
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,510
you're actually sort of squirm and going,
like,

306
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,000
how would I react? What I would
hope that I would be one of these,

307
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,170
okay,

308
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,120
you know, the good guys here as opposed
to the person just trying to blend in.

309
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:12,811
Well,

310
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:16,900
the not coming after me and I just sort
of do whatever the fuck they see now

311
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,150
choose like self preservation, which
I gotta be honest with you. Like,

312
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,250
I would never fault a parent for doing
that because once you get your kid like

313
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:29,790
you just like so focused on your fucking
kid, you just like, fuck all adults,

314
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
you know, not fuck all
adults. It's just like, well,

315
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,720
I'm not creating a situation where
they, I gotta I, I got a kid, you know?

316
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,350
Okay,

317
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,300
but you'd like to think like,
you know what?

318
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:44,740
Fuck that I'm going to teach my kid how
to shoot a fucking Uzi and let's go Nazi

319
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,930
hunting. You know, you'd like to
think that you were that person

320
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,580
as opposed to sitting there quietly
eating your soggy corn flakes.

321
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,503
You know,

322
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,310
this is the thing about being a
coward is if nobody else knows,

323
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:07,130
you'll forgive yourself.
You know,

324
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,110
it's other people knowing it. Just staring
at your shoes for the, the, you know,

325
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,710
waiting for the people that know what
a coward you were during that time.

326
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,690
Eventually die or you die or whatever.

327
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:22,640
But it's a fucking unbelievable
fucking movie. Absolutely loved it.

328
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,580
And um, directed by Sean
Ellis. I liked this.

329
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:28,160
I like giving shout outs cause not a
lot of people go to movies anymore.

330
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,470
Shadow some of these fucking
talented people here.

331
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,840
And it starts Jamie Dornan,
killy and Murphy.

332
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,890
I hope I said that right.

333
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,490
It's spelled c I. L. L. I. A. N. A. Okay,

334
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
come on. You got to have a couple of
broads in here with some loving inches,

335
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,340
right? Oh, I'm never going say
this. Sarah Amro savage Strava.

336
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,420
Hannah fried joke,

337
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,110
joke for this crisis is like trying
to name a fucking hockey player now.

338
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Hannah F R E J K O v.

339
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,440
A with a fucking hatchet
mark right above it.

340
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,930
Okay.

341
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,480
I don't know what it was. Uh, it
was amazing. Great fucking movie.

342
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:12,880
Check it out if you get a
chance. If you're on American
Airlines, it's played. Um,

343
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,530
I don't know if they get extra money if
they do it that way. I know. All right.

344
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:18,050
Anyways, let's read a little bit
of advertising here for this week.

345
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,210

352
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,350
Unlike the generic ones when you're

00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:49,580
All right,

354
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,170
Okay.

355
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,110
Oh man, that one's stuck with, isn't it
amazing the things that stick with you?

356
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,350
That was almost 30 fucking years ago
and I still remember it like it was

357
00:21:57,351 --> 00:22:01,890
yesterday. Ooh. Hot labels. You know,

358
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,830
if I had a time machine, like I wouldn't
go back and try and stop Hitler.

359
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:08,490
I'd go back to that moment in my life
so I could turn around and be like,

360
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,940
and that'll be, that'll
be it. That'll be it.

361
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:16,170
And I get right back in and I would leave
anyways.

362
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:17,960

00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:33,470
bought underwear,
five packs,

367
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,150
if you've been settling to go into the
fucking mall and buying a pack of five

372
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,790
What's the first thing you put on
in the last thing you take off?

373
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,670
What does it do? Your underwear, right?

374
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,910
Unless you leave your hat on your
fucking Weirdo, it's your underwear.

375
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,560
Make your most important piece of clothing
the best it can be with me undies.

376
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,650
When's the last time you were completely
naked and you just had on a hat?

377
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,590
You know if there's anybody in the room,
they're fucking laughing, right? Key.

378
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,360
You cannot be completely naked and
just have on a hat and not do a dance.

379
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,180
It's impossible.
Especially if your guide,

380
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,160
then you got your junks fucking
shaking around. It's tremendous.

Feel good undies delivered

Los Angeles or Louisiana.

384
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,360
They don't really say la and
made from sustainable sources.

385
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,250
Micro Modal, modal of fabric,
three times softer than cotton.

386
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,800
Beyond these softer than
soft luxury undies coming in.

387
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:45,980
An ever changing selection of classic
colors. What is classic call is,

388
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:50,480
this is probably your basic, you know,
Crayon set when you were a little kid.

389
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:55,400
What's your favorite color? Whoa.
All right. Blow red, white, black,

390
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:59,330
brown, yellow, green.
That's it. That's it.

391
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:01,250
Like the original members
had guns and roses.

392
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:02,930
Then all of a sudden you get burnt Sienna.

393
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,790
You know when Matt Sorum comes in and
you get a little fucking a, I dunno,

394
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,350
some other fucking car off white. When
you get a, what does that Guy Dizzy?

395
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,950
Fucking something rather. Anyways,
bold shapes. Adventurist patterns.

396
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:18,800
So you can tailor your undies to your
own personal style. And guess what?

397
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,570
Guess what? You can save time and money
each month with a monthly subscription.

398
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,440
How much do you shit your pants
that you need underwear every month.

399
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,070
And if you're not ready
for a subscription, that's
okay. You can still save.

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,363
Yeah.

443
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,680
Do you like to booze? Huh?
Do you like to get fucked up?

444
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:16,020
But you don't want to get pulled
over for drinking and driving?

445
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,310
Wouldn't be great if there was a
service that was like a taxi service,

446
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:23,400
but it wasn't,
it was just some person in a car.

447
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,910
While I introduce you to lift l,
Y,

448
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:31,110
f t cause she can never
spell it the correct way in
the modern air in the modern

449
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:34,730
era. Right? It's gotta be, it's
gotta be funky. Get people over this,

450
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,630
not l I f t man, that's the
squares. This is l. Y. F. T.

451
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:43,920
Like why would you drive
when you're drinking? Um, you
know, you know about Lyft,

452
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:44,754
right?

453
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,530
Yeah.

454
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,363
Right.

455
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,170
It's the APP that gets you a
ride in minutes on demand 24,

456
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,370
seven for less than the cost of a cab.
Uh, please include the following points.

457
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:57,900
By the way,
that fucking commercial,

458
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:02,370
I think it's full lift that they do on
TV where the people are robbing the bank

459
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,820
and they're freaking out. And then this
at one kid just sitting there going like,

460
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,570
oh, the guy's name Tim, that's a great
name. And he's totally fucking relax.

461
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,880
Don't that fucking actor in that is,
is should immediately be putting movies.

462
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,770
That's my own personal opinion.

463
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,830
Okay.

464
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,270
I thought it was very unique.
There's all,

465
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:23,590
I'm saying it's a great commercial retro
or all the way around. Two thumbs up.

466
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,680
Anyways, please include the following
points during your read. Okay.

467
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,620
If you've tried Lyft,
you know what I mean? Uh,

468
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,170
with Lyft you just download
the APP request to driver
and they show up in three

469
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,120
and a half minutes. On
average. That's really fast.

470
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:38,530
Everybody knows how this fucking works.

471
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,660
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted through
that 10 point safety standard one.

472
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,650
Have you ever fucked a kid? Okay,
good. We move to the second round to,

473
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,400
have you ever had a drone crash into your
neighbor because you were jerking off

474
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:54,250
watching them take a
shower? No. Okay. Three.

475
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,150
Yeah. Have you ever been
sympathetic to the Communist Party?

476
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:01,670
Whatever the fuck they say up to that
it kind of goes off the rails. You know,

477
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,730
once you haven't fucked a kid, you
know, you haven't killed anybody,

478
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:09,710
then it's kind of like, Eh, you
know, uh, you like to boost plan,

479
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,020
know, but how much do
you like to boost? Um,

480
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:16,640
10 point a standard including criminal
and DMV background checks, you know,

481
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:20,540
you'll get around quickly and safety
lift drivers are rated after every ride.

482
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:24,920
So only the best stick around. This is
like bill Belichick do your fucking job.

483
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,220
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude

484
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,640
with Lyft. You can tip in the APP, which
obviously leads to happier drivers.

485
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:32,510
So right now,

486
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,680

M ms and it's here in la.

506
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:56,090
I for some reason don't have
the information in front of me.

507
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:59,810
I don't fucking know womb.
I'm co hosting it with Craig Gas.

508
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,980
It's rock against ms I believe is
going to be a bunch of musicians there.

509
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,890
Steven Adler, again, fucking Gilby Clarke,

510
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,940
uh, Rudy Sasso, Michael, Devin.

511
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:15,040
All of these fucking rock
stars are going to be there.

512
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:19,740
We're going to raise a bunch of money to
help try and find a cure for this bed.

513
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,490
Horrific disease as opposed to
what? Bill? A wonderful disease.

514
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,340
What about the disease of laughter?

515
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,570
I don't think we ever want to
cure that to me. I'm sorry.

516
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
I'm going to be in San Jose this week.
Everybody, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

517
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,600
I'm doing two shows a night.
I got my new shit going on.

518
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:40,290
I was supposed to do the
goddamn comedy jam, but I'm,

519
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:44,160
my fucking shoulder is messed up.
And uh,

520
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:47,970
I've been driving my old truck to
that's three on the tree and that's the

521
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:48,910
shoulder that's fucked up.

522
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:52,080
But I actually was bothering
me just to shift on the column.

523
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:53,200
That's how fucking old I am.

524
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,950
Like someday I might have to sell that
truck because it hurts my shoulder to

525
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:03,860
just shift. It only has
three gears. I know.

526
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:06,980
It's fucking pathetic. I've been fallen
off on the Bruins and the Celtics,

527
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:08,900
I know the Bruins scored a bunch of goals.

528
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:13,200
I know we beat the bulls the
other day, but then the, uh,

529
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:17,070
the Bruins scored like six goals,
four goals in the third period.

530
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:20,270
I watched the first period of both the,
uh,

531
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,020
the Vancouver and the Calgary game.
And that was always my,

532
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,410
my fantasy when I was young as a fan,
when I went on the road, you know,

533
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:32,580
I was just like, I would love to do
that fucking western Canada road trip.

534
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,770
You know, back then it was
Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver,

535
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,400
and maybe played Winnipeg too.

536
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,950
And then the last end they went down
and they played the La Kings in La.

537
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:50,030
Kings would just sit in a way out
in the west with nobody narrow.

538
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,780
Like the closest fucking
team I think was Vancouver.

539
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,160
And then the next closest would probably
be, would have been the St Louis Blues,

540
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,750
maybe Chicago Blackhawks, I would
guess Saint Louis. They would just,

541
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,760
there was no fucking team west of
St Louis other than the La Kings.

542
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:13,331
So no wonder the ants such tar time took
him so long to win a fucking cop along.

543
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:18,030
They had to fly. Vancouver's never
fucking one. One Calgary one once,

544
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,250
right.
In 89,

545
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:25,080
they'd be fucking Patrick Wa
and the Montreal Canadians. Uh,

546
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:29,310
I want to say Pat Burns was coaching
that team. I can't remember. Edmonton.

547
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,360
Edmonton fucking lit it up.
So anyways,

548
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,530
let me see if they'd beat
Calgary last night. Boston Bray,

549
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,270
we go bro. When here we go. Boston
Bruins, they're flying around the ice.

550
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:43,240
I Sub Pasta Knox 29th goal.

551
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,680
Okay.

552
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,880
He's really fill up, fill in the
uh, Tyler Sagan void. When you say,

553
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,331
you know,

554
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:55,331
since Tyler Sagan left eye Marshawn became
a legitimate superstar and now pasta

555
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,240
knock is on his way. So I guess
we're doing all right. You know,

556
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:02,480
we survived it and I actually think
Tyler's Sagan [inaudible] shown us

557
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,070
congratulating ourselves. I think we
want Bruins extinguish the flames.

558
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,920
You get it. You get it.
It's like they're on fire.

559
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,580
David Back has returned from a collision
into the boards. Yeah, that was scary.

560
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:19,680
That looked like me and pick up hockey.
Um,

561
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,060
oh for fuck sakes.
Where did the story go?

562
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,830
Gailey's score the game winner
as a Bruins down the flames,

563
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,680
five to two in Calgary on Wednesday night,

564
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:33,681
we scored six goals and Vancouver
five 11 goals and to fucking games.

565
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,490
You know, all my fucking bitch
moaning and complaining. Um,

566
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,880
Marshawn humbled by emerging
status as a lead score. Yeah,

567
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,540
that's absolutely right.
What about pasta?

568
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,970
Marshawn had a hat trick in Vancouver
and I fucking missed it too.

569
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,540
All of a sudden we're scoring goals and
I was sitting there whining st do not

570
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,950
get rid of Clo Julian and it's been a,
it's totally worked out.

571
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,600
It's worked out for us.
It's worked out for him.

572
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:02,960
It's worked out for the Canadian
so it's all good. And um,

573
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,340
we're flying around the ice with the
new coach Cassidy. That's fucking great.

574
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,190
That's fucking great. I love it. I love,

575
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,000
it's good to see Douggie Hamilton to
seem to be doing all right out there and

576
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:13,940
camp and Calgary.

577
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,120
I never had to have a fucking problem
with experts even if they decided to try

578
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:23,780
to take more money. I don't give a
fuck. She will career have a good time.

579
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,640
Good to see. It's still
in the league. You know,

580
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,930
I know you're out there in the saddle
dome that doesn't get a lot of love down

581
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:34,070
here in the lower 48, as they
say in Alaska. Um, anyways,

582
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:37,470
that's the podcast I got to get on
with my fucking day here. Oh my God.

583
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:42,450
My wife said the fucking greatest thing
to me ever to fucking motivate me to

584
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:43,284
work out.

585
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,580
I was sitting there looking in the mirror
in the bathroom and I just fat shamed

586
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:51,600
myself every fucking night.
That's how I stay in shape.
Right. And I just, you know,

587
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,580
I went off the rails and I ate steak
and shake twice and ate Mcdonald's twice

588
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:59,010
and had burger king.
This month has been like fast food.

589
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,710
When I'd been on the road, I don't know
what's been going on with me. Right.

590
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,980
So I was looking at the
results of that diet

591
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,900
and I was just looking in the mirror
and I called myself a tub of fuck,

592
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,230
which I've never said in my life.
I was just like, you fucking

593
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,100
soft mushy tub of fuck.

594
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,210
And then neo was in the other room
going like, what's going on with you?

595
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:25,890
I don't know. Look at me. I'm fucking, I'm
a mess. She goes, you, Oh look dad bad.

596
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:30,690
I go, Yay. Do Look at me. I got a
fucking dad bod now and she goes, no,

597
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:35,010
you don't. I go, nick, you're not
helping me. You know I need honesty here.

598
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,570
And then she just goes,
all right,

599
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,490
you're not his tone as you once were.

600
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,770
And I just went, fuck yeah. She goes,
I'm sorry you said that. I said, no,

601
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,370
you're doing me a favor. So
that's it. Now I've been on it.

602
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,650
I'd been on it like the Joe Rogan company.
I've been foreclosed on it. All right.

603
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,300
OATMEAL, fucking poached egg
in the morning. By the way,

604
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,500
when you make you poached eggs,

605
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,900
if you want to have them like they
do in the restaurant, you know it's,

606
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:06,810
it's spooning with itself.
This is such as simple trick.

607
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:10,830
I didn't even know it for all these years.
Just swirl the water.

608
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,770
I know I've said this before,
but maybe you missed the podcast.

609
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,820
Just swirled the water. Get a
little whirlpool going. Okay.

610
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,000
And then you crack the egg,

611
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,700
you drop it right down the center
and it's like a figure skater.

612
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:24,490
You know when they do the fucking spinning
around, it just, it brings its arms in.

613
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,710
And then you go,
you take it out with a slotted spoon,

614
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,350
you put it on a fucking English muffin.
Unless you like me.

615
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:34,020
If you're a tub of fuck and
you're trying to lose weight,

616
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:37,080
there's no English muffin.
It's just sitting in naked and afraid.

617
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,910
That is the dumbest fucking show.
Do you know there's no price?

618
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,200
These people go out there and get like
fucking Lyme disease got ants crawling

619
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:48,930
around their balls and up into
their fucking private parts. I mean,

620
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:52,500
I just don't understand why you would
do that. Cavemen were not naked.

621
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,790
They were definitely afraid,

622
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,850
but they fucking killed something
and they covered up their junk.

623
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,380
I actually saw this guy naked in
a fucking tree with a hatchet.

624
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,770
This is just the commercial
because I refuse to watch that.

625
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:07,320
I don't watch that show.
You know,

626
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:10,740
black people will watch shit that
because it's a bad representation of

627
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:13,230
themselves.
That's what that show is for white people.

628
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:16,560
There's very few shows out there that
bring white people down, you know,

629
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,210
because white people are running shit.

630
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,220
So we always make ourselves the
fucking heroes. I'm naked and afraid.

631
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:25,080
That's not a good show for white people.

632
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,870
That is every stereotype of a fucking
white person. Just like, you know,

633
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,890
I think my life is just too fucking easy.
I got to make it difficult or do,

634
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:39,310
I took all my clothes off, went into the
fucking juggled sof. I could survive.

635
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,410
Okay.

636
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,860
Naked and afraid. So this fucking guy
and just in the commercial for it,

637
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:49,060
he's up in a tree and he's fucking
hack and at this branch in this tree,

638
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:53,260
he's sitting in and then the whole fucking
branch collapses and it's just like,

639
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:56,500
that reminds me of some
shit from like bugs bunny.

640
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,030
Okay.

641
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,520
Where the somebody be sitting on a branch
in this sign off and it's sitting on

642
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:04,460
the wrong side of it and then they
fall off or the whole tree falls down.

643
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,610
I literally watched this
guy do with live action.

644
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,390
A real person did that to himself. He
was, but he was hacking on the right side,

645
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,950
but still,
I don't know what happened.

646
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:16,090
The whole thing fucking falls
and now he's falling in.

647
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,420
Yeah.

648
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,040
To like a bunch of like branches
sticking all like just completely naked.

649
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,733
You know,

650
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,980
I never cut my balls my entire life.
I never got a scratch on my balls.

651
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:32,510
Nothing.
Cause they were covered up.

652
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,810
I had on a pair of pants
claims a fucking tree naked.

653
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,923
MMM.

654
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,760
Anyways,
I don't know why I'm talking about this.

655
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:45,340
I don't know why I had this level of
passion for a fucking show. I don't,

656
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,330
I don't even watch, uh, that's the, uh,
day I checked in on you. Okay. You guys,

657
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:49,751
you guys have,

658
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:53,440
you guys have yourself a great fucking
weekend or I get cards and I will, uh,

659
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:58,050
I'll talk to you on Monday. All right,
that's it. Go fuck yourselves. And uh,

660
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,620
God bless the United States of America.

661
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,993
Okay,

662
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,303
quick

663
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,593
slack.

664
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,480
Hey, what's going on? It's still bird. It

665
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,070
is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

666
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:58,270
March 16th, 2009. Um,

667
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,450
I didn't know what this is the
year of anybody. Asian listening.

668
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:07,270
What is it the year of? Is it
the year of the Monkey? Um,

669
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,490
I am in San Francisco right now and uh,
I can't believe it.

670
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,410
It's drizzling out and it's cold
and it's miserable. It's just,

671
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,450
I just blew my mind because every time
I come to San Francisco, the weather,

672
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:26,590
it's just, it's just, you know, it just
puts a smile on your face, you know,

673
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:27,850
it's just one of those,
you know,

674
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,810
which I don't know when the fuck they
ever filmed that rice a Roni commercial,

675
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:35,510
but it must've been like the one sunny
day in the last 10 fucking years out here.

676
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,730
Cause this is the 12th time
I've come to this city.

677
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,610
I just pulled that number out of the air.
But whatever.

678
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,280
What a suck every time.
I mean it's like physically impossible.

679
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,350
Um,
and I mentioned I have a touch of a cold.

680
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,600
I usually get sick when I come here.

681
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,140
Dave is actually a little bit sick before
I got here. How did you get sick belt?

682
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:01,930
Well, I'll tell you, I went to a
Joshua tree national park and uh,

683
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,970
evidently I didn't dress properly as I
hiked my way out to somebody's goldmine.

684
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,570
Literally, um, Joshua
Tree, definitely, uh,

685
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,130
definitely a good time. Although I made
a real, I made a big time fool of myself.

686
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,610
I showed up and uh,
I asked the ranger,

687
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,030
I swear to God he was a ranger,
but he's working in the gift shop,

688
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:26,330
so I forget he sucks at being arranger,
you know what I mean?

689
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,180
Probably accidentally started a fire
rather than put in one out in the,

690
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,410
in the park. So, uh, I asked
the ranger, I, you know,

691
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,740
it's called Joshua tree.
So in my mind, you know,

692
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,810
there's this big beautiful park and this
is one fucking Joshua tree and that's

693
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:45,080
what everybody comes up to. And you
know, like that, what's that wallet?

694
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,350
All those Jewish people go up and pray to?
I thought it was something like that,

695
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:52,420
some sort of Mecca. Right?
So I say, yeah, you got,

696
00:42:52,421 --> 00:42:54,890
it gives me the map of the whole,
the whole park.

697
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,840
I'm actually getting embarrassed
telling the story. I actually said,

698
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:03,080
so where exactly is the Joshua Tree?
Is it like,

699
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,830
is it like one tree?
Is it like a group of like five trees?

700
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,370
And the guy's looking at me and
then just the way he looked at me,

701
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:11,121
I just realized,

702
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,480
I just said probably the dumbest fucking
thing I could possibly say within them

703
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:19,340
park. And evidently this is what
I learned it in defense of myself.

704
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:20,750
I am from the east coast.
Every gift,

705
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Bentley a Joshua tree is just the type
of tree and I had probably driven by like

706
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:31,720
200 of them on the way up to
fucking talking to this ranger.

707
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,680
There was probably three
of them in the parking lot.

708
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:37,250
Basically there for you people
on the east coast who ever,

709
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,840
if you ever go out there, there is no
Joshua tree. It's just a type of tree.

710
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,720
And if you go to Joshua tree and you say,

711
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:47,840
so where is the Joshua
tree that would like be,

712
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,580
that'd be like going to New Jersey
and going, um, where is the pine tree?

713
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,330
The pine tree that,
you know,

714
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,150
the special one and uh,
you know, uh, just, yeah,

715
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,300
I don't know. I, you know,
I just got the directions.

716
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:08,630
I just found out how to fucking get there.
I had no information about it.

717
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,520
But you know, in defense of me,
they should name the park. Uh,

718
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,610
Joshua trees, plural, not Joshua tree.

719
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,710
It confuses people.

720
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:23,400
And then they ask silly questions and
then they feel stupid and then they tell

721
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:27,920
us, we tell the story on their podcast
and they get slightly embarrassed. Uh,

722
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,900
so anyways, that was my
week. Oh, you know something.

723
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,480
I went to the San Jose sharks game on
Saturday night on my way up here to do my

724
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:41,190
one, my two shows here up in San
Francisco, saw the shark's speed, uh,

725
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:46,191
the kings in a shootout and
at the game I saw a 50 to 50,

726
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,990
I'd say about 55,

727
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:53,310
58 year old Guy Punch a 27
year old kid right in the face.

728
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:57,830
And it was fucking hilarious. Um,
there was this kid he had on this uh,

729
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,470
Detroit Redwings Jersey
A's hat on backwards,

730
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,620
you know that right out of the gate he's
just standing up screaming shit and he

731
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:09,900
was cheering on the sharks. So
Evan, I don't know what happened.

732
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,580
I think cause he kept
standing up. Anyways, this,

733
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:19,380
this chick who's also like 55, 58,
she's got this awful for coat on,

734
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,220
you know, in San Jose. So you
know, she thinks she's somebody.

735
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,610
I'm sure that's a fancy thing
to do in San Jose, California.

736
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,950
What a fucking ghost town. That was by
the way. Nobody on the streets. Right.

737
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,500
So, um, yeah, speaking of which, I like,

738
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:39,460
I actually was going cheap with the fuck
I was going to stay and I actually, uh,

739
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,170
decided to stay at this Ramada,
you know,

740
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:45,950
thinking that it was, you
know, I'm like, all right,

741
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,150
I tell you 89 bucks for the
night. Fuck it. I'll stay here.

742
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:53,151
And I'd pull in and it's one of those
deals where the hotel rooms open up,

743
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:57,180
out into the parking lot. And if
you're a fan of my podcast, you know,

744
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:02,130
I feel about those. I do not stay,
I don't stay in motels. Okay.

745
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,310
Even if you call it a hotel,
if it fucking opens up,

746
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,960
if your room opens up out into the
parking lot, that's a fucking motel.

747
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,620
Can somebody tell, well, what is the
definition of a motel versa? A hotel.

748
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,100
Because if my world,
if your door opens up to the parking lot,

749
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,310
that is a motel slash this serial killer
buffet where they can just walk down

750
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:25,710
and be like, I'm going to kill this
guy, I'm going to kill this guy.

751
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:27,090
Am I fucking with duct guy?

752
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,130
So I never even checked in nor
did I cancel my reservation.

753
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,760
So I wonder, uh, I wonder if
I'm going to pay for that.

754
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,850
I ended up just calling the
Marriott around the corner,

755
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:43,350
not even worried about whether they had
a fucking room available because I saw

756
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:45,220
that there was only six
people on the street,

757
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,310
four of which were fucking
crack heads. Um, yeah.

758
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:54,840
So anyways, so I go to this fucking
game, get back on track here. Yeah.

759
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:58,260
So this woman, this fur coat, all of a
sudden she gets into it with this guy,

760
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:02,850
where is this? This, this Red
Wings Jersey and you know,

761
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:05,280
she's giving him shit.
He's giving it right back to her,

762
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,350
which of course I'm loving.
You know what I mean?

763
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,830
Cause usually the guys back down to women
once they start screaming and public

764
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,100
and he didn't,
he just kept giving a shit right back.

765
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,140
And I don't know what she
said, but she goes, yeah,

766
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:20,550
you just try me or something like that.
Which was really fucking annoying.

767
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,690
You know, I have a woman act like
they're going to get physical with a man.

768
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:28,800
Like they going to knock them out.
It's like we do shut up, you know,

769
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:31,060
I hit you.
I mean I could,

770
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:34,750
but I'm instantly going to go to fucking
jail and then I'm going to get raped,

771
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,710
you know,
so stop acting like you're fucking tough.

772
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,080
The law is on your side.
All right.

773
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,610
So she's doing all that shit and he's
giving her shit right back and then it's

774
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,610
sort of died down.

775
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,960
Then I started watching the game again
and next thing you know there's just this

776
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:52,150
commotion and I look
over to my left again.

777
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:55,360
Now the kid and the Red Wings
Jersey is covered in beer

778
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,690
and he's John at the,
the lady with the fur coat and a,

779
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,420
obviously she dumped it over
his head. You know, I mean,

780
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,780
of course I would too if it was
illegal to kick the shit out of me.

781
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,470
So she dumps it over ahead and he doesn't
blessed her in the face just adding to

782
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:16,630
her country level that she's
going to be the following day.

783
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:21,180
The fact that she got away with that and
didn't get dropped. I'm not advocating,

784
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,570
I don't think you should hit a woman,

785
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:26,140
but I don't feel like women should take
advantage of the fact that a man can't

786
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:31,141
hit them by just doing over the top
country things like just dumping a beer on

787
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:34,810
somebody. You know what I mean? So
anyway, so she dumps the beer on the guy,

788
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,850
which I got them in is also
hilarious on another level.

789
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,580
So I didn't hear the exchange, I
guess. I don't know what happens.

790
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,640
All of a sudden this fucking old guy comes
into the picture he's got his face is

791
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:49,630
all twisted up with angry anger and
he just says to the kid, he goes,

792
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,550
who you calling a bitch?

793
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,490
He must've called the chicken
and for our code a bitch and I,

794
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,580
the kid didn't say anything.
And I swear to God,

795
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,900
this fucking 55 year old dude who was
the slowest punch I've ever seen in my

796
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:05,350
life, he literally lifted his
hand up like a rock 'em sock.

797
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:08,790
'Em robot and just through this straight,
not even,

798
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,360
I don't know what the fuck it was.

799
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:13,270
It was like rock 'em sock 'em he
just see sort of bought them right,

800
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:17,630
right on the nose. And then the kid
just immediately called for security,

801
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:21,480
you know, it was just like, wow, that's
really a tough situation. They're like,

802
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,220
he just dealt with two of the
toughest physical confrontations.

803
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:28,000
A woman dumps a beer over your head,
you want to punch her in the face,

804
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,750
but you can't. But then you allowed
her to dump it over your head.

805
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,230
So he deals with that. Then he has
an old guy punched him in the face.

806
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,670
It's like another man just punched him
in the face. You want to drill them back,

807
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,760
but you can't cause he's an old guy,

808
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:45,520
but then you will allow to an
old guy to punch you in the face.

809
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:48,640
So at this point this guy
socially has been raped, right.

810
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,940
So I'm thinking when security
comes down, I'm like, all right,

811
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:55,930
this guy got punched in the face and a
beer over his head. He might actually,

812
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,770
you know,

813
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,310
he should get out of this even though
he's younger than the two of them and

814
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:00,970
you're going to be sympathetic
with the old people.

815
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,090
But he immediately screws up cause the
security gets there and he just starts

816
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:07,150
cursing his brains out going,
I need to do shit.

817
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,200
I was use fucking watching the fucking,
they just snatched him.

818
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:16,330
They actually smashed all three of them
and 20 minutes later somehow the kid

819
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:19,240
with the Red Wings Jersey came
back and the two old people didn't.

820
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,420
And I was thinking,
how the fuck did he pull that off?

821
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,520
And the only way I can think of it,

822
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,800
it's as if the old guy admitted
to punching in the face,

823
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,460
which is probably what someone
would do if they weren't a lawyer.

824
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,160
He probably said, well this guy punched
me in the face. And then he probably said,

825
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:37,400
I did it cause you called my wife a bitch.
And then it became,

826
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,780
do you want to press charges?

827
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,690
And then the old guy gets scared and grabs
his walker and he leaves and then the

828
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:47,120
fucking Detroit, right when kid
came back, that was my experience.

829
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,110
Was that just a long boring
story that went nowhere.

830
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:52,750
I kind of lost interest
towards the end of that.

831
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:55,820
And then mouse started getting
dry. Anyway, this is the month,

832
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,210
the Monday morning podcast and a,
he new to my podcasts.

833
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:02,600
I do one of these every single week.
And uh,

834
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:06,500
I think it's becoming really relevant
during these tough economic times,

835
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,340
you know, to just give away
something free like this.

836
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,400
I'm only mentioning that it's free
because somebody told me that they find it

837
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:17,820
annoying when people say it's
a free podcast, you know,

838
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,570
it's like really well, it is a free
podcast. You fucking douchebag.

839
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,390
And despite the fact that it's free,
people still bitch at me every week,

840
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,960
you know?
So yeah,

841
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,710
I am going to throw it in your
face that I'm doing this for free.

842
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,730
What do you think about that? I'm going
to guilt you. Just like your grandmother,

843
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,790
you know, I saw one of the greatest
movie trailers I've ever seen in my life.

844
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,050
You guys, you guys, fans of the
movie, the dirty dozen. Well,

845
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,560
what is wrong with you? You
should be go, go on Youtube,

846
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:52,160
hit pause. You don't need to listen to
me right now. This is all you need to do.

847
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:53,540
If you want to be entertained for free,

848
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:57,560
just go on youtube and type
in the dirty dozen and watch,

849
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,080
watch the movie trailer of it.

850
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,530
And they have one of the greatest lines
I think that has ever been written.

851
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,640
And they're describing basically
the premise of the movie is this,

852
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:12,110
these 12 guys who are on basically either
on death row are facing really long

853
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:13,130
prison sentences.

854
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,990
And if they agree to go on this
suicide mission to kill a bunch of Nazi

855
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:22,910
officers, if they survive,
they get to go free. And uh,

856
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,621
that's the movie.

857
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:27,440
So they're basically describing all the
characters and one of the characters

858
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:32,420
they described as an Indian with
war paint smeared on his soul.

859
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,640
I can't do it justice.
I cannot do it justice.

860
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:46,330
The guys doing it in that movie voice
and he's not doing it with a hint of how

861
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:48,590
fucking hilarious it is.

862
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:53,591
Cause it wasn't the hilarious back then
and Indian was war page smeared and

863
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:58,400
under his soul. It's just, that's fucking
awesome. I want that as my ringtone. Um,

864
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,110
anyways, so let's get on with the podcast.
Uh, yeah, like maybe new to my podcast.

865
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:06,380
People send me questions, I answer my
answer the questions the best I can.

866
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:11,000
People send me their lift of underrated
things they find underrated or overrated

867
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,680
and a movie reviews. Um, and the latest,

868
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:20,840
the latest is people are
telling me stories of, uh,

869
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:26,100
of revenge. Um, all right, so
here's one. They're really long.

870
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:30,960
These people really are writing me like
Stephen King length stories of revenge.

871
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:35,430
And personally what I've been saying
throughout this is I don't do revenge.

872
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,970
I, uh, I enjoy hearing the stories,

873
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:43,500
but I don't do it because I just,
my Karma is too fucking strong.

874
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:45,451
I Dunno man.

875
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:50,451
Like there's something about
revenge unless it's face to face,

876
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,420
you know, you just sort of
fight somebody, you know,

877
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:56,960
that seems like an honorable kind
of revenge. But when you sort of,

878
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,550
you start the second year,

879
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:02,970
like looking at another human being and
they don't know you're looking at them

880
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:06,210
and you're trying to plan some diabolical
shit. I don't know about you guys,

881
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:09,420
but there's something inside of me.
I can't fucking do it because I just,

882
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,380
I never feel more evil. I mean,
I'm not going to lie to you.

883
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:17,610
I've sat around and thought about it,
but to actually carry it out, yeah,

884
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,140
who knows?
Maybe it's exciting.

885
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,650
I never feel more alive than when plotting
the depth of my next door neighbor.

886
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,350
All right, there we go. Um, you know,

887
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,470
that sound byte might to come back to
haunt me in the future when I pull my

888
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:35,570
Robert Blake in my sixties. Take
that one of the context. All right,

889
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,140
so here's the podcast one.

890
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,420
I'm gonna try to skip through most of
this and just get to the gist of it. Uh,

891
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,830
Bill, I was going to college
in Washington state. Uh,

892
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,590
but I was skipping all of my
classes and getting horrible grades.

893
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:50,400
The school I was going to was
university of Puget sound,

894
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:56,160
easily the worst place I've ever
fucking bed to a Yada, Yada, Yada.

895
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:56,701
So anyways,

896
00:54:56,701 --> 00:54:59,600
there was this kid who was a friend of
mine and at the beginning of the summer,

897
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,920
it was in front of his,
at the beginning of the semester.

898
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:04,290
But I slowly started to realize
that he was a piece of shit,

899
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,050
which culminated when he also

900
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,720
having red hair fucked my then
girlfriend when she was drunk.

901
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,011
That makes sense.

902
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,740
So basically he had this friend who the
this semester he thought he was cool,

903
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,930
he graduated,
realizes he's a piece of shit.

904
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,960
And the culminated when he fucked his
then girlfriend when she was drunk.

905
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,120
There we go. So anyways, uh,

906
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,490
uh, what he said, he went to this,

907
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,460
this was actually one of the better
moments of my time at the college hearing

908
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:37,290
that they had hooked up and finding
her the next day. The next morning,

909
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:40,080
sorry. And she literally
could not look me in the eye,

910
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:44,900
which in hindsight I find extremely funny.
Um,

911
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,500
and she is shame.

912
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:50,550
She shamed way explained that
she thought the other guy was me,

913
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,510
but she was so drunk. She
didn't notice. Needless to say,

914
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:56,430
I was not understanding with her at all.

915
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,930
And maybe out of character choice to
go back to not fucking anyone. Well,

916
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:04,590
good for you man. That's a strong
choice. Hey, go be alone. Good move.

917
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,420
Um, but this of course then my
friendship with that piece of Shit Kid,

918
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:14,250
since he confirmed what I
had been suspecting about
him, about big being a, uh,

919
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:18,090
an asshole. So Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. This.

920
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:20,100
So basically the kid stops going to class.

921
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:24,430
He starts drinking every day and he,
he ends up dropping out.

922
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,290
So, uh, he's cleaning out basically
his room. He goes, so it's my last day.

923
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,430
I'm happy. I'm happier than a crack
head with a hundred dollar bill,

924
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,600
packing my shit up. Then the cock
sucker who fucked my girlfriend,

925
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:42,490
somehow found me in the hall checking
myself out of my room and he comes up to

926
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:47,491
me with this incredible shitty shit eating
grin and he says how much he's gonna

927
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,970
miss me and that thickly sarcastic tone.

928
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And then actually proceeded to pinch my
cheek like your grandmother used to when

929
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:58,270
you were six.

930
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,180
I'm sure you know the feeling of shaking
with rage, being unable to do anything,

931
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,710
being unable to do anything.

932
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,550
Assaulting a kid in a liberal arts school
with security guards right in front of

933
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,230
me would get me arrested.

934
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,150
But of course I still felt like the
world's biggest gaping pussy for not doing

935
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:20,740
anything at all. Something had to be done
about this. And here comes the revenge,

936
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:24,930
ladies and gentlemen.
Okay. I decided, said,

937
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,190
I like that kid from the ranch story.

938
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:30,070
Last week I decided to fuck with his car.

939
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:36,010
Jesus Christ. Dude. You know,
that's, that's really not,

940
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:41,020
that's not the man. That's not the, the,
uh, that's not the John Wayne moved there.

941
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,090
You know,
you should have,

942
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:46,120
you could have always gone back
when the security wasn't there.

943
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:49,200
And then just started, just fucking
smashed him in the face. I don't know.

944
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,120
So anyways,
he decides to fuck with his car.

945
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,240
Dude, you're reminding
me of that. That uh,

946
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,160
that checked in fast times at Ridgemont
high. That's what, what's what women do?

947
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:07,690
They write dick or a prick on
the side of your car, whatever.

948
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,830
What am I going to do?
I'm going to stop judging.

949
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,610
I'll just read the rest of the story.
So we had decided to fuck with his car.

950
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:16,090
He had a nice Jeddah and I knew
where he parked it every night.

951
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:21,091
So I got a friend to be my lookout as
much as a scumbag as I am for fucking with

952
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,470
someone else's car. All
right, leave the, admitted it.

953
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:27,160
This could not have gone any
better. Miraculously, there was,

954
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:30,670
there was this perfect gap in the security
patrols giving me just enough time to

955
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:35,671
key every panel on his car and slash
all four tires until I was back on the

956
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:40,450
sidewalk with my friend. Immediately after
finishing a security guard, showed up,

957
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:43,150
bill old people started doing
their early morning walk to Cetera,

958
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:45,700
and I got the fuck out of there.
Within an hour,

959
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:49,240
I caught a bus to Seattle and commerce
started working almost immediately.

960
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,580
Only an hour in front of
my friend's apartment.

961
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,570
An hour later in front of my friend's
apartment, I started feeling awful.

962
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,980
I went from feeling totally fine
to having a, a hallucinatory fever.

963
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,040
Uh, I lay in my friend's bed for
an entire day until around four.

964
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,200
Apparently that jackass discovered what
I did to his car and called my phone

965
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:11,290
over and over from a
number from his number,

966
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,900
then from all my friends' phones,
et Cetera.

967
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,450
I don't remember much
of this conversation,

968
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:20,540
but I do know I was trying
to be a tough guy. Uh,

969
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,390
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. So the kid kept calling

970
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,340
for months and months. Eventually I
stopped answering his calls, but he,

971
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:32,190
he kept calling, dude,
you fucked with a psycho.

972
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,340
You know, when he came up and pinched
your cheek like that, and it said,

973
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:38,360
how much did you do?
Realize how,

974
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:40,910
what a sadistic fucking
maniac you would dealing with.

975
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:45,020
It's probably good you didn't fucking
punch him cause he probably would've came

976
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:48,020
at you like Hannibal Lecter and fitting
the Chunky a cheek right out of your

977
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:50,210
face.
But anyways,

978
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:55,040
he said he even called me on Christmas
almost a month later when he would call

979
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:59,900
it these times
always on available blah blah blah.

980
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,440
Oh this is a good party.
I'd answer.

981
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:06,130
And he'd start making heavy
breathing noises after awhile.

982
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,860
Like those telephone perverts
women were afraid of in the 1960s

983
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,580
a story has a happy ending though.
Uh, at one of those hipsters bar,

984
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,350
a sort of gothic coffee shop.

985
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,400
Actually I managed to hook up with a girl
that was probably out of my league by

986
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:26,840
playing off his constant cycle of phone
calls as though there were other chicks

987
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:30,700
trying to get with me.
I Dunno when it does that.

988
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:33,710
It sounds like the number one thing.
Well it's like with revenge. I'm sorry,

989
01:00:33,711 --> 01:00:34,880
like that was really choppy,

990
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,190
but I swear to God the kid
wrote me like a manifesto.

991
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:40,540
I was really trying and I don't have time
to edit these fucking things, but uh,

992
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,910
that seems to be people's
number one a way of

993
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,640
taking revenge on somebody.
You know,

994
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,590
you got to get out there and uh,
fuck with their car.

995
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,300
I guess that what's makes it Ben,
right? Revenge has to be sneaky.

996
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,680
She, wait a minute, we've got
two guys fucking with a car.

997
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:09,070
Then we had another guy who took
his girlfriend to Disneyland,

998
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:12,290
his ex girlfriend who cheated on him.
It did horrific things to her.

999
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,820
You know what he's about revenge.
It has to be sneaky.

1000
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,940
Cause even that chick thought she was
going to Disneyland to ride on the tea

1001
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:26,040
cups and to get back with this guy and
he was actually taking her down there to,

1002
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:30,630
to make a porno. Uh, do you know something
that's, that's what it is about revenge.

1003
01:01:30,631 --> 01:01:33,030
I can't deal with,
I can't deal with the dishonesty of it.

1004
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:38,010
There's just something that just makes
you feel like you just feel dirty.

1005
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,340
You know
the fuck up somebody's car.

1006
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:45,600
You should do it right in front
of them as you look at them.

1007
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:49,680
With some of maniacal look on your face.
I mean that would really,

1008
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,980
you know when that get them,
cause then you'd be like, wow,

1009
01:01:52,981 --> 01:01:57,180
this guy knows I fucked him
up if he fucked with my car
and not only is he doing

1010
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,270
in front of me, he made sure he called
out my name. So I saw him doing it.

1011
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,613
You know what I mean?

1012
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:04,903
Got It.

1013
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,340
You know their minds,
me on what time?

1014
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:11,341
I saw this crazy white dude on the subway
and he was rapping some song and that

1015
01:02:11,471 --> 01:02:15,760
had the n word in it and there was like
10 black people on the train. Okay.

1016
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,430
And he's dropping the n
bomb every five seconds.

1017
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,000
I'm a pretty easy Edward Sam,
something,

1018
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,060
some crazy and we're doing the
best of can and then he go, right.

1019
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:28,270
Woo.

1020
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,260
You just kept doing it over and over

1021
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,980
out of his fucking mind.

1022
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,210
But why is health all
the downtown's checks?

1023
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,440
Back in the day when I lived
on the upper east side,

1024
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,590
he kept saying it over and over again.
It was like, you know, it was a subway.

1025
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:45,620
It was like 10 15 black dudes on
the train who was a white dude.

1026
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:49,310
He's dropping the Edward. Every white
person knows if you fucking do that,

1027
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:52,610
if it's instantaneous ass kicking.

1028
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,490
But I think that that's what saved him.

1029
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,680
It's because he was so overtly doing it.
All the black people looked at him.

1030
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:01,330
We're like,

1031
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:05,540
this guy knows we're going to kick the
fuck out of him yet he's still doing it.

1032
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:10,490
So then you just do the quick math.
Oh he's fucking crazy.

1033
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,470
He's crazy.
Okay,

1034
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,460
I'm going to fight this guy and he's
going to bite me and I'm going to get

1035
01:03:16,461 --> 01:03:19,050
hepatitis. So that's the, uh,

1036
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,000
I know what the fuck point I'm trying
to make that that's how you get out of,

1037
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:24,710
I guess got nugget and your advocate.

1038
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,980
Cause if you can truly convince
people that you're fucking crazy,

1039
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,130
like people just, they don't,
they don't mess with you.

1040
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,100
So that's what you should have done.
They didn't,

1041
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,150
you want to cheat his
fucking car in front of them.

1042
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:40,610
They just have a maniacal look at
your face. And every other sentence,

1043
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:41,444
just scream out,

1044
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,820
ooh.
And

1045
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,100
they leave you alone. Then you have
to dealt, dealt with the phone calls.

1046
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,210
Then again, you wouldn't have hooked
up with the chicken, the coffee shop.

1047
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,660
I don't know. Let's get to the podcast
questions. Shall We? I get a phone.

1048
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,690
I get fucking, I get a cold here. Okay.

1049
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:57,390
I'll make an excuse as to that last two
minutes. That didn't even make sense.

1050
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,620
All right, podcast
question number one. Well,

1051
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,650
he talked about wanting to have a kid now,
now that you're getting older,

1052
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:09,651
I'm just curious to know if you would
want him or her to hear your podcasts.

1053
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,900
Considering you condone
things like revenge.

1054
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:17,100
I love how people don't listen to me.
I don't condone revenge.

1055
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,660
I've said that on every podcast,

1056
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:23,220
but I do find the is interesting and I
will comment and laughed at the shift

1057
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:26,700
that you did.
I don't condone what Scarface did,

1058
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:30,960
but I can enjoy him shooting up people
in the end of the movie, you know?

1059
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,880
Anyway, so he, but anyways, the way this
guy heard it maybe have maybe, you know,

1060
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,600
maybe I wasn't clear about
what I was saying. So anyways,

1061
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,320
the way he heard it is basically I
couldn't, don't things like prevention.

1062
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:43,651
He said,

1063
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:48,651
I he busting a nut on your x face to make
her feel like a whore for cheating on

1064
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,340
you.
I'm not criticizing you.

1065
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,900
I'm sincerely interested in knowing
if having a child will change your

1066
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:58,170
perception on things because
as I closed it on 40,

1067
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,120
I'm feeling the same way,

1068
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,950
wanting to finally have a kid and it
makes me consider if I should adjust my

1069
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:09,951
moral compass beforehand because I would
want my son or daughter to have me as a

1070
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:15,660
decent role model. Your situation is a
little more precarious in the your future.

1071
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:19,960
10 year old son could find an old
copy of bill burrs greatest hits.

1072
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:21,341
And here I was,

1073
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:24,880
father thinks that come and a girl's
hair is the best prescription for

1074
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:27,610
heartbreak. Keep up the good work. Ah,

1075
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:32,800
all right Michael, this is how
I view this type of shit. Um,

1076
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,240
for me to actually think about anything
that I'm saying on this podcast about

1077
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:44,080
actually having a child that I don't
even have is the quickest way of making

1078
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:48,340
these podcasts horrifically. Unfunny. Um,

1079
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:50,950
um,
I actually,

1080
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:56,010
I have major problems with parents
and how once they have kids,

1081
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:01,840
they all of a sudden start acting like
they're not the fucking frat boy date

1082
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:05,680
rape is that they used to be.
And not only do they act that way,

1083
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:09,010
they want everyone else
to behave that way too,

1084
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,800
because they knocked up the check
that they're with and it's like, dude,

1085
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:15,400
I didn't knock up my curl. Okay. I'm
still having a good fucking time.

1086
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,250
You know what I mean? So if
my, you know what, why don't,

1087
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:20,890
why don't I do the rest of this
spot, this, this moment right now,

1088
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:25,510
like my future 10 year old son is actually
listening to the archives. Hey son,

1089
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,700
what's going on?
It's your dad.

1090
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:32,230
I hope I didn't fuck up the first
10 years of your life. Listen son,

1091
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:37,150
if you're taking anything that I say
on these podcasts remotely, seriously,

1092
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:42,151
I've completely failed as a parent and
I want you to go outside and fall on a

1093
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:46,150
fucking lawn dark cause I'm going to start
over again and I'm gonna make another

1094
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:50,320
kid and uh, I'm going to teach them
to learn how to fucking take a joke.

1095
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,030
I don't know.
You know what?

1096
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,860
I got halfway through that
and just got fucking creepy.

1097
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:58,600
I just told him my future kid to kill
himself with a toy that has been banned.

1098
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:02,290
Um, no, to be honest with
you, you know, I never,

1099
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:06,310
I never think about what you're asking me.
Do I swear to God?

1100
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:09,400
Is the formula for not becoming funny?
You know,

1101
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,230
that's what comedians
do is they get older,

1102
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:16,231
they have kids and all of a sudden they
stopped cursing on stage and they stay,

1103
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,360
want to be a role model and uh,

1104
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,600
that's when shit just starts
going down hill and you know,

1105
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:29,430
you want to start doing family movies,
you know,

1106
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:32,620
and I'm not doing that.
Okay. I'm a comedian.

1107
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:35,680
Nothing I say should be taken seriously.
And if you take it seriously,

1108
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,250
that's not my problem.
Even if you are on my kid,

1109
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,750
I'm be honest with my kid.
You know what I mean?

1110
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:45,310
Don't people like trying to shelter their
kid and tell him that there's a Santa

1111
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:49,840
clause and everything like that.
And you know, I dunno about that.

1112
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:54,550
Like if somebody does something really
weird and then my kids like why did

1113
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:57,580
somebody, why did that person do
that? I'd be like, you know what son?

1114
01:07:57,581 --> 01:08:02,550
Cause most people are, you know, I
know it's a harsh reality and uh,

1115
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,430
enjoy your coloring years sun
cause it's only going to get worse.

1116
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,610
I'm going to get worse. All
right. Uh, listening to,

1117
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,010
uh, okay. Bill listening to
be newly discovered podcast.

1118
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,160
You, Oh, this is the guy. You
know what, this guy, I'm going to,

1119
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:25,550
I'm going to say this guy for this,
this right here. Not as whole email,

1120
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,010
but this email right here, I think
this guy earns Douche bag of the, uh,

1121
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,310
of the fucking week because he goes,

1122
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:36,311
you should charge for your podcast and
up the production value or just leave

1123
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:37,154
them as they are.

1124
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:41,270
Just don't keep mentioning that they're
free like other podcasts is due.

1125
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,420
It's a bit Douchey when you do that.
You know what?

1126
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:49,360
Why don't you go fuck yourself? How
about you do that? Does that Douchey?

1127
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,350
If I tell you that you fucking cunt,

1128
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,230
they'll tell me what to do in
this fucking podcast is free.

1129
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:55,610
I don't need to do this.

1130
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:59,810
Shift going to tell me how the fuck
I'm supposed to do these. All right?

1131
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:04,310
So go fuck yourself on your
first paragraph. But because
I'm such a sweetheart,

1132
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,350
I'll read the rest of it. The
rest of it. You don't bug me.

1133
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,650
You're a Douche in your
first paragraph. Uh, Bill.

1134
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:13,100
So with the video call you to come and
I kind of assume you are a drummer like

1135
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:17,210
me and with the headphone comment
drummer headphones gotta be right.

1136
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:22,220
Uh Oh gotta be right. So if you are a
drummer and listen through headphones,

1137
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,510
listen to Steve, Steve, oh seven days.

1138
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,420
Then in parentheses it says, uh,
staying field of gold though they did,

1139
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,250
they did a cover of that.
Yeah.

1140
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,110
I don't know if you guys will
listen to the podcasts, but that's,

1141
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,420
I'm kind of into,
I've been starting to buy records,

1142
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:44,890
started buying them again and find like
some concept albums and that's, you know,

1143
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:49,790
those all those great old albums.
So just great. Somebody sent,

1144
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,280
somebody wrote something on the
Internet where they would just,

1145
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,090
they were bitching about music today
and they said something to the effect of

1146
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:57,770
how,
you know,

1147
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,220
how bummed they worked because people
today don't want to hear good music.

1148
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:05,390
I just think that's such a hilarious
comments. People today. Yeah.

1149
01:10:05,391 --> 01:10:08,630
They don't want to hear good music. Oh
yeah, that's, that's exactly what it is.

1150
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:13,430
It has nothing to do with the deregulation
of media in the early 1980s which

1151
01:10:13,431 --> 01:10:17,660
allowed fucking five guys to buy all
the fucking radio stations and to run

1152
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:19,400
everyone exactly like the other one.

1153
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:22,220
Thus limiting the amount of
music that can get on the radio.

1154
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:26,660
That's not what it is. It's that people
then they don't want to hear the music.

1155
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,800
Is that good music? You shut that
off, Mr. I don't want to hear that.

1156
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,690
I want to hear some awful, I don't
want to hear good music. You know,

1157
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:36,081
it's funny,

1158
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,990
there's the cleaning ladies on the
outside of the door and she thinks I can't

1159
01:10:38,991 --> 01:10:41,270
hear. And I know she's
listening to me ranting it here,

1160
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:45,680
debating whether or not to come in
here enough. I know you're out there.

1161
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,560
Um,
don't just freaked around.

1162
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,190
And it kind of freaked me out too,

1163
01:10:51,191 --> 01:10:55,100
cause I realized that technically I
really am not talking to anybody. Um,

1164
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,250
what was I talking about?
Oh yeah, the music.

1165
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:00,920
I think there's plenty of good
music out there. You just hit,

1166
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:02,060
you get assessed to find it.

1167
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:05,660
It's on the Internet now and
possibly on satellite radio.

1168
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,400
And if you don't have satellite radio,

1169
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,280
that's one of the most
underrated things ever. Uh,

1170
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:16,510
it's fucking incredible. And I'm, I'm
getting there putting my car because,

1171
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,970
uh, I've rented a few cars recently and
they had satellite ready radio in it and

1172
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:25,170
that's where the good music is.
That's where the funny radio shows are.

1173
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,700
That's where it's at when it comes to
radio. Man, it's fucking great. And, uh,

1174
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:34,290
and people curse on the radio,
which I enjoy.

1175
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,550
And if I had a 10 year old son,

1176
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,560
I let I let them listen to those words
because I always heard him from the day I

1177
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:42,720
was walking around.
I heard them and look at me.

1178
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:46,010
I turned out fine and I
did two stop laughing.

1179
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:51,000
I did pay my fucking taxes. I'm
not hurting anybody. I'm anyways.

1180
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:54,150
Overrated. Underrated, uh, overrated.

1181
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,960
This guy says sonic youth
dot, dot, dot. Really?

1182
01:11:59,100 --> 01:11:59,940
You know what?
I don't know.

1183
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:04,941
Why are they the ones who are saying
a runaway train about the kids who run

1184
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:06,540
away?
Run away.

1185
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,390
[inaudible] code back fillet

1186
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:18,090
something Yak. A Paul Simon. Dot Dot. Dot.

1187
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:21,510
I want to shove an African drum
up his ass. Is he black now?

1188
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:28,050
Okay. Listened to any Paul Simon album
in the late eighties, early nineties.

1189
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:30,690
Do you ever think he was just trying to
spend as an artist and he was working

1190
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:35,570
with different musicians and the
went outside of America? You know,

1191
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:39,450
it's not like he went out there with
the Fubu fucking track suit on when he

1192
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:41,400
played with them. Notice I said, Fubu,

1193
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:45,570
staying in size with the early nineties
was Booboo, wasn't it? It was at midnight.

1194
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,450
You know, Jesus Christ. Who did he black.

1195
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:55,800
Now he's standing next to a black guy.
He's still wearing those wrangler jeans.

1196
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:59,450
It was awful. Hair plugs, uh,

1197
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,950
BB King and the other
guy says is overrated.

1198
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,890
He's been milking the legend
status for so long. He can't eat.

1199
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,300
He can't even play a chord.
C You two's rattle and hum dude,

1200
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:14,070
I got to agree with you on
that one. Bb King, I think.

1201
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:18,980
Uh, yeah, I think he might be a little
overrated. The guy can't play a chord.

1202
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:23,490
A, he does play nicely,
but if you've noticed,

1203
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:25,230
there's not a lot of black
people going up to see him.

1204
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,470
I think it's a bunch of white
people who think he's good.

1205
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:36,290
That was one of the most ignorant fucking
things all over say a that really made

1206
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:39,900
me laugh. You know, and that guy who
sent me the email, I didn't mean that.

1207
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:44,220
So in the future where my 10 year
old son hears it, I, you know,

1208
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:48,840
he's going to know Jesus Christ.
Why would you put that in my fucking head?

1209
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:53,220
I never think shit like that.
That's how you know,

1210
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,360
if you think about ramifications,
you're never going to be funny. Hey,

1211
01:13:57,361 --> 01:14:00,510
what if I say this?
Won't that hurt someone in the crowd?

1212
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:05,720
And then the moment to set it is gone
and it's over five bad shows tonight.

1213
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,220
I'm going to fucking blame
you. Hey, like that. Alright.

1214
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,830
Underrated the May field four miles.
Kennedy.

1215
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,180
I have no idea who that is. I'm going
to look that up. And Roy Orbison,

1216
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,170
he's one of those guys who was overrated.
Underrated.

1217
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:24,160
I think he's underrated with the
average listener. And he's overrated.

1218
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,390
When you just talk about
him, about his, uh,

1219
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,910
seven octave voice and he,
I dunno,

1220
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,140
he really has an amazing
range with his voice,

1221
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:38,200
but I don't like the sound of it.

1222
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:43,300
Is that like sac religious?
What are some of the songs he thinks?

1223
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:45,483
Pretty woman.

1224
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,590
Ooh.

1225
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:54,863
Ooh.

1226
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:59,690
Kill yourself. He goes like a
lesbian. All right. Underrated. Uh,

1227
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,870
the lightness of college chicks.
Um,

1228
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,830
I don't care. I'll figure the Roy
Orbison, he died out of nowhere, man.

1229
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:10,080
Like I just had a heart attack.
That's what I, those guys,

1230
01:15:10,081 --> 01:15:12,600
when he dies of a heart attack, you really
look at his face and it's like, yeah,

1231
01:15:12,601 --> 01:15:16,290
I can see the heart attack. He
had blue cheese, double chin,

1232
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:19,920
underrated.
The sluttiness of college chicks.

1233
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,320
I don't care where you went to college,
if you lived,

1234
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:26,100
if you lived away at school and
weren't getting laid once a week,

1235
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:30,180
something must be wrong with your Dick.
This is over exaggerating a bit.

1236
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:31,830
That's one of my favorite expressions.

1237
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:36,090
I think I've ever read over exaggerating.

1238
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:39,570
I'm trying to do the math on what
the fuck that means. So if you said,

1239
01:15:39,571 --> 01:15:43,110
if you lived away at school and we're
getting laid at least once a week,

1240
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,320
if you weren't getting
laid at least once a week,

1241
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:50,340
something must be wrong with your Dick.
But that statement is, is over exaggerated

1242
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:55,050
over it.
So does that mean you're not exaggerating?

1243
01:15:57,150 --> 01:16:01,440
Does that mean to get laid one and a
half times a week and tag someone finger?

1244
01:16:01,441 --> 01:16:04,140
Bless someone else? I really
don't do sex jokes. I really that,

1245
01:16:04,141 --> 01:16:08,850
that makes me uncomfortable. Uh, but this
is over exaggerating a bit, but I still,

1246
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:12,390
it is ridiculous.
I went to a small Catholic college,

1247
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:17,150
but you would know about the stories I
got from my dorm room. A couple bears,

1248
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,890
some can't even read this.

1249
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,840
Do you guys even guys like against using
the space bar? A couple of beers, some

1250
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:30,870
dim dorm room lighting and slow jams
playlist off your laptop and you were in

1251
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:34,650
business most of the time. It didn't
even matter if your roommates were there.

1252
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:39,120
I want to have my roommate wake up to
this bitch sitting on my face riding a

1253
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:42,540
unicycle. All right, we're going to
stop there. Okay, I got it. Dude.

1254
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:43,980
You're getting laid.
Jesus Christ.

1255
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,450
You know what? That's actually
true. I never lived at college,

1256
01:16:51,451 --> 01:16:55,680
but I definitely hooked up with college
girls and I actually hooked up with the

1257
01:16:55,681 --> 01:16:58,860
girl in the top bunk and
they're in a roommate.

1258
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,160
Not only was in the
bottom bunk but was awake.

1259
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,860
You haven't tried to fuck respectively
versus the respective kind of way.

1260
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,850
It doesn't really work.
Uh,

1261
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:14,000
especially when you use a word you
can't even pronounce respectively.

1262
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:17,540
Does that even does that even
a word. All right. Overrated.

1263
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,560
Adding why to the end of guys' names,

1264
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:26,180
unless you're playing stick ball in the
school yard or your grandma calls to

1265
01:17:26,181 --> 01:17:27,530
wish you a happy birthday.

1266
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:31,970
If you're over the age of 18 year old
man and should not be referred to as Joey

1267
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:36,971
or daddy or any other bullshit name ending
and why I'm hoping you would want to

1268
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:41,540
punch. The first guy walks up and says,
hey Billy, what's up? It's bullshit.

1269
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:44,960
You're a man. Should go buy a man's name.
You know what? That's exactly right.

1270
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:47,510
I actually,
when I first game game into this business,

1271
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:52,070
I went by Bill Burr and I thought it was
too short and too difficult to say so

1272
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,480
for like five years I went by Billy bur.

1273
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,130
Then even though it flowed
better with my last name,

1274
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:02,480
anytime anybody called me that it just,
it didn't feel right.

1275
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:06,350
It was just like a,
unless the guy was some like New Jersey,

1276
01:18:06,351 --> 01:18:09,230
they have a way of making it sound all
right in New York guys. But it's just,

1277
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,390
I just felt like a little kid,

1278
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:14,180
like I should have been sitting there
with my brown sack lunch and after,

1279
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,800
I don't know how Billy crystal does it,

1280
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:19,490
so I would have to agree with
you on that one. All right.

1281
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,110
I think that's it. I think
that's it for the podcast. Uh,

1282
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:26,690
I want to thank everyone
for listening this week.

1283
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:31,880
It's a little bit on the short side,
but, um, I don't know. It's weird.

1284
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:35,480
I'm up in San Francisco and I got a gig
tonight and before I even do the Gig,

1285
01:18:35,481 --> 01:18:40,180
I want to thank everybody for coming
out on a Monday night. I know. It's, uh,

1286
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,760
you know, it's a work night for you guys,
you working hard and that type of shit.

1287
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,820
So, uh, listen to this
before we come up to my show,

1288
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:51,680
I'm going to try out this new chunk and
I'm probably going to bomb, but, uh,

1289
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,210
definitely going to give
you your money's worth.

1290
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:54,800
I really appreciate
everybody who showed up

1291
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:59,870
or who's gonna show up or if this
is the next day who has showed up?

1292
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,500
Jesus Christ. They'll get to the point
and a next week I'm going to be in the,

1293
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:07,580
not this upcoming weekend, the following
weekend, last weekend in March,

1294
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:10,980
I'm going to be at the uh,
uh,

1295
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,550
the house of comedy in East Saint Louis.

1296
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:19,300
All the information's on a
billboard.com and anything else?

1297
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:24,890
Oh, and I'm going to be on
the opie and Anthony Show. Um,

1298
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,640
when I got, I got to Atlantic city
date covenant. What is the fucking day?

1299
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:33,270
Hold on one second. I got to
figure this out. I need a calendar.

1300
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,580
God dammit.
Hang on a second.

1301
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:38,960
He knows podcast cancer's going
pretty smooth up until this point.

1302
01:19:38,961 --> 01:19:42,950
This is just garbage time. You can hang
up right now. You don't listen to this.

1303
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:47,330
All right. It's the Trump marina
gig is on April 4th. All right,

1304
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:50,300
so that's the Saturday.
So Friday the third,

1305
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:55,580
second first, the first, second and
third at least. I'm going to be going,

1306
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,840
I'm going to be on the
opiate Anthony show.

1307
01:19:56,841 --> 01:20:00,950
I'm going back into New York and I'm
going to visit my, my good friends,

1308
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,640

And I'm really excited to get back there.
Um,

1311
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,370
it's been number one thing that
I miss about living in New York.

1312
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:15,470
I fucking love doing that show. And, um,

1313
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,520
it is on XM satellite radio because
satellite radio was the shit XM two o two.

1314
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,050
And, uh, we'll be doing the taping,

1315
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:27,940

1316
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:32,460
uh, and that is it. I think that's it.

theater in Chicago,

Alright. Right. And that is it.

You guys all have yourself a good week

America saying

1322
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:50,240
no to the marrow and the North
American Union and microchip.

1323
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,533

[inaudible].
