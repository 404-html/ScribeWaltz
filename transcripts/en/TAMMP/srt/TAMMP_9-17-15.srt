1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,310
Yes.
Hey,

2
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:05,880
what's going on is bill bar and
it's the a Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,730
Monday morning podcast
just before Friday. It. Ah,

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,200
just checking in on you.
Lovely.

5
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:25,030
Nia in the background. What's going
on? Oh, are you? How's your week going?

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,860
Oh, freckles made it. Oh,
freckles made. It is 72 days.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,620
I didn't drink 72 days.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,050
It just became a part of me life and
the fuck can check in dead. It was over.

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,670
I went to the apartment, had
40 drinks. Uh, yes I did.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,610
I had been boozing. Uh, I might actually
be legally drunk right now. I just had a,

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,770
just had a beer. Um, what,

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
oh you said shout out. I thought
you said shut up. Look to,

13
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:58,420
if you're going to be on the podcast,
be on the podcast.

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,490
Don't be on in the background.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,240
You know what kills me is
you saw me setting up my
fucking mixer and you sitting

16
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:09,520
there in the background and it's
just like, why the fuck you know,

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,690
why would you just keep waiting?
Where the hell's the other microphone?

18
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:18,210
Go get the other microphone. It's
in the drawer over there. Um,

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,920
anyways, while she does that bullshit. Uh,

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,750
let's address some of the top news
stories of the week, shall we?

21
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,550
I don't watch the news, so I don't
know what's going on internationally,

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,640
but I do know this,

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,830
the buffalo bills a talking all
kinds of shit. You know what I mean?

24
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,330
Talking, oh, we're gonna do
this and we're going to do that.

25
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:47,830
And a wonderful grammatic sentences like,
don't nobody liked the patriots.

26
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,050
Um, you know, the usual
shit, and this is the thing,

27
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,390
they have a good enough defense.
They'll beat us once this year,

28
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:59,140
probably going to split with them and
they're going to talk all kinds of crap

29
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,970
and fucking rex. Ryan's going to wear a
wig and smell somebody's feet and Yada,

30
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,810
Yada, fucking Yada, the whole goddamn
thing. And at the end of the fucking day,

31
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,200
the bills aren't going to win the
Superbowl. So let me ask you this.

32
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,610
You miserable constantly. She's putting
on the fucking wind. Think sock there.

33
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,450
You got an auction. You're hearing.
All right. Just hang on a second.

34
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,490
I've got to get through this.
So let me ask you this.

35
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:26,320
You miserable cunts out in western
New York, who at the end of the day,

36
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,510
if you just beat the Patriots won,
let's say you fucking take the whole,

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,330
you wind bolt, which you're not
going to do, but anything can happen.

38
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:37,780
Let's just say you do that, you know,
and then you don't win the Superbowl.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,760
What was all the fucking talk about?
Huh? You know what the deal is?

40
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,810
If you give Rex Ryan of fucking defend,

41
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:48,810
this is what I loved when Rex Ryan had
a defense with the jets and he had a gay

42
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,160
manager, quarterback. He talked
to all this shit, Yada Yad,

43
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:53,630
I'm going to win the fucking Superbowl.

44
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,630
Blahblahblahblahblah even
beat the Patriots at home
and the playoffs kicked our

45
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:00,610
ass if remember correctly.
Right.

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,820
Then all of a sudden all those players
left and then Rex Ryan didn't talk shit

47
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,150
anymore and they were sitting there going,
yeah,

48
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,580
I think rex has learned his lesson.
You know, he's a little older,

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,850
a little more mature. Well blue, blue,
blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, and now,

50
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,183
no,
he wasn't.

51
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,460
He kept his fucking mouth shut cause
he didn't have the team to do it.

52
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:23,990
So now all of a sudden he's got a defense
again and look at them whey the fuck

53
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:28,130
out in Western fucking New York.
Buffalo,

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,210
Buffalo, one of those one
professional sports towns.

55
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,780
You only got one fucking team.
It don't even bring up the savers.

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,050
You fucking assholes. You never even
been to a Stanley Cup final hall.

57
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,470
That's right. You're dead.
After further review,

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,270
the goal counts.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,280
Why am I doing this to you guys?
I actually like Buffalo.

60
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,840
I really enjoy that town. I don't know
what the fucking problem is out there.

61
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:58,200
Maybe if I lived there every day and I
was out there with a bunch of miserable

62
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:01,230
cons that we're sick of buffalo wings
and there was nothing else to out to eat

63
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:05,700
there other than some Nachos
or some salads. I have no idea.

64
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:09,180
I don't know what your fucking
problem is. Hey, people are buffalo.

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,640
Why don't you fucking grow up? All
right. We're in the same division.

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,380
We're playing each other two times a
year and for the last fucking time. Okay.

67
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:22,620
I know you don't understand this cause
your team's never won a Superbowl.

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,610
If you win a game in September,
it doesn't mean shit.

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,900
So there's really no reason to be
sitting here talking shit and all that.

70
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,120
All right,
so I love it that you're doing it.

71
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:38,040
I love that rex is doing it and the
fan base is going to take on Rex Ryan's

72
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:42,270
personality. You know what I mean?
I actually think if I had to guess,

73
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,740
if there was going to be any,

74
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,190
yeah.

75
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,170
Head coach and the professional league.

76
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,130
Okay.

77
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,270
To go from being rex to be an a,

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,220
what's a woman's name
begins with an r Rashida.

79
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,490
What's a white woman's name near a white
woman's individuals are Rachel to go

80
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:08,690
from Rec Black Rachel's too. Well, I mean,
yeah, you can name a white baby Rachel.

81
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,670
Nobody freaks out. They're
like, oh, I get it. Yeah.

82
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,450
Nobody would freak out if you
named a black baby. Rachel,

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,550
What is wrong with you saying? Can I
ask a question though? Is this one,

84
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,830
what it means to be a sports fan is
just to antagonize other sports fans who

85
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:25,110
aren't a fan of your particular
team that you support.

86
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,220
It's just like nonstop antagonizing.
Yeah.

87
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,460
In the words of John Rambo,
they drew first blood.

88
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,960
They drew first blood.
Okay.

89
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,620
I wasn't talking 80 showed
them a compliment and buffalo
the whole fucking year

90
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,220
cause I got a nice thing. Amazing.
I think rex Ryan's support

91
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,130
poking at and the Vermont,

92
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,520
the reminding of how they didn't go
to the Stanley Cup or if they did,

93
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,630
they didn't win. Does that
kind of needling? Antagonizing?

94
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,480
Yeah,
it's,

95
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,480
it's just like the real housewives
with a dash left less like continents.

96
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,510
You know, you, you guys instead Cardenas

97
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,390
and the sports fandom. No. Yeah,
but we don't go like a, you know,

98
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,990
that's why you had an abortion and
you're fucking babies got three thumbs.

99
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,480
That of shit that people
say to the players are men.

100
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,330
And we would watch that 60 minutes
thing and it was all about how like,

101
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,420
but you know there's a certain generation
that feels like they can't take their

102
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,390
kids to ball games anymore
because the amount of lag,

103
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:21,530
just vitriol and hatred coming from
the scan. That wasn't just a story.

104
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,100
So then they told us the story. So
it wasn't, it wasn't a real thing.

105
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,590
It wasn't a thing that happens where
people are up there and they're like,

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,360
that's why you know Bob,

107
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,990
like they're just saying all
this horrible personal shit.

108
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,960
They're screaming it at players.
No, this is what it was,

109
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,420
was that was the point
they wanted to prove.

110
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:42,320
So they went out and got footage to prove
it out to eat. They think it's bad now.

111
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,650
Dude, it was fucking animals when I
was growing up, when I was growing up,

112
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:48,240
he would stab still and fucking

113
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,580
at dodger stadium a few
years ago did not go well.

114
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,450
Look what happened on Sally Jessy.
Raphael.

115
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:58,910
Did one fucking guests kill
another guests? I mean,

116
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,320
you're going to have those moments.

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,520
You're talking about Jenny
Jones and Jenny 30 years ago,

118
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,870
but it happened talking about stuff
that is happening currently today. Okay.

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,200
And then that happened at the Dodger's
stadium. That was three years ago.

120
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,090
That's not currently today.

121
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,870
I feel like it's pretty current versus
something that happened on like, Hey,

122
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,970
two home games a fucking year.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why can't you over 10 years is almost
a thousand fucking home game meant that

124
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,170
people like there are a certain,

125
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,440
I'm not saying all Hashtag
not all sports fans,

126
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,250
I'm just saying there's not a certain
section of sports fans that will yell the

127
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:41,960
most inappropriate, disgusting,
horrible things at the players.

128
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,850
Philly's pretty bad. Philly's pretty
bad. But generally speaking non yeah,

129
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,230
you go to games and they had like,

130
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:52,280
people like they won't let you go to
your fucking seat while the balls in play

131
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:56,330
and you have to stand there while some
old lady holds up a sign that says not

132
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:00,870
yet. And then finally turns around and
says, okay, now that you can't go out the,

133
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,610
uh, the Roland Garros and the other, um,

134
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,310
had a task that snooty shit,
that's it. Like Games now,

135
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,400
unless you go to like an old stadium,
like the old stadium,

136
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:14,330
Connie has like the old guard, but there's
not a lot of old stadiums left. Like A,

137
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,930
I will say this like fans on the west
coast or fucking lunatics like out in

138
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,260
California, like, I don't
like going to games. Uh,

139
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,120
you're afraid you're going to get
stabbed in the parking lot? No,

140
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,980
I just feel like I'm just not
literally get stabbed. It's just,

141
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:29,360
it's not a fun environment.

142
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,540
Like I used to wear my red sox shit to
a Yankee stadium before we won the world

143
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:36,380
series and I got a ton of shit. But
the, once they saw that I, you know,

144
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,480
I was good natured about it or
whatever, and then they'd be like, Hey,

145
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:41,150
what's up man? How long you in the city?
Boy, he lived down here at Blah Blah.

146
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,590
They were cool. But out in California
at that turn never happens.

147
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,450
It's just, you're, you're wearing
the other team's stuff and fuck you.

148
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:54,380
You're a bitch. Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. And it's
just nonstop, nonstop, nonstop.

149
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:57,620
And it's like, you know, even if you
were a buddy of mine, Jason [inaudible],

150
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,150
Jason ally had worn Indians Jersey
to a Dodgers game one time and um,

151
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,960
the doctors now when this guy was,
you know,

152
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,620
take that fucking thing out of the hall
is shit. So I don't understand that.

153
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,221
Like what?
Yeah,

154
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:13,221
what is that about that fuck that that
like I hate you because you are a fan of

155
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,870
another team.
Like I automatically hate you.

156
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,320
It's like they're taking
that competitiveness that's
obviously it's supposed to

157
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:20,480
be on the field,
right.

158
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,310
Drives a whole game and the whole business
and they're like internalizing it and

159
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,350
it's the male version of real housewives,
you know,

160
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,560
I don't understand who
actually says the same thing.

161
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:35,760
She actually feels like that's our
sort of version of sports and I always

162
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:38,910
counter but women like sports as well,

163
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,700
so I don't really feel like it's the
girl version of sports because women like

164
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,970
sports and play sports.
Can I tell you something?

165
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,770
Finding a woman that likes sports is
like, it's a, it's a diamond in the rough.

166
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:52,320
Like when you find like that's
a big thing with guys don't add.

167
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:57,050
She's into sports. She fucking loves them.
I mean that's like unbelievable. Okay.

168
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,510
Okay. No, I mean, okay.
I mean your first okay.

169
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,350
Wasn't like that I Merced. Okay. It
was like, so I just stay. You Go.

170
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,960
That's what you see are first.
Okay. Was in your point is,

171
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,070
and then you tried to be like, oh, okay.
That first. Okay. Was how you felt.

172
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,660
It's just funny to me that that's like,

173
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,050
that's like a thing as she likes sports.
Yeah.

174
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,440
And she's into the sheet that's like it.

175
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:26,970
You'd be like Eddie and he likes going
to Brunch. I would never say that.

176
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:31,890
That would never be
a reality TV.

177
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,460
Yeah. It's still not a thing that I
would like need to check off a list.

178
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,020
Well isn't that convenient and be
excited about and he loves the real

179
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:41,700
housewives.
Well that's a big thing.

180
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,580
Some of our biggest arguments have been
the bullshit fucking horrific moronic TV

181
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:52,480
that you watch. Reality TV was
that you had in my life. Mike.

182
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,620
The understand amplification
of sound. Oh No, I'm sorry.

183
00:10:55,621 --> 00:11:00,060
I haven't been like on the stage
for the past like 25 years. So no,

184
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,400
I guess I don't understand
how microphones work.

185
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,160
Well I guess you don't cause you keep
fucking taking, you had away from it.

186
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,690
I don't know what you had to attack me
and my career for me saying this is like

187
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,890
your thousandth guest spot.

188
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,810
How many times you're going to be
like I just moved away when I do it.

189
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,790
It's for comedic effect.
I just feel like you're crying

190
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,880
or you're trying to
measure it is I have to,

191
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,760
I am the sexiest mentorship I've ever had.
No,

192
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,010
I'm crying. I have to be like the
guy who records it in the guy,

193
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:33,720
the sound guy at the same time.

194
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:38,460
So you rarely wearing a lot of hats really
wearing a lot of hats on this podcast

195
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:42,240
that you're doing in your underwear? Yup.
Not In my underwear were regular old. No.

196
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:46,830
You've got white shorts on when I just
realized that there's ventilation and the

197
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,610
inner thigh and the Crotch area.
Look at this all the way across.

198
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,990
These are tennis shorts.

199
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,620
So you got to some air and that.
That's right.

200
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,440
You gotta make sure your
balls are breathing while
you're trying to win a grand

201
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:04,370
slam.
All

202
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,090
right. You're done. I guess done
shitting on me. You can't fuck with me.

203
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,560
Yes, I go ahead. Yeah, the week I had,
I don't give a fuck what you say to me.

204
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,430
You really feel like you're a design
like this whole other level. Now what?

205
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,730
You know what you kind of,
I don't know.

206
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,630
But you are though because violin
like a make a wish kid. That was a,

207
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,320
that was a once in a lifetime
experience you had. Which one? Oh Jesus.

208
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:33,610
See this is where you
start becoming a news.

209
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,720
You're mad at me cause I
had a great fucking week.

210
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,110
Are you mad at me that I moved away from
the mic and like the perfect way just

211
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:43,750
now? No, I'm not. I though it was actually
great though. But it was great though.

212
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,290
Great. Fucking weak. Yes.

213
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,870
When are you talking about you tell
the people about your week. Huh?

214
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,800
If they haven't heard already.
Cause it's all over the news, honey.

215
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,480
And I love how you resent it on
some level. You know what I resent?

216
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:02,040
I have a whole time in making the decision
to go because I was tired and I had

217
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,630
to pack. I was, I, I'm, I'm the

218
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,020
maybe or the whole fucking song.
All right,

219
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:11,610
here's two things that happened
this week. One, um, Thursday night,

220
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,000
a week ago,
uh,

221
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,270
Queens of the Stone Age was
getting ready for a tour.

222
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,130
So they were doing like a tuneup show.
You know,

223
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:23,670
those secrets shows you always hear
about like, oh my God, you know,

224
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,870
Queens of the stone age prince just
played in front of 40 people down in a

225
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:30,870
coffee house. You know,
you didn't hear about it

226
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,710
and I never hear about it. I
never hear about, I'm like, Whoa,

227
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,340
I could have got you in dude. You know,
you don't follow him on fucking Instagram.

228
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:40,710
Like what up?

229
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,300
Somehow I don't even know how people
find out about those fucking things.

230
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't know how either

231
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,890
people who are really into like one
particular thing like prince and they're

232
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:53,550
following his every move, they're like
googling him all the time. They just

233
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,280
super secret fucking like whenever there's
like a band that could sell out like

234
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:03,090
a fucking stadium and then they, they're
going to go play some waffle house.

235
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,270
There's always like,
like the hipsters always Dixie somehow.

236
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:09,030
They know and I never fucking
know and I'm just like,

237
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:10,740
you gotta you fucking saw them.
Like yeah,

238
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:14,310
that guy was standing like fucking
two feet away. It was awesome.

239
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,960
They did like two hours and in the end
they gave everybody a hug and shit.

240
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,850
He's just like,
I have some thing.

241
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,640
Hipster is being hip to all this shit.
What's going on? What's going on? Right.

242
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,810
And a lot of this shit that hip those,
I'm pretty nice,

243
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:31,260
like a lot of the food that
they like. Anyways, so, um,

244
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,840
I got to open for them on that show,
which was the most insane thing ever.

245
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:38,940
And you know, I play drums.
I'm a total drum geek,

246
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:42,980
so I got to stand at the side of the
stage and watch John Theodore [inaudible]

247
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,880
John, yeah. All of those. It was,
they were fucking unbelievable.

248
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,100
They were incredible. And Josh
Homie is, he's just the coolest guy.

249
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,320
He's the coolest guy.
All I know. All I know,

250
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:59,380
this is when I watched that
band play. Yeah, I was,

251
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,680
I was immediately thinking I have to
get better as a comedian like that.

252
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,311
I was just like,

253
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:06,070
I don't do what I do at the level of
these guys are doing what they're doing.

254
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,170
They'll fucking unreal.
I never saw them live before.

255
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,270
I heard a couple of their songs,
but like they are,

256
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,150
they're an incredible band though.
I wanted to see them forever.

257
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,380
Tremendous musicians.

258
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,030
I wanted to see them forever and like
most huge bands when they play and they

259
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:23,290
come through La, it's on a Saturday
night when you're working. Yeah.

260
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,430
And I'm usually out of town and like
that's the story in my let dude,

261

I'm like, I'd love to go. Uh,

262
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,630

Um, the road manager know who has it.

265

his name now. Bill at the elbow,

266
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:51,130
another bill for us. Jesus
Christ. He said, what did he
say that you were playing?

267
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,030
Oh yeah.

268
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,760
Fake name for a comedy club.

269
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,980
It wasn't, it wasn't
the Yak, Yak, Yak, Yak.

Yes. It's said you
playing Yakety Yak. Yeah.

271
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,950
Which was hilarious to me
because that wasn't even funny.

272
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,260
But just meant like your
update just running your Yap.

so you open and Queens of the Stone Age

275
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:20,810
because it, Dean del Rey, Dean del
Rey, Dean del Rey who got into, uh,

goes, you know what's funny? He goes, uh,

281
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,270
I was just thinking right before I got
here because it was nobody on the road

282
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,110
going on. Yeah. What a
beautiful day to ride.

283
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,380
And he was going over Marin's house
to have lunch or something. Oh.

284
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:53,050
And this person came on the
highway on the lefthand side.

285
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:57,430
I think it just went across four lanes.
Thank God he's okay though. Oh yeah, no,

286
00:16:57,431 --> 00:17:01,990
he almost lost if he said if it was a
foot like it clipped his back tire then he

287
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:04,630
high sided incentive flying.
But um,

288
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,010
but shout out to Dean del Right for him
that up through the, and I got to know,

289
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:13,470
I got to know John and then John asked me,
yeah.

290
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,970
He said, hey, he goes, because
we're doing this show. He goes,

291
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:20,500
would you want to come down and do it
now opening for bands is death is fucking

292
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:21,560
death usually death.

293
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:25,900
So that can be really bad because it's
just like they tried it a little bit,

294
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:30,750
but you handled it well. Yeah. That
one lady. So I was like, you know,

295
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,930
you know the, the smart part of me was
going like, no, no, no. Don't do it.

296
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:38,560
Don't do it. It's going to
suck. Right. Something else
was like, no, it was amazing.

297
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:40,450
Yeah. So that was third. But at one lady,

298
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,510
one lady who was drunk and everybody
around her hated her. She was going, uh,

299
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,623
she's gone.

300
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,180
Oh my God.
The around her were so pissed off.

301
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,590
They were so annoyed.

302
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:57,950
And like everyone there was like this
Collette collective embarrassment you feel

303
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,990
when someone is just absolutely unabashed,

304
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,580
nakedly making an ass of them.

305
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,080
This is all like embarrassed
and then you feel rage

306
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,810
is all I did was I trashed her, you
know, Blah Blah Blah. Oh my God,

307
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:14,170
somebody's going to marry that the usual
way that she's going to be a nightmare.

308
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,303
But then

309
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,060
it's like someone's going to marry.
But then the panic clock was turned on.

310
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,620
I didn't show it on my face,

311
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,790
but internally I'm like, all right,
right now that woman is annoying people.

312
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,420
But in about three more jokes,
they're going to start to see your point.

313
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,250
I need to leave second to be like,
yeah, you know what? She's right.

314
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,990
We didn't come down in a sea of freckled
albino content, get off the stage.

315
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,390
So I did like

316
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,750
one more little thing and then
I got out of there and uh,

317
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,980
then I was able to sit down and
watch the show and it was, oh man,

318
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,070
James is Christ Jesus Christ.

319
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,810
It was really fun. Yeah.
I'll tell you a right now,

320
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:56,440
if you never see Queens of the stone
age live view, you are an asshole.

321
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,200
Even if you don't think that you
like the Stone Age, just go do,

322
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,440
are not into that kind of music
or whatever the fuck you saying.

323
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,400
Please go see them.

324
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,750
Like even music that you feel like
you don't like when you see it live.

325
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:12,430
I feel like it turns like if I went to
a country, I don't, generally speaking,

326
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,790
I'm not into country. Cause when I
went to lady Gaga I was still like, no,

327
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,390
this thanks not because
that's you and you being you.

328
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,590
She came out in a fucking horse.
That horse,

329
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,160
that poor horse horse was so
beautiful and horses on the road,

330
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,120
road horse rode a horse, you know,
it's getting shitty oats and stuff.

331
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,670
Okay,
so that was Thursday and then on Saturday,

332
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,880
so Saturday. All right. So,
all right, this is, this is,

333
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,110
this is more rock and roll.
I know.

334
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:46,510
And I have no business because no matter
the end of the day I looked like Ron

335
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,430
Howard, so like, uh, so, uh, on, um,

336
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,870
I don't know, it's some
part of the week. This is,

337
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:55,620
this is actually an f is for family promo.

338
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,760
The guy who was one of the guys who was
doing the music for the F is for family

339
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:04,300
cartoon is Dave Cushner who played
in velvet revolver. All right.

340
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,630
So those guys have been
doing some sick ass job.

341
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,600
Just someone else we saw live
in la at the Wiltern. Yeah.

342
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,950
It's not the of it revolving this.
We did. They were great. Yes,

343
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,750
we did with like one of the gods,

344
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,610
the last performances with
them. Yes. So anyways, so uh,

345
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,570
he was doing, um, you know, he's
been doing the music for it.

346
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,180
So anyways,
he puts together a lot of benefits.

347
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:30,910
So he's putting together this benefit
thing for, uh, for some public schools.

348
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,430
Something. I didn't know what
it was, but he goes, hey,

349
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,890
you know all these guys are
going to be down here playing

350
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,820
nice opportunity for you to
plug the charity. Yeah, yeah.

351
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,630
Remember that's the thing too. I
never, that's another thing too.

352
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,720
You play all these charities and I'm
like, oh what was the charity for you? I,

353
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,050
yeah, no, but you do because
it's Richie cause you

354
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,940
hear is for charity and you'd do
it because you're a good person,

355
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,760
you have a good heart, but you damned
if you notice bad shit in my life,

356
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:59,720
I'm going to balance out my Karma.
So all I do is right before I go on stage,

357
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,760
I always look on my goal,
what is this for again?

358
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,540
And then they tell me what it's for and
then I just make sure I steer clear.

359
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,350
I don't go out there and make a reference
to that and then I just go out and do

360
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,240
the other 99% of my act.

361
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,680
You're like a pop star that doesn't know
what city she's in and see they what

362
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,243
Cleveland.

363
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,320
I don't know what disease it's for,

364
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:26,390
but I know it's a disease
and we want to stop it.

365
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,160
Isn't it enough that I showed up
for free? You? I can fucking shit.

366
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:32,930
The next thing you know,
you're gonna tell him this fall.

367
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:36,440
You don't know what charity it's right.
I never know.

368
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,350
Some of the funniest
things I've ever seen,

369
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,620
some of the funniest ones I've ever seen
is when commerce go on stage and they

370
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:45,230
don't know what the benefits for and
they're killing, killing, killing.

371
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:48,480
And then they start doing a bit
that it has to do, you know,

372
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,690
and then everyone gets all quiet like,
yeah,

373
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,100
they somehow make an autism reference
or cancer or they do something and then

374
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,690
the crowd totally pulls back.

375
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,960
And the greatest is when this
so early into their career,

376
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:02,870
they don't understand why.
And they're like, dude, what
the fuck she guys problem?

377
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,930
Jesus Christ.
What did

378
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,140
everybody, I'm an autistic baby here.
Like they don't even know what's going on.

379
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,890
And the whole crowd, the magic.
And then the person like,

380
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,970
like directing us in the
back, like cut off the mic,

381
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,050
cut up to Mike.
Right.

382
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,880
What's funny is when you get a
seasoned comic and they do it,

383
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:25,270
you see the look on their face
and there'll be like, oh fuck.

384
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,240
And then they'll literally ask, is
this a benefit for cancer? Sorry,

385
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,940
I didn't know a fucking sorry. I'm the
worst person ever. So anyways, Mike leg,

386
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,390
knees charity. Huh? Mike leg, knees.

387
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,070
We weren't Mike leg knees.
Are we talking about how you were Oh,

388
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,180
lag niece works at wild west. Oh,
sorry. Hey Mike, you got to shout out.

389
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,300
So anyways, so of course he goes, hey man,

390
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:54,130
all these fucking guys are going to be
there. Um, blah blah blah, blah, blah.

391
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:56,410
You know, he knows that I play drums
and then I'm amount then you know,

392
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:59,710
I'm a fucking nerd. I'm a nerd.
I'm a drum NERC, right? So he goes,

393
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,260
you want to come down and watch these
guys play? And I'm like, yeah, fuck yeah.

394
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,020
You know, I'm working in the comedy
store later. Let's, let's fucking do it.

395
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,750
So like two days before the event, he
texted me and he goes, uh, he goes, hey,

396
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:15,460
do what you want to sit in
and play a song. And of course
I want to, but I'm like,

397
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,730
I'm not going to be that fucking asshole
where it's just like you got all these

398
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,180
studio level and professional guys.
I'm not going to be the fucking guy.

399
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,950
Come in there, boom, boom,
boom. That fucking guy,

400
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,390
just embarrassing.
And them just fucking tolerating me.

401
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,410
It's like I'm not fucking doing that shit.
Um, so then he writes back, goes bad,

402
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:38,650
they don't give a fuck. They don't give
a shit company if you want to play,

403
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,180
go ahead and fucking play.
He goes,

404
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:42,640
but I'm not going to be that guy who
pressures you or whatever. So I say, fine.

405
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,690
So once again,

406
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,140
I'm driving around and it's like two
days before the thing and I was like,

407
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,790
Oh bill,
stop being such a fucking bitch.

408
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,800
Most of this is the reason
why you're saying no,

409
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,580
it's not out of respect for
the professional musicians
just because you'd be in

410
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:59,480
a fucking pussy right now. So I
said, so I texted him, right? I was,

411
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,570
I'm not gonna lie to you. I was scared.
I would have been scared too. So I said,

412
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,800
I said, I text him, I said,
fuck it, let's do it. So he
goes, he writes back, Oh shit,

413
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:11,090
right? And he goes, all right, learn
whole lot of love. See on Saturday,

414
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,860
and it's Thursday,
whole lot of love.

415
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,000
I've never been able to play
that fucking song. Right?

416
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:18,710
And the fucking bottom starts,
all the fills on like three goes over,

417
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:21,830
the bar comes back. I mean, I, I
can't, and I'm trying. So I start,

418
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,990
I go to the drum room and I'm
fucking woodshed in his shit, right?

419
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,480
And I cannot, he's got this and get,
get that ended up [inaudible] De de,

420
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:34,420
De, De, De, De, De, de, De, de.
But boom, boom, boom. Right?
And it's for aunt out one.

421
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,910
I could never fucking, I can't, I can't
fucking do it. I can't fucking do it.

422
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,480
So finally I got, I ripped off two of
his fills and I was like, all right,

423
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,900
I'm playing these two fills 60
fucking times during this song.

424
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,630
And I'm gonna hope nobody notices.
So fortunately,

425
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:51,320
like a day before the event,
uh,

426
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,010
cushion or text me and he goes, hey man,
we're just going to do highway to hell.

427
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,590
And I was like, thank God, that's so
much easier. It's slower to man for this.

428
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,060
It's more like the, I don't think
there's really any fills in it.

429
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,580
There's a couple of places where you stop
and then it starts again or whatever.

430
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,770
Okay. I'm really quickly in
Phil's is when the, it's like
that did, do, do, do, do, do,

431
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:12,250
do like talking about, okay.
Yeah. Got It. So, uh, so anyways,

432
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:16,520
so I fucking, you know, dust
off that fucking song. Right.

433
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,310
And,
uh,

434
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:23,150
that's a song I used to play with two
of my brothers back in the day when, uh,

435
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,960
I was in my parents' basement.
Right. And, uh, we still blessed,

436
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:29,930
one of the songs that we used to butcher
was highway to hell. So I'm like, oh,

437
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,580
that's Kinda cool.
We're going to fucking play this song.

438
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,530
So I show up to the event and um,
he's got all the like, you know,

439
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,310
it's like it's some fucking
tennis club or some shit.

440
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,640
It's like some real rich
people kind of thing. And uh,

441
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,700
and the kind of people
that need shanti, no, no.

442
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,100
They were doing it for public schools
and they weren't doing it for themselves.

443
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,550
American greed, they have charities
for themselves. So anyways,

444
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:56,210
so I show up and like,

445
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,920
like the band's playing and
everybody there is a fucking monster.

446
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,750
So as I'm meeting the people,

447
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:07,250
I'm then like trying to fucking
Google in this shit, you know?

448
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,020
And it was a, the people that was
Cushner Frankie Perez who sang in, uh,

449
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,030
he plays in this apocalyptic IA or
something like that. This, this,

450
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:18,310
Finland's psycho fucking string band.
Amazing voice sang in slashes ban.

451
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,720
I think it makes it one Finnish and
Swedish and like they're really into like,

452
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,600
they don't fuck around all day. Fucking
love that fucking death metal music.

453
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,750
[inaudible] I think it's called. They
don't fuck around. They're really, really,

454
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,190
they really embrace the idea,
I think of like death as a part of life.

455
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:37,670
And happens and just rock out to, and I
don't know, I'm this because they sit,

456
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:42,530
I'm like ma'am, 23 hours of darkness,
six months of the fucking year,

457
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,250
negative, you know, 20
degree weather. Yeah.

458
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:50,210
So then as a cold, dark hell
yeah, Christian, he's there.

459
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,200
The Bass player from a Jane's addiction
since 2002, he's fucking playing ankle.

460
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,560
Uh, and then the drummer, I
hope we say his name right Todd,

461
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,360
while watching, I got it
written down here. He, he,

462
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,990
he like does like blue man
group and all these Vegas.

463
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:08,940
She like big studio Guy Monster,
which was playing,

464
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,850
I was playing all this Keith
Moon Shit wasn't staying.

465
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:12,990
And then this other studio guy,

466
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:17,810
Andrew Wyatt and these guys are fucking
slaying it. Is that true though?

467
00:27:17,811 --> 00:27:20,400
You know, we were saying the guy
that does, um, blue man group,

468
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,420
those kinds of musicians who do play
like a variety of different gigs at like,

469
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,130
they really can't play everything right.

470
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:29,160
And that's why they get hired all the
time because they're versatile and they

471
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:31,800
can just kind of, I think they think
there's like, you're the bad guy.

472
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,630
Or then you're like the studio guy.

473
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,390
When the studio guys like you don't know
who you're going to be playing with.

474
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:39,930
So you have to, you don't just
know your band's catalog is like,

475
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,940
these guys can play all these different
styles they have there. They're all,

476
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,730
whether you're in a band or whatever, you
get to that fucking level. You're obese.

477
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,770
So these guys, so I show up and these
guys, you know the fucking around,

478
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,740
then they start playing and I was
like, oh my God, Oh my God. Oh my God.

479
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:55,140
And then I start feeling like, you know,
and I was like, what did I say Yes to?

480
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,570
This could have just been hearing
the jewelry it, right. So anyways,

481
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:02,310
so then we go up, they go, hey
bill, you want to, you know, they,

482
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,840
they blow through all these fucking songs.
The whole lot of love.

483
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,880
The fuck in a won't get fooled again.
All of this shit fucking destroy it.

484
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,230
And then I go up,

485
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,830
this is just during the sound check and
there's like nobody there if this tennis

486
00:28:15,831 --> 00:28:18,280
club right. And I keep thinking of
good fellas, you know, when he went,

487
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,870
he met the fuck he met Karen and you know,

488
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,460
and he gives him that
little fucking half ass,

489
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:27,140
that jerk off handshake foreshadowing that
he wasn't going to get along with. Um,

490
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,761
so anyways,

491
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:33,480
so I went up and we play
this fucking song and uh,

492
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,950
and it went good. It sounded good. And
they're like, man, that sounds all right.

493
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:39,230
They go, you want to play it again?
I was like, Nah, I'm cool. I'm cool.

494
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:44,060
And like high shelves at nine
come back then. So, you know,

495
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,940
I had heard that slash and duff,

496
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,260
we'll maybe going to be there, right?
But I didn't, you didn't know, you know,

497
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:54,860
whatever, whatever. So anyways,
long story fucking short, I, uh,

498
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,030
I come back at nine o'clock and now all
of a sudden there's a bunch of people

499
00:28:59,031 --> 00:28:59,570
there,

500
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,570
so the nerves are even higher and now
these guys aren't doing sound check.

501
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:06,860
Now they're not fucking around.
Now they're doing the show.

502
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,210
And the show starts and it just
fucking raping, killing it,

503
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,800
fucking killing it.
And the songs that just whipping by.

504
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:18,220
And with each song that's going by,
like I see on the setlist,

505
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,660
they're going to do roadhouse blues
and I know that I'm next. So I'm like,

506
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:24,080
Oh fuck, I'm going to be next out.
Jesus Christ. Why did they say yes this?

507
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:27,470
I'm like Phil, right Phil, right to
four, just two, four. Don't fuck it up.

508
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,170
Just don't look up at anybody and just
plow through it and you'll be done. Right.

509
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,910
So,
um,

510
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,170
it finished roadhouse boot blues and then
I can sort of sneak up on to the band

511
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:38,870
stand there and uh,
you know,

512
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,320
Todd leaves and I sit down
behind the kit as I sit down,

513
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,920
everybody else in the band
just like walked off the stage,

514
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,460
except for Dave and Frankie, the
singer. And I'm sitting here like, dude,

515
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:53,480
what the fuck in Christian goes,
hey, we got a special guests,

516
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:56,690
we've got some special guests on this
one. He goes it towards like, oh,

517
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:59,450
it's already back day goes on drum.
We've got built,

518
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,150
burn it. It was the funniest, the funniest
clap error. Like everyone's just like,

519
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,930
wait, what? Why is it special?

520
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,370
I think my face turned red.
I want her to crawl under the stool.

521
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,820
It was like I got a better round of
applause what I was doing open mikes in

522
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:21,900
front of eight people and they would
just keep it going for this next guy,

523
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,920
Bill Byrd built bar. They
would, it was fucking,

524
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,920
and I'm thinking like, what the fuck's
going on here? And then he goes, yeah,

525
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:33,410
I got a couple other friends are
going to help us out on this one.

526
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:35,450
And then they just fucking
walked out of the crowd.

527
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,510
Slash slash and duff and hours.

528
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,860
Yeah, I'm getting like nervous telling
us right now and they can't fucking stage

529
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,070
it.
Duff's already really tall.

530
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:49,210
So now he looks like nine feet fucking
tall and he shakes my hand. I'm like, hey,

531
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,970
how's it going? And then there's
fucking slash oh my God, I can now,

532
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,870
and this is the best part.
Of course she didn't go to the,

533
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,970
so of course Joe and Frankie turnaround
and that just laughing at this stunned

534
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:05,971
look on my face and I have all of three
seconds I felt to take this in and then

535
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,450
slash just goes Diana.

536
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,800
No, I was like, oh my God,

537
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,530
play this fucking song
with my brothers in, in,

538
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:19,210
in the basement and slash or standard.

539
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,560
One by one brother stood in Duff's
where the other and then cushion I was,

540
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,500
and they're just in Frankie's looking
back at me laughing at me and um,

541
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,000
I didn't remember what had just fucking,
just put my head down and like,

542
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:32,700
what the fuck?

543
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,520
You know? I really wish you guys
could see bill's face right now.

544
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:39,670
Like his eyes are shining.
He has the biggest smile.

545
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,140
Like there's like a glow rating
from it. You like it. This was,

546
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,060
I can tell this is one of the top
experiences. It's over. It's over.

547
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,720
You have like pure joy on
your face. No. Awesome.

548
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,200
I'm done. That's it. I love it. No,

549
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,400
I can't talk. I cannot top that. I
don't give a fuck either. That's a no,

550
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:06,720
that's awesome. I'm happy for you. I
can, I'm so excited that, that, that,

551
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:11,010
that happened. I'm so, I can't even
believe I missed it, but that's okay.

552
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:14,500
Cause that was your moment and your
year memory. So, yeah. All good.

553
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,700
And there's video,
so it does,

554
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,640
we'll live forever.

555
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,700
So this sickest fucking part was
in the end when the bad cuts out,

556
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm on the way Gaga. And
then he's got, you know,

557
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:32,650
Frankie and I'm going dad all the way.
And then there's the end where he goes,

558
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,820
Whoa, whoa. And then there's like this,
the symbol wash starts in this drama,

559
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,960
the guitars.
So I to give the cue,

560
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,490
so when the band cuts out and
I'm going with that all the way,

561
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,820
and then dolphin slash Cushner basically
velvet revolver turns around and looks

562
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:54,740
at me. Dude, I almost fell
off. I almost fell off the bat.

563
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,860
That's amazing. Yeah. I,

564
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,960
I will never be able to believe
that that fucking happened.

565
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,030
I can't fucking believe it.
And I fucking believe it. And,

566
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:15,060
and it's funny cause the
song is like three minutes
long and I, it's weird. Like,

567
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:17,420
I don't remember it.
I remember every fucking second of know.

568
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,410
So thank you to her and Frankie,
cause they basically set it up and uh,

569
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,300
that was, I sent a cushion
or a text, I said, dude,

570
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:31,050
23 years in this business, 47 years
on the point at, there's nothing,

571
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,970
nothing could fucking that. I've never
had a feeling like that ever, ever.

572
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,150
I mean I'd have to go back to make the
first time I ever did standup and I was

573
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:42,780
so fucking psyched that I did it.
But it was different. Yeah. This was,

574
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,100
it was different than,
you know.

575
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,770
No, you're playing in a band with like
your heroes like and like rock gods,

576
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:53,630
rock royalty. That was like
legit rock gods. So yeah,

577
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,410
that's an amazing thing. I
love, I believe I missed it.

578
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,670
You know how much I love slash God no,
but I fucked you over.

579
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:03,660
Cause cause I said cause,
cause yeah,

580
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,470
at one point said, hey, maybe you
could jam with slash in those guys.

581
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:08,570
And I was just like, fuck
yeah, I'd love to do that.

582
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,510
But then when I went to the sound check,
they weren't there and we,

583
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,070
I ran the song with the other guys.

584
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,750
So you were going, I'm feeling
kind of tired and I go and I said,

585
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:18,770
and I have to pack. And I said, yeah, I
don't think it's going to happen. I go,

586
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:22,760
I think I'm going on early.
And then they're going to
close it out. So, you know,

587
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,500
and I remember I said to
you, I'm like, are you sure?

588
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,720
Like it's not annoying that you're like,
not a nut.

589
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:29,540
I'm just going to be in and out of there.
It's fine. It's just for the charity.

590
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:33,530
It'll be cool. It'll be really quick.
I'll go do my other sad, I'll come home.

591
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:36,200
That's it. And uh, go ahead.

592
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,520
There you go. So that fucking happened
and uh, now it's incredible. Yeah.

593
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,200
Over, over. It's over.
It's done. Washed away.

594
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:48,150
Anything I've ever
fucking accomplished ever.

595
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,620
Can we also talk about how earlier today
that you said that you were basically

596
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:55,730
in velvet revolver, kitchen
plan, that moment? Three. Four.

597
00:34:55,731 --> 00:35:00,020
So in that moment and that moment I was,
I took over for Matt,

598
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:01,100
so I'm in my head,

599
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,170
in my head and Frankie took over
lead vocals. I'm, I stand by this.

600
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,650
My ego is completely a check. Hey,
I got to do a, I got to do some, uh,

601
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,520
I got to do some advertising for
this week and uh, then we'll,

602
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,270
we'll play some classic stuff here.
All right. Uh, oh Ba everybody, uh,

603
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,820
hey. Hey. Hey. You like
making great money, right?

604
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,940
Here's a really cool opportunity
I had to share with you dry.

605
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,760
This always starts off like it's a
drug deal. Like, Hey, hey man. Hey,

606
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,780
you like making good money,
right? Come on down the alley.

607
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,560
You got a car and a driver's license
driving with Uber. How old are you?

608
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,770
Uber's that popular smartphone. You don't
fucking, Amazon sent me a fucking email.

609
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,390
Mia. What do you mean?
Say and they might click,

610
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:53,170
they're going to close my
account by October 31st if I,

611
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,010
cause I never filled out the thing
that said I wasn't interacting.

612
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,160
I wasn't trying to interact with
people 13 years of age or lower.

613
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,520
What on my website,
on my website,

614
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:06,490
like I do the Amazon link going to Amazon.

615
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:10,240
If you just click the link and you go
there, it doesn't cost you any money.

616
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:13,450
But Amazon kicks me a little bit of money,
uh,

617
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:18,451
for driving traffic to their site and
I take 10% of that and I throw it to a

618
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,920
wounded warriors, wounded
warriors. Anybody.

619
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:25,030
Cause somebody told me that that was
a little sketchy. Is that sketchy?

620
00:36:25,031 --> 00:36:26,800
I have no idea.
I don't know how to figure it out,

621
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,990
but I found that saint Jude's is good.
Yeah.

622
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,380
Well I don't think we just
signed it with light warriors.

623
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,510
Wounded warriors is sketchy. I don't
know if that, but I, I find like,

624
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,820
I feel like we shouldn't say that.
I feel like won't be boys.

625
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,810
I want to walk up to the wounded guys
and give them the money directly cause I

626
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:45,470
just feel like both the, do you want me
to give him an envelope and the mafia?

627
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,423
Why not?

628
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,470
Sure if you're going to locate all the
wounded warriors and then personal,

629
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:54,000
but I figured like whatever,
I'm going to give these organizations,

630
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:57,110
whatever I give helps one guy.
Why don't I just, well one woman,

631
00:36:57,111 --> 00:37:00,890
why don't I just walk up to that one
person so there's no infrastructure and

632
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,020
I'll pay it.
I'll pay the gas money.

633
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,300
How do you propose that's going to work
now I've got a podcast. I just said it.

634
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,140
Okay, so everyone,
everyone sending emails,

635
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:12,950
he in like and claimed civilian job
and then I'll have like a little,

636
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:15,570
like one of those games shelter if
everybody's name in it and I'll flick up

637
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:19,910
Craig house like a Bingo, pull
it out. And the winner is,

638
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,100
yeah, but they can, all the fucking
money I'm giving goes to you,

639
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,970
but they can't prove that they're
wounded by interacting with them on the

640
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:32,660
Internet. That's why you have wounded
warriors and organizations like that.

641
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,580
Like cause how are you going to know?

642
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,770
Are you going to like do a home visit
and then look around and be like, hmm.

643
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,710
All right.
And then what about your checkbook?

644
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,530
You know, you'd really just took all the
sunshine out of that, didn't you? Sorry.

645
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,350
Anyways, um, so Amazon goes,

646
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,190
you never filled out something that
basically said that your website is not

647
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:53,580
interacting with people
under like 13 years of,

648
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:56,370
I don't know if they listen to the
podcast and it was fucking like me saying

649
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:59,640
content, all this stuff. And they're
like, what about children? Um,

650
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,660
oh, so people who don't like cursing, I
don't know what it is. So now I get it.

651
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:07,740
Not like Amazon. They made
me feel all creepy. Well,

652
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:10,710
why don't you just say that you're not
interacting with 13 year olds? Well,

653
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:14,790
why don't they fucking ask me from the
beginning and then not fucking come at me

654
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:17,310
later? Like he never said that. It's
like, dude, you never fucking asked me.

655
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,310
What do you mean? I thought you
said they did ask. You know,

656
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,150
they just send me a random email out
of nowhere going, you never said this.

657
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:27,120
It's like, dude, you never fucking
ask me. Well did you answer it?

658
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,290
No,
I have until the 31st

659
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,603
fuck you.

660
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,420
I'm talking about them
not asking the question.

661
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,880
And then coming at me like I'm some sort
of fucking Weirdo. You're ticking it.

662
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,770
Oops. It isn't personally. You don't have
somebody on the Internet go, are you?

663
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,850
Are you? Are you not interacting
with 13 aimed at 13 year olds?

664
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:02,020
Yes. Fucking weird, funky way.
Amazon fucking jerk offs. Sorry.

665
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,070
Oh, what are they going to do? Don't,
yeah. What are they going to do?

666
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,900
I don't know the webs.
What are they going to do?

667
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,920
Not Send me boxes of shit that
I don't need. Fucking assholes.

668
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,210
You want to send your packages by drones?
Huh?

669
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,050
Did they really? Yeah. A bunch of toilet
covers flying fish your fucking house

670
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,880
so they could save money so you don't
have to have some guide drive it.

671
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:29,410
You know what? Fuck Amazon and fuck the
fucking link. All right, Uber, everybody.

672
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,500
You are never going to have another
advertiser that's Modsy you again.

673
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,270
You realize that right? I don't do
it because of their, that's true.

674
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,560
He do it for the fans, man. Fun.

675
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,170
If you're dumb enough to fucking advertise
on my podcast just with my reading

676
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:52,090
skills alone, I've already compared the
Uber App to like fucking drug dealers.

677
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,820
I don't give a shit here. I don't
give a shit. I live within my means.

678
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,860
I'm wearing tennis shorts and
then suck it. You're such a rally.

679
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,900
I drive an eight year old rebel bill.

680
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:05,410
I drive an eight year old tennis
stories on the island of Nantucket.

681
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:08,890
Stop telling these maniacs. Where
am sorry. It's one of the rules.

682
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:11,170
You never tell them that you
just, you leave. I'm like,

683
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:15,700
why is he wearing tennis shorts?
Why would he be doing that?

684
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,660
This guy is even weirder than I thought.
I have to keep listening. Once you go, oh,

685
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:22,210
he's on fucking didn't Tuck it in and
they go, oh, now it all makes sense.

686
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,650
Now they're not listening and Uber
loses money. All right. Hey guys,

687
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:28,030
you like making great money,
right?

688
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,560
Here's a really cool
opportunity I evidently had
to share with you driving with

689
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:32,920
Uber.

690
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Uber's that populace smartphone APP
that connects riders with drivers.

691
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,410
I take Uber a bunch.
Did you know that Nia?

692
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,850
I love them by the way. Oh boy. Oh boy.

693
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,120
Nothing I like better.

694
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:52,270
And then getting into a
complete stranger's car that
isn't regulated by any sort

695
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:55,690
of government fucking entity.
Hey Buddy, how are you?

696
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,020
Let's roll the dice again.

697
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,850
Some of them have really interesting
stories as to why they drive with Uber.

698
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,310
Fucking broke,
man,

699
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,130
I don't make enough money at my other
job. Jesus Christ. Is that interesting?

700
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,360
They love being their own boss.
Don't they work for Uber?

701
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,570
They earn great money while
their cars are halfway decent.

702
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,050
They must be invested in, in
real estate. It's easy to start.

703
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,650
This happened because your here,
you just need a car and a license.

704
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,010
Exactly. No other background
check is there. Driving

705
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,610
with Uber got off on a murderer, a
technicality. Hey, welcome to Uber.

706
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,210
Driving with Uber is great for
anyone who needs flexibility.

707
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,600
Parents, this is a really easy way to work
around your family schedule. Students,

708
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:50,990
you can make some extra money between
classes. Doesn't that sound filthy?

709
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,520
Now's the prime time to catch
in with driving with Uber.

710
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,970
You'll thank me for telling
you how to get paid every week.

711
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,470
I could be getting into your car when
you drive with Uber. Call to action.

712
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,030
You got a car and a license. Put
them both to work for you, uh,

713
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,890
for you and start earning serious
life changing money today.

714
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:12,080
Sign up to drive with Uber.

715
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,980
That's drive with U B E r.com.
Drive with uber.com.

716
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,920
All right, blue apron. Uh,
it's okay. You can admit it.

717
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,440
I don't like it. They put you
on the defensive. It's okay.

718
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,150
You can admit it.
What are we talking about here?

719
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,930
The last thing anyone wants to do after
work is wait in line at the grocery

720
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:37,760
store, Schlep home and cook a complicated
meal. I can admit that. Okay, well,

721
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:41,510
evidently it's okay with
blue apron and expensive,

722
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:45,590
unhealthy takeoff takeout
is hardly better. Uh,

723
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,840
that's where this new service,
blue apron comes in.

Each balanced meal is 500 to 700
calories per serving and so tasty.

736
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,900

magazine these days. Yep.

776
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,660
So if you can put them all together,
God dammit.

777
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,130
All it takes is one
brilliant idea like that.

778
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,400
Companies like that and blue apron I
have of those the first time I really

779
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:03,330
listened to that. Advertising all it
all it takes is one brilliant idea.

780
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:06,900
Everybody as opposed to the run of the
mill shit that I think of every day.

781
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,930
Well you think of like 50 things and one
of them will be brilliant, hopefully.

782
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,200
Hopefully. All right, well that's
the podcast. The Thursday afternoon,

783
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:16,320
just before Monday, just checking in on
your podcast. I hope you had a good time,

784
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:21,180
uh, listening this week. I hope you
have a wonderful weekend and I will,

785
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:25,740
uh, talk to you again on Monday.
Here's a wonderful throwback episode,

786
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,760
um, from, uh, some
Monday, a long time ago.

787
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,760
Turn to stone

788
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:54,150
[inaudible].

789
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,660
Now if you're new to my
podcast last week I was saying,

790
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,110
how come miles per gallon
on gas, uh, on cars, sorry,

791
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:21,280
as Ben has basically been
the same since the 70s.

792
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,400
So people were trying to suggest to me
that cars weighed more back in the 70s.

793
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:29,270
And I said, get the fuck Outta here.
Those God damn led back in the day.

794
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:30,020
They had metal

795
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,780
bumpers and full size spares. Get the fuck
Outta here. I remember when we had, uh,

796
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,500
we had like a 72 or 73 Buick
regal to door and it took two,

797
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:40,910
me and one of my brothers,

798
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,740
all of our might to open that fucking
car doors like opened up, God damn

799
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:50,300
like a bank vault.
But two things I forgot to do.

800
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:55,100
One actually look up the stats and to
realize that I was like fucking six years

801
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:57,470
old when I was trying to open it.
You know,

802
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,600
you ever think that shit
when you think it doesn't,

803
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:03,260
it doesn't really snow as much as it
used to, which it probably doesn't.

804
00:48:03,261 --> 00:48:06,770
But as far as like the storm spent by you
like dude back in the day was up to my

805
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:10,880
waist. Yeah. And you were
about three feet tall.

806
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,820
That's why.
That's why,

807
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,050
that's why it seems so
fucking deep because you could
barely look over a coffee

808
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:22,520
table. Um, anyway, so I'll
give you guys that one.

809
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,560
I'll give you guys that one.
Okay.

810
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,110
And I would actually love to be wrong on
this one, but I just don't think I am.

811
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:35,830
Even though I was wrong that the cars
weighed more in the 70s so people show me

812
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:39,920
a bunch of stats cause God knows I'm
not going to look at them all right.

813
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,320
And people,
by the way,

814
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,080
who actually said that I really
sounded like a moron last week.

815
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:50,110
I May I invite you to listen to the
first four years of this podcast and just

816
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:54,980
see the reoccurring theme that that is
okay. I don't read it makes me sleepy.

817
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,530
I stated that before. I don't fucking
read. All right? I go with my gut.

818
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,050
Okay, I'll tell you this right now.
I don't know how to fill a tooth,

819
00:49:06,051 --> 00:49:08,510
but I can go in and look at
a dentist and real and I can,

820
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,080
I can fucking judge that guy.
Whether or not he's gonna he's,

821
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:16,250
he's telling me the truth.
Does that make any sense?

822
00:49:16,251 --> 00:49:19,280
Of course it doesn't go fuck yourself.
I've got a God damn hour to fill here.

823
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,620
This is what,
this is the problem I have,

824
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,760
I have with people who are defending
the oil companies here is basically when

825
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:26,990
you go back to the 70s okay?

826
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:30,590
And you prove to me that cars
did they weigh more now? Okay,

827
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,820
so you're right on that one.

828
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:33,590
Okay.

829
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:38,590
But your logic though is still based in
that the oil companies were telling the

830
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:44,411
truth in 1976 that whatever 35 miles per
gallon was the best that we could do.

831
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:50,450
So you use that as a jump off point to
then prove your point now that that's why

832
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:53,330
cars get the gas mileage that, that, that,

833
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:56,420
that they get today is basically,

834
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,750
I have to make the leap with you that
oil companies are telling the truth,

835
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:06,540
that there's $350 billion
industry. Okay. That,

836
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:10,610
that is
on numerous occasions,

837
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,200
openly got in the way of any
sort of progress. I remember
here out in California,

838
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:16,400
I think it was the late nineties.

839
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:17,940
Yeah,

840
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,170
it might've been 20 years ago.

841
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:22,860
I can't remember what it was before I
moved out here the first time or right

842
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:26,970
after I left.
Did the air quality out here.

843
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,330
So fucking horrific.
It's like,

844
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,550
I know a lot of people still
think it's real smoggy out here.

845
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:34,830
It definitely gets smog,
but it usually just in the summertime,

846
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:39,390
and it's definitely Oh, hazy out
here, but Hays is not fucking smog.

847
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,280
Smog is Brown.

848
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:46,350
You go hiking and you feel a burning
in your fucking chest back in the day,

849
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:50,400
in the late nineties. Okay. You
could see this shit. So anyway,

850
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:52,350
so they put this,
uh,

851
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,950
they put it to the vote for a people to
the people who actually would vote on

852
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:56,784
this shit.

853
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:02,180
And they passed this bill
that said by the year 2000,

854
00:51:03,151 --> 00:51:05,310
whatever,
whatever,

855
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:10,050
25% or 30% of cars had to
run on something other than,

856
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,710
you know, the gas oil get basically
the gas combustion engine.

857
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:18,711
They basically paved the way for the
big three to then basically start making

858
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,080
electric cars.
The fucking thing passed.

859
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:28,610
An oil companies got together with their
lobbyists and they went and they just

860
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:31,860
totally dismantled the whole thing
and the whole thing fucking went away.

861
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:37,370
Okay. Which for all you people out there
who are going to explain capitalism,

862
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:42,510
capitalism to me, I get it. That
is their prerogative to do that.

863
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,590
Why wouldn't they get in the way of that?
So let me ask you this.

864
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,260
You're telling me that they
would get in the way of that,

865
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:53,970
but they wouldn't get in the way of
any sort of progress just with the gas

866
00:51:53,971 --> 00:51:57,120
combustion engine. They wouldn't get in
a way, have any of that type of progress.

867
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:00,840
They seem to not get in the
way of anything else. Safety,

868
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,630
they don't give a shit about. They won't
get in the way of that type of stuff.

869
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,440
Burning it cleaner. They don't give
a fuck about but miles per gallon,

870
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,000
which is their bottom line. Like do
you guys honestly think like today,

871
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:16,530
like what your car gets like that's
honestly the best that science can do that

872
00:52:16,531 --> 00:52:19,950
is we are right up against the fucking
wall. Is that what you're telling me?

873
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,660
You know, considering if they
just even increased it by five,

874
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:28,480
10 miles a gallon per every new car,

875
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:32,020
that they would immediately lose
hundreds of millions of dollars.

876
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:36,070
Why would they do it? Why would they
do? Why would they allow that to happen?

877
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,580
Why wouldn't they get in the way of that?
That's all I'm asking here.

878
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,010
And you know something for all
you fucking assholes out there.

879
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,600
Who called me this? Whack job. Conspiracy
theorists. These are my conspiracies.

880
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,030
Okay.

881
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,950
Bankers are fucking evil.

882
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,370
Yeah.

883
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,900
Well,
companies lie to you.

884
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,350
Yeah.

885
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:00,410
And insurance companies are pieces
of shit. That's basically my three.

886
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,780
And then they have enough money
to basically buy elections.
That's basically yet,

887
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:11,370
okay. Those really aren't
groundbreaking conspiracies, are they?

888
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:13,920
I'm not saying that there's some
guy living in the fucking moon.

889
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,530
I'm not saying I saw a fucking flying
saucer come out of the god Damn Ocean.

890
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:24,830
Had fucking take a piss on somebody
sunbae then, and then, you know, I,

891
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:28,760
I saw Ronald Reagan waving out the
side of it and then it took off.

892
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:32,880
I'm not saying that shit, I
just, I don't buy it. Okay.

893
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:37,590
And I actually got emails from
people. Um, they sent me these,

894
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,040
these, these links. They
sent me this link of this,

895
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:43,210
this fucking kid,

896
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:48,810
14 year old kid with one of his classmates
built this futuristic looking Jetsons

897
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:53,800
car and they got close to 2000
miles per gallon. I'll, I'll,

898
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,880
I'll send you the link to this.

899
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:57,640
You can go on the [inaudible]
podcast and look at this thing. Mm.

900
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,790
The MM podcast.com look at the
picture of this thing. Okay.

901
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:03,610
And once you're done saying,
well, it's not a practical car.

902
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,350
It's not as heavy as the other ones.

903
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:08,140
It would never meet the safety
standards and Yada, Yada, Yada,

904
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:12,430
all that fucking shit.
Do you honestly think that airbags,

905
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,140
navigation systems,

906
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,830
crumple zones and all that?

907
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:23,550
You're honestly going to tell me that
that basically knocks off 1900 miles per

908
00:54:23,591 --> 00:54:24,424
gallon.

909
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,530
Are you really going to fucking sit
there and tell me that you honestly think

910
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,230
that they're not?
Why wouldn't they get in the way of it?

911
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,470
They have the money to get in the way,
in the way of it. And not only that,

912
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:38,160
they're not even part of this
country in a way. They're borderless.

913
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:44,290
They're, they're worldwide.
I don't, I don't know.

914
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:49,360
So I did, I respectfully
apologize for not fucking, uh,

915
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,600
looking up the weight of the car.
I was 100% wrong in that,

916
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:56,830
but I still do not think that I'm
wrong or I'm fucking paranoid.

917
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,030
I had one guy, this guy's fucking
hilarious. This guy was just ripping me,

918
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,490
just saying, this is classic old
man. It's like, dude, I'm 43.

919
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:09,500
Jesus Christ. This guy's going old
man. Like I'm afraid of the world.

920
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:10,840
Yeah.

921
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,610
I'm afraid of the fucking world I have.

922
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:17,820
I at least can sit here and tell you that
I don't believe in all that religious

923
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:23,840
horse shit. Well, if I
was a scared old man,

924
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:26,720
when I be going to church every God
damn week when I'd be doing that stuff,

925
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:31,670
believing in the immaculate conception,
I think you go on the ground people,

926
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,410
I you don't want it.
That's, that's my theory.

927
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:37,400
I think when you died you go in the ground
and then you become a fossil fuel for

928
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:41,750
more people to fucking fight in,
in, in, in a lie about the, the,

929
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,220
do you know, you know what? I might,

930
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:45,500
my actually my Prius and I've
actually thought about doing this.

931
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:49,250
There's people granted it
fucks over your warrant, your,

932
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:50,480
your warranty on your car.

933
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,960
They can actually get a hundred miles per
gallon but bay and basically what they

934
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,730
do is they just, uh, they just fill
the ass end with a bunch of batteries,

935
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,343
you know?

936
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:01,710
Okay.

937
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,930
Which I'm sure those are
great for the environment.

938
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,690
Oh, you know what it is? People, I think
you know what a cup is down to the most.

939
00:56:12,691 --> 00:56:14,910
Why is my fucking throat so dry?
Hang on a second.

940
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,300
Okay.

941
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,550
I think it comes down to the
amount of what we do. We're fucked.

942
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,220
But I just think that there's certain
entities that just have too much fucking

943
00:56:23,221 --> 00:56:24,054
power.

944
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:29,540
I think when you start making $350
billion a year and you're nationwide,

945
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:33,360
at some point, some sort of government
should have some sort of power over you.

946
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,420
And I don't really think
that are ours does. I don't,

947
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,180
I don't think that they have any fucking
pilot. Well, what are they going to do?

948
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,050
They got us by the balls.
The second you start giving them shit,

949
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:49,400
they put their hand on the, on the nozzle,
the spicket go ahead. Keep talking.

950
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,850
We're going to, we'll shut
this fucking thing off. Huh?

951
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,890
You want to pay $9,000 for a cantaloupe
that shut your face for 25 a gallon?

952
00:56:57,381 --> 00:57:02,110
Go Fuck Yourself. Next question.
Yes. This is our Marnie. MMM.

953
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,060
[inaudible]. Alright, plowing ahead here.

954
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,970
I really want you guys to look at this.
Okay?

955
00:57:07,971 --> 00:57:11,900
You guys who actually fucking do research?
Um,

956
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,960
like here's one guy
tells me the 1987 Honda,

957
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,500
CRX got 57 miles on the highway.

958
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,600
Wait was 1800 pounds.

959
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:25,690
The 2011 CRX miles per gallon is 41 on
the highway and it weighs 2,600 pounds.

960
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,930
So I, I see, I see. They're
fucking argument. So right
there it's like, all right,

961
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:36,090
well the car was fucking 800 more pounds,

962
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,910
which is a lot when the first
one only wait 1800 you almost,

963
00:57:38,911 --> 00:57:42,690
you're talking about, was
that 40% boys? 40% more?

964
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,290
Is it getting 40% less
on the gas? No, it isn't.

965
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:48,990
So that's actually a fucking improvement.
I will give you that.

966
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,820
But the jump off point, I'm not
buying it. I'm not buying that.

967
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:58,230
We can only get 50,
25 miles a gallon in 1975 I don't buy it.

968
00:57:58,231 --> 00:58:01,740
I bet they easily could've got 200 at
that point. They're not going to do it,

969
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,220
dude. You talking about the
blue bloods at that point?

970
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:08,250
You're talking about that level
of fucking power. All right.

971
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,790
My apologies to everybody out there
were actually has some sort of science

972
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:15,630
background. Evidently people told
me that that Stan Stanley Mayer,

973
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:19,400
the water power car is
junk science and it's,

974
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:22,920
it's absolutely ridiculous as some would
even suggest that they could do that.

975
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:28,200
Uh, so I lost on that one. So this,
so you'd, so you guys, you guys one,

976
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:31,530
two thirds of the argument here with me.
All right.

977
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,660
So now that you've backed
me into the corner,

978
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,840
I want you to explain to me
why oil companies wouldn't
stand in the way of that

979
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:43,971
technology and w and to fold and why
you believe that what they tell you that

980
00:58:45,241 --> 00:58:47,250
cars get is the best that we can do.

981
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:51,750
Why you believe that we can't
get 60 miles per gallon.

982
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,210
Okay,

983
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:57,680
well, you know there's
dairy steers, air bag and,

984
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:01,460
and other things and
satellites flying around this.

985
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,640
Here comes Santa Claus come samples

986
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,980
put me on the ground.

987
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,763
Oh,
bigger.

988
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,410
Now they cut the lights
down. Skin. Walmart.

989
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,920
All right,
here's one for you.

990
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,790
We're going to bring back a topic despite
the fact that I dropped this topic

991
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:37,791
because people told me that Daniel Tosh
does something like this on tosh 0.0 uh,

992
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:42,530
this person actually asked a great, this
is, I'm bringing back, is it racist,

993
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:46,290
racist, racist. I'm bringing this
topic back. By the way, I worked,

994
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,350
I worked with Daniel
Tosh, uh, on Wednesday,

995
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:52,020
this past week down at the
Wiltern theater for the, uh,

996
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:56,720
the Greg Giraldo benefit and um,
Jesus Christ,

997
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,370
that guy's a fucking beast.

998
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,930
Absolutely fucking hilarious.
Uh,

999
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:06,470
he might've had the set of the night
and then everybody down there was a,

1000
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,920
was a headliner in their own right. And
I want to thank everybody who came down,

1001
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:13,520
but Daniel Tosh was fucking hilarious.
Um,

1002
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,210
I know you guys think that I say some mean
shit and I'm able to get away with it.

1003
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,900
You got to see that guy, man. It's, it's,

1004
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,370
it's every time I see him and he
always has like new jokes and shit.

1005
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,790
You definitely be get a chance.
Definitely check that guy out. And a,

1006
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:28,250
and with that, I evidently I'm going
to do one of the bits from his show.

1007
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,560
Is it racist? All right bill. I love
the podcast consistently hilarious.

1008
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,870
Turn on some friends and brothers tour it.
I really appreciate that.

1009
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:39,380
Anybody who listens to this, please
tell your friends about it. Um, anyways,

1010
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,200
here's my, is it racist thing?
And elderly white neighbor,

1011
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:47,290
a neighbor lady came over and asked my
wife if she wanted this leftover rice,

1012
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,250
obviously from takeout and she said,

1013
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:55,370
maybe you can use it to make
some fried rice or something.

1014
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:59,720
My wife who is Korean,
oh Jesus was cordial,

1015
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:03,380
but later set a kind of pissed her off.
Here's the kicker.

1016
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,300
She did end up making fried rice
out of it. Is it, is this racist?

1017
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,990
Uh, thanks. Um, Oh man,

1018
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:14,790
this is one of these ones that it,
it,

1019
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,140
it's not racist.
It's

1020
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:20,540
okay.

1021
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:24,590
It walks the line of unnecessary.
Slash.

1022
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:25,790
Offensive.

1023
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:27,230
Okay.

1024
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:28,070
You know what I mean?

1025
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,370
Okay.

1026
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:33,510
It's, you know, she answered the question
by actually turning it into fried rice.

1027
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,740
And I gotta be honest with you,
I've never understood the food thing,

1028
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:43,140
why the food thing is racist.
I could see if you saved people a dumb,

1029
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:43,861
you know,

1030
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:47,700
all those classic clan things would they
say certain people aren't fucking human,

1031
01:01:47,701 --> 01:01:51,330
the, you know, fucking your
part, whatever like that.

1032
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:55,500
But the food thing I never
got, I never understood it. Um,

1033
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,370
okay.

1034
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:01,280
I don't get why if you say what
I think is, it's always just,

1035
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,350
just the way you say it.

1036
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,700
I look at French people are
called frogs cause eat frog legs.

1037
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:11,530
The Germans will call the
Krauts Sauerkraut, right?

1038
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,770
There's always like something about
food that people flip out about you.

1039
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:18,400
I gotta tell you it's really fucking
weird to have extra rice and just be like,

1040
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,650
you know what, I the Korean lady
cross the street with like it.

1041
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:26,720
I think that might be an example
of a white person trying to be,

1042
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,920
I'm assuming the person's
white trying to be like, uh,

1043
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:35,660
they think they don't want a good
thing. Like, oh, we have extra rice.

1044
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,180
Let's give it what it,
what about the Korean lady?

1045
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:43,790
Let's show that we know something about
her culture. So I just think it's,

1046
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,730
uh, it's really bizarre. Um,

1047
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,660
but I don't think that they at for it
to be racist, like I always said it,

1048
01:02:50,661 --> 01:02:52,130
it has to be like your intent.

1049
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,970
Like if they did it because they
were trying to be like, here you go,

1050
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:59,330
your receipt and son of a
bitch, then yeah, that that is a

1051
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,060
okay

1052
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,100
then it would be racist. But if they're
just doing the classic, you know,

1053
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,130
white person just not knowing,
you know what I mean?

1054
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,550
Like we have the reputation for doing
shit like that. Like we're trying,

1055
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,480
but we just don't know. And then the
great thing is how other races act.

1056
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:16,970
Like they know everything about
white people, which they don't,

1057
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:20,920
despite how many episodes of family
ties, you know, like I actually saw it,

1058
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,110
there was this website, uh, there
was something, I look it up,

1059
01:03:24,111 --> 01:03:28,370
it's called what white people do
and I believe it was written by, uh,

1060
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:32,240
some black girl and she was basically
making fun of white people. But if you,

1061
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:36,770
if you look at it, she's really
making fun of hipsters in Brooklyn.

1062
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,920
She's making fun of the white
people around her and she's,

1063
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:43,760
she's basically lumping all white
people. Like, this is what they do.

1064
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,020
That is what they do. They're really
into taking a, what did she say?

1065
01:03:48,021 --> 01:03:49,200
What the fuck was it?
Uh,

1066
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:55,720
taking time off to find themselves
or some shit like that. And, uh,

1067
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,960
you know, I dunno, my
friends, we grew up, yeah,

1068
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,550
we didn't take time off to find
ourselves. We were, uh, you know,

1069
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:05,763
we were,
drunks

1070
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:14,380
took time off.
We didn't take time off to find ourselves.

1071
01:04:14,381 --> 01:04:18,610
We flunked out of college. That's what
we did. That was our, or we fucked up.

1072
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,510
We found ourselves in high school by
doing so bad in high school that we didn't

1073
01:04:22,511 --> 01:04:27,100
go to college, you know? Um, anyways,
I ain't, what the fuck I'm doing? Hey,

1074
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:31,170
let's plow ahead. So I wouldn't say it
was racist. I think it's, it's just,

1075
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,550
it's ignorant.
That would just be ignorant.

1076
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,100
They think that they're
doing this great thing.

1077
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:37,960
Okay.

1078
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,020
You know, and their defense would probably
be something equally as ignorant. Like,

1079
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:45,700
well, what, they eat it
all the time. Um, so yeah,

1080
01:04:45,701 --> 01:04:49,120
I wouldn't say that it's racist, but
yeah, people listened to the podcast.

1081
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:50,830
It's probably not a good thing,

1082
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,760
even if you're respecting the fact that
there's people starving around the world.

1083
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:56,410
Um,

1084
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:57,510
okay.

1085
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:02,460
You know, I could see if you're always
bring over extra food now, you know,

1086
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:05,220
something that what's fucked up. What
could we do? You guys can't afford rice.

1087
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,950
The more I'm looking at this,

1088
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:09,970
okay,

1089
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:12,850
who the fuck would do that?
And you're gonna eat my leftover rice.

1090
01:05:12,851 --> 01:05:14,470
Like what do we fucking animals over here?

1091
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,060
Okay.

1092
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,670
But the thing is,
she did it.

1093
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,400
You know what I dunno. I Dunno.
That could go either way.

1094
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:25,620
I think that was one of those ones.
I'd have to be there.

1095
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,660
I'd have to know a little about,
little bit about that.

1096
01:05:27,661 --> 01:05:31,470
The lady across the street and, and I,
I'd have to hear, I was, she said it,

1097
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,000
but I would've given anything to
listen to your wife going like,

1098
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:38,910
you believe those sons of bitches coming
over here, give me this goddamn rice,

1099
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,860
you know, as she's taking out
the fucking, uh, what, how, how,

1100
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:46,350
whatever the fuck you make
the fried rice then hold on.

1101
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,350
Did you laugh when she actually cooked?

1102
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,543
Yeah.

1103
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:07,740
Hold on.

1104
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,400
Yay.
