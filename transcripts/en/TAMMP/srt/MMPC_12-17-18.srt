1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,600
Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's
time for the Monday morning podcast from

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,220
um,
December 17th.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,360
Okay.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
2017 all my God.

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:15,870
Only seven more days
till the fucking baby.

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,560
Jesus comes down the chimney there.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,550
Whatever the fucking story
is, right. What was the story?

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,740
All calm,

9
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:30,741
all ye beard guys into this fucking barn.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,160
Look at this lid.
Obey.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,950
Be she was Nana ever banged.
Oh,

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,130
poor Joseph. What's going
on everybody? How are you?

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,800
How did you enjoy your
weekend? That Jab, a good one.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,710
My patriots lost again.

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,180
I think they're only going to
win 10 or 11 games this year.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,840
Is it time to hit the panic button?
Um,

17
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,623
yeah.

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,030
What are you going to do?
You know,

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,160
we had a great run. We had a great
run. This is a trend. Normally this,

20
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:15,420
this type of play would not,
would not worry me. I, you know,

21
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:16,920
cause I remember when we lost,
you know,

22
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:21,921
Romeo chromal and Charlie Weiss and we
lost Thai law lawyer Malloy and fucking

23
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:27,720
Teddy Bruschi retire and we lost all of
those guys and we built it back up again.

24
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,970
So you know, this time, what do we lose?
We lose, we who'd we lose? We lost a,

25
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:33,751
you know,
Matt,

26
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,220
Patricia left to go coach the fucking
lines running back to wide receivers,

27
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,880
quarterback left tackle all of that
shit and adds up one year. You know,

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,140
two years. That's a lot of people to
lose. But back in the day you'd be like,

29
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,650
all right, you know, all the
draft picks they got for them,

30
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,500
they're going to build this
fucking thing back up again. Right.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,280
Which they always did and they continue
to win and people kept saying the

32
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:00,630
Patriots had done and they kept
proving them wrong. But now,

33
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:05,190
I mean Tom is what, 41? Almost 42 is
that what it is or is he 40, almost 41?

34
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,720
Um,
yeah,

35
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,750
it's like do they have time for one more
champion chip run for ring number six

36
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,840
on precedent. I, by the way,

37
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,050
I'm so fucking sick of every time they
show the fucking steal are still like

38
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:24,070
they got six Superbowls more than
anyone else and they never bring up the

39
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:24,761
packers.
It's,

40
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:29,320
the packers have four and they have like
11 NFL titles that for whatever reason,

41
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,730
they don't count NFL titles.
I've been asking this question

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,430
cause I'm, I'm big on that. All
right. I'm not saying the Steelers,

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,710
not one of the great franchises
or the Super Bowl era. They are,

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,460
but what kind of fucking league is around
since the 1920s in 1930s and doesn't

45
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:51,530
count championships until 1968.

46
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,250
You know, as, as I've stayed
before the Montreal Canadians,

47
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,340
they fucking count championships,

48
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,360
won the Stanley Cup was the size of a
fucking shot glass and the, and you know,

49
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,410
and they beat the fucking Montreal
maroons playing pond hockey.

50
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,660
The fucking Philadelphia Phillies,

51
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:16,400
one of their world series titles
is from the fucking 1880s.

52
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,780
I didn't think they had baseball gloves.

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,570
I don't know what they fuck
they were using as a ball.

54
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,610
Okay.

55
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,443
You know?

56
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,450
Okay.

57
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,200
Probably like a fucking human skull.
It was so god damn long ago. Um,

58
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,830
those championships are all counted.
I don't understand why,

59
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,580
how nice are people in Wisconsin that
they don't speak up and be like, hey,

60
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:41,420
not for nothing. Uh, back when
you could, when NFL titles,

61
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,490
the Pittsburgh Steelers were playing.
So,

62
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,300
okay.

63
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,420
We basically been playing the
same amount of time and uh,

64
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:52,550
as far as I could tell we're,

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,580
we're almost like 10
championships ahead of him.

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,930
Okay.

67
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,380
Why do they always get all the
glory? I have no fucking idea. I do.

68
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,880
I just don't understand
why NFL titles don't count.

69
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:07,160
Why don't I Google that? Why
don't I look it up? By the way,

70
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:10,490
congratulations to the Steelers. Jesus
Christ. That wind was a long time common.

71
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,530
Should've want it fucking last year when
that guy caught the ball and scored a

72
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,350
touchdown and then they said he didn't.

73
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,030
Yeah.

74
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,210
After further review what
she just saw didn't happen.

75
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,800
Replay the down. Alright, there we go.

76
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:30,100
Let's write this out here.
Why

77
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,270
starts with a w bill?

78
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:38,271
Why doesn't the NFL count
and F l champ be an ships?

79
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,950
BOMP bomp bomp.
Bomp dude,

80
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,970
why do people ignore pre
Superbowl championships?

81
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,500
Okay,

82
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,333
here we go.

83
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,373
Okay.

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,840
Or a team's dark ages.

85
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:59,450
I don't know what dark age assessed
to do with any of this stuff. Okay.

86
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:04,130
So this guy goes, I rarely post
on here, but this always irks me.

87
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,550
I'm a fan of the packers,
but I live in the middle of steel,

88
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,860
his country and I get this thrown in my
face all the time that the Steelers have

89
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:10,940
one six Superbowls.

90
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,750
I throw out the fact that the
packers have one 13 championships.

91
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,010
Okay.

92
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,420
With four of them being super bowls.
Yeah. So they have more than twice then.

93
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,780
Okay.

94
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,630
I get all the time saying no,
they don't count in.

95
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,090
This bothers the crap out of
me. Yeah, it absolutely does.

96
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:31,650
You basically saying that like all the
champions that came before Superbowl

97
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,950
champions, they're not champions even
though they won a championship. Um,

98
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,260
as a person who was a history major
and who loves the history of the sport,

99
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,740
especially for some Steeler fans,
um,

100
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,490
that NFL history doesn't start at 1970.

101
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,400
It actually store the first two super
bowls were called NFL title Games and AFL

102
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,650
AFL championship games or something.
And then later they were,

103
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,250
they were renamed Superbowl champions.
Um,

104
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,290
Superbowl won a Superbowl too,
I should say.

105
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:06,990
But the first one that actually was
called a Superbowl as it was happening was

106
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:11,680
Superbowl three. Uh, anyways, they
ignore or the third AFL NFL title.

107
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,900
Jesus felt we get it.
And he was,

108
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:17,800
they ignore the fact that the Steelers
were terrible until 1970 also known as

109
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:20,090
the dark ages of the Steelers.
Uh,

110
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,040
I think they have actually terrible
until about 72 or 73 till they had that

111
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,520
incredible draft. I acknowledged
most of the packers dark ages,

112
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,450
the 50s and posts,
Lombardi and home grim. Uh,

113
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,870
I know it's not all Steeler fans,
but it still bothers the crap out of me.

114
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:38,260
The question I ponder is in the title.
All right.

115
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,850
All right.
So this guy writes,

116
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,880
it's kind of funky since most NBA fans
will count championships before the 76

117
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,210
and be a merger. Oh Dude, you can go big
and go back further than that. With a,

118
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:59,211
with the Los Angeles Lakers count like
a fucking Ba championship has an NBA

119
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:01,910
championship.

120
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,300
It was the BA in the NBL and those two
things merge to form the NBA and like the

121
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,290
Minneapolis Lakers, I think one
the first like four NBA titles,

122
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:16,910
but the year before that they want to a
Ba championship and for some reason that

123
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,040
is counted as an NBA championship.

124
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,870
The Lakers won an NBA title
before the NBA existed.

125
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,220
Explain how that works anyways.
Um,

126
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,530
this isn't going to be a good name.

127
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,710
I wanted something to somebody
who fucking knows something

128
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,920
green bay as much more historical.

129
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:41,210
I think if someone wants to argue that
the league is totally different now than

130
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,700
the real point of reference isn't 1970,

131
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:47,210
it's 1994 in the salary
cap was introduced. Yeah.

132
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,070
Why don't you turn it into
your fucking argument.

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,590
MMM,

134
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,450
okay.

135
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,530
Mass swarm of lines, browns and
eagles fans. But in all honestly,

136
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,490
it's really frustrating.

137
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:02,120
Flat out inaccurate when they say the
eagles have never won anything. Yeah.

138
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:03,800
That's bullshit. Well, this
is from four years ago.

139
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,060
You can't Cherry pick which championship
titles count and which don't.

140
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,250
The name of the trophy is arbitrary.
Uh,

141
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,690
it's not arbitrary at all.
It's,

142
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,890
it has a very specific line in the sand
and it's one that the league itself drew

143
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,700
not friends fans trying to hold
down the eagles and other teams.

144
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:27,380
The NFL decided nothing pre Superbowl
matters. Yeah. Well that's my question.

145
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,214
Why?

146
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,783
Okay.

147
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,910
Cherry picking would be saying the
eagles are packers pre Superbowl

148
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,440
championships camp but the browns don't.

149
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,380
Arbitrary would be saying
the package packers,

150
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,180
NFL championships count but the eagles
don't just because the NFL only counting

151
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:48,780
stats and championships and super
bowl one may or may not be fair,

152
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:51,570
but it's definitely not arbitrary
or cherry picking. All right.

153
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:56,571
That's all good points but it doesn't
explain why they decided not to decide it.

154
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,200
Why people count. Why do people do, I see

155
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,400
there's a bunch of articles on it.
There's a bunch of articles.

156
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,870
I all these are all chat rooms.

157
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm not going to get anywhere with this
next time I do one of these fucking

158
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,750
I, I don't know who. Who would you ask?

159
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,170
Okay.

160
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,060
Is somebody that has got to be somebody
that you asked because this fucking

161
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,540
bullshit that they act like,
you know,

162
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,090
the fucking league is like 70 goddamn
years old and they're acting like the top

163
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:36,970
of the heap is six measly
fucking championships.

164
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,270
It doesn't make sense at all.
And then, you know something,

165
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,460
if they actually counted NFL titles,

166
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:47,580
I know the giants won a couple
two and they got four super bowls.

167
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,723
Okay.

168
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,610
And the only thing that I'm
basing this on is that the NBA,

169
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:58,611
the Nhl and certainly major league
baseball all go back to the 1920s and MLB

170
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:03,210
goes back to like 1889.
Um,

171
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,690
I dunno,
it's weird.

172
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,430
It's just a weird fucking thing that like
the Patriots have bullied, been good,

173
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,031
you know,

174
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:15,740
winning championships and 18 for the last
18 years and we're one championship a

175
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,660
wave in 18 years.

176
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:22,220
We somehow are only one championship
away from being the most successful tied

177
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,810
for the most successful champ NFL team
of all time. That makes no fucking sense.

178
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,370
It makes no fucking sense.
People. Um, anyways,

179
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,740
I miss most of the Patriots Steelers
game. I caught, uh, the first quarter,

180
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,030
first half I basically caught and then,
you know,

181
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,220
I'm a dad now so I had to go to a kid
birthday party and uh, once again,

182
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:45,440
every time I go to one
of these parties I am so,

183
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:50,060
feel so blessed that I had a
daughter and not a son. Jesus Christ,

184
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:53,890
they're fucking lunatics.
Lunatics. I was just like,

185
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,430
I used to be like that.

186
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,580
You go in there with your daughter and
the first thing you're doing you're just

187
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:00,380
fucking,
you know,

188
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:04,430
you become like the Dave some Manco and
your kid's like fucking Wayne Gretzky.

189
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,040
Cause you know somebody
is going to do something.

190
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,390
You know somebody is going to throw
a ball, comes flying off a slide,

191
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,590
they have their fucking lunatic.
She was the funniest thing.

192
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,900
I was watching this kid who
has like a little Bobby Hurley.

193
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,640
He's playing this game,
you know,

194
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,140
hitting the ball like using is like both
his arms like intellect in his, his,

195
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,980
his fingers. It'd be bounced the ball
and then use his forearms like a bat,

196
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,980
smash it against the wall and
then stop it with his hand.

197
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,810
And throw it back between his legs,
you know,

198
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,600
all point guards style and you
look like a little Bobby Hurley.

199
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:38,510
So I was getting a kick out of this kid
who, this kid, this kid, this kid's got,

200
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:42,110
yeah, he had it, you know what I mean?
Like he had like that competitive thing.

201
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,890
And then at one point he ran over to go
pick up the ball and there was like a

202
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:49,100
couple of, um, the almost
like, do you know those,

203
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:51,950
those yoga blocks that help you
if you do not stretchy enough,

204
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,120
they would like that but
were more like cushions.

205
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,630
And someone had made a little seed out
of them and I had kind of been sitting

206
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:58,530
there like,
oh this is nice.

207
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,780
Some parent did that cause they
didn't want to sit on the hard floor.

208
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,750
And I was standing up when the kid came
over and he picks up the ball and just

209
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:08,310
sees like two blocks with a bigger block
on top of it and he just kicks it over.

210
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,710
There was no reason to do it,
you know?

211
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,030
And I was really just looking at
that thinking like, like, wow,

212
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,390
did I just see right there in
that moment? Why, why there's war?

213
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,820
Why,
why the world is so fucked up.

214
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,510
Why we don't get along because we're
like literally wired to just fucking

215
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:34,910
destroy stuff.
And I'll tell you something else.

216
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:39,140
With all these fucking people out there
who are trying to say that like gender

217
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,383
mmm.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,620
Gender roles are,
are basically taught to kids.

219
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,950
Uh, yeah. From what I
see when I've seen it,

220
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:53,940
these kid birthday parties that he's just
not, it's not even remotely the case.

221
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,480
Okay.

222
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,290
Boys are fucking lunatics.
Anything they can pick up,

223
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:03,220
they're going to throw anything.
They can just knock over and break.

224
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,054
They're going to do it.

225
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,260
The girls are like sitting
down like behaving themselves.

226
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,340
I can't necessarily say shake
sharing after a certain age.

227
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,400
They're not really sharing.
But there definitely like

228
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,570
their interactions with boys. It's just
kind of like, what the fuck was that?

229
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,620
Like they just kind of this sitting there
with a toy and a boy just runs up and

230
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:30,420
rips it out of their hands and you
just see them looking at it like, like,

231
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:34,650
you know, if you asked me for
it, you know, I, I would've
given it to you, you know?

232
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,490
Okay.

233
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,720
So it's going to be interesting with
all of these families out here that are

234
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,530
trying to prove, I might be wrong,
but as far as me just sitting there,

235
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:51,531
it's just boys are absolute
fucking lunatics loaded taste.

236
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,960
I'll tell you last year,
and we had my daughter's a birthday party,

237
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:57,450
they came over and immediately it'll
pick it up, gravel in the yard,

238
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,240
throwing it down on,
thrown in at fucking cars,

239
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,290
climbing up on shit every two
seconds. Hey, get down from there,

240
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,780
get down from there.
You know,

241
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,440
girls would just go into like the doll
house or pick up a toy and they would

242
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:14,910
just sit there and play
with it. Um, beyond,

243
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,580
beyond, more mature than the
boys. The boys, I swear to
God, it's like, it's like, uh,

244
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,710
I can't say puppies still like,
um,

245
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,700
do you know after a dog is just afterwards
a dog and it knows how to run their

246
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:30,810
like that age, you know where they're
going to go get sprayed by a skunk.

247
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,300
Um, yeah, fucking hilarious. But um,

248
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,800
we had a great time and they had like all,

249
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:45,600
like we went out to this place of good
friends of ours and it was at one of

250
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,090
those parties. It wasn't at the
house, it was like an a destination.

251
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,760
So there was one room that had all these
games and after you're done with that

252
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:51,020
game,

253
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,650
then you go into another place with a
bunch of other games and then in the end,

254
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,110
you know, all the kids get food, you know,

255
00:14:57,111 --> 00:15:01,310
and they're sitting there eating pizza
and shit. All of a sudden the cakes,

256
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:04,670
comedy and you know, you
know, just the meltdowns. A
common, everybody's like going,

257
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,970
all right, all right. Trying
to time it, they had the cake.

258
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:11,150
We sang happy birthday
to starting to whine.

259
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,520
I feel look like if we leave now,

260
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,730
the meltdowns only going to happen
like halfway, uh, on the way back.

261
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,760
But fortunately my daughter
loves music, so, uh,

262
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,010
whenever we drive home, whenever
she starts like flipping out, uh,

263
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,040
me and Nia just starts singing to her,
you know, he just stuck. Ah, wait. Oh,

264
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,750
the itsy bitsy spider or
the, we'll say, um, uh,

265
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,360
what's the other one?
Uh,

266
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,520
the wheels on the bus go round and
round that when she likes Jesus Christ.

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,080
Who's calling already? It's, it's early
in the morning. People who cook at this B,

268
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,700
who could this costs off? Fuck, I
got to take this, hang on. Hello.

269
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm back. I just said hello, like I
just clicked back to you guys. Um, yeah.

270
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,461
Anyways,

271
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:03,110
we just sing all these frigging songs
and then she wants to sing along with us

272
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:07,520
in themes is shows, you know, par, par,

273
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:11,600
par puppy dog pals. She loves
that Shit. I'll tell you the show.

274
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,790
I've been talking about it.
I just don't fucking like it.

275
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,590
I just don't like that fancy Nancy.
I just don't like every,

276
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,520
every show.

277
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,790
She's like being a Douche in self
involved and like totally shallow.

278
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,060
And then she allegedly learns a lesson
and then the next show she's just a jerk

279
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,903
again.

280
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,590
There's like no growth
whatsoever in this person.

281
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,990
You know what I mean? I mean, Van Porino
always wants to go back to Transylvania,

282
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,220
but she's not hurting anybody.

283
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:46,070
She just gets a little bummed out every
once in a while that the other kids

284
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,880
aren't blue light car. Right?
But fucking fancy Nancy,

285
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,260
this little ginger broad over there,
dude,

286
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,500
she's hanging out with a girlfriend,
right? And they're sitting there,

287
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,540
they're going to do a fucking dance.
And she's like,

288
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,090
I'm going to be the sun and
you'll be a wrong to be a rainbow.

289
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:06,560
You be the son and a friend Zach. I want
to be a peacock. She goes, yeah, but yeah,

290
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:10,250
you can't because it's a rainbow and
a peacock doesn't make any sense.

291
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:14,750
It's gotta be the sun and the rainbow. And
she goes, well, I want to be a peacock.

292
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,310
And she's like, look, you gotta
be, you gotta be right, Jen.

293
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:24,110
Say that. But that's the subtext. So then
they have this big fucking falling out,

294
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,900
you know, cause she's being a cunt again,
like she has every fucking episode,

295
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,990
every episode she's into like,
like,

296
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,580
what's the fanciest stuff coming up
with a clubhouse that's just her and

297
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:41,600
exclusively her own, you know,
she, I swear to God, Dude, God,

298
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,360
I'll tell you this right
now in the animated world,

299
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:48,030
God blessed the animated man
that marries her someday.

300
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,760
Fucking lunatic. Fucking, that's going
to be one of those fucking chicks, right?

301
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,630
He just buy him everything under the
every designer keeping up with the car

302
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:59,810
Dashi and fucking love
bracelet you could possibly do.

303
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,370
And then in a fucking end
when she's leaving, yeah.

304
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,870
And you're sitting there going, but I
bought you all this stuff. She'll be like,

305
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,830
I never wanted that.
I just wanted to kidnap action.

306
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,520
Uh,
I swear to God,

307
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,290
this is going to be a first 48
with an adult fucking fancy dancy.

308
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,030
If she doesn't get her act together,
she is.

309
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,660
She's going to drive somebody to do
something crazy because she doesn't learn

310
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:27,170
any fucking lessons. And she's
really shallow. You know,

311
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,050
she's a little sociopath. I just,
I just don't like sending the end.

312
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:33,950
She does some fucking dance to
apologize to a friend. And once again,

313
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:37,250
a friend's going to be friends with her
again rather than just being like, hey,

314
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:40,970
you know something, I've been on
this ride before you little red cunt.

315
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,560
I'm not fucking doing this again.

316
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,370
But it's like literally teaching
somebody how to stay in a dysfunctional

317
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:50,950
relationship every fucking episode.
At least the ones on paying attention to,

318
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,700
I just don't like it,
you know,

319
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,340
I don't be that person just sitting
there say they don't have your kid watch

320
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:57,410
step, but like, you know,

321
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,440
I don't put my foot down too much
as a parent with my wife. Um, well,

322
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,060
who's kidding?
Who would I put it down?

323
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,450
But it's not listened to because it's
the dad foot and nobody gives a shit.

324
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,640
Nobody gives a shit about the debt.
It's all about the mom foot.

325
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,960
The mom says it ain't happened in anymore.
It ain't happening anymore.

326
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,560
The Dad says that they,
people just, they just, yes,

327
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:21,230
them to death and then the next
day it's like, why is she watching?

328
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,560
Why is she watching carrot top here again.
Huh?

329
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,040
Okay.

330
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,930
Why is she watching this stuff bill?
It's fine. It's just a cartoon.

331
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,400
It's just, it's just what you
wanted. It's just what you wanted.

332
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,740
I don't like that show. Um,
anyways. Puppy dog pals,

333
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:46,350
that's where it's at. Okay.
There are a couple of pals.

334
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,630
They're trying to help out somebody
in need, you know what I mean?

335
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,720
And you know something and yeah,
Bob goes through a lot of little problems,

336
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,140
but he's, he's not hurting anybody
salted. The Earth Guy, you know,

337
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,400
probably could do some squats.

338
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,910
It owes shoulder's a little too broad
for this little skinny legs. I don't,

339
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,350
I don't know what's going on there,
but other than that,

340
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:06,180
I don't have a problem with it, you
know? So anyways, plowing ahead.

341
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
I watched Liverpool versus man United.
I did watch that game.

342
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:13,470
I saw a little bit of the
dolphins, Vikings. Um,

343
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,640
how about the browns?

344
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,230
About the fucking Cleveland Brown's
got a chance to make the playoffs.

345
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,710
This is really going to be a fun year if
my patriots are not going to win it to

346
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,480
share. Okay. What's
looking like that? Not,

347
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,080
I just hope they lose the fucking first
round just so I can enjoy all these

348
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:31,680
other goddamn teams that are going
to be in it. It's going to be a,

349
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,250
okay,

350
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,350
it's really going to be exciting.
And all of a sudden, you know,

351
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:38,410
the rams have lost a couple this
showing that they're not invincible,

352
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,720
that fucking challenges are coming on.

353
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,990
You know, there's a fucking chance someone
was saying to me yesterday that, that,

354
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:52,860
that they could actually be the NFC and
AFC championship games could both be

355
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:56,580
played in Los Angeles.
I Dunno about that.

356
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:58,410
Cause the charges get
home field advantage.

357
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,350
I don't know if they could do that
mathematically at this point. Uh, by,

358
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,350
I apologize, I'm music better, better up
on the sports, but uh, I just, you know,

359
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,880
I got the kid now, so, you
know, it's only a kid once,

360
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,880
something has to give and it's
not going to be her. So, um,

361
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,970
I did watch Liverpool versus Man United
Liverpool scored the first goal and was

362
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,470
really carrying the play.
And then all of a sudden,

363
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:24,360
man United just really had possession
of the ball, um, in Liverpool's and,

364
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,700
and, uh, kind of seem like basketball
or it's like, you know, to game a runs,

365
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,350
you know.
And uh,

366
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,460
at one point I said something
when I was just like,

367
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:40,110
we got to get the fucking ball back.
I said, we, and I was like, ah, Shit.

368
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,800
It's just something else I care about.
I don't totally care about it,

369
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,300
but I do find it interesting

370
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,380
to watch and I'm actually
starting to get into the game.

371
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,930
And I remember back in the day when I
would hear the crowd applaud when no goal

372
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:58,200
was scored, but they would just applauding
the pressure you were putting on.

373
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,820
I started like, without thinking about
it, doing that yesterday, I was like,

374
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,160
I fuck,
here we go again.

375
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,590
I'm gonna start giving a shit
about something else. Um, anyways,

376
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,790
but I'm actually going to go on,

377
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,400
I should go online now and see
if Liverpool has a fucking game.

378
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,680
I know I'm going to be
out there at some point.

379
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,280
That would be sick if I went out
there and no, I'm not going to sing.

380
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,320
You're never going to be alone or
whatever the fuck they sync beads.

381
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,580
Some douchey watch three games and all
of a sudden we're going to go buy a scarf

382
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:30,960
and stand there. Like I fucking bled
there colors. I'm not doing that.

383
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm just a fucking,
let's see here.

384
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,940
Just a fucking Newbie fan here. All
right. What do we get? billboard.com oh,

385
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:39,361
by the way,

386
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:44,361
did I mention I'm going to be
in Europe January 4th through?

387
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,780
Where are we? January 4th
through the 13th uh, alright,

388
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,410
Liverpool. I'm there on the 26 now here's
the interesting thing. That's the first.

389
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,380
That is the first date on that tour,

390
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,740
which means if they have a
fucking game on the 25th at home,

391
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:06,150
there's a chance there is a chance I
could actually go to that fucking game,

392
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,330
right?
Liverpool fucking schedule.

393
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,000
All right.
What do we got here?

394
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,663
Okay,

395
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,930
come on. Come on one fucking
time. Work out for me.

396
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:23,790
One 19 to 14 to 27 it looks
like it's an away game,

397
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,310
right? Where the fuck did they just
play? Yeah, they just played man,

398
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,340
man, man United. Right. Oh
wait, no, they got a home game.

399
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,740
12:00 PM the day of my show,
the fuck Gotti.

400
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:44,590
I'm going Liverpool Verse Watford.

401
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm going to fucking go.
They got one verse, man.

402
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,960
You not all their ad in
Manchester on the 24th.

403
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,370
All right. Don't get greedy built.
Don't get greedy. You know what I mean?

404
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,510
Don't get greedy.
I'm,

405
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:04,950
I'm going to see if I can go to that
one on the 27th it says 12:00 PM though.

406
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:09,930
Wait, is, but it's probably going to
be at night. I'm thinking 12:00 PM uh,

407
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,160
Liverpool time, but it's not going to
be, is it? It's going to be my time.

408
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:18,480
They're eight hours ahead.
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

409
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:19,740
The games at 10 at night,

410
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,280
maybe that's an east coast
time and it's at seven.

411
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,400
I don't know if that would be at five.
I don't fucking know.

412
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,900
I'll figure something out. Jesus Christ
is going to be nobody at my fucking show.

413
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,770
We would love to have gone
bill. Um, all right. No booze,

414
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,220
everybody. Oh, both freckles came close.

415
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:44,640
He fucking came close a couple of times.

416
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,430
He's 22 days in. Can he make the
entire month? I'm right there, man.

417
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,210
I'm right fucking there by just
make it through Christmas Day.

418
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,950
All have gone 31 days and I'll have my
own sober October from November 21st

419
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,960

420
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,310
December 25th. That'll be,
yeah, that's six days, right?

421
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,220
25 and six is 31. So longest.
God Damn. Once you can have, uh,

422
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,010
tell you it's going pretty good. It's
going pretty great. What's wild night?

423
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,330
And I have really looked at the bottles.
I was like,

424
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:16,950
do I really want to
start doing that again?

425
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,530
I don't want to fucking do that again.
I got to stay in shape.

426
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,970
I'm going to be taping a special next
year. Right. I got stay in fucking shape.

427
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,620
All right, let's, let's read,
uh, only a couple of fucking
ad reads this week. Okay.

428
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,280
Ah.

429
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,400
[inaudible] the Patriots

[inaudible]
a righty.

484
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,910
Um, oh, you know what I made for
the first time? I was second time.

485
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,470
First Time I fucked him up.
I made some chocolate chip cookies.

486
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,170
I'm not good at making the cookies. And
this time they finally came out. Right.

487
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,010
Cause they made three different batches
where I just, uh, often the same batch.

488
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,300
I did three different cooks of them.

489
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,840
I only had like one cookie sheet
and I had to like, you know,

490
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,010
my recipe called for only
half a tablespoon of a, of
a dollop. And I was like,

491
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:27,620
that seems really small.
I didn't get how much they spread out.

492
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,620
It's like reverse bacon or bacon,
like all shrivels up,

493
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:34,130
like the cookie dough spreads out. So, um,

494
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,330
my first one that I made it like the
whole sheet looked like a giant cookie and

495
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,950
I was like, all right,
that's not the way to do it.

496
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,840
And then the next one will like medium
size and then I coat sign it kinda had

497
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:47,470
like the smaller ones, but
um, they were damn good.

498
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,370
And I use my little kitchen aid
thing, you know, second pair of hands,

499
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:53,560
not free advertising.
I just love that fucking thing.

500
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:56,200
I love when that thing's turning and
I'm over in the counter doing something

501
00:29:56,201 --> 00:30:00,610
else. Um, but I learned
from the expert. My mother,

502
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,560
she told me, uh, you know, she's like,
well how did you do it? You know,

503
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,050
I'm like, well, you know, I put
them in the kitchen out. She's like,

504
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:11,470
you got to fold the flower
and you can't use that.

505
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,410
He can't use the kitchen aid thing. You
want to fold it. And she's trying to say,

506
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:18,160
cause it, uh, you get some
air in there. I don't know.

507
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:19,990
Somebody else was saying
it has to do with gluten.

508
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:24,820
I have no idea because my cookies
seemed a little bit runny yet crispy.

509
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,980
And every oven is the diff is
different. So I used the classic, um,

510
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,430
our version, my family's version
of the classic toll house

511
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,780
recipe and chocolate chip cookies
were invented by a couple of ladies in

512
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:43,180
Massachusetts at this place,

513
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:45,790
this like toll house tavern
or something like that.

514
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,470
And they would use like a
semisweet chocolate chip.
And that's what I always use.

515
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,360
But I got, you know, my wife told me that
she likes milk chocolate. So I said, fine.

516
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:59,620
So I put the milk chocolate ones in
there and everybody said they didn't say

517
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:00,401
they were good.
They were like,

518
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:03,490
this is the best goddamn chocolate
chip cookie I ever tasted.

519
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:07,450
So maybe I'll do a cooking
video on that shit,

520
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,360
but I can't give away my family recipe
so I don't know how to fucking do it.

521
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,341
And having said that,

522
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:15,010
I fired up my big green egg for
the first time in a long time,

523
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:20,011
and it had these two fucking rib
eyes with like literally the fucking,

524
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,290
uh,
the rib bone sticking out.

525
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,610
You could have fucking brain somebody
with that when they were frozen. And, um,

526
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,600
I got impatient with my green egg.
I was told to 50 with indirect heat.

527
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:34,990
It went up to like three 10.
So I was like, all right,

528
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:38,140
I'll leave it in there for like 40,
45 minutes instead of doing the full hour.

529
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:41,260
And I then I reverse seared
it when I was on the stove.

530
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,530
I should only done that for a minute
and ended up being under salted and

531
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:49,080
overcooked. Two beautiful pieces
of meat and I fucked it up. Um,

532
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,030
it just really fucking,
it just,

533
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
it made me sick cause those things
where my freezer for a while,

534
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:59,770
but I still ate it and a, I will
not waste it. I'm going to eat,

535
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,610
I'm going to remember next
time to be more patient.

536
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:05,140
That's the biggest thing
with the big green egg.

537
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:08,960
You gotta be fucking patient and I'm
just not cause that thing is the PR,

538
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,520
it was the shit it, we'll just stay at
the temperature you want. And I just,

539
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,220
you know, it was getting late. We
were coming back from the party.

540
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:18,910
I just wanted to put them on here that,
you know,

541
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:22,210
when you put it on and uh,
ended up fucking him up.

542
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:24,760
So anyways, you, you, you know,

543
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:29,170
I think Alannis Morissette said it best
when she said, uh, what, did she say?

544
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:33,850
Something at pot of being ironic?
No, she said you live, you learn

545
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,230
use update. You let, um,

546
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,010
why did she ever have a
really good follow up to that,

547
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,710
that jagged little pills that,
cause she got it all out.

548
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,190
It's almost like she should have saved
some of the anger for like the next album,

549
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,840
you know, like, yeah, but like you,

550
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,310
when you were watching a baseball playoff
and your team scores 11 runs, you know,

551
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:59,760
when's like 11, two, and as it scoring
like runs now by eight, nine, 10,

552
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,420
there's always some baseball fan be like,
save it for tomorrow night.

553
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,320
Why you scored all of them now

554
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,260
maybe she should have done that.
I don't know baby bill.

555
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:16,350
Maybe you ought to put out a hit fucking
album before you criticize somebody

556
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:20,490
else's fucking, uh, one of the albums of
the decade. Right? Jagged little pill.

557
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,460
Fucking rich. Yeah. Balls. Huh?

558
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,240
His scrotum there, whatever the
fuck it's, I don't know how it goes.

559
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:28,571
I don't even know.

560
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:32,740
The anatomy aren't your
balls and you scroll down the
same thing. I have no idea.

561
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,050
You know what I mean? And
it's like, it's a snare drum,

562
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:37,630
but the things underneath
it to call this the snares,

563
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,830
it's very confusing

564
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,070
sa with path,

565
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,240
you know, can you imagine a guy if
you wrote a fucking song like that,

566
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,350
I remember every breath you take
they will like to sunk. It's,

567
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,730
it's this guy's a stalker.
She puts out a sign.

568
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,210
Ha ha ha.

569
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,080
Sounded like a flood.
She's looking in the guy's fucking house.

570
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,940
Terrifying fucking song.
And of course when women do it isn't,

571
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,170
she's strong and brave.

572
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,580
Ha Ha.

573
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,490
Poisoned your morning tea.
Anyways,

574
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:20,460
plowing ahead here. Guess what
I'm doing today at 12 noon. Uh,

575
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:22,410
I'm going to go fly a helicopter there.

576
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,670
I flew Saturday for the first
time since the end of October.

577
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,430
Uh, and I had the best fucking time.
Flew great pickups and set downs.

578
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:36,840
We'll fucking is great
as they've ever been. Um,

579
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,220
and I had taken a lot of time off.
Dare I say I'm getting fucking good at it.

580
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:44,400
I landed on top of a building,
which I've never done before.

581
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,470
Just fucking awesome man.

582
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:50,760
I felt like I was in some like
fucking copper procedural show,

583
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,930
you know, where is the patient
always coming? And now, you know,

584
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,120
the beginning is to play in the opening
credit poem by, by Dubai and was

585
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,990
a fucking freckled pilot. Right. But

586
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,200
he's almost fucking see you through.
Um,

587
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,370
it was always really intimidating because
I felt like it would always be like

588
00:35:17,371 --> 00:35:20,610
really windy and stuff like that, but uh,
I'm a chump. Sure. It could have been,

589
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:23,430
but it was kind of perfect. Conditions
came in, there was plenty of room,

590
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,850
there wasn't anything sticking up. I
always felt like when you would go there,

591
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:31,560
it was just sort of like,
um, you know, I've, I've had,

592
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,220
I've had to land those things on a,

593
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,350
I don't even know what you them,

594
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,230
it's like, rather than just
setting it down on the ground,

595
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:43,890
there's like a Little Square Hella pad
that you land that's actually sitting on

596
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,500
the ground and you have
to be way more accurate.

597
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,220
Then you start getting in your head, you
stirring the pot, you get a little wind,

598
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,360
what the fuck's going on?

599
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,930
And then the ski instructor has to come
on the controls with you and then your

600
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,110
friends in the back don't respect you as
much. You know, it's one of those deals.

601
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:59,490
Speaking of friends in the back,

602
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,350
I'm going to be flying with my instructor
and uh, and Joe Rogan's coming along.

603
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,160
Uh, I've been trying to figure out some
time when we could actually do that.

604
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:10,590
We finally have a little bit of time and
our schedules could have fly with him.

605
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:14,520
And then on Wednesday I'm going to be
doing the Joe Rogan experience podcast and

606
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:15,810
we'll be talking about the flight.

607
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,200
Maybe you have some video hopefully or
whatever. It's going to be a great time.

608
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,430
So please tune into that.

609
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,030
And I will be promoting a season three
if f is for family and of course the uh,

610
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,510
the Patrice O'neil standup comedy benefit,

611
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:35,080
which is happening February
19th, 2019. Trying to get last,

612
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:38,490
the rid of the last couple of
hundred tickets on Joe's podcast.

613
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,720
I'm all right with that.
I've already read the, uh,

614
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,710
the advertising. Let's, let's read
a little bit of the questions here.

615
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,370
Let's read some of the questions. I got
to get back to the fucking gym, man.

616
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,920
I've been being Mr Mom, you know,
now that I've been off the road,

617
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:59,940
you know, cause I, I, you know, want to
be with my kid and every morning I just,

618
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:02,870
you know, there's always
a reason, you know,

619
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,590
not to go to the gym where I'm just like,

620
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,860
or I could sit here and read her a book,
you know,

621
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:11,610
or we could go to the playground
or I could take her for a walk,

622
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,770
you know, or I could watch a driver, a
little electric car around and then, oh,

623
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:21,720
cleo audio is in town and my
trainer who now owns the dog,

624
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,130
you know, whenever he comes into
town, he brings her. And uh,

625
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,160
it was awesome going on.
A couple of hikes with her and stuff.

626
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,210
I've fucked in love that dog, but she
looks great if anybody's concerned.

627
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,430
And she has a dog friend now,

628
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,540
which I didn't have the skill set to
make her comfortable around another dog.

629
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:43,530
So she's like a,
she's living her best life.

630
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,970
So she really is like an amazing
story where she was abandoned,

631
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,830
you know, by the La River.
She had all these issues.

632
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,820
My one of my wife's friends found her,
my wife took her in,

633
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,230
we kept her for eight years.
She lived in the lap of luxury.

634
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:04,800
It got too crazy, you know, she
bit, one of my friends, you know,

635
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:08,190
all of this stuff usually ends with a
pit bull getting put down and this dog

636
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:12,940
just keeps going to an even better
situation and now it has like,

637
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,190
you know the dog is like 10 years
old now. So I mean it's in, you know,

638
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:22,191
probably the final four or five years
of its life and its going to live,

639
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:27,090
you know, now has a best friend
you know to hang out with.

640
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:28,770
It's really awesome.
It's really awesome.

641
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:32,930
And I still get to see her once
every couple of months and um,

642
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,090
you know, so I'm happy because I felt
like when I got that dog I felt like a

643
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:41,720
responsibility. Like this thing
is, is going to live a full life.

644
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,430
It's not going to get put down. I didn't
anticipate that. I'd have to, you know,

645
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,230
give her away to somebody else.
But I made sure that when I did,

646
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:52,280
she had a good home, so I feel like I
did the right thing, you know? All right.

647
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,360
Anyways, that's my little
Rni a great guy. You know,

648
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,650
talking about myself. Very
Instagram influenced, uh,

649
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:05,210
Bosnia show come to Bosnia.
You lying ginger. Fuck all.

650
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:09,100
I thought I was going there. You're
fucking dose. Um, I'm fuck kee kid.

651
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,910
Jump on a fucking train.
Let me know.

652
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm going to find out how long have
these fucking assholes over there.

653
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,010
I'm literally going to Estonia and Latvia.
Like,

654
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,540
how much more do I have to fucking
do for you guys? Come to Bosnia.

655
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,230
All right, well, it was Bosnia.
It's find out, isn't it?

656
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,930
Just south east of, of, of

657
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,220
have a prog. It's not
that far, is it? Isn't it?

658
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:38,510
Just like a fucking train ride away?
Let's see here.

659
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,160
Okay,

660
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,830
let's see how close.
I mean,

661
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:45,170
I'm only flying from the
other side of the globe.

662
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:48,620
You can't get on a plane for a
couple of fucking hours. All right,

663
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:49,730
so there's Bosnia.

664
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,020
Okay.

665
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,970
All right. That's what Jesus that, so
it's a hell of a fucking ride. My fault.

666
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:56,030
Where else am I going to be?

667
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,260
Okay.

668
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,570
I'm going to be in Vienna. All right,
let's see. Let me see. Something.

669
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,780
Bosnia to Vienna.

670
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,150
Yeah.

671
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:14,260
Travel. Uh, just say distance, right?
I'm the worst with Google and shit.

672
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,170
Bosnia to to be in a distance.

673
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,670
Okay.

674
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,500
Eight hours and 32 minutes.
Holy Shit. That's a fucking
drive. All right, my fault.

675
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,660
I'm starting to understand your argument.
Uh,

676
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,210
okay.

677
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,180
Plane ride.
Let's see how long this is.

678
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,443
Okay.

679
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,490
It's an hour and 15 minutes by plane.
Jesus Christ. Like how much can that cost?

680
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,340
That's like flying from here to Vegas.
She jumped on southwest for like 80 bucks.

681
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,230
All right.

682
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,990
Yeah.

683
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,220
Good Lord. I apologize.
Next time sir. Or ma'am.

684
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,450
Okay.

685
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,380
Or, or, or transgendered person,
whatever the fuck you are.

686
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,910
I will try and get to Bosnia. All
right. I thought it was going there.

687
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,420
You lie. And Ginger. Fuck, isn't it weird?

688
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:12,530
Somebody from that part of the
world to be judging somebody. Um,

689
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,900
I'll try to get my ass down there.
All right now here he comes, all the,

690
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:19,130
all this shit about Europe.

691
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:26,390
Now it would be getting all this
advice on places to go, things to do.

692
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:29,450
And the problem is I'm not really
going to have a lot of time. All right,

693
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:34,280
tip about Poland. Dear Mr Bill, I'm
very excited about your towards so am I.

694
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,580
I'm very excited to go to
Poland. Uh, I'm Polish,

695
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,280
but for now I'm living
and working in Sweden.

696
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,110
So I hope to get the ticket for one of
your stand ups in Stockholm or in Oslow.

697
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,900
One tip about Poland.
Uh,

698
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:52,901
use it how you want in one of your late
night shows visit you called Poland and

699
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:58,250
Eastern European country and that
you are excited about visiting.

700
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:00,650
They're happy to hear that,
but well,

701
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,820
we Polish hate the term eastern
European for a few reasons.

702
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,230
I imagine one of us is gonna be the
Russians first is that if you look at the

703
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:12,800
map of Europe geographically,
we're not on the east.

704
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,210
Well then explained to me why the
Detroit Redwings for so fucking long.

705
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,490
You know, we're in the
east, weren't they? Are,

706
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:26,360
they're still on east
coast time and he was so,

707
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:31,220
it's the same like Nebraska is on the
east coast. I'd say more like Michigan.

708
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,690
And second reason political is that
this term comes from times when we were

709
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:40,160
under the Soviet Union.
Yes, we fight back, uh,

710
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,330
got our India,
we fought back on our independence.

711
00:42:42,331 --> 00:42:43,860
We are happy and proud about that.

712
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,280
I'm sure that you never
mean to offend us also.

713
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:52,080
We are not hypersensitive pussies now.
You Polish people seem fucking cool. Uh,

714
00:42:52,081 --> 00:42:54,630
I wish you great time
during the European tour.

715
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:58,830
Kickass performance and lots of positive
energy. So as always, go fuck yourself.

716
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,720
Mike Guy Named Mike from Poland.
Uh,

717
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,150
anyways. All right. Point
taken point. Fucking take it.

718
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,210
Jesus Christ. Well, let me, let me
look at the fucking map of Europe here.

719
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,770
All right. Uh, you're up

720
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,620
map.
Come on.

721
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,700
Type it correctly.
Wiki fucking TD or why?

722
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:24,930
Okay.

723
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,710
Why would it go to fucking wicky
fucking country? Pedia I fucking hate.

724
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:30,990
I love Wikipedia,
but Jesus fucking Christ.

725
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,510
Why does it always go to fucking
Wikipedia? I don't, I don't get it.

726
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,460
Don't fucking get it. All right. Let's
see here. I don't know about this.

727
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:46,450
Yeah,

728
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,640
I dunno.
You slightly fucking east.

729
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,360
Oh, I see. Cause that much of Russia.

730
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,440
Wait a minute. What do I look
up? Eastern? Yeah, Eastern Europe

731
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:04,910
map.

732
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,180
See what we got here.

733
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,680
Oh, I got news for you, buddy.

734
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:17,370
I just looked up eastern Europe maps
and you're fucking right in there.

735
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:23,100
Eastern Europe is Poland,
Czech Republic,

736
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:27,510
Slovakia, Hungary, Hungary, Croatia.
They don't have Austria in there. Yeah.

737
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:29,280
This might be because these are the,

738
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,770
these are the countries that Russia was a

739
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,530
had control of. Yeah. Maybe that's
it is what it is. Let's see.

740
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:41,470
A more eastern European map.

741
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,320
How about 2019
how about you?

742
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:49,290
Let me fucking click on
it. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

743
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,130
2019

744
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,523
boom.

745
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,230
I gotta be honest with you, dude.
They're still fucking distill.

746
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:05,540
Still got you included in this.

747
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,713
Yeah.

748
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,840
Yeah. They got you in it.
Listen, send me the fucking,

749
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:19,920
whatever fucking map you're looking at is,
I don't know what it is.

750
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,060
Okay.

751
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,520
All right. You know something I give
up. I give up. Why? Why don't bill,

752
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,130
why don't you listen to the guy
that fucking lives over there?

753
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,290
Am I really doing that? Oh, I daig
guy who actually lived in Poland. Uh,

754
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,570
this is me from Los Angeles.
I think you're wrong about
where you live. It might,

755
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:37,330
was I really just doing that for
the last five minutes. I apologize.

756
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,720
Told um, Rosebowl everybody. Hey,

757
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,090
d

758
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,610
Billy Rose balls. First of all, I'm a
big fan of all your work. Thank you.

759
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,720
I was at your Seattle show and you and
Dean del Ray were hilarious. Thank you.

760
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,410
Anyways,
my school is in the rose bowl this year.

761
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,720
And since you're such a veteran,

762
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,750
I was wondering if you had
any advice for a first timer.

763
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,400
I have the basic tailgating stuff
like a grill, beer, and a cooler.

764
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,290
Should I bring anything special? Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself. Alex. Uh, Alex,

765
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,570
uh, bring a chair, brings some lawn
chairs, someplace to sit down. Um,

766
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,250
depending if you want to hang afterwards
and let all the traffic leave,

767
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:26,340
I would bring some firewood that you can
put into your little Hibachi and start

768
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:30,600
a little fire and stay warm.
Um,

769
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:35,190
what are things that people forget? Uh,
don't forget plates. Don't forget Napkins.

770
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:39,270
Bring a trash bag to put all your shit in.
Um,

771
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,640
condiments.

772
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:43,650
Okay.

773
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,460
Utensils
a table.

774
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:52,980
You don't want to be sitting there having
everything in your fucking lap. Uh,

775
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,070
what else? Charcoal. Uh, uh, I'd,

776
00:46:58,071 --> 00:47:01,340
I'd bring those little squares that make
it easy to like the, if you get in the,

777
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:01,551
uh,

778
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:06,170
the wood burning sort of whatever the
fucking that natural would charge crap if

779
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:11,000
you're going to do that, unless you,
unless you have the match light stuff. Um,

780
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:16,070
a lighter
beer bottle opener.

781
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,770
Um,
butter for the bonds,

782
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,150
bonds, it just, everything. I
just go over and over and over.

783
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,070
A Red Solo cups,
booze.

784
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,580
I had a jacket for when it gets cold,
when he gets your tickets,

785
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:40,440
try to stay on this side with
the, uh, with the press box on it.

786
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:45,420
That way you're not staring into the
sun for half the fucking game. Um,

787
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:50,190
oh, and before you leave, even when you
go to take a Piss, when you're tailgating,

788
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,540
find where you are because
you're on a golf course.

789
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:58,470
It's all going to look the same. The
stadium is round, especially at night.

790
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:01,260
There's no focal point that you're going
to be able to find and you will walk

791
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:04,410
around lost. All right. There'll
be these little balloons.

792
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:07,620
They're finally lighting them up for
years. They did not light them up.

793
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,390
Yeah,

794
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,120
it's literally one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

795
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:16,110
I don't know how high up it goes, but
just make sure you remember where you are.

796
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:22,300
Um, pace yourself depending on what time
you're going to go. Bring us to Gar.

797
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:25,830
Fewer cigar person. Bring a light
or bring a cutter. All of that shit.

798
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:30,370
You think that you, you're
gonna, you're gonna Forget. Um,

799
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,830
all right, so good luck to
Ya. Alright, daughter MMA,

800
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,650
a Billy red nose tubes,

801
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,670
a belly, the red nose. Pubi
I am a 33 year old lady

802
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,510
D

803
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,040
and I'm also a second
degree black belt in.

804
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,460
Okay,

805
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,290
go. Gee, Guru. Go Djourou karate.

806
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,490
I've done martial arts for the last
eight years that I have also dabbled in

807
00:48:58,491 --> 00:49:01,700
other styles and learned a lot of
things for many different instructors.

808
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:02,534
That's awesome.

809
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,230
The reason I am writing to you is
because I listened to you on Conan.

810
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,390
Conan needs a friend podcast,

811
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,780
and you've mentioned you wanted your
daughter to learn MMA or something,

812
00:49:11,781 --> 00:49:14,870
but your wife might not be
thrilled about the idea.

813
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,070
I was hoping you could tell her that
as a small woman, I'm only five feet,

814
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,340
that knowing something to protect
myself makes me feel better.

815
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,440
Being outside or in crowds. I think
of it as having insurance. Uh,

816
00:49:27,441 --> 00:49:31,760
you hope you never need it, but
it's nice to have. Yeah, absolutely.

817
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:34,190
I think all women should know how to
do this shit and they should learn it

818
00:49:34,191 --> 00:49:38,480
without it being broadcast out there
that they're learning it because then the

819
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:38,991
perverts,

820
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:43,040
we'll then start taking classes and
try and roll around the mat with you.

821
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,170
Not only they'll have a defense
against whatever you do,

822
00:49:45,171 --> 00:49:46,400
you should spring the shit on them.

823
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,060
Not only will you fucking
be able to defend yourself,

824
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:52,550
y'all should be able to catch the fucking
Douche that's still stolen it and they

825
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:55,330
can lock them up in a perfect world.
All right?

826
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,740
There are instructors who are very caring

827
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,910
and our fathers themselves,

828
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:04,270
they will give your daughter tips
and extra advice on how to face men.

829
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,210
Since generally speaking, men
are stronger. I don't know.

830
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,600
I don't think there's anything wrong
with sending your daughter to dancing

831
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:15,340
school. Sometimes that can
help with your art. Uh,

832
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:19,420
my friend at the Dojo also did ballet,
but she said it helped with her foot work.

833
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,600
I have a daughter that's three years old
and when she's a little older I will be

834
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:24,010
enrolling her at my school,

835
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,690
which my husband and also our son daily.

836
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:31,980
Being a martial artist wouldn't
make your daughter on feminine. Uh,

837
00:50:31,981 --> 00:50:36,981
when you rather she be a little femme
fatale you're preaching to the choir here.

838
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,973
Exactly.

839
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:42,870
Does any questions I'd love to answer
and we'll write back merry Christmas and

840
00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:44,520
go fuck yourself. Yeah,
thank you. I'm going to,

841
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,250
I got to read that to my
wife and she'll be like,

842
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,530
I never sad that Jay can fac and dad.

843
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,800
It's like, yet you did, you did on some
level or at least that's the way I heard.

844
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,240
That's the way I heard it.

845
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,540
MMM.

846
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,710
Anyways, I've been doing well with my
anger. Everybody been doing well with it.

847
00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:07,050
Like I immediately now
and when I flip out,

848
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,080
I start to apologize as I'm doing it and
say that I'm being a baby and there has

849
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:15,480
to be a more mature way to settle this.
And I swear to God,

850
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,100
if you're an angry guy out there,

851
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:20,340
I cannot tell you what that
means to the woman in your life.

852
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,173
They like,

853
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,150
okay.

854
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,050
They become the person
they were when you met him.

855
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,250
Okay.

856
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,670
You know, a lot of times when
your wife or girlfriend changes,

857
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:37,150
it's because you are changing and
they're reacting to what you're doing.

858
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,841
You know what I mean?

859
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:41,950
Not to give women 100% of fucking pass
before all the women listen to this guy

860
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,890
and looking at their fucking
boyfriend now husband.

861
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,210
Yeah.

862
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,510
For one thing women love to
do is fucking rubbing it.

863
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,950
They can't just be right
there. They get out here, see,

864
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,520
look at it and fucking push your face
right down on the paper where it says

865
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,354
there.
Right.

866
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,633
MMM.

867
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,210
So, uh, yeah, that's going to
be my thing. And I'm going to,

868
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,840
I think I might go back to therapy next
year just specifically to talk about my

869
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:14,320
anger and get this
thing sorted out and uh,

870
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,430
you know,
and I keep threatening.

871
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:18,100
Then I might start going to
Sunday church again regularly,

872
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,110
even though I don't believe in any of it.

873
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:24,910
I like it just as a way to reset and
just kind of sit and think as I block out

874
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:28,300
all the bullshit that's being said to me.
Just sit there and think it'd be like,

875
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,740
what's important? What do
I need to do, you know,

876
00:52:32,741 --> 00:52:36,550
get your shit together,
you know, don't be a dick.

877
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:40,100
Um, life is flying by. All right.

878
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,370
Friend wants to get matching tattoos.
Oh.

879
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,000
[inaudible] all right.

880
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,000
A Billy Burnett.
Uh,

881
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,150
so I've known this girl for
going on five years now.

882
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:57,290
We both still remember the night we
met and the developed a close intimate

883
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:00,390
relationship sense. Yeah. Boy,

884
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,420
we were together officially
earlier this year, then broke up.

885
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:09,450
And it was during this time she got a
tattoo to symbolize the loss she felt

886
00:53:09,461 --> 00:53:10,870
after our breakup.

887
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,770
We've since started talking
again and we went to, uh,

888
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:19,690
we went out to a concert together in
San Francisco and fell in love all over

889
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:23,400
again. Well, since we've returned,

890
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:27,200
she asked me how I'd feel about
getting a tattoo matching hers.

891
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,910
Okay.

892
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:33,500
Yeah. No, yeah, don't do that. Uh,

893
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,240
we're not officially back together,

894
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,810
but I think that meaning behind
this tattoo is deeper than that.

895
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:43,550
I feel like I'm connected to this girl
regardless if I'm with her or not.

896
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:48,551
So I wouldn't regret it even if
I didn't talk to her ever again.

897
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,520
I'm leading towards yes as
obviously I really liked this girl,

898
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,770
but I need an outsider's perspective.

899
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,970
It'd be my first and probably
only tattoo and it's not,

900
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:03,320
and it's nothing ridiculous.
Just a word on the forum,

901
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:05,660
no name or anything like that.

902
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:10,070
She's beautiful and we get along
like best friends as well as lovers.

903
00:54:10,071 --> 00:54:12,230
What do you think? Uh, yeah, dude, I,

904
00:54:12,231 --> 00:54:15,980
you don't get a matching
tattoo with a woman ever.

905
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:21,070
And it may be if you're 25 years into
being married and the kids have all moved

906
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:22,790
out of the house.

907
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,290
Okay.

908
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,590
You don't do that. Don't,
don't fucking do that. Okay.

909
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:29,030
Because you've already broken up.

910
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:34,010
It seems like a very volatile
emotional relationship. Um, you know,

911
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:38,360
you're my soulmate. I love you. Fuck you.
We're breaking it up. I got a tattoo.

912
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,700
A,
it's talking about how sad I was,

913
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:43,820
wasn't we broke up and now we're getting
back together and now we need to get

914
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:48,290
matching tattoos. I mean, this is,
it's why wouldn't when, when the,

915
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,870
when the emotions level off a little,

916
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:51,890
okay,

917
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:56,390
okay. And you're in the grind
of a relationship and you
guys don't run from that.

918
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,650
They can actually hang,

919
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:02,750
there's no fucking reason to do that
because if you end up fucking breaking up,

920
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,271
which, who's kidding, who,

921
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:08,240
that sounds like there's a 50 50 chance
you will now you got this fucking tattoo

922
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:11,150
on your arm and then you're going to
get with the next person. You know,

923
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:14,150
the person you ended up where maybe the
person ended up being with and she's

924
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:16,160
going to be like, what's that? And He, oh,

925
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:20,960
this is this tattoo that I got from a
past relationship that another woman also

926
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:22,840
is walking around with and she's,

927
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:25,730
can you think if you fucking think
that that's going to stay there?

928
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:27,620
Yeah.

929
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,380
The only reason why I would say to do
it is because there's still that laser

930
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:31,790
fucking surgery though.

931
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,540
Don't get like regret or missing you

932
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,900
or butterfly, whatever the
fuck my butterfly, whatever
the fuck she has an arm.

933
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,520
All right. She fucked up. She did
that. You didn't. So you know, this is,

934
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,720
you know, this is a good like lock the
door test in the relationship to be like,

935
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:54,710
yeah, I don't want to do that. I don't
have any tattoos. I'm not a tattoo guy.

936
00:55:54,711 --> 00:55:56,240
I respect the fact that you did that.

937
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:59,570
I respect what that means and what that
means on your arm is in my heart and I

938
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,240
don't need to draw it on my arm and it,

939
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,870
if that is a deal breaker and you're
going to break up with me then then that,

940
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,740
that's fucking great.
I didn't do it. Okay.

941
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,520
Don't do it. You hear me, sir? Do not.

942
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:15,650
Okay.

943
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,280
You know, let me ask you this. If you
got the tattoo and she didn't do it,

944
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:21,980
would you break up with her?
The answer's fucking no.

945
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,070
Then why the fuck should that be a
deal breaker the other way around?

946
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:31,890
If the answer is yes, then you're fucking
crazy. And I hope she's crazy too.

947
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:36,390
And uh, you have a positive kid. Two
negatives make a positive. I don't,

948
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:39,240
I don't want to fuck. I just wouldn't
do it. I wouldn't do it. All right?

949
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,830
I thought many times in my younger time
life of getting a tattoo and I never did

950
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:48,570
and I'm so glad I did now because I
feel like not having a tattoo is like

951
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,600
rebellious or not even rebellious.
It's unique.

952
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:53,290
Okay.

953
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,101
Especially now.
You know,

954
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:57,850
I saw the first fucking person that
wasn't like a pop star walking down the

955
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:01,390
street with like a fucking face tattoo
and they were coming across the street.

956
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:05,110
I was like, what in the fuck is
that? Like I didn't know. Like I,

957
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:09,250
I couldn't tell why the person just look
different until they got up close and

958
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,670
it's like, oh my God. Oh my
God. They drew on their face.

959
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:17,080
You draw my face.
Um,

960
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,190
do destroys airport ticket machine.
Ah,

961
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,470
oh,
please tell me this is true.

962
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:29,930
That literally made my entire
body just relax. Hey, hey.

963
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:34,070
Hey Billy. Ginger nuts. A lot of stuff
about my private sis week. Everybody,

964
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:35,900
you know, there's a lot of other
things you can make fun of.

965
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,390
You might like this one.

966
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,480
Massive Korean man destroys
all the airport auto ticket
machines because his one

967
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,880
ain't working well. You know something. I
kind of liked this until he had a wreck.

968
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:51,710
Everybody else's.
Uh,

969
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:56,711
I spent a fair bit of time at this airport
and the dudes with the machine guns

970
00:57:57,411 --> 00:58:00,560
always seen to be right next to me.
Anyway,

971
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:04,580
if you get some time out of your
fancy celebrity interview podcasts,

972
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:08,540
I knew I was going to get shit
for that and want to see, uh,

973
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,770
a normal, a normal slash insane.
Can't lose his shit. Check it out.

974
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,420
Thanks for the company.

975
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:20,680
It's been great for the last five years
is so best regards to you and yours and

976
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:25,300
go fuck yourself. All right, I got
to click on this. Yeah, go to page.

977
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,370
Oh my God.
How did I miss out on this?

978
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,920
I haven't been on my Twitter
account for a couple days,

979
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:33,710
so maybe some people sent me this.
Ah Ha ha ha ha.

980
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:39,040
Oh, here we go. Come on. This
is all written in Korean.

981
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,310
I love it. This seems like
the real deal. Here we go.

982
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:43,940
Okay.

983
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,020
Oh,
don't do this to me.

984
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,510
All right.
He's smashing his luggage.

985
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:55,913
Okay.

986
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:00,560
On this thing, people are looking
at them just staring at it.

987
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,523
Okay.

988
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,580
He's taken his carry on.

989
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,100
Yeah.

990
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,710
He just tipped it over.
He tipped two of 'em over.

991
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,440
Where is the security?

992
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,360
No,
he just sorta pushed a woman.

993
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:23,510
Wow.

994
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,580
Oh,
now he's going after another one.

995
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,130
I love this guy. She, Oh my God.

996
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,513
Okay.

997
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,830
Okay. There it goes. Number four.

998
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:44,820
Yeah.

999
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:48,230
Dude, this is like the NFL.
Combine a going psycho.

1000
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:54,040
Like this guy just put up and say numbers.
He's first round draft pick.

1001
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:58,703
Yeah.

1002
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,140
He does have a sense
of entitlement though.

1003
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:01,760
Yeah.

1004
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,960
Somehow he's standing there with
his hand on his hip with his suit.

1005
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:06,340
Where is the security?

1006
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,500
Wow.
All right.

1007
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,310
I really fucking enjoyed that.

1008
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:15,810
Okay.

1009
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:19,710
Good advertisements. So where can
I buy this suitcase? Very durable.

1010
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,783
He's a comment.

1011
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:25,320
This is the English comment you are
looking for because they're all in Korean.

1012
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:29,210
Yeah. Uh, yeah. He probably,

1013
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:34,100
he got a vision of what will happen in
the future. You saw the plane crushed,

1014
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:38,480
so he tried to stop everyone on
boring to board it being positive.

1015
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:45,620
Those of you who are wondering, this is
what happened. A businessman name all die.

1016
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:50,621
Sue is arrested for drunkenness missing
his daughter's fourth birthday and his

1017
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:54,540
friend Chew Hawaiian,

1018
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,260
picks him up from the police station.
They go to the phone booth.

1019
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:00,670
Okay.

1020
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,600
Calls home.

1021
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,603
Okay.

1022
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,890
Okay. This is this bull. This
is just all bullshit. Oh my God.

1023
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:10,810
I hate everybody's trying to
just make a funny comment.

1024
01:01:10,811 --> 01:01:13,420
How come nobody's saying like,
oh my God, this is fucking great.

1025
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,510
Yo.
If this was in the states,

1026
01:01:19,511 --> 01:01:23,320
he would got chopped in the motherfucking
throat after the first kiosk went down.

1027
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,090
Korea, you got to work on your anger
management issues. There are better ways.

1028
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:30,100
Is this an American telling people this?

1029
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:35,380
There are better ways this period
is period. Not Period. Okay,

1030
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,180
period.
Shut the fuck up.

1031
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:38,750
Okay.

1032
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:43,440
Kind of a fucking asshole. Uses
that to give a lecture. Um,

1033
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,800
okay.

1034
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,320
Anyways,
uh,

1035
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,140
oh.

1036
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:56,730
Just got a message on Facebook. Call
me. I lost all my contacts there. Oh,

1037
01:01:56,731 --> 01:01:59,820

He had never know. Anyways, this is the,

1038
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:04,460
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody go fuck yourselves. Uh,

1039
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,690

I'll check in on your,

1040
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:09,900
