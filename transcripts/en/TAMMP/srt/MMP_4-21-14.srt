1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,610
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,360
April 21st,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,360
2014 being recorded live on
digital tape and the good all you

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,500
in my fucking bedroom. Oh Man. It's
great to be back. Well, let me tell Ya.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,330
Well I'll tell ya and a crazy flight
color back. Yeah, no, I am. Uh,

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,740
I'm excited to be back. I'm happy to
be back. Uh, I didn't want to leave,

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,690
but you know, some point you got
to grow up, right? Go back to work.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,770
You know, put some food,
no fucking brown sack.

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,150
Getting to some fucking car that has a
hatchback inch your way into traffic.

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,170
Can I go? Can I go? Thank you.
Thank you. One person who cares,

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,653
you know,

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,920
to put on Jack FM and sit there and cry
as they call songs that you thought came

13
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:04,570
out two weeks ago. Classics. Good.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,610
It's been a long time.

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,370
That's a 40th anniversary.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,910
Some metal heads going to co mutually the
cube and the TV would go fuck yourself.

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,650
All right, take off. You have rob Helford,

18
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:27,420
leather studded gloves and go clean up
the garbage to scope disposal. Right.

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,010
What did I say?
Garbage disposal.

20
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,840
Cause that's what I think of
when I think of those gloves.

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,800
The ones that go all the way
up to your elbows, you know,

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,340
basically the glove form
of superhero boots. Um,

23
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,920
anyway, so this is the Monday morning
podcast. If you're new to the podcast,

24
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,840
welcome.
Thank you for listening.

25
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:50,580
I know you have your choice between mine
and nine zillion other fucking podcasts.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,480
I mean at this point, I mean, you
guys could all have a podcast,

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,950
but why would you do that?

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,380
Why would you do that when you could
just sit down and listen to someone else

29
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:04,770
attempt to do it? I don't
fucking know. Um, yes.

30
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,190
So back in the United States and uh,

31
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,900
I had an unbelievable trip.
You know what fucking story I kept trying,

32
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,850
I kept forgetting to tell
you guys and a helmet on.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,450
It's still boring you with
stories about France, but I,

34
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:23,790
I did have a fucking great time over
there. Um, which is an understatement.

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,760
Anyways,
I know like two weeks ago I told you,

36
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:31,740
or last week I told you the story
going to Omaha beach and the uh,

37
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:35,280
the American soldiers cemetery over
there and all that type of stuff. And um,

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,400
one of my podcast listeners sent me an
email a couple of months ago talking

39
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:43,830
about how after he took
the tour the next morning,

40
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,660
he woke up early and went down to Omaha
beach when there was nobody there,

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,980
you know, maybe one guy with
a dog and a Frisbee. Right?

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,960
And he just sat there on the, uh, on
the, on the beach and smoked a cigar.

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,350
And I was like, I got to fucking do
that. Right? I gotta fucking do that.

44
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,430
So I got my cigar,

45
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,490
I take the tour and I got that big stupid
Mercedes nine passenger bus that they

46
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:13,090
rented me. Cause I wanted a car
one way. And as I've told you guys,

47
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:16,210
time and time again on this podcast,
when you rent a car one way,

48
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:20,440
you are getting the fucking ugly duckling,
the one that they can't rent out.

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,580
You get in the Griswold family truckster
and that's what they gave me for two

50
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,410
fucking people, nine passenger. Right?

51
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,310
So I wake up the next morning
early nehes still sleeping and um,

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,191
you know,

53
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:38,170
my phone is dead and I'm not going to
take her phone because I don't to be here.

54
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,270
Why did you take my phone?

55
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,550
I was looking for it. I didn't
want to deal with that. Right?

56
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,330
So what I have is I have this gps
that was the shit in about 2002.

57
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,030
Okay.

58
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,820
I'm in another country.
I don't speak the language.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,550
It's about eight o'clock in the morning.

60
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,870
And I go out and I get it in this
fucking nine passenger bus by myself.

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,480
And I start driving and I already
can't get it to say Omaha beach.

62
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,720
I can't read half the signs. And I'm
just laughing as I'm driving away going,

63
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:16,830
I'm going to get lost.

64
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,180
And I keep turning around every
time I make a left to turn around.

65
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,010
And rather than looking at a sign,

66
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm trying to look at something that
stands out, a billboard or something.

67
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,410
And I'm trying to remember like,
remember that fucking game, Simon, right.

68
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,400
The little colors and it would go
all around is a fucking great game.

69
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,590
Great electronic game.
One of the few that I was allowed to have,

70
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,990
my parents never gave his video games,

71
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,630
never let us do any of that shit cause
they thought it was going to affect our

72
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:50,340
studies. You know, my dad's
like, you're not watching that
shit. Everybody. But yeah,

73
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,330
I want to play asteroids fucking books.
You know,

74
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,760
it's funny as I still flunked
everything in high school,

75
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,320
so maybe should've let me
play miss [inaudible] man.

76
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,800
Um, I didn't flunk it, but
I was in the, you know, if,

77
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,500
if my high school class was a
batting lineup, I was baton eighth,

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,090
right. Right before the
catcher. Um, anyways,

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,370
so,
uh,

80
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,750
so I get in this van and
I'm fucking laughing and I'm
trying to feel my way back

81
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:25,510
to where the tour guy drove us.
And you know,

82
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,870
every fucking 20 seconds is a goddamn
rotary round and round and round.

83
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,570
You go and you spit out the van and
I have no fucking idea where I'm at.

84
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,200
So I'm just laughing. I'm like, I don't
give a fuck. I know where the beach,

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,620
I know the beaches in this direction.
I'm just going in this direction.

86
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,650
And then I know I go left, go, shh.

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,540
As the French people say I'm going left
and then I'm just going to drive until I

88
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,120
see it and I'm going to get there.
And when smoke my cigar,

89
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,240
I'm going to complete this fucking
mission, right. And A and in way.

90
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,290
And I'll deal with the fact that I don't
know how to get back and that I have a

91
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:07,340
flight to catch, you know,
early afternoon. So, uh,

92
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,400
actually it wasn't even
eight in the morning.

93
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,220
He was like nine by the
time I got up or whatever.

94
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:12,320
So I kind of blew the
early morning part of it,

95
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,000
but I still wanted to go smoke the cigar.

96
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,380
So I'm driving and this
fucking thing is just taken me,

97
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,630
you know, I can't figure out how to input
it. I can't, there's no enter button.

98
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,051
I can't.

99
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,580
I'm going Omaha beach and I'm yelling at
the fucking thing and I'm screaming at

100
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,780
the about the rental car people.

101
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:34,130
How can you rent this fucking piece of
shit out and charge somebody fucking 20

102
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,610
francs a day for this God damn thing
or euros, whatever the fuck they on.

103
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,300
And I'm driving down the road and I
got the radio on because I'm trying to

104
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,400
immerse myself in the language.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,680
That's what you supposed to do
when you learn a new language,

106
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:52,100
you just immerse yourself in it. Although
I'm sitting there speaking English,

107
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,090
which I shouldn't be doing,

108
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,180
I should be going mayor zoot or whatever
the fuck I was supposed to be yelling.

109
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,220
Um, but I wasn't, I was, I was speaking
in English. So anyways, I had on,

110
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:06,221
this is the point of the story I had
on French talk radio and it was fucking

111
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:12,920
hilarious. First of all to
speak at 90 miles an hour.
And I'm, I'm just, by the way,

112
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:17,390
they're talking, you can tell basically,
I don't know what they're talking about,

113
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,600
but you can kind of figure out like
what's going on. And somebody was like,

114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,680
you know,
is we'll have a zip.

115
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,980
And then some other guy goes like
[inaudible] and the other guys like

116
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,570
[inaudible]. So it says the guy said
something and the other guy goes,

117
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:32,030
you know what the fuck's in? And the other
guy goes, no, no, no. I'm not saying,

118
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:36,560
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm
just, you know, I'm just saying, oh Cleo,

119
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,650
what's up buddy? You haven't
been on the podcast in a while.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

120
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:42,560
Get off the bed. Get off to
bed. Get off to bed. Sorry.

121
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,130
Can a fucking hit stop on the
record button. So anyways,

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,670
these guys are going back to Egypt.
The most helpful. You're getting money.

123
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,770
No then no, Eh, eh. So anyways,

124
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,290
I'm listening to this shit
and now I'm driving into fog.

125
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,260
I'm completely fucking lost and
I'm listening to these guys.

126
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,860
And what's funny over there is when
people talk and they're searching for a

127
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:10,980
word, they don't go, ah, cause
that's actually a word like Isla.

128
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,770
So you'd be like, have, so you be
going have, you wouldn't do that.

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,970
So what they do, they say is this is, this
is my, I think this is what's going on.

130
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,130
So rather than going I
or, um, they go, Ooh,

131
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,520
like e the EU are almost,
Ooh.

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,210
And so they kept doing that going,
Ooh,

133
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,770
as I'm driving through the fucking
fog and I'm laughing, just go, Ooh,

134
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,740
imitating the Shit is, I'm trying to
find this beach. And then, you know,

135
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:44,590
like when you trying to make a
point in any language, you're like,

136
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,260
you know, this guy is, is, is,
is, or you know, these people,

137
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,100
what they traded do it, whatever
you say, like the fucking word,

138
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:55,980
like 15 times in a row. So that's what
they kept going. They kept going like

139
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,560
a [inaudible] do, do, do.

140
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,510
And I'm driving in the fog. Go, go on a

141
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,970
stupid fucking French people.

142
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:10,730
I was screaming about them and the
stupid thing and long story short,

143
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,130
this fucking,
this fucking a tare,

144
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,660
mapquest, whatever the fuck
you call it makes me go left.

145
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:24,470
I'm going down these farm roads.
All right.

146
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:29,471
And now it literally feels like it's
1944 and some Germans are going to come

147
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:34,220
around the corner with a motorcycle
and a sidecar. I'm driving by the, uh,

148
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:35,330
the hedge rows.

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,440
I'm getting to like dark
roads and I'm just laughing.

150
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:43,100
I have no fucking idea where I'm at.
It's foggy.

151
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm on a road that's so fucking small,

152
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:49,130
like I literally have to pull this
bus over to let somebody else go by.

153
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,660
They give the wave over there, by
the way, and I'm just driving a

154
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,463
Ooh,

155
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,540
drive on my way through
this fucking thing.

156
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:03,541
And I finally make it to the road like
an hour later and my flight is leaving at

157
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,090
two and a half hours.
I have no fucking idea how to get back.

158
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,020
And I get to the place where I'm going
to make the left to drive up to the beach

159
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,500
and it says road closed,
you know,

160
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,840
and you gotta be sitting
there going, Bill, you know,

161
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,760
3000 people died that way that day.
I mean on that beach.

162
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,800
They saw their mission through,

163
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,260
they just kept common and common and
common until they fucking met their

164
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:34,094
objective.

165
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Are you going to let one little French
police barricade that says erect or stop,

166
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:46,670
whatever the fuck it says you're going
to let that stop you or are you just

167
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:50,600
going to drive this nine passenger van
around it and use the fact that you don't

168
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:54,180
speak the language as a God damn.
Excuse it.

169
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,280
Ooh, do, do, do, do

170
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,300
right. I pussied out. I was just like,

171
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,580
I gotta go to the fucking airport.
I don't even know where I'm at.

172
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:07,050
And I fucking turned around like the
coward that cries in the foxhole.

173
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,140
So now I've drive it back into the fog

174
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,200
as you, but do you have it?
You have to a do a De, de, de,

175
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,020
de and all.
Uh,

176
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,050
those kinds sweats all teeth.

177
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,270
Drive it back into this fucking fog.

178
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,730
Okay.

179
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,860
And will you on Joey? Doo, Doo, Doo Doo.

180
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,790
And don't, it took me like fucking,
it took me like fucking two hours.

181
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,370
We almost missed our goddamn flight.

182
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,020
I'm driving around rotary after fucking
rotary and I can't find this place.

183
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:43,730
And then finally I came in bay. You,
they have like this old part of town,

184
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,140
you know, they got all the lead home
strip malls and shit. Not Strip malls,

185
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:53,060
but just like just regular shit
please to get 1 cent beach, um,

186
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,460
awesome. [inaudible] on jewelry.
They got all that bullshit,

187
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,550
right? But then in the center of town,
they have like the old school, like,

188
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,460
like the old part of town,
like old Montreal, Old Vegas,

189
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,080
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

190
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,630
So I see this church and I'm like,

191
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:14,920
I remember that fucking church.

192
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:19,360
My hotel is somewhere near that church
and there's a little brook near it.

193
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,790
So I drive back and it was
the most frustrating half
hour my life. Cause I knew

194
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,840
that I was near my fucking hotel, but
I just couldn't find the fucking thing.

195
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,830
And finally

196
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,900
I found the brook and what I had to do,
I had to just,

197
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:42,901
I just got out of the van and started
walking around and then I finally,

198
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,250
and I'm walking up to people and
I'm going, uh, uh, excuse me. Um,

199
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:52,810
why? Uh, I was doing that. I was going,
ah, so it's actually going to excuse him.

200
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,480
Why subsequent, excuse me, have, um,

201
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,890
or has whatever I'm saying.
I was like, excuse him,

202
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:06,190
why [inaudible] uh,

203
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,630
Winston Churchill Motel,
motel day, Winston Churchill,

204
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,270
because that wasn't even named my hotel,
but I,

205
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,670
my hotel was right next to
it and then it would be like,

206
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,220
uh, Jenna, they go, God
dammit, fuck. And I,

207
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:25,570
it took me like five people
walking up to him, um,

208
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,720
and I finally was able to find the brook
and then I found it and I saw them if

209
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,790
there's my fucking hotel.
And then I just took this,

210
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:38,220
I had to run back to the van and weave my
way around it. I'm freaking out, no one,

211
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:43,100
my wife's going to be pissed at me and
I finally get to the hotel and, uh,

212
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,580
we got enough time to get to the airport
and I fucking go in a hotel room and

213
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:49,810
she's still sleeping. She's still
sleeping. She's like, hey baby,

214
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,250
did you make it to the beach? And
I was like, no, I couldn't find it.

215
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,570
That stupid piece of shit.

216
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,810
Mapquest fucking thing from 1982 took me
down a country road and she just goes,

217
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,880
oh,
why didn't you just take my phone honey?

218
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,700
And that's the story.

219
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,570
Um, but anyways, I'm keeping up with my,
my French shit. Um, I'm going to try to,

220
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:19,840
uh, I dunno, I gave up on
the Spanish stuff. I just,

221
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,280
there's something about
the French language where I
flunked it for three years

222
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,210
in high school and it's familiar and I,

223
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:31,210
and I feel like maybe through learning
French I could somehow learn Spanish.

224
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,730
I don't know. A lot of you guys are
sitting there going, fuck you, Bill.

225
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:36,370
You're never going to learn this shit.
And you know what? I thrive off of that.

226
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,360
Go Fuck Yourself. I'm going to learn
how to speak it. And when I do,

227
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:43,410
I'm going to do an entire podcast
and French on for, I'll say,

00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:05,200
That was pretty good reading for
this week. Um, oh by the way,

270
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,210
uh, I've been obsessed with, um,

271
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:14,050
with German cars ever since.
Um, I went on that day,

272
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,520
that Dee day trip, you know, and
I looked at one of our tanks,

273
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,960
you know, our tag basically if
a Chevy Chevette was a tank,

274
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,640
that's what the fuck we were
rolling out a, which once again is,

275
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:30,730
I'm really starting to understand why
Tom Brokaw called them the greatest

276
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:33,170
generation because, uh, I,

277
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,090
I couldn't even make it to Omaha beach
in a fucking Mercedes Benz nine passenger

278
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,860
with fucking satellite help you,

279
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,710
these tanks compared to what the
Germans had. It's unfucking believable.

280
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:48,490
So I actually, I, you guys got to see
this video that I watched this week.

281
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:52,270
If you're into, they basically show, um,

282
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,440
then putting together the engine that
they stick in one of their unbelievable

283
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,890
cars.
And this guy hand builds the entire thing.

284
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:03,000
What the help of some actually some really
cool robots and you know that I'm not

285
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:03,834
into robots,

286
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,530
but what I like about these robots is
they're doing the pain in the ass job that

287
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:08,364
you don't want to do.

288
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,730
Like you know when you squeeze that
fucking glue I guess to basically,

289
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,960
I don't know if you're
sealing the head to the block,

290
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,200
I thought there was a gasket there. I
have no idea. It was one of those deals.

291
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,610
I didn't one of those deals, but this
fucking robot thing just, it's got the,

292
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,720
the sealer and it fucking
goes right around the edge.

293
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,390
And then when he get to his screw
it goes like around the rotary,

294
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,560
like me in the bus and then just
fucking continues on and it's perfect.

295
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,271
Then you line up.

296
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:41,271
So basically the guy puts
the whole glorious engine
together and then in the end

297
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,280
he has his own seal with his name.

298
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:49,230
He puts his fucking name on
the engine and a, I was like,

299
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,910
oh my God,
I got to get a Mercedes someday.

300
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,000
And then I looked up how much they
cost and I was like, oh my God,

301
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,800
I got to rent a Mercedes someday.

302
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,240
I know he can get some
of the smaller ones,

303
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,690
but you know the one you fucking want,
you know,

304
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,440
you know the Mercedes you want,
you don't want to get those fucking,

305
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:12,030
the lower end ones. Fuck those ones. You
want the one that you're walking up to,

306
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,480
somebody opens the door for you and
you have a briefcase handcuffed to your

307
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:20,250
fucking wrist. That's the model you
want. Like the one I looked up, I'm like,

308
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,550
well fuck this. What's the best
one that got? So they're uh,

309
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,280
basically in the BMW's got the m's,
the m series,

310
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:30,150
the m five [inaudible] three and all
that with Mercedes, they have the AMG.

311
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:32,790
So I'm like, oh, let me check out
was a fucking four door sedan.

312
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:37,440
They weren't a $237,000 for
this fucking thing, you know?

313
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,110
And I was just like, all right,
well, you know, that was, that was,

314
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,390
that was a fun fantasy.

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,670
Maybe they'll go buy a used one from
somebody getting a goddamned divorce or

316
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:51,900
some shit. I don't know
what, but I definitely got
to, hopefully I'll remember.

317
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,050
Maybe I'll make a note right now.
I'll do that. Cause I always say,

318
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,420
and I'm going to put that video up.
Hey everybody,

319
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,220
I'm putting the video up and a,

320
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:03,150
I guess what it's going to be up
on the website and it never is.

321
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,390
If you guys just saw how I just
typed Mercedes with my right hand,

322
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm lefthanded Mer ces mercies.
MERCI.

323
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,950
MERCI. Wait a minute. I put
the damn, I swear to God.

324
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,500

325
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,780
C. E. D. E. S. That looks
right. Right? Mercedes video.

326
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,230
Stupid.
Why do you have to install your yourself?

327
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,260
Why can't you love yourself and just
tie a string around your finger?

328
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,460
Um, anyways. Yes.

329
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:40,410
So I am back in the United States of
America and uh, I'm getting back to a,

330
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:43,740
watching American sports and um,

331
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,240
Jesus Christ, my picks week,
I swear to God and the Nhl.

332
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,950
What a fucking train wreck that was.
That was like some Paul Versey Shit.

333
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,400
I went on there and I only picked one
upset. I really hope he hears that.

334
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,310
Can you guys please send
that link to him like Paul?

335
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:03,430
Like please send to this entire section
if he can't. Paul, you listen to this.

336
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,290
I went,
I did what you did.

337
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,670
I went with all the fucking favorites and
I'm going to give you my results right

338
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:14,590
now. If you're listening. New Jersey
Zone, dude, I called it Paul Versey.

339
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,390
Alright. Flyers verse the
Rangers. I picked the fucking,

340
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,990
that series is actually one one.
Boston,

341
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:30,340
Detroit. I picked a Bruins.
That series is one. One. Uh,

342
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,960
Montreal actually picked Montreal. Jesus
Christ. Where the fuck are all my losses?

343
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,410
Oh yeah, San Jose, Los
Angeles. I picked Los Angeles.

344
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:39,670
I guess they're not the favorites,

345
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:44,110
but I looked at San Jose fucking they
like when the president's trophy every

346
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,400
year. Then they fucking, they lose
usually in the first goddamn round.

347
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:52,960
I'm not shitting on the San Jose Sharks.
Come on Jack.

348
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,320
Mvp Sports. We got all the
jerseys. We got the shacks.

349
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,090
The seal is the charges in more.
Um, I'll never forget that.

350
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:03,190
Read every time I say San Jose Sharks,

351
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,880
I always think about MVP sports in Boston.
Um,

352
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,430
yeah, so I just, they just
stay. They do whatever year.
I'm stating a fact. Alright.

353
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,500
Pittsburgh. Columbus. I picked the, uh,
the penguins. That's one. One. Colorado,

354
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:21,190
Minnesota. Pick Minnesota that
download to Chicago. Saint Louis.

355
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:25,070
I picked the blues. I bet. I'm sorry
I picked Chicago. They're down o two.

356
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,190
I don't know. But anyways, it's been
a hell of a fucking, uh, actually my,

357
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,680
wait a minute, let's go
back here. Was I that bad?

358
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,520
Maybe I'm giving versus a compliment. All
right. Minnesota while they pick them,

359
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,910
they download two black
hawks. They down. Oh two.

360
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,380
I did pick the ducks.
I picked the king's deer down.

361
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:50,260
O Two. I picked J I think that
I'm doing all right. Look,

362
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,290
if the brewers win this series and the
fucking penguins win that series and the

363
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:57,900
flyers when then I, I think
I'm all right. And then,

364
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:02,370
you know what I would hope Paul
Versey and apology. Um, anyways,

365
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,150
how great is the playoffs, man? I swear
to God, if you're still watch an NBA hoop,

366
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,420
I understand it. It's a great
game to watch, but come on.

367
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,610
Why don't you watch a real fucking
leak instead of the NBA? Who's kidding?

368
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,190
Who if you really watched the NBA,

369
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,130
I mean that is the most
manipulated fucking sport.

370
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,740
Okay?

371
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,470
I mean, I know it's all, all of
them are a God damn business.

372
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,780
I would say the NFL is
the least manipulated.

373
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,760
And I know a lot of people
don't like the new rules,

374
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:32,570
but everybody's got to play by him.
But like I've said this a zillion times,

375
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:36,470
but everybody's got to fucking Seahawks.
Goddamn Seahawks.

376
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,210
Just want to fucking Superbowl.

377
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,610
Okay,

378
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,443
that's great.

379
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,080
One of the fuck of the Marin is going to
be in a position where they could spend

380
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,440
money to compete with the red sox and
the Yankees and they can give me a break

381
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,760
and ain't fucking happening.

382
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,840
Although they just blew a bunch
of money on Robinson Cano.

383
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,120
Okay.

384
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,620
Paul versus man crush.

385
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,613
MMM.

386
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,810
They had the fuck. They said
what a bunch of idiots they were.

387
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,400
Did they learn anything from the
Texas fucking ranges? You know,

388
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:10,450
blow 200 million on a shortstop
and you have no money for pitching.

389
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:13,270
So you didn't blow 200 oh what if
it's on the other side of second base?

390
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:16,690
What's a little fucking blow 200
million on this guy. So anyways,

391
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,180
the uh, yeah, the NBA is basically
a, I feel like the NBA is like,

392
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,550
it's like wrestling two years before they
admitted that it's just was all right,

393
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,811
you know,

394
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:32,650
were fake fighting but we're really
hurting each other and then everybody was

395
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:35,050
just like, all right cool. You
know, and we'll, we'll go with this.

396
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,080
That's what they should do in the NBA.
Just go look,

397
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,940
they're really playing the games.
But you know,

398
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,970
we got to make sure certain teams get
to a certain point in the playoffs so we

399
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:54,581
could get the ratings we need so we can
all make our money and we refused to pay

400
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:57,740
the referees anything more
than we're giving them,

401
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,380
despite the fact that an,

402
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,440
an NBA official has more power than any
other official in the four major sports.

403
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,340
Okay.

404
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,700
Now I just pause there cause I went for
all the fucking more on sports fans will

405
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,600
be like, yeah, you put the
bullshit. It's true. No other sport.

406
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:19,650
Can you just sit at fucking
guy down a star player.

407
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,860
You can sit them down in the first
quarter. Give them two quick ones.

408
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,850
Second quarter, give him that. I've
said this a zillion fucking time.

409
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,750
She can keep them on the bench.
The whole God damn game. Yeah.

410
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:30,830
You can't keep Tom Brady on the bench.
You,

411
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,520
you'd have to kick them out for something.

412
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,040
But what does Tom Brady going to do
that's gonna make you kick them out? Huh?

413
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,750
You could, what are you gonna penalize
him for his Dimbleby in too deep. Right?

414
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,860
Do you going to take out some
measuring things? Stick like woods.

415
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,940
Somebody has like a two curve to stick
in hockey. You're not throwing them out

416
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,530
anyways. I'm not saying you
can't manipulate the game,

417
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:56,320
but nowhere can you manipulate
it more than the fucking NBA.

418
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,310
So I'm just saying come on over
and watch the fucking hockey. It's,

419
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:03,400
it's been unbelievable so
far. And, uh, the Bruins,

420
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,470
uh, Detroit series is, is, is
shaping up to go seven games.

421
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:11,140
It's been fucking great. Uh, the game one.

422
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,393
MMM.

423
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,990
I mean, they just made us look old
and slow. Detroit is so God damn fast.

424
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:18,950
And let me ask you this.

425
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:23,270
When was the last time you saw Detroit
Redwings team where every pass wasn't

426
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:27,190
tape to tape. Like what, 1994. I mean,

427
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:30,730
they going on like fucking 17 years.

428
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,960
The puck movement on that
team is fucking unbelievable.

429
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,000
And that souk is from another planet.

430
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:41,530
That goal that he scored to win game one.
It was so fucking good.

431
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:45,420
I couldn't even get mad. I mean, it
definitely took the wind out of my sails,

432
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:50,410
but I was just like, Jesus Christ, that
was the thing of fucking beauty. Um,

433
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,170
that backhand pass he had in game two.
He's fucking incredible. And uh, so what,

434
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:58,310
anyways, they basically, for those of
you who weren't watching, they, um,

435
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,510
they were just flying all around the
ice and we look like we were like a

436
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,100
division two hockey team
trying to keep up with them.

437
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:08,110
So you knew what was going to
happen. All right. Game Two,

438
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:11,410
we're going to get physical and
that's what we were able to do.

439
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:16,000
So now game three, uh, is coming
up. Now they're going to adjust.

440
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,150
Yeah.

441
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,490
You know, to us getting
physical with them, you know,

442
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:23,480
it's always hard after you
won a fucking game too. Um,

443
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,730
you know, to win that next game
in the playoffs because you know,

444
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:32,360
you won the game, so you're like, yeah,
I guess we keep doing what we're doing.

445
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,390
You basically have to wait to
see the other teams adjustments.

446
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:39,020
That's why I love playoff series and uh,
and that type of stuff.

447
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:41,990
So I know there's a bunch of Detroit
Redwings fangs and haters or the Bruins

448
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:42,261
fans.

449
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:47,210
Right now you probably have your face
like a centimeter away from your Jesus

450
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,961
Christ.
How long was that in Europe?

451
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:52,160
Like an inch away from your fucking
a millimeter away from your, uh,

452
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,640
your recording device right now going,
is he going to bring up Milan,

453
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,690
Lou Cheech in his piece of
shit? Yes. Move. Absolutely.

454
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,500
Somebody said go. I would love to
hear you. Dyfed Milan blue cheese.

455
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,730
He basically speared this guy.

456
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,873
MMM.

457
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,070
Like I think he got half taint, half
ball bag, hopefully the guys balls,

458
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,890
hopefully Milan stick.
He basically,

459
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,520
he hit the sweet spot of the ball bag
that causes both of your fucking balls to

460
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:26,120
go sideways.

461
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,450
Like those side impact airbags
just fucking to the side.

462
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,560
And then his stick came down
before they clang back together,

463
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,910
which still would definitely hurt.

464
00:28:36,911 --> 00:28:38,440
But when are they going
to clang back together?

465
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:43,441
You'd rather be bald the ball rather than
both balls hitting the fucking wood or

466
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,000
the whatever the fuck
his sticks made out of.

467
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:51,001
Now that's the second time he's done
that in three fucking weeks and I can't

468
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:58,130
defend it.
I think he should've got suspended.

469
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,380
I think it's a fucking joke
that that was a $5,000 fine.

470
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,720
$5,000 fine.

471
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:10,721
So basically what you're telling me
NHL is you're telling me that Danny

472
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,460
Dekeyser, Kaiser's balls are
worth no more than 2,500 each.

473
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,410
Is that what you're telling me?

474
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:23,411
I'm your for your basically fucking with
the man's ability to start a family.

475
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,380
This goes beyond the game.
A hockey

476
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,603
that,

477
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,170
look, you know what it is,
is it's, it's a new move.

478
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,050
I haven't seen anybody
do that consistently.

479
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:39,310
I've seen somebody while somebody
is looking at him, you know,

480
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:44,700
and it's the shaft of the, and they'll
kind of fucking bring it up like that. Oh,

481
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,780
he acted it out. You like
that? No, fucking bring it up.

482
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,960
But to have a guy skating
up the fucking ice,

483
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,160
not even looking at you and you come
there and you turn your stick in the blade

484
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,023
up.

485
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,490
Okay.

486
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,200
And give the guy a fucking would up a
cut to his Tate and ball area. I mean,

487
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:05,460
Jesus Christ. I'll tell you that. That's,

488
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:10,470
that's some new forensic shit right there.
You know, actually you don't use that.

489
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,400
That's actually the only person who knows
what that bruises looks like is a Gyn

490
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:19,170
forensics. Actually, I got, I got, I
got a Bruce Ball bag and taint one time.

491
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,480
I don't know if I ever
told you guys this story.

492
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:25,440
I was working in a warehouse and a,
we had a softball team.

493
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,580
I was basically an excuse for
people to drink fucking, uh,

494
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,220
cause lite and wine coolers.
It was the 80s,

495
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,390
the lady's tea did drink the wine coolers
and then when I played in the league,

496
00:30:36,391 --> 00:30:40,830
it was right before, you know,
wine coolers suggest come out.

497
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:44,730
So there was actually a few guys
having some out of a four pack.

498
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,700
Uh,
and it was,

499
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,060
it was that maybe that three week
window before it closed where you're,

500
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,630
your entire manhood was judged if
you ever had a fucking wine cooler.

501
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,280
But there was, when they
first came out, you know,

502
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:03,540
Bartles and Jaymes these two fucking cute
old guys doing these silly commercials

503
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:07,540
that it was actually, oh, let me try
this. You know, they, that was the,

504
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,880
that that was like the Zima
version of wine. So anyways,

505
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,030
anyways, so whatever, I'm on base,

506
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,450
I'm trying to go first to third
on some fucking single, the right.

507
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,730
And My boss is on third base and the ball
comes in. Oh, came in from left field.

508
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:25,790
So I must've been on second base.
I never had any wheels,

509
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:26,670
so there's no fucking way.

510
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,920
I was trying to go first to
third on something that's left.

511
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,220
So I'm running into second and I come
in standing up and they threw the ball

512
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:35,640
was,

513
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,520
maybe it was the centerfield cause they
throw it to the outside a third base.

514
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,260
So he's basically,
he's reaching over on the,

515
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,760
into foul territory and
he back handed backhand.

516
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,800
How did he do it?
Yay.

517
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,600
He backhanded it and then
swooped up to try to tag me.

518
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,860
And I came in standing up and he fucking
with the ball in the web of his glove,

519
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,870
went fucking full lop to
my fucking under carriage.

520
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,540
And I remember standing on third
base waiting for the paint,

521
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,830
you know,
like it didn't happen at first.

522
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:16,430
And then immediately I'm thinking of that
Eddie Murphy bit that he did on one of

523
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:20,000
his specials where when you
get hit in the balls so bad,

524
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:23,600
there's that delay and then
the, uh, then, then, then yeah,

525
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,560
that's usually a medium hit. If you get
hit in the balls really bad, you just go,

526
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,000
oh,
and you go down.

527
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,690
But if there's that there's that light
to medium hit where you get hit and it,

528
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:40,010
there's a delay in the penalty, the
penalty, the, the, the pain. Um,

529
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,090
I dunno, Eddie Murphy did a fucking
phenomenal bid on it. So anyways,

530
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,350
and it never came.

531
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,940
And I'm standing there and I'm sitting
there waiting for people to start giving

532
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:50,870
me shit to be like,
dude,

533
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:55,100
you just got hit in the balls and you
didn't feel any pain. How small are they?

534
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,630
Right.
And it wasn't until like fucking

535
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,390
like two, three days later,
I'm in the shower, right?

536
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,340
And I'm cleaning myself and
all of a sudden I just fucking,

537
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,120
I don't know how I, they all had a
fuck. Do you look at your tank? I Dunno.

538
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:18,680
I was washing my ball bag and I
saw a little bit of Cola, right.

539
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,770
Look down and I swear to God,

540
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,880
the back half of my sac right to
the tape was like popsicle purple.

541
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,160
All right. And I didn't even feel
that. So I can't even imagine

542
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,240
what fucking poor daddy to cars,

543
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:49,130
his ball bag and fucking taint look
when he took a piece of lumber.

544
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,720
I mean, it's just completely, and I'm
gonna say this, Milan, Lou Cheech,

545
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,360
he had up until this point,

546
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,170
other than just the haters that don't
like it because he's a classic power

547
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,490
forward that can score goals and beat the
fuck out of anybody on your team if he

548
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:05,324
chooses.

549
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,353
Right.

550
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,350
And I don't want to hear
any of you guys going like,

551
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:13,250
go blue picto he booked on the fucking,

552
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,120
who the fuck was the goad the
Canadians had back in the day?

553
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,620
He was actually one of the, uh, uh,
I shouldn't say gone. He was the one,

554
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,350
he made it an art form. Charles,
uh, George de la rock. He's like,

555
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:28,580
why does he fight that guy?
And it's just like, well, okay,

556
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,890
we're trying to win a
hockey game here is stupid.

557
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:36,250
So we're supposed to have a fucking
all star square off with the goat.

558
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,203
Okay.

559
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,890
Keep calling him a goon square off
with the goddamn artist of fighting,

560
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,230
fighting a martial artists on skates.
He supposed to fight this guy.

561
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,900
All right? I'm not saying he would have
won, but he couldn't hold, held his zone.

562
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,060
He's a fucking big guy,

563
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,260
but he's risking injury and he's going
to be sitting in the penalty box.

564
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,560
We don't have him for five fucking
minutes. And you don't have George.

565
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:05,410
Laura could stupid. It's fucking stupid.
That's like people yesterday was gay.

566
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,551
Well,

567
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:09,170
it gave me shit on Twitter asking why
Chara didn't fight that guy that he was a

568
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:13,730
foot taller than that guy was trying
to go to him into dropping the gloves.

569
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:17,330
So he sits in the penalty box and anybody
who fucking says the chart was a pussy

570
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,770
because he didn't fight that guy.

571
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,070
You're a fucking moron and
you don't understand the game.

572
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:24,110
I don't have any care how many
fucking games you watched.

573
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,760
So Danal Chara arguably still the
best defenseman in the league.

574
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:32,880
If not,
he's top two or three.

575
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,330
Okay,

576
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,090
so he's going to drop the
gloves with the forward

577
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,910
and then it go sit down
and maybe get an extra two.

578
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,450
We're an entirely different team.
When that guy's in the box, you're,

579
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:51,010
you're a fucking moron. You saw him
laughing at the guy going, all right,

580
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:55,190
you drop him first. Even then,
that would have been stupid.

581
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,950
So anyways,
loot Cheech,

582
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,420
he only had one bad incident as far as,

583
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,490
now granted I'm also prejudice cause I'm
a Bruins fan was when he fucking took a

584
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:08,180
run at a Ryan Miller. A hope. I'm
getting these names right dude.

585
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:10,400
I'm still a little jet. Like that
didn't sound right when I said it.

586
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,180
Reggie Miller, Ryan Miller. Um,

587
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,590
okay.

588
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,620
So he had that one.
Everybody has their one,

589
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:18,690
I got pissed and I got
far state of Blah Blah.

590
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,980
But now he's got that and he's got
two Spearings of the under carriage.

591
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,950
So I think from Milan to get his rep back,

592
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,030
he's going to have to be like
lady big for the next seven years.

593
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:32,910
But I think that those two,
are they going to haunt them for awhile?

594
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,790
You can't fucking do that.
You can't do that.

595
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:40,791
And that's a God damn shame that the
Nhl said that poor Danny dekeyser is

596
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:44,140
fucking balls and only worth $2,500 each.
I mean they come on

597
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,380
though.

598
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,650
Those guys at pawn shop would have
given you more fucking money for those.

599
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:53,320
And those guys don't pay shit.
Hey,

600
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:57,550
can I get 2,500 for the my balls? And
then that bald headed guy, it'd be like,

601
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,450
he'd be like, and how much you
really want? 2,500 each year,

602
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,820
cunt.
I hate that everybody a pussy on the,

603
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,550
on that fucking show
when he comes walking in,

604
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,880
you come in with that whatever you got.
And he's like, Oh yeah, that looks great.

605
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:12,770
What do you want for it? It
would, no matter what you say,

606
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:17,600
can I get 1 cent for this? He is. How much
do you really want? He's fucking joke.

607
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,010
That's what I want. Fuck off.
Now it's 2 cents. Um, anyways,

608
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,420
that's why I stopped watching that show.

609
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,370
There's something about the way that
they do that that I don't enjoy it yet.

610
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,490
I can watch fast and loud and I think
it's absolutely fucking hilarious watching

611
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,550
Richard Rawlings bus, those people
down. There's just something,

612
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,950
I don't know the way he does it.

613
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:43,770
It's so God damn funny if you guys
watch any of the new episodes.

614
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,200
Okay.

615
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,710
Where he went up and he met some
guy named so and so, six pack Magoo,

616
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,690
whatever his fucking name
in the middle of Minnesota

617
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,600
and the guys shit faced and he gives
Richard's buddy literally Ajara moonshine

618
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:00,170
that that guy starts drinking.
I forget what the fuck they went.

619
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,720
What were they trying to buy?
Oh,

620
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:09,340
a 57 Chevy. Is that what it was? Was
that the one with the dent in it?

621
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,810
I think he got it from that guy.

622
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,910
So he's trying to bust the guy down
to like 1500 bucks for this and it is,

623
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,250
it is a hunk of shit. But he, but it's
a 57 Chevy so he knows that, you know,

624
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,340
he can flip this thing and this guy's
hammered and he wants 1800 bucks and

625
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:29,200
Richard won't go above 1500 so the guy
breaks out some days and they rolled the

626
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:31,570
dice on the hood of the car and he
right there. I mean it's just, come on,

627
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,270
let's fucking America right there by way
he lost and he had to pay an 1800 bucks,

628
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:39,740
but still we got a 57 1800
bucks. It was a good, I'm, I'm,

629
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:44,110
I'm totally on a tangent
here. Um, so anyways,

630
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,010
so there you go to Detroit,

631
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:48,940
red wings fans and everybody else and
I want you to remember this. All right?

632
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:52,300
You myopic cunts. When somebody on
your team does something filthy,

633
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,500
don't be that Douche in
the sports bar who just,

634
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,760
who just blindly defend your fucking team.

635
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:59,620
If you have somebody on your
team does a piece of shit move,

636
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:02,260
you've got to call him. He got to call
it out and say it's a piece of shit move.

637
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:05,020
And that was an unbelievable
fucking piece of shit move.

638
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,530
He should've got suspended
and, and like, come on,

639
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,990
my balls are worth more than 2,500
bucks each. And I'm not, I'm not,

640
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:17,670
I'm not in the playoffs. I'm not even
in the league. I played pickup hockey.

641
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,010
Okay. And if you fucking hit me in
the nuts hard enough. All right.

642
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,070
When I go to sue you,
I'm not suing you for five grand.

643
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,300
All right, so there we go. There we go.

644
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,340
We are well into the podcast here.

645
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,750
The poor like yest uh
oh hey Billy red face.

646
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:44,130
It's got to do some standup comedy here
cause I have not done any standup comedy

647
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:48,360
since a uh, I did the uh, the all ins.

648
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,940
I hosted the all end tore down it
and um,

649
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,990
so I'm going to shake the rust off.

650
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:58,320
I've got a bunch of Shit I want to talk
about cause I'm doing some gigs this

651
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,300
week in Portland, Oregon and
Oregon. Portland, Maine, sorry,

652
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,710
Montpelier, Vermont in Albany, New York.

653
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:09,900
I believe that those are the
three gigs I'm doing this weekend.

654
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:12,150
I could probably go to my
podcast and my website,

655
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,250
maybe get that information for you.

656
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:16,320
I could probably do something
like that and be organized.

657
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:18,210
But that then again then if I did that,

658
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:21,540
it would not be the Monday
morning podcasts now would it? Um,

659
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,550
speaking of, uh, podcast, uh,
the wonderful all things comedy.

660
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,050
Okay.

661
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,280
A podcast network that me, Al Madrigal
and some friends of ours have started.

662
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,900
Uh, we actually, we got some new
people that are coming aboard. Doug,

663
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,180
Stan hope's going to be coming aboard.
Uh,

664
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:43,890
we got the A and we got, um,
Dean Edwards hosting the,

665
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,950
the father McKidd the
father muck and protocol.

666
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,420
How do you not listen to that podcast?

667
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:52,620
The father McCade protocol where he talks
about the do's and don'ts and what's

668
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:56,620
been done. All right. If he dean
Edwards name sounds familiar,

669
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:01,621
that's because you've seen him on a Colin
Ferguson SNL cast member or now an MTV

670
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:06,550
two's hit the guy code.
I also does spot on impressions.

671
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,020
He does Eddie Murphy, Bernie
Mac, Don Cheadle, Chris Rock.

672
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,880
He does a good impression of me. Check
it out at the AUC things comedy network,

673
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:18,070
the [inaudible] protocol.
Um,

674
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,430
actually I don't know if I was supposed
to announce Doug Stan hope yet.

675
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,870
I'll probably just fucked that up. But
there's rumors that he's coming a board.

676
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:29,440
How about that? Huh?
Little teaser. All right,

677
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:31,750
let's read a little more advertising

691
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,100
I wonder what they fucking
have nightmares about.

692
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,540
I think they're just like us.

693
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:34,420
Like they just know what they
know and they just fucking,

694
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,250

All right.

when you think about the best
time to go to the post office,

700
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:50,140
she probably guessing before work,
after work or during lunch, wrong.

701
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,410
That's when it's the most crowded.
Everyone's going to be there at that time.

702
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:57,550
The truth is there is no convenient time
to go to the post office and that's why

703
00:42:57,551 --> 00:43:02,551
you need stamps.com stamps.com with

post office right from your desk.

00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,260
Okay.

721
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,710
All right. And lastly, but not
leastly dollar shave club. Everyone,

722
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,960
nothing feels better than the, that first
shave with a fresh blade, right? Well,

723
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:11,200
something's do, but they involve
lubricant. Other than that,

724
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,660
it's smooth. It's close and the blade
is sharp as it's ever going to be.

725
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,680
It feels fantastic. Uh, but thanks
to the big shaves companies,

726
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:24,370
ridiculous prices. You can't afford
to use a fresh blade every week.

727
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,420
Uh, listen, I want to get involved in
your money, but a lot of you can't.

728
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,090
So you drag that Dell as blade across
your face for two, three, 10 weeks.

729
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,080
Who knows? Depends on how broke you
are. Why do you do that to yourself?

730
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,390
Jesus Christ. Bill, is there a solution?

731
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:43,020
Maybe because the only thing more
painful than shaving with an old blade is

732
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:46,350
shelling out 30 bucks for a pack of new
ones. It's a complete rip off. Well,

733
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,640
if you want to enjoy a fresh blade,
a fresh pack of blades every week,

00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,760
but you know what? I'm take out a
second mortgage on your house there.

a whack. Can't you treat your face too?

746
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:32,700

Okay.

751
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,910
All right, let's get into the uh, some of
the emails here for this week. All right.

752
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,630
Caught cheating. Hey, they
have freckles, the clown.

753
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,700
I'm a married guy in my mid thirties.

754
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:03,060
I don't want to bore everyone with the
details, but I recently got cheated,

755
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:06,720
got caught cheating on my
wife with a 25 year old lady.

756
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,820
The affair went on for about four months.

757
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,690
And the truth is I really started to
like this girl after getting caught and

758
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,160
spending a few nights in a hotel,

759
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:21,161
my wife graciously suggest that we work
up with that we work on our marriage and

760
00:46:21,921 --> 00:46:26,600
try to put this mess behind us.
We have two small church children,

761
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,700
so all logic points to me agreeing to
get the help we need and to move on with

762
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:32,510
our marriage.

763
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,050
The only problem is that I can't
get this other girl out of my mind.

764
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,140
These women are two polar opposites
of each other. My wife, uh,

765
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,111
a professional,

766
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:46,160
more conservative woman and the other
girl is a 25 year old party girl.

767
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,290
I know what the clear answer is,
but I do.

768
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:53,840
I snap out of this and put this
other girl out of my mind. All right?

769
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:56,810
This is a very simple
one, sir. First of all,

770
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,060
your wife is a saint.
All right?

771
00:47:01,061 --> 00:47:05,020
That she's going to take you back and I'm
not judging you all right? I am a man.

772
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:07,300
We've all been there,
all right?

773
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:11,320
She's a sate that she's
gonna fucking take you back.

774
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:17,140
All right, so you got to treat it like
that one. And secondly, what do you do?

775
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,710
How do you get this girl out of your
mind? Easy. You wake up in the morning,

776
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,910
you walk into a bathroom, you close
the door and you'll rub one out tour,

777
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,040
and then you get on with your fucking day.
All

778
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,300
go in there, close the door, rub one out.

779
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,530
When you'd done rubbing one out,
it's just going to hit you.

780
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,330
What am I out of my fucking mind. Let's
to you describe, you know these women,

781
00:47:41,331 --> 00:47:43,520
they're two polar opposites.
My wife is a professional,

782
00:47:43,521 --> 00:47:46,760
more conservative woman and the
other is a 25 year old party girl.

783
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:47,930
Why don't you just say it?

784
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,240
Your wife is a kind of girl you marry
and this other girl is a fucking whore.

785
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,800
All right? Nah, it's not
worth it. Just fucking, just

786
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,530
get it out of his,
I'm telling you,

787
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,340
if you're any sort of an intelligent
human being, the second year rub one out,

788
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,280
you're going to be thinking,
I don't want to call that other girl.

789
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,500
What am I a fucking idiot?
You're going to look at your kids.

790
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,430
What the hell was I thinking? All
right, other than that, if you don't,

791
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:20,150
you're an idiot. All right? Because
this is what's going to happen, sir.

792
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,610
You're going to lose your wife.
Your kids are going to hate you.

793
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:23,630
You're gonna lose your house.

794
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,680
You could end up on a Futon in a studio
apartment and that 25 year old party

795
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:30,400
girl is going to move on to somebody
else and you're going to be left daily.

796
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,350
Get Dick in your hand.
So both scenarios,

797
00:48:33,351 --> 00:48:34,640
you ended up with your Dick and your hand.

798
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:38,870
Would you like to do it in a four bedroom
house or a fucking studio apartment

799
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,370
with empty Chinese food containers all
around as you cry yourself to sleep,

800
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:46,580
wondering what the fuck happened?
Jesus,

801
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,020
I gave him the lumber there. Didn't,
I was a little loose cheeks there.

802
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,640
I gave him the fucking stick between the
balls there. Um, all right, next one.

803
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,020
I am a hideous human being. Dear
bill, I'll be straight to the point.

804
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:05,240
I am 25 years old and I have been a
closet homosexual for as long as I can

805
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:09,820
remember. Well Dude, you're gay so you
will gave the second you were born.

806
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,400
That's like me being, I'm, I'm a
straight as long as I can remember.

807
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:15,310
I guess you've been in the closet
is what you're trying to say.

808
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,530
I don't you confuse me.
Maybe you're right.

809
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,320
Maybe this is another
example of me being dumb.

810
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,290
Maybe I've read the sentence
wrong. Who knows, who cares?

811
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,720
Let's continue sentence number three.

812
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,940
I come from a strict Asian immigrant
family and my parents would commit suicide

813
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,260
if they found out about my orientation.
You know,

814
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:38,560
I got scared when I saw the first
you basic, you know, orientation.

815
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,900
If you take off the
shun and put the elder,

816
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,720
that was the word that I thought Oriental
was coming on and I was going to get

817
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:45,350
in trouble here.
Um,

818
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,820
therefore I've been committing petty
crimes for the past few years to get into

819
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:55,180
jail so I could pursue and
nurture my homosexuality.

820
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,320
You calling bullshit on,

821
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:02,380
I'll answer this but I'm
calling bullshit on this one.

822
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,070
But there is something for the,
I gotta tell you though,

823
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:10,570
this is a very unique lie,
so this could actually be true.

824
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,441
You know what?

825
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:16,030
I'm going to go with this like it's
true just in case it is true and I don't

826
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:19,390
want to be yet another person turning
my back on this person. All right,

827
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:19,900
so here we go.

828
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,900
Recently I was locked up after I took
three tabs of acid and I don't really

829
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:29,300
remember how I got into the
can when I became sober.

830
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:33,080
During my trip I saw a thousand dog bites.

831
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,311
Oh,
when you were tripping,

832
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:38,760
you saw a thousand dog bites at me from
every direction and it was the worst

833
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:40,170
drug experience of my life.

834
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,460
That's why I wasn't surprised
when I woke up in jail anyway,

835
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:48,420
I was quite relieved to be away from
society until eight hours later I was

836
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:52,440
released by my parents. The cops called
them while I was tripping in jail.

837
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,200
My question is if it's
better to be in jail,

838
00:50:55,201 --> 00:51:00,201
happy and away from society or an unhappy
and vision individual that satisfies

839
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:05,050
his parents and social excellence.
Oh, if it's better, dude,

840
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,270
what are you doing? If this is
actually true, come on man, you keep,

841
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:16,570
you gotta be who you are. All
right? And, uh, I think every day,

842
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,980
I don't know where you live in the
world, but every single day, uh, I,

843
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,990
I just feel like it's that scales are
tipping in the more enlightened favorable

844
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:32,410
direction and you know what?
You can become a part of
that tipping of the scale.

845
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:38,050
Um, seeing that, that, that
kid who's going into the NFL,

846
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,990
when he talked about my,

847
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:42,820
I read that story how when he finally
came out to his teammates and he felt like

848
00:51:42,821 --> 00:51:44,710
a cinder block came off as just,

849
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,650
I know the feeling of having
to carry something around.

850
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,220
I don't know where to tell
that fucking level. So

851
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,820
yeah,

852
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,520
I don't think you're going to regret it.
All right.

853
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,170
Your parents aren't going to fucking kill
themselves. It might take them a while

854
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:01,540
okay.

855
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,890
To come around. All
right. But if they don't,

856
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:09,880
you know what? Fuck them. Okay.

857
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,180
Yeah,

858
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,940
I think they will because at the end of
the day, you're their kid. All right,

859
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,710
but what the fuck do I know? But at
the end of the day, they're there.

860
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:21,320
Every kid at the end of the day has to
make a break with their parents on some

861
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:25,070
level where your philosophies
do not line up with theirs.

862
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:28,580
And if you're truly going to pursue
what's gonna make you happy in life,

863
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,980
there has to be the cutting,
you know,

864
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,740
the metaphorical cutting of the
umbilical cord. And you have to be like,

865
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:36,770
you know what? Fuck them. I
know when I was a little kid,

866
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:40,280
to me they were gods and I wanted their
approval. And at the end of the day,

867
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:44,480
I now realize that they're human
beings and they have their flaws.

868
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,190
And what they want me to do does
not fit in with what I want to do.

869
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:53,030
And if you're not hurting
anybody, which you're not, dude,

870
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,660
w what do you think? You could dig it.
You gotta go to jail and find love.

871
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:01,520
I mean that it's not a GE. Not exactly
going with some healthy fucking people.

872
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,060
That's like,

873
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:06,410
that would be like if a woman wanted to
find a good boyfriend and she fucking

874
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:09,710
went to a place where raw guys
were locked up for abuse and women.

875
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,880
You know what I mean?
Those are some, uh, yeah,

876
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,920
you can find a better boyfriend than
that. Just go to a gay bar, I would say.

877
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,720
You know, or whatever. I don't pretend
to know what the fuck you, that's bad.

878
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,900
That's me saying to a woman, hey, you
want to be the good guy? Go to a bar.

879
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,103
Whatever.

880
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:36,320
We've reached the end of my intelligence
on this topic we probably did about

881
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:40,830
five minutes ago, but I'm too dumb to
realize it. But Dude, if this is real,

882
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,530
I'm treating it real. Hello.
It's so fucking crazy. I
don't, I don't, I don't know.

883
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,540
Don't do that. All right. If this is
actually true, I'm choosing to believe it.

884
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,810
Don't fucking do that.
All right, beloved. God,

885
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,420
just sit up doubt.
I don't know how you would do it.

886
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,960
I, you just got to sit
him down. Just say it.

887
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:07,230
Just get it out there and then you set it
and that it's out there. Yeah. You know,

888
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,580
I don't know what to do after that.
You know what?

889
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:14,780
Why don't you go meet a gay guy? I'm
sure he can fucking give you some advice.

890
00:54:14,781 --> 00:54:18,520
Why you asking me?
Why am I yelling at you?

891
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,170
I got frustrated because
I don't have the answers.

892
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,140
I feel bad for you if it's true.
All right. I hope it works out.

893
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:27,790
Don't fucking go to jail.
All right, big gaze. Great.

894
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,070
You fucking in great shape.

895
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:34,040
You've got all this disposable income
and wherever you're living you're,

896
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,850
you're making the fucking
property value go up.

897
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,270
Okay.

898
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,620
It's a lot of advantages,

899
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,083
you know?

900
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,740
Anyways, let's plow ahead.
Where are we? 54 minutes. Okay.

901
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,830
X Won't sell house.
Dear Bill,

902
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,090
big fan met you in Jacksonville a while
back. I have a quick question for you.

903
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,990
My ex fiance and I were together
for four and a half years.

904
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,260
Why the fuck did you buy a house
with somebody you're not married to?

905
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,870
All right. Now that that doesn't
help you. But if anybody listening,

906
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,640
do not buy a house, do that. Live with
somebody you're not going to marry.

907
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,470
Do not buy a house with somebody you're
not going to if you're not married.

908
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,300
Don't do that shit. Anyways.
During the relationship she read,

909
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:27,250
she remained loyal while I was deployed
to the Middle East and upon my return I

910
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:31,870
used my saved up money to buy a
house with her near the beach.

911
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,930
Oh my God.
If this fucking woman,

912
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,340
this is going to somehow make a claim
to your house that you bought with your

913
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,460
serving for our country,
putting your life on the line money.

914
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:50,240
This would be a new level of whoredom.
Is that a new word?

915
00:55:50,241 --> 00:55:51,170
I think a hoard them.

916
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:53,123
All right.

917
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,640
Am I not even really,
I know it's a new word,

918
00:55:55,641 --> 00:55:58,100
but that night and I'd be the
proper use of of it already,

919
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,810
which would be very apropos for the
type of fucking moron I am. Alright.

920
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:06,720
Hang on a second.
Where the hell I am is okay.

921
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,310
It was her dream house and I felt
that if the deployment didn't ruin us,

922
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,650
that nothing would, well, I was wrong.

923
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,060
We decided to split and I tried to be
Amy a couple. Did I say that right?

924
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,100
And let her keep the house.

925
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:25,600
If she could pay me the closing costs of
about eight grand. This is what guys do.

926
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:29,950
They just want to cut bait and
fucking leave. Women got that fucking,

927
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,700
they burrow in. She agreed. All right.

928
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,250
Why did you do that? She agreed and
I move. You bought the fucking house.

929
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:42,720
Did she kick in for it? Maybe I'm
being too hard on her. I Dunno.

930
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,770
She agreed and I moved back home
to New Jersey to start a new life.

931
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:52,440
It's been nearly a year and she's has
stalled every effort to get this resolved.

932
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,510
When a contract was finally in place,

933
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,390
she decided it needed some
amendments to protect herself.

934
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,040
That basically left me with less money
than we agreed and getting her a house

935
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:05,250
worth 150 grand for 8,000 bucks.
Dude,

936
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:09,240
I swear to fucking God if I read
one more of these fucking stories.

937
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,460
All right, and if you're some
fucking woman, all right, and you,

938
00:57:14,461 --> 00:57:17,400
you host one of these shows where you
always talking about the shit that men do.

939
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,570
How about your balance it out?

940
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:21,300
The way I balanced it out saying
that Lou cheats did a piece of shit.

941
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:24,300
Fucking move. Why don't you bring
this shit up? This is ridiculous.

942
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,160
He goes,
I throw out the contract and contract,

943
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,830
contacted a realtor to list the house.
They go,

944
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,230
she's refused to sell and her name is on
the title because I'm a fucking idiot.

945
00:57:36,231 --> 00:57:38,660
Long story short,
after I threatened a lawsuit,

946
00:57:38,661 --> 00:57:41,000
a mysterious man who called
himself a family friend,

947
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:45,440
emailed me and asked to
act as the facilitator for
the deal between the two of

948
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:50,150
us. My ex do. Don't give into that.
My access not been involved since,

949
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,540
and this guy is a real cunt who
was only out for her. My cousin,

950
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:55,550
who was a lawyer is guiding
me through the process,

951
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,640
but I need some advice from you
on how to resolve this issue.

952
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:03,320
I just found out that the family
friend is my new ex's new boyfriend.

953
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:04,250
I could've told you that.

954
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:09,430
My question is how do I let them know
that I know I'm like a serial killer who

955
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:13,990
needs to be caught? What?
I'm like a serial killer.

956
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:17,770
Who needs to be caught?
Her man caught here, man.

957
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:22,540
What typo there? I can't
resist them thinking. I don't,

958
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,100
I guess no anymore.

959
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,420
I thought a nice joke barred her
having herpes would be a good start.

960
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:33,200
I joked that she was too
selfish to even give me that.

961
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:37,790
Any feedback or advice on the podcast
would really be appreciated. Um,

962
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,920
I usually say cut bait,
but fuck that. Fuck that.

963
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,003
Fuck that.

964
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,190
Uh,

965
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:54,080
you have two options here and I don't
want to tell you what the second one is.

966
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,430
Uh, the first one is, well,
you have three fight this,

967
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:03,460
which I would walk away from it,
which I wouldn't.

968
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,990
And number three

969
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,860
would involve a convenient accident
that happened to the house,

970
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,030
but even then, then she probably
fight you for the, uh, uh,

971
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,680
they'd figured out you started
the fire. Don't, don't,

972
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:26,120
I shouldn't even brought that up.
Listen, this is what you gotta do.

973
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,250
You just got to accept the fact

974
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,210
that you were in for a long fight here
and that lawyers are going to get most of

975
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:33,571
the money,

976
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:38,310
but that bitch is not going to get
the house now to go that route.

977
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,180
Oh God,
I don't want to tell you to quit,

978
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:51,050
but my world, I would just be like, look,
you want 150,000 fucking dollar house,

979
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:54,020
just take the fucking
house free and clear.

980
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:55,973
MMM.

981
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,870
It costs you 150 grand to get rid of
this fucking devil woman that's going to

982
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:03,440
take that new guide down.
She's going to take that guy down.

983
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:04,890
Yeah,

984
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:08,430
it, I mean, granted, I only heard
your side of the story. All right.

985
01:00:08,431 --> 01:00:11,190
And I'm taking this as the truth
and if this is the truth that,

986
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:14,730
that that's not the,
that's not you.

987
01:00:14,731 --> 01:00:16,710
You don't want that devil
woman in your fucking life.

988
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:18,450
That is some evil fucking shit.

989
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,653
MMM.

990
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,350
Ah, okay. I got to walk away
from this story because it's,

991
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:27,450
it's actually making me fucking mad and
I don't have a dog in the fight here.

992
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,650
What I'm doing is I am
inserting myself into the story,

993
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:36,520
who I would be in this fucking story of,
uh,

994
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,460
Jesus do. You're young, you're young.

995
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,050
Get into the best shape of your life.

996
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,520
Hit on women out of your fucking league
and then treat her like a fucking Queen

997
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,800
Mary her and then walked by this
bitch someday on the street.

998
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:54,390
That's what I would do. All
right. Oh, you fucking cunt.

999
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,250
How long to wait for sex?
Short and simple.

1000
01:00:59,330 --> 01:00:59,830
Yeah.

1001
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,620
Adolf Hitler.
I don't know what that means.

1002
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:06,160
I'm 26 and I started dating a girl,
a lady.

1003
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:10,540
We got to talking about
doing the dirty now Jesus.

1004
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:14,770
And she'd said she doesn't
want to be sexual for a while
probably. Cause you say,

1005
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:18,100
Hey Lee Lee, say we do
the dirty air. Me Man,

1006
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:19,960
I got my fork and balled over here,

1007
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:24,250
whether it's debt that dads do
it and I liked to a plat he sees,

1008
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,000
uh,

1009
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,740
per se a man was l a my question is,

1010
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,280
how long is too long to wait?
I don't want to pressure her.

1011
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,090
I want her to feel comfortable. But at
the same time of 26 what do you think?

1012
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,150
Also, side note, what do
you think about the cheese?

1013
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:41,280
Okay,

1014
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,270
a cup. I already went
on that. Um, all right.

1015
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,690
Uh,
I don't want to pressure her dude.

1016
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:53,350
You don't give a fuck about this woman.
Get out of the relationship.

1017
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,170
You just want a banger.

1018
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,620
You want to fucker 26 so it got my
fucking balls. If full over here,

1019
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,400

1020
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:05,830

that guy did in the hockey game?

1021
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,180
I'm supposed to give a fuck.

1022
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,650
You couldn't even get through this God
damn question. Dumb fucking sidetrack.

1023
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,880
This is what I do. I do
break up with her. All right?

1024
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:19,590
She doesn't want to have sex with you.
No means no. Don't pressure Jesus Christ.

1025
01:02:19,591 --> 01:02:23,760
Do you want to have sex with her while
she's sobbing? You fucking Weirdo. Look,

1026
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,780
you don't give a shit so
goddamn phone buzzing there.

1027
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:32,940
You don't give a fuck about this woman.
Okay. You don't break up with her. Okay.

1028
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:35,370
And go find some woman that's
going to jump on your Dick.

1029
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,450
Cause that's what you want right now and
your life because you're 26. All right.

1030
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,590
There you go. He says thank you. Thanks.
