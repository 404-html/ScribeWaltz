1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,750
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Berg.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,830
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, April nine, 2018.

3
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:11,730
How the fuck are you doing?
Huh?

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,150
Oh, that's good. That's good.

5
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,690
I just got back from Cincinnati
or as they call it, the Natty,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,650
the night before I was in Pittsburgh,
or as they call it, the Berg

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,120
about a year ago. This time I was
in Cleveland, or as they call it,

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,220
the land.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,740
I've always wanted to do a gig
in Akron or as they call it,

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,090
the Ron.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,010
What is with that part
of the fucking country.

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,133
Okay.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,000
What is Saint Louis?
They call it the Louis.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,040
The Louie a welcome to the Louis.
Hey,

15
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,120
welcome to the walkie.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,433
Yeah,

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,650
welcome to the in a older, not to
state Minnesota mean any, any odor.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,060
Welcome to the Apolis.
Welcome to the Paul.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,420
Now it only works with the Berg,
the Natty,

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,010
the land and I'll Belper the
Dosha and when we return,

21
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:23,490
we're going to be discussing the upturn
in the stock market. Um, you know,

22
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,470
it's funny,
I didn't give him shit about that at all.

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,700
Okay.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,010
I didn't even think about that the
whole time I was there. I was still,

25
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:34,030
I was too fucking tired. I flew
in Thursday night so I could, uh,

26
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,800
get up early the next
day and go do a Wda d

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,400
okay.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,630
With Randy and bill. And I went in
there, he and bag sitting there.

29
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,240
Okay.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
Like the fucking headliner he is and
there's Joe Barton [inaudible] we had a

31
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:53,350
great time and I evidently I said
bullshit twice. And I said fuck.

32
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,120
Once I knew when I said
fuck cause everyone, oh Eh,

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,720
uh,
I'm such a foul mouth.

34
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,680
Freckled jerk off. I didn't even
realize it did it. I felt bad.

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,693
MMM.

36
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,110
Whatever.
I had a good time.

37
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:12,350
So I want to thank Randy and bill
for having me and all these years,

38
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,030
that's why sell tickets in Pittsburgh.

39
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:19,031
Pittsburgh was a very difficult ticket
to sell for a long fucking time.

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,640
You know, I used to work that
goddamn cavernous Improv.

41
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,410
It's not a comedy club, it's not
a theater. It's just a giant,

42
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,390
like they should have a
fucking DJ in there when it
was big rooms with no chairs.

43
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,710
Right. And the guys just starts spinning
and everybody's on fucking drugs,

44
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,640
whatever it is, say to actually, you
know, I've seen some of those djs lately,

45
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,880
I've seen some of those youtube videos
and you, they have little Casio keyboards,

46
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,430
you know,
to add to their beats.

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,803
MMM.

48
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,400
Do you think it's hard to play drums with
just your little fingers then actually

49
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:58,170
play drums?

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,730
You know what I'm getting sick of.
I'm getting sick of the one man band guy.

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,810
You know when they got that
little fucking thing where they,

52
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:09,281
they do,

53
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:13,900
they do a drum beat first and they add
the base and then they yell some shit and

54
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,450
then they fucking do something else and
meet how many people are going to do

55
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,880
that fucking act.
All right.

56
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,520
It's like I get it. You
have no friends. You know,

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,710
it's like the baseball kid for a musician.

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,420
The whole point of making music is
to go door with other fucking people.

59
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,480
Look if you're doing it at a high
fucking level, I don't, I don't mind,

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,270
but this does a lot of people on
youtube who just come, pull, pull, pull,

61
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,880
get,
get,

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,870
get in and they had the thing and then
they're just standing there and they can

63
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,030
still hear his voice going. Pork, pork,

64
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,460
pork and also I'm going to turn this
into a song so I'm not going to make the

65
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:56,380
rest of the fucking noises.
All right.

66
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,490
You probably just used to like the

67
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,750
part of the podcast or
maybe that laughed there.

68
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,160
Put that over the top right and then
add your own stuff and then you have a

69
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:13,900
fucking ego. They make, make a
podcast team or whatever the fuck.

70
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,120
I was just dough it.
Um,

71
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,620
every time everybody flips the fuck out,
like holy shit,

72
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,500
I can't believe they just did that.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,370
It's like musicians have been
doing that for years, haven't they?

74
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,300
I remember Steven Tyler way back in the
day when they had their making a pump.

75
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:35,990
He was on every fucking instrument in
there. I guess because we never saw it.

76
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,080
I don't know what I'm talking
about. Oh, this is one. I never,

77
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:44,081
I try not to do podcasts on days that
I flew on an airplane because they feel

78
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:47,990
like free me.
They're never funny.

79
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,910
They're always fucking scatter brained.

80
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,693
MMM.

81
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,210
Oh Man. We got me and partner
drove from fucking, uh,

82
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,050
an from Pittsburgh over to Cincinnati
I thought was like a three hour drive.

83
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,880
I always forget like that fucking the
conehead part of West Virginia is in

84
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:10,270
between that part of
Pennsylvania and Ohio.

85
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,250
And uh, I'll tell you, man,
I feel fucking life of me.

86
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,840
I do not understand the poverty of
that state. Pennsylvania is doing fine.

87
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,310
Ohio's doing fine.

88
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,090
And you'd just drive to that
little fucking triangle on the 70.

89
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,110
I was joking on stage. You're on your
drive by on the highway and you look off,

90
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,710
you see people like wave and asking
for help. You know what I mean?

91
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,840
Like fucking Willem Defoe and platooned.
Um, it's such a gorgeous state.

92
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,770
I don't get it.
Um,

93
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,170
I dunno. I think one day that, that place,

94
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,900
that place is going to turn around
the way downtown Cincinnati did.

95
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,850
I remember 10 years ago I did that funny
bone that's just across the fucking

96
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:58,790
river, the Ohio River in, um, Cincinnati.

97
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,810
I was in Kentucky

98
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,520
and I stayed there like, you want to stay
out in the Kentucky area is like, Nah,

99
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,270
I want to stay in downtown Cincinnati.
Won't be downtown where, where,

100
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,560
where shit is happening.

101
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,640
And I was at 10 years ago and it
was one of these fucking towns bed.

102
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,690
Everybody comes into work at eight and it
five, everybody leaves and it's, you're,

103
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:20,490
you're alone. There's nobody
there. There's homeless
people, there's people who,

104
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,440
who need medical, uh, mental

105
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,990
assistance, you know, crazy people

106
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,550
and all the stores is fucking closed up.

107
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,520
You gotta get your last meal by
three o'clock or you're fucked.

108
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,660
And um, I had been there, I
feel it feels like forever.

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,280
And um, I, uh, by immediately

110
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,900
the downtown area, if it's
fucking amazing, it's fucking him.

111
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,630
It's actually a whole article. The
second I got there, I was like,

112
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:53,260
this is not the Cincinnati that
I remember from that fucking Gig.

113
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,600
And that I carried with
me the next two times,

114
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:57,040
even though it was slowly getting better.

115
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,930
I had such a bad
experience the first time.

116
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,163
MMM.

117
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,400
They actually people right.
And fucking articles on it.
Where the hell is it, bill?

118
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:09,990
There you go. Cincinnati Streetcar.
They've got a fucking street car.

119
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,200
Okay.

120
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,340
By the time the first passengers boarded
Cincinnati straight current September,

121
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,140
it's advocates had already been on a
wild 15 year ride that included surviving

122
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,740
two ballot initiatives to
derail the project. Whatever.

123
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,150
I'm not reading all this boring shit.

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,180
They got all this fucking cool
stuff to do down there and now,

125
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,430
and evidently I was talking
to this guy in the plane.

126
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,830
They revitalized a bunch of bad areas,
but they didn't kick the people out.

127
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,370
Now this was according to a white
male in first class. So who knows?

128
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,940
Who knows what happens cause that's
what I'd like to see done, you know,

129
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,130
have that done.
And for poor white people too.

130
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,830
I never understand where it's
just like, oh, we're, we're,

131
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:54,290
we're making this area better. It's like,
what about the people that were there?

132
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,490
Yeah.

133
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,560
They would have made it better
if they had any fucking money.

134
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,700
Okay.

135
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,310
I don't understand why
like areas like that.

136
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,310
Okay.

137
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,200
This point, you know, we're doing all
these startups and all of this shit.

138
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:13,060
We ought to do it for our around fucking
country men should we then every place

139
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:17,920
is nice. Every way you go is a nice
little fucking cupcake area or whatever.

140
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,001
I don't know.

141
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:21,280
Do you think it then everything would
be the same because you already had that

142
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,150
fucking problem.

143
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,173
You know?

144
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,890
It has to be a way to go into different
neighborhoods of people and fucking help

145
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:34,920
out broke ass people.
Yet they still,

146
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,560
they don't lose their vibe,
you know, the music, the food,

147
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,860
the people, the whole fucking
thing. Because once like,

148
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,970
I dunno what's once,

149
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,550
what's the fucking people they want?
What's, why people come in and it just,

150
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:53,780
it just becomes white.
You know? It's be I,

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,700
I really don't even know
what I'm about right now.

152
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,090
I just don't understand West Virginia.
It's fucking gorgeous.

153
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:01,790
I don't know why people don't want to,
it's been a minor.

154
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,400
The only fucking job is that why,
you know,

155
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,340
they see the people that
mining isn't that fucking

156
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,630
honey booboo from their fucking
dirt floor cab and she grew up in,

157
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,640
so one of the saddest things I ever was,

158
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,520
I tried to watch the show one fucking
time and they were going down the grocery

159
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:24,360
store and they were having an auction on
food that was at the grocery store that

160
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:26,100
they no longer could legally sell.

161
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,820
They weren't even buying shit that
at least you used to be healthy like

162
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,770
perishable shit,
like fruits and vegetables,

163
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:38,220
which God knows what the fuck they
sprayed it with. Right. They will,

164
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:41,930
they will fucking bidden on like
a double stuffed Oreo cookies.

165
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,930
It's like they've already expired
and they're not good for you.

166
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,730
And she's sitting there looking like
Haystack Calhoun. I mean, what, what,

167
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:55,700
what the fuck do you went out? Here's
a question. What do you do with that?

168
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,773
You know what I mean?

169
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,720
That's just like, I mean, it's just a shit
show in and already fucking procreated.

170
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,870
So now you've got half of
that and somebody else,

171
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,310
maybe there'll be half as stupid.

172
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,680
Okay.

173
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,670
Maybe some smart person got drunk and
fucked her. That's the best thing you can,

174
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,130
you can hope for and knocked
down her stupid by 50%. Right.

175
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,310
Because certain people you see, they're
broken. You just like, all right,

176
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,890
well maybe if they had some opportunity,
then there's other people.

177
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:27,540
It's just like, Nah, you know, even
if she was born rich, I just don't.

178
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,550
Then once the parents died, I think, uh,

179
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,120
I don't see that fortune and

180
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,210
let's look up honey fucking booboo.
Oh, honey booboo was the mom. No,

181
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,900
that was the kid and he booboo mother.

182
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,790
Okay,

183
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,540
come on. Internet Mama. June, Mama.

184
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:54,330
June of here comes honey boo boo.
Famous for raising Padgett prisoners upper

185
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,690
uh, where the fuck is she
from? Amazing weight loss.

186
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,890
Jesus Christ. You know, when people are
really fat and they lose all that weight,

187
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:06,810
then they get it figured out what
they're going to do with the skin.

188
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,470
Then they then they need to do a startup
to get rid of the skin, right? I mean,

189
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,220
Jesus Christ, you need an extra startup
just for the shit underneath her chin.

190
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,010
She has had an unfortunate
thing where it like, you know,

191
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,670
it's like your chin is flushed with your
chest and she's way too young to have

192
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,230
that level of a double chin.
And that's what happens.

193
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,270
People when you go down
to the gross to her,

194
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,250
because she's so fucking
broke and you have to,

195
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:33,690
you have to bid on already
expired double stuf Oreo cookies.

196
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,820
Her neck is full of the cream. That's
what it is. I know. It's disgusting,

197
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:39,654
isn't it?

198
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,380
Okay,

199
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,340
but you know what? In this day and
age, I imagine she's a hero. All right,

200
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,080
so let's see. Let's see her loss. She
lost a bunch of weight. Good for her.

201
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
Good for her.
Now she's going to live longer.

202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
You know what they should
have with the facelift? They

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,640
should also fucking,
they should have fixed her.

204
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,210
I know this is harsh people,
but there's too many fucking people.

205
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,790
There's too much traffic.
Okay.

206
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,810
You can't have dumb people like make it
more fucking people that are going to be

207
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:12,120
out there on the road,
you know,

208
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,000
and the DNA is full of fucking expired
Oreo cookie double stuff. He just Gig,

209
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,390
he can't fucking do it.

210
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:19,730
Okay.

211
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,730
And this is the thing that liberals
cannot handle and conservatives go too far

212
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:26,174
with.

213
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:26,840
Okay.

214
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,410
There has to be a feel good solution.

215
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,550
What would you do? I would just say,
listen, if you're, if you're dumb

216
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,970
and you don't have kids,

217
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,650
the government will give you Oreo cookies
that have not expired. How about that?

218
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,940
We'll start with is that as, as as a,
as an, uh, taxpayers will pay for that.

219
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,920
That'll come off the top

220
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,743
right.

221
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,490
I don't know how to solve this. I
mean, what the fuck I'm talking about?

222
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:01,300
I can't tell you this. Guess what
the fuck I'm doing on April 13th.

223
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,550
I'm going to be in shock.

224
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,890
Okay.

225
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,880
North Carolina at the rough
and rowdy and vet a event.

226
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,570
Um, I cannot fucking wait
for this. I think I got the
suit then I'm going to wear,

227
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,770
um, I'm very excited and,
uh, I'm going to be there.

228
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,450
It's going to be 1599. If you order
now 1999, the day of the event,

229
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,030
I'm going to be commenting
the entire night. God willing,

230
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,190
I'm going to be there with Al Pres
Day Portnoy and the big Cat d uh,

231
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,630
Dan Katz. And guess who's fighting
on the card? The one man thrill ride.

232
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,050
All right. He's not
wrestling, he's fighting.

233
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,320
He's not wrassling he's fighting and
he's going to show why he's an absolute

234
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,440
savage and I can't fucking wait.
I'm very excited for this event.

235
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,180
I hope I add to what and uh,

236
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,790
bring some more humor to it and check
it out. 16 bucks the fuck. Do you care?

237
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,720
What do you do with these 16 bucks?
Go down their bed on some cookies.

238
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,323
Um,

239
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,550
okay.

240
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,970
So anyways, I had a great flight back from
Cincinnati. Congratulations, by the way.

241
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:09,060
I'm very excited for Cincinnati.
I have to watch. And Pittsburgh,

242
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,810
they hold downtown areas start
to get going again. Alright.

243
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,130
Cleveland's made a huge comeback.
Cincinnati has made a comeback.

244
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,490
It's fucking tremendous.

245
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,030
I hope this keeps happening because
I've been on the road since the 90s and

246
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:24,660
those places were really sad.
And I remember in 2004, um,

247
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,400
when nick costs is opened hilarides I
remember looking across the street and

248
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,380
talking to one of the comics here,
seeing if I had money,

249
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:34,980
I'd buy the fucking [inaudible]
building right across the street.

250
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,660
And it was just like this beautiful
building that was just empty,

251
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,060
just fucking empty.
And hilarides were the only lights on,

252
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:45,930
on that block.

253
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,860
And I would finish my show and the cop
would walk me to my hotel around the

254
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:56,750
corner to make sure I didn't get
jumped or anything. Right. So,

255
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,460
uh,
and here we are now,

256
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,170
like that whole street now is lit up
like the fuck and Bullwinkle shelf and a

257
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,770
band. If I was where I am now, back then,

258
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,720
I would have invested in all of those.

259
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,330
And I want to do invest in Detroit
now that's fucking coming back to.

260
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:14,030
But I still might do that.
You know,

261
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:19,031
I think that's a great thing to do by
a fucking in an up and coming city that

262
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,360
needs some money in there.

263
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:23,630
You buy something there and
you don't kick the people out.

264
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,240
And He'd give them a nice safe
place. You know, they pay in ramp,

265
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,910
the fuck did these fucking assholes.

266
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,090
They redo these things and
then they kick everybody out.

267
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,590
Then they try and flip it,
you know,

268
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:38,450
this fucking heartless cunts that'll go
into some beautiful building and just

269
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:42,770
gut the place and come back
with like home depot bullshit.

270
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,760
Um, and then kick everybody out
and try to get fucking, you know,

271
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:51,620
20 and 30 somethings in there.
I Dunno,

272
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,180
I'm against it personally, but then
again, I never tried to do it. Who knows?

273
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,250
Who knows?
Maybe someday I'll become a slum lord.

274
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,420
I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do. All right.
Anyways, plowing ahead here.

275
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,110
Uh, so my flight back, I overslept,

276
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,370
but fortunately the airport was right
down the street and a cruise through

277
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:14,450
security and all that shit got
there in plenty of time. And, um,

278
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,280
I get on the plane and a Delta Airlines,

279
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,010
I would slide different airlines.
I'm not fucking loyalty any of them,

280
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,860
cause I never used the fucking miles.
All right?

281
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,160
I have no interest in getting on the
phone, trying to figure out, you know,

282
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:32,750
when I can use them. You know,
I don't give a fuck. Keep,

283
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:33,740
keep the fucking miles.

284
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,450
What am I George Clooney and that
fucking movie up, up in a way,

285
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,520
um, uh, up in a way. Hey,

286
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:47,390
with my salt and pepper,
perfect. Five can, hey,

287
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,440
you know, I love most about that
movie. I'm going to ruin it.

288
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:55,580
Here is when he finally finds love and
he comes and he finds out that woman's

289
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,370
married and she looks at him like,
get the fuck Outta here.

290
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,510
And he has to get the fuck out here.

291
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:01,850
That was one of the realest things
I've seen in a movie, you know? Well,

292
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,320
that's how it usually works out.
You know, something happens.

293
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,560
Um, so anyways, the, uh,
why would I say that?

294
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,750
Why would I, why would I put that
sort of negativity out there?

295
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,760
Only because I'm a cunt? That's right.
Uh, so I get on the plane and uh,

296
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:24,761
I made sure I told my half to take
the f one race from Bar Bardeen and,

297
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:30,710
uh, get on the plane. Lone and behold,
I have ESPN two and I'm like, Holy Shit,

298
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,450
the fucking racist coming
on at 10 past 11. Right?

299
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:39,380
So I sit there and I'm watching
fucking ESPN, which is hilarious now,

300
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,641
you know what I mean?

301
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:44,120
Every sports talk show now it seems
like a woman has to be like running it.

302
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,520
And then the guys are sitting there like,
she's the teacher now,

303
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,120
just like the overcorrection,
you know what I mean?

304
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:53,360
So now like a guy can't run a show, I
don't, I don't fucking get it right.

305
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,640
So I'm watching this shit and
they show this woman from the, uh,

306
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,130
women's hockey team throwing
out the first pitch.

307
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:02,600
Instead of throwing out the first pitch,

308
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:07,250
she uses a hockey stick and she takes
a fucking risk data and sends it to the

309
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,930
catcher and the guy comes out
of his crouch and he catches it.

310
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:11,450
It was a fucking ball by the way.

311
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,920
So there's a woman and a man commentating
on this fucking shit. She goes,

312
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:18,410
see that? You see it,
you know, most, you know,

313
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:21,530
a lot of the dudes can't even get it over,
you know? That's why I'm telling you,

314
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:24,200
women are just better. They're just
better at things. And the guy's like,

315
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:27,110
little buddy though, the elbow, you're
going to say anything. She goes,

316
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:31,730
that's right. You got a
wife and a daughter. It was
just like, what in the what?

317
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:32,810
What the fuck was that?

318
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,370
Just imagine

319
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,960
that conversation and you flipped the sex,

320
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,230
the guys saying that to her.
Hey,

321
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:46,780
you see that most of broads can't get it
over the plate guys are just better at

322
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:49,640
Shit. Right. I'm not even gonna
say anything. That's right.

323
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,970
You got a husband and almost slap
the shit out of you. You dumb bitch.

324
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,840
All right, dumb bitch. I put a
little bit too much mustard on it,

325
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,170
but that's basically
what the fuck they said.

326
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,410
And then she came back
again and she said it again.

327
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,493
MMM.

328
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,810
Which is hilarious. And I,
uh, you see that a lot now.

329
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,200
Yeah.

330
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,800
And, um, at first it bothered me. Then
I'm just like, this is actually just,

331
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:20,130
it's not coming from a place of strength
that's coming from this really insecure

332
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:24,090
place. Like, right. See, we can
do stuff. Nobody said you kid.

333
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,380
I guess they did back in the day, but
nobody now is saying that. I just,

334
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,630
I can't know. Every guy has set
up his tail between his legs.

335
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,040
I wish I was commentating,
whether it'd be like,

336
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,340
that's astoundingly
ignorant and reverse sexist.

337
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,290
What are you talking about?

338
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,373
Yeah,

339
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,140
I could fucking do what she just did.
If he gave me three tries,

340
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,170
it's a fucking wrist shot with a baseball.
You got a teed up on a mound.

341
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,410
I don't even play hockey.
I think you give me five attempts.

342
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:53,640
I think I could fucking do that.

343
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,300
But you know what's funny is
if I went in and I failed,

344
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,780
that woman would feel justified because
a standup comedian couldn't get a

345
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:03,330
baseball nut 90 feet or 45 feet,

346
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:05,910
whatever the fuck it
is with a hockey stick,

347
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,110
that would be considered a
victory, I guess. I don't know.

348
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,130
So then I'm still watching.
Right? And then they had
this really weird commercial,

349
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,450
you got to see this one.

350
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,640
I actually wrote it down in my
phone so I wouldn't forget, uh,

351
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,490
where am I getting the notes?

352
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,050
Women are just better.
They're just better.

353
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,020
I was fucking around with that this
weekend where they just sit there going,

354
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,050
you know the, the, the future is female.

355
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,620
Like all guys are just going
to step aside. You'd have
to, we built everything up.

356
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:41,040
We're just going to give
you the airplanes. Go Fuck
Yourself. Earn them. Um,

357
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,120
I'm with you ladies,

358
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,410
but she knows something. So here's how
you divide and conquer the cool ones.

359
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:53,850
Know what I'm saying?
All right.

360
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:57,750
There's a commercial out right now that
you have to see for new genic that has

361
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,010
the big hurt in it.

362
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,380
And I swear to God he standing there
cause he lost all this weight and this

363
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:07,800
woman standing there with this guy who
I assume that kind of together, right?

364
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,270
She goes, he says something. Oh Wow.
Is that the big heart? She says, wow.

365
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,020
He looks okay.

366
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,870
Think that's the big hurt.
She said she should call a call.

367
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,090
Like the big handsome or
some she compliments on the
way he looks and then the

368
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:23,940
guy rather than being like the fuck you
looking at another man for and commented

369
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,190
it and in front of me, fucking disrespect
me like that and this grocery store,

370
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,570
you know, is this something I need to
know? Instead of saying that he just goes,

371
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,330
yeah, he kind of agreed with her. Right.

372
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,160
Then they get over there and I that this
is really weird conversation with it,

373
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:44,180
talking about this stuff that helps you
lose weight and every and suddenly makes

374
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:48,590
you a fuck better. I swear to God the way
the dialogue when I don't, I, you know,

375
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:50,090
I couldn't write it down fast enough.

376
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,900
I thought in the end the dude was
going to ask big hurt to fuck his wife.

377
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,910
Listen, I dunno. It might,
maybe it's me. Maybe it's me.

378
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:06,870
Maybe all of this is playful and I just
have to disease to fucking mind and

379
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:10,380
that's how I'm seeing this shit, so
don't take it seriously. All right.

380
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,790
Speaking of disease mine. Um, April,

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,170
I am going to be no vice
Billy, no vice, no drinking,

382
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,140
no smoking cigars,
no online porn,

383
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,370
meditating, yoga, working out,
eating right, drinking water,

384
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,630
all of that fucking little house on
the prairie shit. Okay. And I am,

385
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,210
when you hear this, I'll be
nine days in. All right. Oh,

386
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,450
Billy, no, vice hashtag Billy. Nice, Nice.

387
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,400
Billy boredom. What else? Oh, William.

388
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:49,990
Without a fucking,
I'm almost halfway through the month.

389
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,490
Um, no, I think I'm gonna try
to go to my birthday, right?

390
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,360
I'm going to go to my birthday,
you know, get myself, you know,

391
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,710
in the shape I want to be. And so turn
50, you know, a 50 wasn't bugging me.

392
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:06,910
Now all of a sudden, now that it's
like two months away, as of today, no,

393
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,360
as of Tuesday, it's two months away.
It's starting to fucking hit me,

394
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,750
even though I know I'm not
going to feel any different. Um,

395
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,220
it's just that you can kind
of lie to yourself through
your 40 set, you know? Nah,

396
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,210
Nah. You know, I look good for my age
above. When you turn 50, you fucking old.

397
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,790
You fucking, you're, you're, you're
even old to people that are old.

398
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,180
Okay?

399
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,170
Like somebody 70 would love to be 50, but
they're not looking at you like, like,

400
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,830
you know, they're not
pick the, they'll take 50.

401
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,360
You know what I mean? But if, if you know,

402
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,340
okay,

403
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,250
nobody's picking that age. If they rubbed
a genie lamp and a genie comes out,

404
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:49,520
what age do you want to be? Nobody
saying 50. Even if you fucking 120,

405
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,490
um, was getting who don't be seen 40 or
30. I don't want to get the fuck anyways.

406
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,270
Um, so, uh, it's been going,

407
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,530
God spend going good.
I like not drinking.

408
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:08,330
I guess I do,
but I dunno if you go to Pittsburgh,

409
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:11,150
Pittsburgh's just the town. You just
like, fuck man, I'm getting drunk.

410
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,570
How do it or not? This is
just, it's too amazing.

411
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,260
We went to the Primanti brothers,
however the fuck you say it,

412
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,780
you know, we went to the place, the,

413
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,320
the Italian market, uh,
part next favorite one.

414
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,760
We get the Gabba wool.

415
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,350
Why the guy that got all of
that and they just, you know,

416
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,770
was eating that all fucking
weekend stuffed olives.

417
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,240
I ate like a fucking lunatic, but,
um, I didn't need it at night,

418
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,740
so it wasn't that bad.

419
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,640
But I definitely did not eat healthy
over the last couple of fucking days.

420
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,160
But anyways,
but I didn't booze,

421
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,450
I didn't smoke and in both towns had
cigar bars and I had to walk by them.

422
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:59,360
And on the plane ride home I was watching
top 10 tight ends of all time and they

423
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:03,380
got to Mike Ditka and he was talking
all this shit. And then he just took,

424
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,250
you know, fucking, you know, a
couple of Poles off this fat cigar.

425
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:11,930
I was just like, ah, fuck, fuck,

426
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,560
but I'm going to get a, we're
going to make it. I Dunno.

427
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,740
I Dunno.
You know what it is.

428
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,590
It's like everyday I wake up and I don't
miss not doing heroin because I never

429
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:28,730
did it. And that's the thing, like they
say, once you open the Pandora's box,

430
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,350
all Fox speaking in that
shit, you know, that, um,

431
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,570
you know, that's ACDC songs, Sin
City. And when they do the breakdown,

432
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,710
when whatever the fuck, I can't remember,
I can't remember the baseline of that.

433
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,180
But boom,
boom,

434
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,690
kick drums on too, which is weird. Um,

435
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,040
and then bond Scott
goes lattice and snakes.

436
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,560
That is guilt snakes take right now.
He's always like it. What is he saying?

437
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,850
That lat ladders, ladders
and snakes. Liars.

438
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,070
Sounds like he's saying ladders
like something you'd climb up.

439
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,390
I never knew what the fuck it meant.
Did I tell you guys to see how the,

440
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:18,170
I can't remember it. Mike. Devin
told me he goes, no, it's, it's a,

441
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,520
he said that's in Australia.
That's like chutes and ladders.

442
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,690
But the original was called ladders
and snakes. And then I looked it up.

443
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:31,470
It's actually from India, if I'm
right. And it has to do with, um,

444
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,330
vices and virtues and it's
called snakes and ladders.

445
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,150
So she played sorta the same board game of
chutes and ladders. Right. So, you know,

446
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:46,151
if you get on a snake that's a vice
and you slide down the land on a snake,

447
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:49,090
I should say you slide down. But
to go on a ladder, that's a virtue.

448
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:53,200
And virtue is bring you up.
So, uh, basically, you know,

449
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,600
after years of sliding down and device,

450
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,330
I'm now going to try to go up a couple
of floors on the ladder, I guess.

451
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,160
I don't fucking know.
I don't know what I'm doing.

452
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,430
All I know is every once in
a while I got to shut down,

453
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:10,120
but every time I have to shut it down,
like the window is shorter.

454
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,200
Basical hard for 10 months and
then shut it down for a month.

455
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,540
Now it's like I go hard for two,

456
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:21,130
three months and then I shut it
down for like four or five. Um,

457
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,360
I dunno. I don't know. Could he hit it?

458
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,140
Just all the comedy just left at
this fucking podcast. It's just,

459
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:32,890
it's just not fun. It's not fucking, I
don't give a fuck. People have, yeah.

460
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,660
I fucking love being sober.
I love being sober. You,

461
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,110
I'm sitting next to this fucking guy
that one of these guys that says, yes,

462
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,280
that's the worst when you're sober. Okay,
I get you something to drink. I'm like,

463
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:47,730
yeah, I'll have a water. And he
goes, I'll have a bloody Mary.

464
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,130
Like fuck, I love of bloody Mary. He
finishes his bloody Mary, which she goes,

465
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:57,820
would you like another one? He's
like, yeah, how about you sir? Nah,

466
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm fine with my water. I was
just clock in this guy, right?

467
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,321
I flew out.

468
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:09,321
Another guy had a jack and coke
that he got the fucking meal.

469
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,870
You don't think got another jack
and coke and the lady said, Hey,

470
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:17,610
you want some ice cream?
Right? And he's like, uh, yeah,

471
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:21,360
but can I wait? She goes, yeah, the letter
you had the ice cream, you said? Yes.

472
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:23,760
The entire fucking flight is,
I sat down, just have a water.

473
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,890
Um, anyways, plowing ahead. By the way,

474
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:31,470
that's what you can look forward to.
He worked your ass off.

475
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:33,300
You sit at the front of the plane,
they bring your ice cream.

476
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:36,730
Like it's a figure of fucking two
year old. But here's the thing that,

477
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,630
here's the thing.
All right?

478
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,150
You die sooner because you're up there
eating and drinking like a fucking

479
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:46,830
asshole. All right? At least if you're in
the back, you know what I mean? You back,

480
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:50,460
they're starving, but you're
going to live longer. All right.

481
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:55,680
And the worst thing is to write up
front and be sober and watching somebody

482
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,080
acting like they're in
the fucking Roman empire.

483
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,940
And you're sitting there
drinking fucking waters

484
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,270
or s INA said salad. Um,
anyway, so let me do this.

485
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,040
Let me do the fucking, uh,
the reads for the week here.

486
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,343
What do we got here?

487
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,250
Have any advertising left on this
file? The black tops, everybody,

488
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,140
the black talks like the
Ohio state or the land,

489
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:28,060
the Natty, the Berg, the black
Tux for more than a year.

490
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:31,570
Now I've talked about the black tux.com.

491
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,670
The black Tux never gets old because
they always have new and exciting styles

492
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:40,600
for your next big event.
Ooh, look at that lapel. Hey,

493
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,710
I your cumber bun,
whether you're going for a stylist,

494
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,680
stylist selected outfit
or building a custom look,

495
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,930
the black talks has tons of new
suits and Tuxedos to choose from.

496
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:54,950
I thought it was for fat people,

497
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,870
tons of new suits and Tuxedos to
choose from for your big spring event.

498
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,270
The Black Tux, they black Tux is
always changing up their looks,

499
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,720
making it fun to try out
different suits and Tuxedos.

500
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,370
Even if you have your own suit,

501
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,030
switching to be black Tux
is always a great idea.

502
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,000
And what their new fit algorithm,

503
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,570
one of the most overly used fucking words
in the English language are algorithm

504
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,510
in other,

505
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,530
you know how they all have
a fucking algorithm because
you gave your information

506
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:31,220
at cvs, she got your fucking retina scan
at the airport and they all share the

507
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:31,791
information.

508
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:36,650
So now they have an algorithm on what
the day of fucking three d model of your

509
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,820
if goddamn skeleton. Now here's what
the mouth breathing more and says, yeah,

510
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:45,490
you know, I don't give a fuck
as long as it Tuxedo fits. Um,

511
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,360
Jesus questions I think in Atlanta on
my fucking house, the black trucks,

512
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,480
um, and within I would
been their fit algorithm.

513
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:55,580
You don't have to
awkwardly measure yourself.

514
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,730
How is it awkward to measure yourself?

515
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,340
See how they was trying to make it
seem more easy. Just measure yourself.

516
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:05,690
You'd dump content simple or ask a friend
for help. That's when it gets awkward.

517
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,740
The, I guess, you know, it's kind of hard
to, it's not awkward. It's difficult.

518
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,923
I see what you're saying.

519
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,020
Then your roommates a guy and all of a
sudden he's going to measure it in scene.

520
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah. Know the back of his hands
touching the underneath the ball bag.

521
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,260
You know what? I take that back. Thank
God you have an algorithm, you know?

522
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,850
All right.
The Black Tux does it for you.

523
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:31,020
Plus the black Tux is free home.
Try on,

524
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:34,800
let's just see the fit and feel the
quality of your suit months before your

525
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:38,210
event. I always think that's
dangerous. Months before your event,

526
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,260
you try it on and then what?

527
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,760
You fucking go out boozing and
it doesn't fit your person.

528
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:45,840
You come upon there after ordering
your suit. After ordering your suit,

529
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:49,020
will I never, I always blogged
commas after ordering your suit. No.

530
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:54,021
After ordering your suit will arrive 14
days before your event and remember how

531
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:56,580
simple returns are where it turned heads.

532
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,840
Then send it back three days after
your event. Shipping is free.

533
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:03,660
Both ways. Standout at your
event for the right reason.

534
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:08,490
With the Black Tux where it
just ship it back. Good Lord.

535
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:11,220
It can imagine the Hazmat suit they're
wearing when they take that thing back

536
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,280
during prom season.

540

Here's why I'm a big fan of simply
safe home security. Evidently,

541
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,370
simply safe is prepared for
anything that gets thrown at it.

542
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,440
Uh,

543

Simply safe.
We'll get you the help you need.

546
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,120
They come running up your front
door with a fucking chainsaw on.

547
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,530
Simply safe is ready.
Sure. Maybe it's overkill.

548
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,530
Maybe you don't need to be ready
for every worst case scenario,

549
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:09,830
but that's what makes simply safe
home security systems. So great.

550
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:14,480
It is always ready. Simply save. Could
cost an arm and a leg, but you know what?

551
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:18,510
It does it instead. The
only chick you, you'll,

552
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,140
they only charge you
what's, what's fair. Sorry.

553
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,440
24 seven professional security
monitoring is just 1499 a month.

554
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,560
It's only a dollar less than the
fucking barstool event. Rough and rowdy.

555
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,860
Look at that. Cross promoting. There
are no contracts, no hidden fees.

556
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,520

594
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:56,900
That was textbook fucking advertising
reading. Oh, did I? So anyway,

595
00:35:56,901 --> 00:36:01,600
so I watched the fucking f one race.
Congratulations to Max for stabbing.

596
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,250
Congratulations to the Ferrari team.
Uh,

597
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,890
I don't know what the
fuck's going on in the pits.

598
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,790
I hope that guy from Ferrari as our
right. You know, he broke his leg.

599
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,910
Um,
what's his face?

600
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,370
Okay,

601
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:21,690
what the fuck's his name?
Kimmy something or other?

602
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,730
Kimmy Rigatoni,
the other guy in the fucking Ferrari team.

603
00:36:27,731 --> 00:36:30,250
I thought I had thought I
fucking knew his name. Anyways,

604
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:34,480
he comes in for a pit stop and they'd
been having all these problems like the

605
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:39,010
house team,
both their cars last,

606
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,980
the previous race in Australia.
Um,

607
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,690
sorry,
I'm typing this in here.

608
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,130
They fucking went to go change the tires
and they didn't get them on properly

609
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:56,310
and they left and the cars were unsafe
and they both got knocked out. Oh,

610
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:59,610
Kimi Raikkonen he came in for a pit stop.

611
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,530
They didn't put the
right rear one on right,

612
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:03,750
or they didn't get it on in time
or they thought it was done.

613
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:06,360
I don't know what the guy with the
Jack lets the fucking car down.

614
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,710
I don't know who fucked up.

615
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,920
There's like 40 people that run up to
the car and they're all dressed exactly

616
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:11,754
the same.

617
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,360
And when he went to drive out the guy's
fucking dead giant back rear tire went

618
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:23,490
right over this guy's fucking
foot and leg and uh, you know,

619
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,770
and he's sorta peeling out too.

620
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,190
So Jesus Christ so that not
their car out of the race.

621
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,090
Lewis Hamilton had a great race, started
at ninth, got all the way up to third,

622
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:37,890
got to the podium.
What's his face Max for stabbing,

623
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,060
accidentally crashed into him or whatever.
And Lewis Hamilton once again,

624
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:46,490
fucking wine and about it
said Max is a dickhead.

625
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,490
It was a dickhead move. He wasn't
showing them any respect out there.

626
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:54,150
It's like Louis,
he's doing what you did when you came up.

627
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,320
What's he supposed to do? But they
all, my God, that's Lewis Hamilton.

628
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,170
I'm not going to try to beat
him through this fucking turn.

629
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:03,780
I didn't have a problem what he
did and neither did the judges.

630
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,170
So what's the problem? He had this
whole fucking thing where he's saying,

631
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,540
you know, he was disrespectful. It was
a dickhead move and all of that. A,

632
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,080
I don't know that guy. That
guy is, I totally respect him.

633
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:19,380
He's a fucking amazing driver. But I swear
to God, if he doesn't win, he fucking,

634
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,360
he's always bitching about something.

635
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:25,050
He reminds me a Peyton manning early
in his career we had protection issue,

636
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,250
you know? Oh, he's
fucking finger pointing.

637
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,600
Well, you know, by radio
wasn't working is you?

638
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:36,010
Little is very difficult to Jody for
Europe. We know supposed to drive or

639
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,480
not have you done enough of these?
There's somebody in front of you,

640
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,620
go get them a bill. It's a little
more sophisticated than that.

641
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:49,120
He was out in the mediums and the other
guy was on the super soft anyways,

642
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,370
it was a great race. I'm just fucking
with the Lewis Hamilton fence.

643
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,690
Fucking relax.
I'm just fucking around.

644
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,620
I know he's your Beyonce and I'm gonna
have to deal with the fucking, the uh,

645
00:38:56,621 --> 00:39:00,250
the Louis Hive coming at me.
Um,

646
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,570
I don't know. I make fun of Lewis
Hamilton cause he is the best. The guys,

647
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:07,210
the best Mercedes last
year was the fucking best.

648
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:11,380
The last couple of years they'd bend the
God damn best and I'm new to this sport,

649
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:15,640
so what am I gonna do? Am I going to jump
on the bandwagon? I can't. I'm actually,

650
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:20,620
I'm ruined. I root for
Haas. The American team,

651
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:24,160
we, we kink Kevin Magnuson came
in fifth place. That's 10 points.

652
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,430
Mother fuckers fortunate.
Our other driver,

653
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:31,570
Romaine like the lettuce garaging,
however you say his name, he came in 13th.

654
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:33,970
It was a great fucking race
and I hate to say this,

655
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,010
ESPN to their coverage of that
race was fucking phenomenal.

656
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,820
It was phenomenal. And I got, I
got to kind of knock a little fuck.

657
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,350
I got to not fuck sports a little bit
cause they just used to just follow the

658
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,420
leader, whoever it was leading.
They were just up there.

659
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,900
And then while the racing was going on
in the back and forth, fifth, sixth,

660
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:57,220
seventh, eighth, like the level
that ESPN two was covering the race,

661
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,350
um, and showing that all that
passing and like, you know, when,

662
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:05,170
when anybody gets a good, it was a good
driver gets to get some sort of penalty,

663
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:08,740
a gearbox penalty or whatever.
Um, and they move back.

664
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,490
You don't get to watch him come
to the field in these past years,

665
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:17,110
the way ESPN, you know, was
following Lewis Hamilton coming up.

666
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:20,080
It was fucking great. I
love the race. Now granted,

667
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:24,040
I don't know shit about racing and I
watched it on the back of somebody's

668
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,340
fucking chair on a,
on a flight.

669
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,940
I could barely tell how many laps will
left saw I imagined I missed a lot of the

670
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,040
drama.
But I went back and I looked at that.

671
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:37,210
It's just like Max step and you can see
he's, he's going to be one of those guys.

672
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,170
He's probably going to win a championship.
He's really young.

673
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:43,810
He's a great driver and he's got balls.
You know,

674
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,120
it takes a lot of balls to go into
a term with Lewis Hamilton. Be like,

675
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:49,450
fuck this guy. I think I have position
could fam. Unfortunately, you know,

676
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:54,130
it's fucked up his car. I Dunno.
I think Lewis has a little scared,

677
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,700
you know, he reminds me
of, it was like, when I,

678
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:01,630
you see that that interview in Milton
Berle is trying to get Richard prior to

679
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,400
fucking, you know, stand down

680
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,480
because Richard Pryor has the
nerve to fucking laugh at him.

681
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:11,440
And then Milton Berle does that. He
goes, I'll give you some advice. He goes,

682
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,540
picky spots maybe.
And then Richard goes,

683
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,430
all right sweetheart,
if fuck you would you invent comedy?

684
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:26,110
He didn't go fuck yourself. I'm funny too.
That's how I feel. Max Verstappen deck.

685
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:29,800
He's a fucking race car driver. It's
supposed to fucking get out of the way.

686
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:32,230
That's not reason not raising anymore.
I was just driving around.

687
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,920
I fucking do that for red bull team.
Jesus Christ.

688
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,500
Okay.

689
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,000
Fucking now Daniel Ricardo,

690
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Aka Riky Rican and [inaudible] fucking
nice car just died for stamps and after

691
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:49,240
he tried to pass Lewis Hamilton, what?
He's tire went out as differential,

692
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:53,500
get all fucked up but a whatever that's
opening the doors for the American

693
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:58,150
racing team. Haas, we were
doing great in Australia too.

694
00:41:58,151 --> 00:41:59,710
We couldn't put tires on.

695
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,370
It was fucking hilarious watching our
pit crew coming out there was so god damn

696
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:04,204
nervous

697
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,540
they came out with like laces out energy.

698
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,120
But it was a great race in our next week.
Everybody,

699
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,540
the Moto GP race I think is
next week. You get, yeah, it is.

700
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,950
Is it?

701
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,210
No wait, is it in two weeks? Was
the impending I've been one today.

702
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,840
If there was one today, I fucking recorded
it. Hang on a second. Hang on a second.

703
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,620
I was trying to go to that one and uh,
after I do,

704
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:33,040
Nashville is trying to go down to Austin
and go to the race. I just, I got a kid,

705
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:36,040
man, I can't fucking do that. If
I was in Austin I would do it,

706
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:39,250
but I'm not going to fly out of my way.
And not hang out with my kid.

707
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:42,580
What am I a fucking degenerates. Ah, yes.

708
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,980
I'm not that big a degenerate though.
All right. Moto GP, come on. Load load,

709
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,970
load is that bad? My Internet is
said I have to cheer it on. Come on.

710
00:42:51,971 --> 00:42:56,140
You could do it. I took like lamaze
classes with my fucking Internet. Come on.

711
00:42:56,141 --> 00:43:00,790
Do it. Push. Push. You look so
beautiful. It's still loading.

712
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,080
This is fucking, I, I pay
like as I got to get somebody,

713
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:07,400
I'm going to get it like a tech nerd
over here, you know. But before they do,

714
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:10,070
they've got to wear a helmet with a
Chin strap so that John doesn't hit the

715
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:13,250
floor when they see them, which I'm
fucking paying a month for cable.

716
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,540
Okay.

717
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,850
You don't said they'd help me out with
that. I've got to take him up on it.

718
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:22,110
A Red Ban told me to help me out with
that shit cause he told me a story.

719
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:27,000
He said he went home to his parents' house
and saw how much they were paying and

720
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:31,860
then called up there, their
provider, and uh, you know,

721
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:37,560
tore him a new asshole with his algorithm.
Um,

722
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:39,390
it's still fucking loading.
All right. I give up.

723
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,610
Okay.

724
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,380
I give up whatever.
That's a,

725
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,540
what's the most recent fucking question
has for this week, by the way? You know,

726
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:52,580
I gave up arguing with my wife for lent
and I'm continuing it and I'm going to

727
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:57,390
tell you right now, I am getting
some wins. I'm getting some wins,

728
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,790
you know, because what it, look,
I'm still losing a lot. All right?

729
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,570
But, you know, uh, I look, I'm looking
at like a seven and nine season.

730
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:10,740
I think that's what I'm projected at.
But you know, I was like fucking own 16,

731
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:14,310
like the browns last year
because I'm finding like a,

732
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,960
what's good about not losing your
temper is, uh, when you're right.

733
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,580
And if he can somehow keep your wife
on topic, you're actually going to win.

734
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,260
You know? I don't know. Who knows? I was,

735
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:34,530
I already know. She's already
fucking adjusting her game
to my new fucking style.

736
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,560
Why won't this fucking thing load?
What is the fucking problem?

737
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,690
How much money do I have to fucking pay?

738
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,370
Okay,

739
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,410
wait a second.
Let me just bring my energy back down.

740
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,950
Bring it back down again. It's
not that big a deal. All right,

741
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,740
here we go. Come on. Load load.

742
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,290
There it is.
Oh,

743
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:02,430
there was one today. There was
one in Argentina. I gotta Watch.

744
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,560
I gotta Watch it before somebody
tells me the fucking results.

745
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,880
I'll talk about this one
on Thursday. Um, naive.

746
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,910
Then I also have to watch
the, uh, the UFC. Um,

747
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,690
even though I already know the results
there, I got to watch this shit.

748
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,290
The big fights rose, Nama, Eunice first,

749
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,010
Jordana, Jordana in
dry trick. I say right,

750
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:27,551
Yolanda,

751
00:45:27,551 --> 00:45:32,080
now you right trick you and I know how
to say that because I listened to this

752
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:33,220
fucking Russian guy.

753
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,013
Okay.

754
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,120
Yeah.
I listened to this guy for like an hour.

755
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,140
It was rose Nama Eunice verse.

756
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,840
You're Angela. Did you
guys get dead? It was

757
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
once again,
the fight was rose.

758
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,200
Nama Yunus versus your own Inner Ian.
Say,

759
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:04,750
tick your honor. Right. Tick. Yolanda,

760
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,530
at some point in her life,

761
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,790
she has to meet fucking axl rose
so he can sing her name. Right.

762
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,430
Sorry. Um, Boogie woman
is coming for your,

763
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,320
um, I don't know what she was
trying to say. Like the Boogie man,

764
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,260
she probably read up on the Boogie
man. I mean, it's a second language.

765
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,910
It's pretty good that she
could come up with that.

766
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,070
But that was oddly terrifying when she
was saying that Boogie woman is coming

767
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:34,970
for you. I was like, I don't, this brought
me back to when I was single. I was like,

768
00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:38,240
man, I remember I dated Boogie
woman a couple of times. You know,

769
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:40,790
one of those women you break up with,
you don't need to go back for your stuff.

770
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,630
You're just like, fuck this. You can
have it, man. I'm fucking Outta here.

771
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,970
A goddamn which, alright. De
Moines, Iowa billary swank. Hey,

772
00:46:49,971 --> 00:46:54,740
billary swank, uh, just checking
in on you and giving you some ammo.

773
00:46:54,741 --> 00:46:58,370
When you go back to your,
uh, advertisers, uh,

774
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,190
of all the podcasts that I
listen to on a regular basis,

775
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:06,380
your ad reads are the only ones that I
will not skip through. Uh, yeah, exactly.

776
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:08,120
That's why I fuck around through them.

777
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,960
So you got to keep it entertaining
because there's nothing stopping you from

778
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:15,080
fast forward through it. You don't
understand. Understands that stamps.com,

779
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,890
you know,
didn't nature's box,

780
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,970
they didn't get it in those other
fucking constant blue apron.

781
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,750
A right of all the pog here.
Also,

782
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,220
how many corn fed asks is
do I need get into seats

783
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,960
to get you to make a stop in De
Moines, Iowa? I've been up there.

784
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,860
I was up there in the last year.
I did a Gig at Iowa state.

785
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,560
I don't know if that's the morning.
I'll get all that and give a fuck.

786
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,400
I'll go out there.
A hippie music blind spot.

787
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:49,510
Always something I learned with drumming.
Uh,

788
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,190
that thrash,

789
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,020
the thrash drum beat is
the same beat and like,

790
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,830
like shout music.
Basically.

791
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,710
It's just the bands
there playing with the,

792
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:07,450
how they phrase the music on top is
different. Punk thrash and shout music.

793
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:13,090
There's a lot of fucking similarities
and that's one to grow on. Hippie music.

794
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:16,590
Blind spot.
A dear Billy curve bald.

795
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,410
I love your podcast and I'm coming
to see in Denver. Thank you.

796
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,950
I love to hear you talk about music
and drummers in particular. All right.

797
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:31,600
I got somebody new that I'm
following on Instagram. Instagram. I,

798
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:36,460
she just came up in my feed and
she blew me away. Uh, what is it?

799
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,040
Oh fuck the pocket queen.

800
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,850
And I thought it was funny cause I don't
know if she's a guns and roses fan or

801
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:44,710
if it's just a coincidence,
but a, you know,

802
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:49,950
rocket queen guns and roses fan
and then the pocket queens and uh,

803
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,790
she's just an amazing,

804
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,630
amazing drummer who's having the
time of her life when she plays.

805
00:48:55,631 --> 00:49:00,631
I think it's the
underscore a pocket drama.

806
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:04,390
But uh,
I started following her and um,

807
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,400
that'd be, I don't know, she's just a
fucking amazing drummer. So anyways,

808
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,120
plowing ahead here. Uh, where is it here?

809
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,730
I love to hear you talk about
music and traumas in particular.

810
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:20,230
Have you ever taken a listen to John
Fishermen, the drummer and fish? I know,

811
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:22,510
bunch of hairy hippies.
I get it. You know,

812
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:25,540
it's not that it's that their
songs or 17 minutes long,

813
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:28,550
it's just such a fucking commitment.
Um,

814
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,420
I will say because of fish,

815
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,840
I learned about the little feet
album waiting for Columbus,

816
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:39,160
so I would do one at their live album.
I do want to thank them for that. Um,

817
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,760
then he was, people always put
them in the hippie music category,

818
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:46,090
but they aren't the fucking
mamas and the Papas.

819
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,880
I don't mind the mamas and the Papas.
My mother loved them.

820
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,120
So when I listened to them, reminds
me of driving around, you know,

821
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,880
in the car when I was a kid with my mom,
uh,

822
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:59,800
they've put on more sold out shows and
consecutively my computer just died

823
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,393
the fuck.

824
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,863
All right.

825
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:11,480
They put up more shows consecutively
at Msg than anyone ever. Wow.

826
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,150
Even when the Billy Joel,
Huh. And at any rate,

827
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,480
love episode family and go fuck
yourself. All right, well give me,

828
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,720
give me a fucking album that I can,
you know,

829
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,840
that's a good jump off that I
could get into this shit. Um,

830
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,140
I saw them live in the early
nineties at the Boston Garden.

831
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:33,630
They headlined the spin doctors
were there off their first album.

832
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,450
Little Miss can't be wrong. All of
that shit. It was like a fucking, uh,

833
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,130
uh, grunge thing. I don't know what
the fuck it was. It was like overnight.

834
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:46,440
All of a sudden it had just changed.

835
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:51,060
It was 1992 when I saw him.

836
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,160
Let me see if I can look that up,
see if I could find that.

837
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:59,250
The whole lineup and I think I
want to say WBCN was a part of it.

838
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:03,090
Let's see here.
A fish.

839
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:04,870
Okay.

840
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:09,230
Spin doctors.
Boston Garden.

841
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,940
1992.

842
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:17,350
Yeah.

843
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:18,910
Okay.

844
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:22,260
No Way. Yeah. October 30th. I mean,

845
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:27,010
the reason why I went
there was because, uh, the,

846
00:51:27,011 --> 00:51:31,740
the sketch comedy group, Alan, the
monkeys had won the BCN comedy, right.

847
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,120
Al Del Benny, Dane Cook, Bobby Kelly
were in it and they perform there too.

848
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:40,750
And I got to watch them perform at
Boston Garden. And let me see if, uh,

849
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:46,090
they got the lineup. This was a
semi Halloween theme. Devil's night.

850
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,500
One set show at the WBC New
Music Concert Rocca Boston event.

851
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,550
It was fish first show at the
Boston Garden. Oh, no way.

852
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,760
I saw that show.
This is how old I am.

853
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:02,650
They actually have to
describe the Boston Garden.

854
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:07,210
A historic basketball and ice hockey
arena built in the 20s with a capacity of

855
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:11,140
about 15,000 addition to
fish and the spin doctors,

856
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,280
the level levelers materially issue.

857
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:19,420
Michael Penn and a comedy troupe
that include Dane Cook. Alan,

858
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:22,360
the monkeys performed between,
but there was called Allen the monkeys.

859
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,550
The comedy to committees
were okay. We won't, we won't
get into the rest of it. Uh,

860
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,200
um, anyways, plowing ahead. Uh, yeah,

861
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,530
I saw them I guess October 30th.
That's right. That's right.

862
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,800
I just started doing comedy right around
them was right when I met Patrice.

863
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:43,990
So there you go.
So I've actually seen them.

864
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,710
So there's a lot of like psycho phish
fans that would be like, oh my God,

865
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:50,050
you still up for the first
time at the bus to garden?

866
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,140
I saw one of their legendary shows
and had no idea who they were.

867
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:55,810
I just remember they had these
little workout trampolines,

868
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,080
personal trampolines that they were
jumping up and down on the whole time and

869
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:02,980
the crowd was jumping with them and
I thought they were cool. But, uh,

870
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,730
I never really got into all
right. Race documentary. Hi Bill.

871
00:53:06,731 --> 00:53:10,390
I was listening to your podcast where
you talked about your new interests in

872
00:53:10,391 --> 00:53:14,850
Moto GP. Uh, yeah, it's
fucking, I'm obsessed with, uh,

873
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:19,950
you should check out this documentary
about the annual isle of Man tt race.

874
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:23,260
I was trying to go to that the last two
years and I can't get anybody to go with

875
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:27,800
me. It's not moto GP, but it
has similar bikes I think.

876
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,430
Yeah, it's uh, yeah, it's,

877
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:33,290
it's a road race around the island
and more people have died than years.

878
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:37,370
They've had it. So, I mean,
it's incredibly dangerous.
I'd like to go see it,

879
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:39,120
see people driving that fast,
but I don't know,

880
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,700
watch somebody die either or die myself.
Um,

881
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,930
was shit flying into the crowd.
It's road racing instead of track.

882
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,010
So there's no tire walls to crash into,
et cetera.

883
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,100
It's insanely dangerous. Usually
couple writers are killed each year.

884
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:59,480
And this document who falls one of the
writers for one of the years. I've only,

885
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,610
I only have a passing interest in racing,

886
00:54:01,611 --> 00:54:04,100
but this illustrates the danger
of the sport really well.

887
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:09,350
In case the link doesn't work, the doc
is called tt three d closer to the edge.

888
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,240
Love the podcasts. You cracked me up.
Uh, I might even buy some of your shit.

889
00:54:14,241 --> 00:54:18,230
You're pedaling. I'm really not pet.
I don't sell anything on my website.

890
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:23,600
All right? So I didn't need the
little snide fucking comment. Oh,

891
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:27,080
l maybe just talking about the shit that
I'm advertising and that case fucking

892
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,400
about it.
All right.

893
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,960
The evil woman.
Ooh,

894
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,820
evil woman.

895
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:39,010
Uh,
Dear Billy Hale Bob,

896
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:44,170
I don't get that. Oh, my
fucking daughter's up here.

897
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:45,880
I gotta I gotta finish this thing.
All right.

898
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:49,780
I was watching the documentary called
wild wild country with my girlfriend.

899
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:55,110
It's about a group of followers of a
guru from India who set up shot shop in a

900
00:54:55,421 --> 00:54:58,000
remote town in Oregon.
Everybody's watching this right now.

901
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,080
I won't get into the higher question of
what is a cult and what does a religion,

902
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,400
oh, I'll tell you the exact thing. A,

903
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,180
a cult is a new religion.

904
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,900
A religion is a former
cult that took over.

905
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,760
That's the only difference.

906
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:18,510
A while watching my girlfriend
while watching my girlfriend
didn't seem as angry

907
00:55:18,671 --> 00:55:22,960
with a particular person is I was the
first in command under the guru was a

908
00:55:22,961 --> 00:55:27,550
woman named Sheila. I don't want
to spoil the doc free listener,

909
00:55:27,551 --> 00:55:32,380
but she did some evil shit in the name
of her cause I, yeah, yeah, she did.

910
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,400
She was a fucking lunatic.
I'm like most guys who are in power,

911
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:39,040
she acted accordingly.
See,

912
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:42,010
and that's the thing right there where
they sit there and they act like if women

913
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:44,980
ran the world, there would
be no war. It's, it's not,

914
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,960
it doesn't have to do with sex.

915
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,460
Most people when given
power do not handle it well.

916
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,690
Uh, they either hurt other
people, they hurt themselves,

917
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,530
they sabotage it because they can't
deal with the fucking pressure.

918
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:05,020
Or they just become a con like me. Uh,
she's a very compelling person to hear.

919
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:08,640
And speak, and I understand how some
of her might find a charismatic,

920
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,150
I liked her to a point.

921
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,550
I liked that she was just like standing
up to everybody, but then, uh, you know,

922
00:56:15,551 --> 00:56:20,290
she went too far. She kind
of went like, uh, you know,

923
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,380
I'll fucking kill everybody instead
of just the people she was upset with.

924
00:56:25,731 --> 00:56:28,640
She didn't try to hurt them. She
tried to fuck over everybody. Uh,

925
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:31,670
but when it gets to the part for the,
this six part series,

926
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:36,020
you started hearing about the town's
water supplies being poisoned under her

927
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:40,520
authority. Uh, he goes on, this
is disgusting, isn't it? No,

928
00:56:40,521 --> 00:56:45,050
that's fucking terrorism. But this
is, you know, what, 25 years before,

929
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:49,610
27 years before, uh, 20 years,
maybe before nine 11. So, um,

930
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,330
okay.

931
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,430
She was just considered
a, you know, bitchy.

932
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,460
I think my girlfriend started giving me
a hard time for calling this Sheila cunt

933
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,390
saying, I worship guys like Tony
Soprano and Walter White. Uh, yeah.

934
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,290
He goes, yeah, I do. I worship
fictional characters that they were,

935
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,300
but I never defended waste management,

936
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,980
racketeering and lying to my family
about being a meth chemist. Uh,

937
00:57:13,981 --> 00:57:18,480
it ended with her telling me that I'm
biased towards the achievements of men.

938
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,120
I can't deal with this lack of rationale.

939
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:25,440
I'm considering breaking it
off with their thoughts. Um,

940
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,760
keep your calm and just say,
listen,

941
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:33,390
the difference between me liking,
you know,

942
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:38,450
anti heroes in a movie versus you
liking antihero that actually existed in

943
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:42,930
really poisoned the town.
You just say, listen,

944
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:47,100
if Tony Soprano Walter, right, we're
real people. I wouldn't be a fan of them,

945
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,170
but you know, you know, you like
to surprise you. You're, you're,

946
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,880
you like the characters. You like the
acting, the writing, the way it's shot,

947
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:01,310
you know, breaking bad and all that.
That's, that's, that's all that is a,

948
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:04,410
if you considered breaking it off with
her over this and I would say, you know,

949
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,430
I think you should, I mean, if this
is enough to make you break it off,

950
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,293
you might as well,

951
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,503
you know,

952
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,280
just, you know, I wouldn't drink your
tap water for a couple of months.

953
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,620
Apparently. I'm controlling
is the name of this. Uh,

954
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:26,370
yeah.

955
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,710
Yeah.
I'm going to say just by that title,

956
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:32,550
I'm going to say that you are
apparently I'm controlling.

957
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,410
Like people will always like get called
out on this shit. They'll go with,

958
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,820
you know, it's like that
bearded content, the flyers.

959
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:42,600
Every time he fucking takes out somebody's
knee and every time he, it's like,

960
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:46,260
so Blake, what the fuck he just did.
It's like totally away from the pocket,

961
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,600
complete penalty. And he always puts
his hand. I was like, what the fuck?

962
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,040
What the fuck did I tow
a dear Billy bung hole?

963
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,530
I recently started dating this lady

964
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:59,410
d

965
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,660
and everything was going well,

966
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,340
so I decided to invite her to a
mariners game for opening weekend.

967
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,950
You know, had I known you were gonna
say the name of the baseball team,

968
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:13,230
I would've switched it just to,
in case I don't know so much.

969
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,030
Somebody figures this out. Anyways,
I knew she was a baseball fan.

970
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:21,100
It would be excited to go. I invited
her and she said that sounded really,

971
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:24,450
so I was really excited as well.

972
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,930
I told her I would take care of the
tickets because I knew finding tickets for

973
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,490
opening weekend would be hard,

974
00:59:29,491 --> 00:59:34,140
so she agreed and said she would pay
for food and drinks. Oh, look at this.

975
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,830
Everything's going great so far. It's
like a classic horror movie, you know,

976
00:59:37,831 --> 00:59:39,240
they get to the fucking crystal lake.

977
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:43,170
Everybody's having a good time and it's
all enjoyable to the first time they go

978
00:59:43,171 --> 00:59:44,004
check.

979
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,720
A couple of days later she started
having car troubles and was worried she

980
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:55,230
couldn't make it to the game because she
wanted to fix her car by Monday and the

981
00:59:55,231 --> 00:59:58,180
game was on Sunday.
I live in the city and don't have a car,

982
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:02,250
but offered to rent a car to pick her up
or we could ride the bus together since

983
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:06,750
we would be drinking and the bus drops
people off right outside the stadium.

984
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,640
She didn't answer my texts for a couple
of days and told me less than told me

985
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,880
less than 24 hours that she
wasn't going to make it.

986
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,200
I sent her a text back saying that I was
upset about it and that if we had just

987
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:23,790
had a regular day date
scheduled, I wouldn't mind.
But the tickets weren't cheap.

988
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,760
Front row,
lower level outfield.

989
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,910
And I don't get to go to many ball
games at, it's important to me.

990
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,740
She didn't reply until the next day and
said she wants to stop seeing me because

991
01:00:34,741 --> 01:00:36,270
the tech same controlling.

992
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,930
But I was honestly just trying to tell
her how I felt about being ditched.

993
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:45,060
I'm usually a pushover and this was the
first time I sent texts like this before.

994
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:49,020
So do you think that I was
being controlling that would
appreciate some advice.

995
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:53,310
Thank you. And Go fuck yourself.
Ps, bring back the sonics. Oh,

996
01:00:53,311 --> 01:00:56,730
you're going to get a hockey team instead.
Sonics on ice.

997
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,420
Okay.

998
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,250
Calm is Seattle soliloquy piece.
Um,

999
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:02,580
yeah.

1000
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,090
No, but I understand both. She has to
get to go to work on fucking Monday.

1001
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:10,740
She wants to make sure cars are right.
I get that. This, but to say that she,

1002
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:14,940
you're controlling and she
wants to stop seeing you.

1003
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,080
Um,

1004
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:21,350
I would say she dated a psycho before and
is a little gun shy or she wasn't that

1005
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:26,670
NC anyways, to quote
Greg Barrett, you know,

1006
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,950
um, I hope he just went to the
game with a buddy or yours.

1007
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:31,950
It got fucking hammered.

1008
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,120
Okay.

1009
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,960
Um, yeah, I dunno, I would just
write back, just say, you know, well,

1010
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,050
I guess we had a miscommunication.

1011
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:43,480
Okay.

1012
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,840
But I have to admit, if you
know, one little spat like that,

1013
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,540
it makes you think about
breaking up with me.

1014
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,670
I kind of feel like you're
not that into me anyway.

1015
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:56,310
So before one of us really gets hurt,
why don't we just,

1016
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:00,340
let's just end his friends and really
try to end his friends. That is,

1017
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,170
that is such a skill I wish I had.

1018
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,620
And to add the way you end
is friends with somebody.

1019
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:07,800
Okay.

1020
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,340
This is for men and women is you just,
you have to be 100% honest with them,

1021
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,770
you know?
Uh,

1022
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,800
and if you haven't been
honest with somebody and
you're in a relationship right

1023
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,660
now,
if you're really honest with them now,

1024
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,250
there's still probably going to hate you.

1025
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:27,790
But you still have to do it because what
she's doing now is you're setting up

1026
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,180
healthy relationships in the future.
All right?

1027
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:37,160
So then he could just got it all
out there. They knew from day one,

1028
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,900
from day one, when you meet a woman, you
do what's, what's going on between us.

1029
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:46,010
Not that I've just, you know, I'm not
looking to be in a relationship right now.

1030
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:50,990
I'm just having fun. That's it. So
why you just want to have sex with me?

1031
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:51,973
Yes.

1032
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:59,150
But yet I know what you're gorgeous.
I'm attracted to.

1033
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,940
There are, I'll practice safe
sex. Do you want to get fucked?

1034
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:08,090
I'm the man for the job. You don't have
to be that honest. All right. Anyways,

1035
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,110
black girlfriends, family. Hey Billy Bird.

1036
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:15,110
Pubes guys are killing me today.

1037
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:19,730
I'm a 24 or five year old guy and I've
been with my girlfriend about eight

1038
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:22,370
months,
uh,

1039
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,780
25 year old guy, but with my
girlfriend for about 18 months. Sorry.

1040
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:30,050
Things are great between us and
she's awesome. We're both single.

1041
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:35,051
Parents have a four of four year olds
are both in school and both work decent

1042
01:03:35,631 --> 01:03:39,590
jobs. All right. I have to ask you
this before we go any further. Uh,

1043
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,940
at night, do you dress up like a
black woman? I'm just, you know,

1044
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,380
this is too many coincidences.

1045
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:48,490
Does this like some fucking psycho
shit where it's your Norman annual,

1046
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:52,010
your mother? No. All right, I'll continue.

1047
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,250
She's a great mother, a
very sweet, encouraging,

1048
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:58,910
beautiful woman who keeps herself in great
shape and is working on her doctorate

1049
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:03,390
in nursing. The total package. The
only problem is her family, bub, bub,

1050
01:04:03,391 --> 01:04:05,090
bub bomb back.

1051
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,290
She's a black woman and I'm the
first white guy she's been with.

1052
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:13,970
My daughter is mixed and I'm used to
dating interracially and my parents and

1053
01:04:13,971 --> 01:04:18,860
brothers lover, but with her family,
her brothers and dad just don't like me.

1054
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:23,600
They barely speak to me even though we
have a lot of the same interest in sports,

1055
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:28,520
music, et cetera. This sounds like a like
a fucking ice cube movie. Her mother,

1056
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:31,430
grandmother and sister loved
me and we get along great,

1057
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:35,240
but I plan on marrying her and would like
a good relationship with the brothers

1058
01:04:35,241 --> 01:04:35,841
and a dad.

1059
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:40,841
They have no reason to dislike me as I
treat my girlfriend very well and have

1060
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:43,430
never acted like an asshole
around that boy. Yeah.

1061
01:04:43,431 --> 01:04:46,220
You're getting judged probably
by other white people. Uh,

1062
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,450
and the shift that they've done.

1063
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,360
The only thing we can think of is they
don't like me because I'm white because

1064
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:58,280
she said her, she said her ex
and them were cool and even

1065
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,860
hoop together often. Oh, wait
away. Okay. So her ex all day,

1066
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:05,300
like the other boyfriend better.

1067
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:09,650
Her brothers said to me a few weeks ago
when I tried to talk him and invite him

1068
01:05:09,651 --> 01:05:14,060
to play ball, he said, we
got nothing to speak on.

1069
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,190
You're never going to be my be family.

1070
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:21,000
It came out of nowhere before
they were just cold to me.

1071
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,640
I've come across people
being prejudice to me,

1072
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:26,760
well hooping and in my area I grew up,

1073
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:30,900
but it's just weird because they actually
know me and know how much I care about

1074
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:31,734
their sister.

1075
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:36,630
Any advice from you or the lovely Nia
on how to approach the situation or if

1076
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,160
you've ever run into this problem?

1077
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:43,220
I'm saving up to buyer to buy a ring
and we'd like to rectify this before

1078
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:45,090
committing the rest of my life to her.

1079
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,600
Thanks for all the laughs over the
years and go fuck yourself. Ah,

1080
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:50,250
that's a fucking major issue.

1081
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,490
That's a major issue.
And,

1082
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,340
and relationships are hard enough.

1083
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,640
Forget about when one whole side

1084
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,640
of the family doesn't like you.

1085
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,263
MMM.

1086
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,660
I would just use humor. That's how I'd
get through it. I go over a hustler like,

1087
01:06:11,661 --> 01:06:16,130
hey everybody, it's the white
guy. Nobody likes, yeah,

1088
01:06:16,131 --> 01:06:18,680
you guys want me to stand outside
while you talk to you, your,

1089
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,420
that your daughter or sister?

1090
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,210
Um, I dunno. Or an act extra white.

1091
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:32,160
I go over there dressed like an a with
a Donald Trump extra long red tie.

1092
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,960
I just started having fun with it,
you know.

1093
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,460
Hey, do you guys see that, that
fucking great speech by Trump?

1094
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:42,750
Yeah.

1095
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,510
I don't know. See, I'm a dick. I
would, I'd probably start doing that,

1096
01:06:45,511 --> 01:06:49,740
but I gotta be honest. Uh,
that's going to wear on. Thanks.

1097
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,560
I think I would pump the brakes on
the ring until you work that out.

1098
01:06:55,650 --> 01:07:00,270
And, uh, I think you guys should maybe the
need help beyond some Dick joke fucking

1099
01:07:00,271 --> 01:07:03,090
comedian.
Um,

1100
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,353
okay.

1101
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,593
Yeah.

1102
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,340
Cause that sounds like that's
going in a direction where,

1103
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:16,360
uh, you're going to have to, she's
going to have to make a choice,

1104
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,690
either be with you or have a relationship
with the family. I don't know,

1105
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,760
but that's,
that's above my pay grade.

1106
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:28,070
So my advice to you is I would
talk to her about it and,

1107
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:28,933
um,

1108
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:31,933
okay.

1109
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,950
You know, I would tell
us it, listen, you know,

1110
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,960
I'm ready to commit to you for
the rest of my life, but like,

1111
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,350
I don't know if I could,
I don't,

1112
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:43,720
I don't want to commit to that because
this is his thing. You don't marry her,

1113
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:46,600
you marry her family in a for
family, fucking hate you, dude.

1114
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,270
You're going to be miserable.
All right.

1115
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,770
And having Ben with somebody
for as long as I have, you know,

1116
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:57,520
there's ups and downs and shit,
even without that,

1117
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:01,990
fortunately near his family is fucking
awesome. So I lucked out there.

1118
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:06,970
And even then, we still had difficult
times, mostly because I'm a fucking idiot.

1119
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,920
But, um, yeah. So I would try
to work that up. All right.

1120
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:19,180
Yeah. What the fuck you in a rush
for? You know, you already have a kid.

1121
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:21,790
Okay. And, uh,

1122
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,340
I dunno. I would just feel listened
to. I'm not going over your head.

1123
01:08:26,341 --> 01:08:28,320
They don't fucking don't want me
around there again. Fuck them.

1124
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,980
You know, I don't give a shit. I'm tired
of going over there being like, Hey,

1125
01:08:34,981 --> 01:08:37,410
what do you want to fucking hang out? And
they go, yeah, get the fuck out of here.

1126
01:08:37,411 --> 01:08:40,470
So it's just like, all
right, I get it. I get it.

1127
01:08:40,471 --> 01:08:42,210
But there's no reason it'd be stubborn,

1128
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:47,430
you know all about it.
Um,

1129
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,010
it's weird because your heart's involved,
but anybody with a brain would be like,

1130
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:54,570
well dude, that's going to be a
fucking miserable marriage. Yeah.

1131
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,010
Okay.

1132
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:56,843
You know,

1133
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,420
God,
Jesus Christ,

1134
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:02,030
and then what they're going to show
up at the fucking man at the wedding.

1135
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,490
Just fucking mean mugging
here the whole time. Okay.

1136
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:12,790
Oh, Davis, if you marry a fucking
