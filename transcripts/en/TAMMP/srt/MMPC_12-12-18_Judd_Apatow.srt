1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,721
All right.
Hey,

2
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:05,721
what's going on is bill burr and it's
time for a special episode of the Monday

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,960
morning podcast. It's not on
Monday. It's not on Thursday.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,690
It's coming out, I guess
what? Tuesday, Wednesday.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,420
We're going to put this out as soon as
we can. I have a special guest here.

6
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,760
You know, I don't do a lot of
guests, so if I bring somebody in,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,300
they gotta be a heavy hitter. That's
right. They got to be a mover, a shaker,

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,150
a shot caller. We have the one and only
John Apatow here. Pleasure to be here.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,750
How are you buddy?
I like to be,

10
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:31,320
or usually you're all by yourself
just talking to the wall. Yes I am.

11
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:35,910
And usually you're in the
midst of producing was
fascinates me. I tried to, uh,

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,690
talk to you about this because a, I like
to think I'm kind of a busy man too.

13
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:44,190
How you manage to have movies,

14
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:48,330
TV shows,
standup special masterclass,

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,670
a documentary on Garry Shandling,

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,750
how they'll fuck management.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,060
Keep all like how big is the bolt and the,
the war room?

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,590
It's all management technique.
That's what you want to know.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,510
I'll tell you a good management technique.

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,050
The staff of crashing is the room
right now writing the fourth season.

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,650
Third season comes out in January,

22
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,620
but they're writing the fourth
season and I'm here with you.

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,220
Yes, that's managed well. So
how do you check in with that?

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,960
How do I check it every day?

25
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:20,200
Did they send you a draft and you just
kind of keep it in bounds of where it

26
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:23,580
needs to be or at season four?
Is it sort of up and running?

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,600
Well, usually what it is is Pete
and I, uh, and also the Judah,

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,410
Mila and Oren who work on the show.

29
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:33,120
We'll kick around a little bit what
we think the season might be, right?

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,910
We bring in writers for a month and
we just kick it around very openly,

31
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:42,911
like anything is on the table and I'll
pop in and out of those meetings and,

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,480
and then there's notes that I'll read
the notes and then sit in for half a day

33
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,300
and then take a day off
and then pop back in.

34
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,630
And usually that gives me
some perspective. Because
you've been in those rooms.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,800
There's a lot of Chinese food, there's
a lot of danishes. He get tired.

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,730
Lunch is huge.

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,030
There's a lot of people talking about
things that have nothing to do with the

38
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:04,580
show for very long periods of time.
Uh,

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,620
and then at some point I'll sit with
Pete and he will go through everything

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,020
right and go, okay,
which ideas do we like?

41
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,470
You know what my favorite thing is?
Is the mental break.

42
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,690
You taking the writer's room, it's
like you're pitching, you're pitching,

43
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:17,830
you're pitching,
then you're fried.

44
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:20,430
And like I always look around the room
and I'll just see someone hasn't pitched

45
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,380
him in it and that just sort of staring
down at the ground for about 15,

46
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:25,930
20 minutes. And then they just come
back and be like, yeah, all right.

47
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:30,280
What if frank did that? If I can get,
but you literally, you have to do it.

48
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:33,370
And um,
what I learned on f is for family though,

49
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:37,420
is I didn't realize how fried you get yes.
In the writer's room.

50
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:39,490
And like my drinking went
off the rails a little bit.

51
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:43,450
It was was one little scotch and then it
just became like three. So last season.

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,450
At what time is

53
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,880
day though?
Are you having your Scotch in the room?

54
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,190
Oh, not in the room.
That was when I got home.

55
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:52,940
When I got home I would literally
just, you know, put on the fireplace,

56
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:54,710
turn it on now cause you
don't light a fire anymore,

57
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:59,590
you just turn it on and then I
would just sit there like uh, yeah.

58
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,670
And it was getting to that shit.

59
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,410
It was just like I need
this at the end of the day.

60
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,560
So in season three like I did this thing,
I'll go,

61
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,390
not only may not drink in this season,

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,630
I'm actually gonna try to do the
impossible, which is drop weight and just,

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,090
which I did, how I packed a
lunch. Like I was a second grader.

64
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,510
So every day that they would be going
out now I had like this keenwah being

65
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:25,300
thing that I would always have. And then
yeah, just fruit and nuts, you know,

66
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,390
it would be my, my snacks or
whatever. Cause this whole reward,

67
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,060
you want to reward yourself. You
know, you get to work whatever, nine,

68
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:34,900
10 o'clock and all you think,
oh morning is that they get 1230.

69
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,080
The food's gonna lay hand. Oh
yeah, the food's going to land.

70
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,180
Then we could stop talking about this
showing if this food and if everybody

71
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:44,650
voted a place that you fucking hate. It's
just like that is the longest day ever.

72
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,760
But if you're going to like,
you know,

73
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:49,450
it's like a Friday and they picked an
awesome like lunch place like d that can

74
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:51,280
literally,
you pitch better.

75
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,230
But I liked that you are not in charge
of that because the only area I will

76
00:03:56,231 --> 00:04:00,340
throw my weight around right is if they
say, hey, we're going to eat here today.

77
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,910
I'm very comfortable going,
we are not going there today.

78
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,120
Daddy needs this right now. There's
definitely a, there's a, uh,

79
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,420
there's also, there's a generation
gap and that also goes with nutrition.

80
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,550
You know, so there's people like
my show takes place in the 70s.

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
So that's those people that grew up in
the 70s and the other people who were

82
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,594
born in the 80s.

83
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,380
So there they're more likely to go to
something a little more healthy than the

84
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,920
old sort of John Wayne people in the
room. I'm like, I'm not eating that shit.

85
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:30,320
And some days there's a little bit
of a mutiny, but it's not about, uh,

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,640
the writers from here. I actually, they
sent me, which was really cool. Thank you.

87
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:37,780
You guys send me a link to the first
episode of season three of crashing with

88
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:41,110
the Great Pete Holmes. And,
uh, just once again, it's like,

89
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,380
like watching that show, it's like,
I've, I've lived this, I've, I've,

90
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,730
I don't want to give away what
the episode is about, but I mean,

91
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:50,980
and generally speaking,

92
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:55,900
it's like Pete has now gotten to the
point where he actually has his own place,

93
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,750
which is awesome. And he's mentoring
a young man. Yes. Yabuki from, uh,

94
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,380
a daily, it was on the daily show. Oh,
okay. Yeah. Who's great and it's he,

95
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:08,770
he finally feels cocky enough to give
someone else advice. Yeah. Oh yeah.

96
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,270
You have to sit and talk.
Like he's in the mix.

97
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,180
He's kind of feeling himself
a little bit and as always,

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,530
this business will humble you. So he ends
up getting humbled in. It's like, uh,

99
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,090
just the way the, the, uh,
how you, when he gets humbled,

100
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:26,220
I don't want to say it is
the way it's written that uh,

101
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,610
he then lashes out at this person that
he kind of smoothed stuff over with.

102
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,120
And that's just like the worst,
especially with the woman.

103
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,760
Then you get that whole, you are enjoying
this, aren't you? You're enjoying that.

104
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:39,820
I mean, I literally had that fight
with my wife like two days ago.

105
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,550
What was she enjoying then? I lost my
temper. Yeah. And then she, you know,

106
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,460
and then she gets, you know, like,
you know how the deal is with women.

107
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,620
Nothing is off bounds,
but like you with you,

108
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:53,470
you have to stay within the lines are,
I'll, she'll never hear the end of it.

109
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,100
So you know, she, you know, you know, she
was driving the car all over the place,

110
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,100
all over my life.
Let

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,420
me know who I was. But you know, she
was right about a lot of it. And, uh,

112
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,460
that's a worst part is that they
are right about a lot of it. No,

113
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,610
but they're all so wrong. So I did
this, this whole period now where women,

114
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,940
like they went from nobody listening to
them to now everything that they say is

115
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,270
spun with gold is, it's, it's, it's,
it's getting ridiculous. I was like,

116
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,000
we have to be okay, let's, let's,
you know, women are like, guys,

117
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,860
a lot of them are just full
of Shit, you know, as our men.

118
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:24,320
So I mean that's the art of life is
trying to figure out who actually has the

119
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:29,230
information that you need, which is why
when I talked to you, how to, you know,

120
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,670
manage a shell, you have the goods with
everything you've got going on here. Um,

121
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,120
well sometimes you know,

122
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:40,121
the thing about it is that you do need
someone who has the perspective to judge

123
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,350
ideas and how things are going.

124
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,520
So there's a process of generating
maybe a thousand ideas for a show,

125
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,150
but if you're burnt out from
being part of that generation,

126
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,830
it's hard for you to pick what works.
Yeah.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,320
And so like at girls I,
I was very involved in the writing,

128
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,080
but I wouldn't go to the set
because it was so well directed.

129
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,960
There was no reason for me to be there.
The footage always was great.

130
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:07,280
And Lena and January graded monitoring
the directors and directing themselves.

131
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,650
At what point did you have
confidence to be like, all right,

132
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,990
this thing is cruising?
Well,

133
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,830
I don't think I ever felt like
it was it w it was cruising,

134
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,510
but I had confidence in if the script
was good, they would shoot it great.

135
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,640
And then I can put all my energy into
just reading the scripts to give them a,

136
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,470
a person who could tell them if
the script's worked, you know,

137
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,190
so they were tired from shooting and
writing and they're exhausted and I,

138
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,970
I'm able to have a little more energy
to just read and go on to page four.

139
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,230
It's weird. Why did they say
that? It's not tracking and it's,

140
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,390
that's hard to do when you're in the
thick of it and you're exhausted.

141
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,380
And so there is a value to,
you know,

142
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,530
picking where you're helpful and where
you're like, you don't need me here.

143
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:55,070
I don't have to sit and look at over the
director's shoulder. You're nailing it.

144
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,090
Let me save that energy for the
writing part. I hate to admit this,

145
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,400
but actually enjoy being in
the writer's room. Oh yeah.

146
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,310
I was like kicking and scream and thinking
about God, I'm a comedian. I'm free.

147
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:06,300
Why the fuck am I going to
go back into the math class?

148
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:09,800
So whatever I should say it.
It's on days where it's working,

149
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,760
when it's working and it's cruising and
we're getting good notes, you know, uh,

150
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,730
we always get good notes, but I
mean, positive notes from Netflix,

151
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,760
like we enjoy this, but then on the
days where like, this doesn't really,

152
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,950
there's too much of that.
And then we go, all right,

153
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,200
and then we try to fix it and
then it's just not working.

154
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,840
Those are the days where I feel like I'm
back in high school and I'm just like,

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,870
it's like, it's the clock broken. Like
what, what, what are we doing here?

156
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:32,300
So you're the teacher.
That's the thing, you know,

157
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:34,580
when you work on the show
and you're not the teacher,

158
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:38,870
like at the Larry Sanders show, if we
did a table read and it wasn't working,

159
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,200
then suddenly there is
someone upset with you, right?

160
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,190
And you are ashamed child that at
the script and look up and you're,

161
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,800
then you're like, how can I fix it? And,

162
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,970
and there's almost a daddy or mommy
character that you're disappointing if the

163
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,940
show isn't working or
if the isn't working.

164
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:59,990
There's a lot of ways for it to be
super unhealthy, but it is more fun.

165
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:03,500
You're right when you're that person and
you can treat people well and you have

166
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,620
your own strong point of view,
it's not as painful.

167
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,380
Well, I would say in my room it, Mike
prices, he's the captain of the ship.

168
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:14,580
So I'm the guy that's sorta chimes
in and tries to like, I dunno, uh,

169
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,500
keep it like certain things
tethered to reality if it,

170
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,070
if it starts getting a little
too like absurd. But you know,

171
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,660
you brought up Gary Shandling who like,
you know,

172
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,910
anybody who was even
remotely in the comedy just,

173
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:31,740
and I mean that guy is like on the Mount
Rushmore there. And uh, I just remember,

174
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:35,220
you know, I watched, you know, you know,
this is the theme, the gallery show.

175
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:36,660
I watched this first one,
I watched everything.

176
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,240
I used to watch this tonight show sets.
I just always just thought the guy,

177
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,860
he just always, it was funny when
even like when I was in junior high,

178
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:47,310
I was like in seventh grade I knew that
his stuff was just funnier that it was,

179
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,600
this is like a different level.

180
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,150
Like this guy is better than all of these
other guys. And I was wondering what,

181
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,610
like what was that like, you know, cause
I, I really, I sent an email about that.

182
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,230
Like I thought the Garry Shandling
documentary that you did with that,

183
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,260
that's my favorite thing you've done.
And I have thank you,

184
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,590
40 year old virgin and all this stuff.
But um,

185
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,520
what was that like because you were
friends with somebody like that? Um,

186
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,060
you know, myself, I've lost a couple of
friends and I know that certain things,

187
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,840
it just gets like really emotional.
What was the key,

188
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,300
but I never delved into their life.
To the level that,

189
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,150
that you did with, with Gary, who was
like a friend and a mentor to you.

190
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:26,010
Like what was that process like? Like
how long did it take you to, to, to,

191
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,390
you know, cause that was on par with
like, did you see that eagles documentary?

192
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,050
I love that. It was like three hours
long and it fell. He was 20 minutes.

193
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,350
I got through like a cross
country flight watching that.

194
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,470
I felt like the Gary Shandling duck
was like that. What was that like?

195
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,490
It was like the Eagles Doc. If,
if Gary, uh, wasn't on coke. Yeah.

196
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,050
Well you know, it's funny cause now that
it's over and I've been, uh, you know,

197
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,940
I finished at six or eight months ago,
something like that. Looking back,

198
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,230
it's almost like a fever dream that
I even did it right because he died.

199
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:05,310
I was really depressed and it threw me
more than I thought because he was a

200
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:10,311
constant presence of support and I didn't
realize what an important beam he was

201
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,300
in everything. And, and uh, and I thought,

202
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,100
I think there's just a lesson
that he wants to teach everybody.

203
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,550
And I'll tell you a story that it kind
of launched the documentary is that I

204
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:29,520
went to Gary's cremation.
And so Gary's cremation was very,

205
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,990
I mean, people don't go to cremations.
You're not supposed to go to cremation.

206
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,800
When you saw him, like
sliding the body in, well,

207
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,190
kind of the CSUS Jud basically,

208
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,870
basically, uh, how did you get
tickets to that? I mean, I only,

209
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,190
I only tell this story
because I think it's, it,

210
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,500
it's helpful to people in their
own lives is that, uh, you know,

211
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,870
a friend put together
a very small service.

212
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:02,670
So if you can imagine there's only
like eight people there and you know,

213
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
oven basically and,

214
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:09,130
and like for a Buddhist monks,
right?

215
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,180
So it takes the edge off a little bit.
Like here, they're not freaking out yet.

216
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,190
They would, they were fine with
it. That's their whole religion.

217
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,760
So we go to this place and it's in the
valley and it's not that far from these

218
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:24,760
offices and it's, you know, a crematorium.

219
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,910
Is it part of a strip mall is like
ramen noodles, getting a tax done,

220
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,720
watching your friend get burned.
Even worse,

221
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,840
deeper in the valley where it's just
next to a place that like, you know,

222
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,910
makes glass bowls or something
in an industrial area.

223
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,140
So we go there, it's clear no one's
ever had a service in this space.

224
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,070
This isn't what people do, right?
So there's no like room to do it.

225
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,280
We're literally in like the lobby of a
place that looks like a sham business of

226
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:58,090
some someplace. Right? And like
what they're selling in the lobby,

227
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,700
there's literally just like
one desk and empty space.

228
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:05,701
And did you make sure it was Gary
underneath fucking we should a crash test

229
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:10,240
dummy. That'll be 50 grand. Like
what they were selling there.

230
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,193
They had these little,

231
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,970
these little pamphlets where you could
take some of the ashes of your beloved

232
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,360
and have them put into like a little
glass figurine you could put on your table

233
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:26,220
or like something you would wear itself,
gone,

234
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,230
gone. So we go, we go to
this, this place, and, uh,

235
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,740
we go into this little room and again,
it's like a,

236
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:38,430
couldn't be ratty are
really, and they have, uh,

237
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,030
a service, uh, which is very
sweet and it's beautiful.

238
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,920
[inaudible] and moving and all of
the ideas of, of Buddhism and the,

239
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,450
and, uh, and then they
take us in this room.

240
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:56,410
Now the room with the crematorium,
it's like the kitchen to a restaurant.

241
00:13:56,411 --> 00:14:00,640
It's just like a big room with a
cement floor and like four or five.

242
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:04,990
So they did a little service. They hit
some little fucking gongs or something.

243
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:05,880
Like what happened?
Yeah,

244
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,500
they did Buddhist prayers and they
talked about Carrie's life and,

245
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,540
uh, and, and what life is about, you
know, you, you live, you die, you,

246
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,900
you learn the lessons that you can,
you try to be as loving and kindness.

247
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,240
You can hopefully you, uh, you know,

248
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,530
you grew and it was very sweet tea.
That actually sounds cool. Now,

249
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:30,310
did they believe in a heaven and hell?
Buddhists people, here's what my issue,

250
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,880
Buddhism is.
As you get deeper and deeper into it,

251
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
it heads to reincarnation.
I,

252
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,660
I believe and I always get lost
when things get too magical.

253
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,670
I like something that's clear, like
life is about being kind. And that's it.

254
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,680
Like that's,
that's as far as I usually can get.

255
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:50,290
I use this script writer
and you needed to land

256
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,900
magical in any way. As soon as someone's
reborn and goes to heaven or, hell, I'm,

257
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:01,490
I've lost, I have trouble
now. I'm not 100% closed,

258
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,670
but I'm pretty close. Uh, but I do,

259
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,700
I can get interested in ideas that are
about how can we let go of our egos and

260
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:15,490
be kind. That's all I need. Okay. So
we have the service and it's, and it's,

261
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,810
they bring into the other room moving
and then we go in the other room

262
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,640
and it's literally a table
with a cardboard coffin.

263
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,710
And then they say some more prayers.

264
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,160
And then at some point
they open up an oven,

265
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,530
which looks like almost like
a dishwasher in a restaurant.

266
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,210
And they roll it into flames already
going or do they turn it on after they

267
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:41,860
closed the door?
There's a pilot light and uh,

268
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,650
and then what did they stick?

269
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,670
It's literally not that far
from a pizza oven. Okay.

270
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,770
And you know, they put,
uh, the cardboard coffin,

271
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,850
then they close,

272
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,740
close it almost like if a dishwasher in
a restaurant and then they ask who wants

273
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:04,490
to push the button? Oh
Jesus. And you know,

274
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,160
they're saying that they have a bunch
of fake buttons, like a firing squad.

275
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,500
Like somebody gets to like young
guy really blows his brains out.

276
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,900
He had no one wants to know who,
who pushed the button.

277
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,700
You don't want to carry that. And
then a friend of Gary's, you know,

278
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,920
push the button and then
suddenly you're here at fire up,

279
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,371
you know,

280
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:27,371
it's getting hotter than your normal
pizza oven and the room gets hot.

281
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,050
And then it's like you smell
something burning. Like it's like,

282
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,530
you know,

283
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,340
if there was like a fire
at your neighbor's house
and suddenly you like your

284
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:42,310
chest hurts a little bit, then
you realize it's Gary, they, it,

285
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,570
there's no vent,
I guess.

286
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,070
I guess it maybe it was a place
that needed more ventilation. No,

287
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:51,380
I mean there is a vent.
It's not like overpowering,

288
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:53,260
like the room is all filled with smoke,
but you know,

289
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:58,070
do you realize like someday if you go
on a fast to get rid of toxins in your

290
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:02,240
body, part of that is Garry Shandling.
Exactly. And that would sadden me.

291
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,350
But, but that's what was crazy about
it. So now I love Gary so much.

292
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:11,180
I will never go on a fast and I breathed
it. Wow. And so, so I'm, you know,

293
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,440
watching this, crying my
eyes out, just balling.

294
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,440
It's as intense as anything
I've ever experienced.

295
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:22,030
This is pretty heavy and I'm feeling it
in my chest and I'm aware like that's

296
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:26,450
Gary, we're breathing in Gary. And
at first it, you know, pardon me,

297
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:29,560
it made me laugh like, yeah, cause this
is super creepy dude. You know, it's,

298
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,980
it's creepy. It's kind of weirdly, uh,

299
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,130
like the Gary always would make the
joke like I'm inside you, you know,

300
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,620
like there's like a sexual
joke to be made there.

301
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,390
And then I just thought God
carry would find this so funny.

302
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,980
All of us sitting here crying,
watching them cremate his,

303
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,440
he would think that this was fantastic
like me here bawling my eyes out.

304
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,010
Gary would look and just go like,
that's right. That's what it is.

305
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,400
That's what it is. And, and
I thought in that moment,

306
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,350
this is a lesson like having to
look at that will change your life.

307
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,100
Having to be at the crematorium
about, you know, what's important,

308
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:13,170
what do we care about?
How do we treat people?

309
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,800
What do you want to do with your life?
And I thought, Gary wanted me here.

310
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:21,100
He wanted me to go through this
hell in this freaking, you know,

311
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,630
always this part of his like,
no, he didn't ask for it,

312
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:27,690
but I decided in like a spiritual
level. I thought, this is it.

313
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Gary wants me to learn every freaking
lesson to the point of his incineration.

314
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,860
He wants me to look at in the eye and
take from it whatever I can take to be a

315
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:38,700
better person.

316
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,030
And I think in that moment was the
seed of how do I tell other people this

317
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:46,530
lesson?

318
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,550
Because I think in Gary's life he was
trying to figure out how to talk about

319
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,301
this stuff.
And you know,

320
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:54,510
it's very hard in comedy to do it
without seeming really corny or weird.

321
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,021
You know,

322
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:58,920
as soon as people start talking about
their spirituality in a sincere way,

323
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,960
we're all like, shut the
fuck up. And it feels,

324
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,290
you gotta be interviewed by Oprah and
she has to bring it out of you and act

325
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,360
like, well, she asked me
exactly the only way to,

326
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,930
that's the only cool way to do it. I
mean, I had so many friends that tried to,

327
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,610
and they always seemed odd.
And I think Gary,

328
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,490
when he did comedians
in cars getting coffee,

329
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:17,490
it was the first time he found
a way to be really funny,

330
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,950
but talk about some things
that he believed in.

331
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
And I think that was his goal
near the end of his life.

332
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:26,190
He was trying to figure out
how to reinvent how he did
stand up and get some of

333
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:29,910
these ideas in and he hadn't quite
cracked it. He was really into silence.

334
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,800
He loved not getting a laugh.

335
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:35,880
He loved putting people
through weird silences.

336
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,290
And he would say to the crowd
that that's where it all is.

337
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,960
It's all in that silence. Right.
And he didn't have a joke.

338
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:44,070
He didn't even know what to do with it.

339
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:48,060
He just knew in the room went dead
contemplating is what they're doing.

340
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,800
They're contemplating
with what was just said.

341
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,680
And so what I was working
at his memorial service,

342
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,830
I cut together four or five little mini
docs about Gary and when I was making

343
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,030
them I thought,
oh yeah,

344
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:03,830
there's a whole movie about Carrie
about what he believed in and,

345
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,530
and that's how it started.
Well, it's incredible.

346
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:10,500
And it just came out on Blu ray people
out there and still have the blue ray

347
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,440
players. You know, I still have
a, I have a DVD VCR player,

348
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,100
but my TV's too advanced and I
can't hook it up to that self.

349
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,570
Anybody knows that there's some sort of
adapter or some darn thing I can do to

350
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,370
try and make that work.
I would appreciate it.

351
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:27,990
But it's a lot of shit cause you know,
I, I, you know, finally became a parent.

352
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:31,440
So I had to get my affairs in
order. You know, it's a guy,

353
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:33,660
you got to make sure everybody's
going to be okay. You got the will,

354
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,100
got to the point like I gave,

355
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,970
I hooked my wife up so much like she
has motive. Like if I die suddenly,

356
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,570
um, I've had the conversation with
my wife and the insurance agent.

357
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,040
Have you done this conversation yet?

358
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,590
Will you sit with an insurance
agent about life insurance? Well,

359
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,140
Judd lives to this age. You get
this. If he, if he lives at this age,

360
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,990
you get that and it's gambling.
You're gambling on me.

361
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,550
Die In paying against yourself. Like, ah,

362
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,190
died before you thought I was going to.

363
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:04,370
Now you've got to give them all
this money. But my wife wouldn't

364
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,810
by the extra insurance. Cause
she said, I feel really weird,

365
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,460
uh, you know, having any, you
know, handicapping your death.

366
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,230
And she was deeply upset
at the conversation.

367
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,070
That was like six or seven years ago
and just the other day she's like,

368
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,480
maybe we should get that insurance.
Yeah, that's what happened.

369
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,580
That's after a while you and I want you
to have kids and stuff. But like I, uh,

370
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,430
you know,
I went with the cremation thing.

371
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:36,070
I think it's so stupid to stick yourself
in the box and then there's like,

372
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,690
you're that important that there's got
to be like a headset I guess is for the

373
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:40,520
living people have someplace to go.

374
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,640
But I think now just with
the world population,

375
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:45,420
I mean the graveyards at some point,
I mean they,

376
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,470
I don't know if they're going to dig
deeper if you're going to be underneath

377
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,630
somebody else, but uh, I've
had a lot of people go,

378
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:53,780
well what did you still feel stuff?
And it's just like,

379
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,160
well then let's get it over with.

380
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,170
Which friend of yours thinks
she's still feel stuff.

381
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,800
A lot of people are afraid of death.
It's just the stuff that, you know,

382
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:03,770
something I don't even know. Cause
I, I, my short term memory is bad,

383
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:07,190
but a lot of people say that about the,
about like, you know, if you get cremated,

384
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:08,780
what if you still feel
stuff? It's like, well,

385
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:11,330
I'd rather just get it
over with in a minute.

386
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,300
I guess I die again somehow
in that minute. But, uh,

387
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,410
rather than laying there waiting for the
worms to slowly work their fucking way

388
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:23,210
in, burn it and toss it out
of an airplane, I want to go,

389
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:27,050
I want to, I wish I don't just
probably isn't legal in this country,

390
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:30,890
but I want to do it like the Viking
way. Like, make a little ship. Sure.

391
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,690
Send me out there. It gives people shoot
some flaming arrows, you know, giving him,

392
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:38,030
make it a little contest. It's
like a burn it on the Ganges. Yeah,

393
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:42,920
it's like a clay pigeon type
of thing. But, um, anyways,

394
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,750
uh, what else we got? We got a benefit
coming up too that you're doing a,

395
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:52,160
at the Grammercy for the Ronald McDonald
House is one of the great charities out.

396
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:56,470
They can go to Judd apatow.com/tour.
That's January 15th. Uh,

397
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
Graham is a Gramercy theater.

398
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,840
Yeah. In the, in New York and it's a
Pete and John Malaney, Pete Holmes,

399
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,370
Regina Spektor and some cast members from,
uh,

400
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,990
from crashing like Buki and
Jamie Lee and me. And uh,

401
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,280
yeah, it's where the Ronald Mcdonald's
house, which is an monster lineup. John.

402
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:14,400
Yeah.
I'm

403
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,180
Laney, man. That guy's just, he's just
a in New York, England, genius guy.

404
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,550
Um, so, uh, all right. What
else? What else do we, can we,
uh, can we discuss it? We've,

405
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:29,140
we've, we promoted, we've
promoted your masterclass.

406
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,410
I have a master and the presence of
them. How do you get, I do like get the,

407
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:38,710
somebody approached you with like,
uh, with something like that.

408
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:39,640
Like you want to just like,

409
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,240
I could teach a master class
on how not to read out loud,

410
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,990
how to fuck things up, uh, how

411
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,770
to make your wife mad at you for three
days in a row. Sure. I have that mastered.

412
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,620
What was your, what was
your masterclass? Well, I,

413
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,800
I did it because my friend Jay
Roach who directed Austin Powers,

414
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,330
he directed my masterclass.

415
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,350
So it's basically several days of talking
to Jay Roach who's asking me questions.

416
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:03,900
There's no crowd or anything like that.
And not like a Ted talk or anything. No,

417
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:07,080
it's just an, they just
edit it, edit it up. And uh,

418
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,210
and I think it came out really well.
You know,

419
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,540
the thing you probably know because you've
worked with a lot of people and staff

420
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,220
is so much of it is just inspiring people
to work hard. People are so damn lazy,

421
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,100
like people just don't
put in the effort at all.

422
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,480
I told him, I told someone that
the other day, I was like, look,

423
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,920
you got to have a certain level of talent.

424
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,500
But what separates people is just like,

425
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,520
I mean the people who have like that work
ethic and it's almost got to be like,

426
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:34,700
and people in this business,
I kind of workaholics, um,

427
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,830
and like I've learned
that with F is for family.

428
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:39,450
So many people ain't want to go through
it again. I was like, Oh yeah, yeah.

429
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:43,040
I'm like, these people are fucking insane.
Like they don't want to go home. Um,

430
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,270
but the people that I saw like
just really, really, really work.

431
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,550
I don't want to name any names
because then if I don't name names,

432
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,380
people saying what he's saying,
I'm fucking lazy. But I just,

433
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:55,020
I saw a lot of people that
weren't the guy. Yeah.

434
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,960
But work their way, like into
being the guy. But like, you know,

435
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:00,291
with you,

436
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,630
it's got to feel good when somebody
comes to you and asked you to teach your

437
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,560
master class.
I mean,

438
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,670
you certainly have the body of work
and all this stuff that you've done it

439
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:10,610
because I, that's I think the last
three times I've, I've talked to you,

440
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,810
that is what I've asked you.

441
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,070
How do you and my delegation of that Shit,

442
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,890
because I still want to be a
comedian and still, you know,

443
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:22,340
and the only way to go still being good
is you have to be out there doing it.

444
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:24,770
But if, if, how do I, you know,

445
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:28,100
but I also love doing the show and then
also got to be a dad. Like how do, how,

446
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,540
how the fuck do you balance all of it?
So it's some of that in, in there, right?

447
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,510
Yeah, absolutely. And I think
that like a lot of it is uh,

448
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,070
that you're just pushing,
pushing balls forward.

449
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,610
So you may be on the road doing standup
and you have a great idea for a movie

450
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:47,110
and it's just making sure in
some consistent way you're
pushing it forward and

451
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,270
making progress.
Now you might finish it in three months,

452
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:50,620
you might finish it in three years,

453
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,650
but if you have four or five
things going at the same time,

454
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:55,930
that's really what it is, is, you know,

455
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:59,890
I might get up in the morning and go
from the moment I get up to lunch,

456
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,530
I'm going to work with Pete and in
the afternoon and I'm doing a movie p

457
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,790
Davidson, I'm an old, I'm
going to rewrite p Davidson.

458
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:09,580
And then did you get to get burned out?
Do you get frustrated?

459
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:13,640
The Illusia Temby seem like a chill guy.
It's just like a, is this how you are?

460
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:14,950
Or like you behind the scenes,

461
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:18,340
you one of those guys throwing
laptops like it doesn't work.

462
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,110
We're going to stay here all night where
I only get crazy on two issues. What,

463
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,230
like two or three issues. One is
if the food order is wrong, I just,

464
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:32,950
I, I can't handle it. Like if they
don't bring the salsa with the Burrito,

465
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,720
like I so reward myself with the food
that could go viral, that could go bad.

466
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,170
You're, you're, uh, you're,
you're flipping out and
that's okay. That's, that's,

467
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,230
that's understandable.
My biggest of shame where I go,

468
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:46,480
you really lost it are mainly around food.

469
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,260
But the areas where I get
crazy one is I used to,

470
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,400
people would tell me I couldn't have my
casting and that would always drive me

471
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:56,830
crazy if I said,
you know who the star of the show you be?

472
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,390
It should be Jason Segel.
And then Fox would go, no,

473
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,720
that's where my head would explode.

474
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,150
And where would you explode on the phone
to them? In your car to your windshield?

475
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,020
Every, every scenario. I mean, I, I'd
be, I'd be screaming, I'd be in tears.

476
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,210
I would be threatening. I'd have agents
calling and I never won. As a result,

477
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:20,680
it took me years to realize,
oh,

478
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,250
all my emotional reactions
have never won me the fight.

479
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,680
And then when I stopped behaving that way,

480
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,590
I started winning more of those debates.

481
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:34,591
But I would get so upset because to me
the worst thing in the world is if you

482
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,430
have an edit of a movie and someone
forces you to change it and you've ruined

483
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:43,960
your own movie due to someone.
Is that happened? Well I,

484
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,650
that's the one here.
I just can't allow to happen now.

485
00:27:47,651 --> 00:27:52,210
I have had things change in the past
that I look back at more. So, you know,

486
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,860
a couple of decades ago where I
did give in and now even right now,

487
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:59,650
if I thought about that movie, I'd be
like, Oh why did we cut that scene?

488
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,800
They told us to cut that
scene and there was a scene in

489
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,580
you failed three cause you were young and
it just trying to get your foot in the

490
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:10,640
door. Everybody always says that thing,
you know, you just gotta let him get him,

491
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:11,900
get you the first time,

492
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,450
and then the next time you'll be
able to write your own ticket.

493
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:16,490
Now do you subscribe to that?

494
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,770
Well, I think it's true. Only
in the sense that you can't win.

495
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,410
You just don't have the power.
Right.

496
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,740
So we made this movie heavyweights and
Paul Feig was in it and still are played

497
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:29,210
the bad guy who was a summer
camp for fat kids and it was,

498
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,840
it was a Disney movie.

499
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,840
And then when we finished it and see real
directed it and wrote it with me, uh,

500
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,280
it was just a little darker than
any Disney movie you've ever seen.

501
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,810
And it ended with was that was funny.
It was funny.

502
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,600
And not in the way that a lot
of those movies are. Yeah.

503
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,340
I'd still here at the end of the movie,
he's lost his mind.

504
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:50,400
He's the owner of this fat camp and he's
like this like demented Tony Robbins

505
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:54,300
guy and he's got a bow and Arrow and
he's like threatening to kill all the

506
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,640
children. Right. And
Disney said, you know,

507
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:58,470
you really can't have
him like point pointing,

508
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:02,580
bow and arrows from Chile and children
were like three feet away. Right.

509
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,240
And so we had to Riyadh at the sequence.
That's the kind of stuff,

510
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,600
I'll wake up at two in the morning and go,

511
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,250
why did we cut out the god damn bow and
Arrow sequence still eats at you it.

512
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,140
Oh yeah. And I might have five of
those. And so that's where I can

513
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,600
what point in your career where you're
like, all right, all right Chad.

514
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,960
Screaming at people flipping out during
these moments isn't working. Yeah.

515
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,560
Like how did you, cause I am
like, my big Achilles' heel is,

516
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,120
is uh, it's not, but it's funny. It's
not at work. I don't flip out. Yeah.

517
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,710
In comedy clubs, I don't,
I've never flipped out at, uh,
F as a family. I've raised,

518
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:40,770
my voice of [inaudible] is crying.
Wait, how do we fuck about,

519
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,460
but I never like got to the
point of light, you know,
never had a big, you know,

520
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,010
storm out fucking throwing shit.
Never had one of those.

521
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,260
But like it's more like at, at, at
home. Yeah. I, I, uh, I, you know,

522
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,390
I just,
I flip out about just stupid shit.

523
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,420
Like I fucking suck at these iPhones
and laptops I get so I'm so frustrated

524
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:05,930
because I don't like them.
Technology doesn't fascinate me.

525
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:09,110
It's not something I'm interested in.
It's really, it's ruined the world. So,

526
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,330
you know, anyways, it has it now.

527
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:14,180
The other ways it hasn't met
with medic medically is it's nice

528
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,550
when your kids are older and they
don't look up at you for hours. You'll,

529
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,470
you'll go,
they ruin the world.

530
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,440
Yes. I, yeah, that aspect of
it. But I definitely like, uh,

531
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,210
I just don't like how yesterday I knew
how to use this device and then now I

532
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:32,840
don't, now I have to go through this
fucking bullshit. It's just every time,

533
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:34,520
you know,
you move three feet ahead,

534
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,210
they knock you back with the new
updated system and then you can't,

535
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,980
you can't opt out of not updating.

536
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:42,380
It cause you to be able to keep your
phone for years and there's just like, no,

537
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:45,770
we're going to fill up this fucking phone
until you have to bring it in and then

538
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:48,680
we're going to take everything off it and
sell it to some kid in the Philippines

539
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,540
and you just feel like you're
just part of this thing.

540
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:55,250
And like that's the type of shit,
like I'm trying to, uh, you know,

541
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,850
and I'm failing miserably at it.

542
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,950
But explaining the flip out, is it a
loans, the throwing it against the wall.

543
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,490
Are you yelling at another person?
Like what does it turn into?

544
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,300
I just literally like,
my wife will be just totally chilling,

545
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:10,310
watching TV and then I of
where I'll just be like,

546
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:12,920
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
You fucking piece of shit.

547
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:16,010
I flip out like that and like what? I
don't know, cause I grew up with that.

548
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:19,640
I didn't understand what it was doing
to her as far as just really just having

549
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:23,870
her be on edge. And uh, yeah. So I mean,

550
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,440
how does she tell you not to do it?

551
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:28,290
What's her approach to
telling you to chill out?

552
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,140
Oh man, she's just straightforward.
She's straightforward. She said,

553
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,930
she said some shit, I'm not going to,
you know, this is too intimate detail,

554
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,110
but she said some shit to me like two
days ago that I will never forget.

555
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,760
And I was like,
wow,

556
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,601
well good.

557
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:46,650
When you have a kid it changes everything
because she knows you're about to do

558
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:49,680
it in front of a child that
understands it. So when they're little,

559
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,630
they're babies and you
can go in the other room,

560
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,140
but at some point you just spend so
much time with your kid that they will

561
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:57,450
absorb it and then you go to,

562
00:31:57,451 --> 00:32:00,990
I like the way I move in the world
cause I think my kid's going to copy it.

563
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:01,901
Yeah.

564
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:06,901
So fortunately I am really on my best
behavior for the most part around my kid.

565
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:09,460
She's seen me flip out a few times,

566
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:14,200
but I quickly tried to turn it in and do
a joke. But, uh, it's something, yeah,

567
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:16,850
I got to go to therapy dude. Cause I, I,

568
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,720
I don't wanna cause she's getting to the
point now where she's repeating stuff

569
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:23,770
and I just don't, I don't want to, this is
the deal. She's not going to be like me.

570
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,030
I already know she's not going to be
like me, uh, as far in a, in a good way.

571
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,940
So I mean that's, that's kind of
what, what does that say about me?

572
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:34,390
Like my job as a dad is to
make my kid not like me. Well,

573
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:37,240
the one thing I think your half of me,
but I don't want you to be me at all.

574
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:39,980
I want you to be like your mom.
Well they don't really have the damage of

575
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,940
us, you know. So that's
something I've noticed is, you
know, my kids are hilarious,

576
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,500
but they're neurotic kids too,

577
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,420
but they didn't go through some of the
intense things and I went through that

578
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:55,250
really builds how my mind works.
But I'm sure they have their own,

579
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,980
their own menu.
No,

580
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,430
I bet there's a whole new level of
shit with just like social media didn't

581
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:06,200
exist. So like what I liked about my
childhood was one school was over,

582
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:11,150
the ass kicking was over, whatever thing,
humiliation. I could go home. It was fine.

583
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,040
It didn't continue. The Mike Douglas
show was on, you'd watch it, you'd heal.

584
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,520
Yes. Yes. There wasn't this think
tank of kids trying to, you know,

585
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:23,090
getting all online and pile on you
and the shit that they deal with. So,

586
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,990
and they know when they're being excluded.

587
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,410
So the biggest issue is
because of Instagram,

588
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,910
you're aware of what you've been invited
to. So when people are hanging out,

589
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,650
you're like, oh, they didn't want
me at this thing when I was a kid,

590
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,130
I was excluded by everybody.
I had one or two really good friends.

591
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:46,310
But basically if I thought about it,
if I think about it now,

592
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,190
I was excluded from every possible
social thing that was happening when it

593
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,090
passed at the club. But I, but
I didn't know it, you know,

594
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:56,750
I just would go home every day and just
watching the Dinah shore show and be

595
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:59,000
fine and wait for my friends
to get back from football.

596
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,900
But now the kids know like, oh, those
three girls went to the mall. Oh,

597
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:06,760
those two are hanging out at this
concert. And they feel bad. No.

598
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,910
And then they take a picture,

599
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:10,460
which is not an accurate depiction
of what it's like. It's like,

600
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:15,020
it's like this selling the movie of
their life or anything. So that's the,

601
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:20,030
uh, that's the thing I get nervous
with and that's been a source of, uh,

602
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,520
you know, back and forth.
Me and my wife is like,

603
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:25,570
I don't like her watching TV and all of
this shit and I don't like her eating

604
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,520
junk food. And uh, you know,
and she has more of like,

605
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:31,090
like she wants a little bit of TV.
She occasionally has Mcdonald's and six,

606
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,600
like say I ain't, but you know, I mean,
this is the fights you have because yeah,

607
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,320
you,

608
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,320
when you're married you're instantly
deciding how much do I care about each

609
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:45,470
thing and what,
how far do I want to push my wife?

610
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:48,060
Like in knocked up one of the
scenes that I like, but it's a,

611
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:53,090
it's an intense scene is Leslie sitting
there and she's looking at a website

612
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:58,901
that tells her where sexual predators
live in the neighborhood and Paul comes in

613
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,980
and he just keeps making jokes about
it and she's really freaked out. Like,

614
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:05,450
do you know there's a guy like three,

615
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,720
three streets over and
Paul keeps making jokes.

616
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,500
Well let's not go to his house on
Halloween. And then finally she's like,

617
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,290
that's what I would though I,
then she finally says like,

618
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,190
sometimes I just want to rip your fucking
head off because you're so fucking

619
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:22,910
stupid. And that really is what
marriage is about. Is there,

620
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,400
there are issues that you care about.

621
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,170
Like how much McDonald's should the kitty.
Now, when I was a kid, I swear to God,

622
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:34,160
I hadn't Mcdonald's, I'm not kidding
you six times a week. And I loved it.

623
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,070
I ate it. My mom had no issue
taking me there every single

624
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,640
time. We used to go out as a
family, like it was fine dining.

625
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,850
He got there, we had a big family, so it
was five cheeseburgers, five small fries,

626
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:51,060
five chocolate shakes, two big
MACs, two large fries to coax.

627
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:56,040
That was the order for years. And it was
awesome every time. Yeah. Yeah. It was,

628
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,020
it was an ISP and jealous.
And when I got older,

629
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:00,690
because I kept getting a cheeseburger
and I was big enough to get a quarter

630
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,860
pounder with cheese, but I was afraid
to ask as you get shit. And I just,

631
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,810
we looking at theirs and they would
only like halfway through it with that

632
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:10,800
little mouse trying to eat it. And I
said, wolf mind down. But uh, yeah,

633
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,910
I remember when I used to,

634
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,580
when I was really young and I
lived in the north shore of Boston,

635
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:17,190
I remember there was a Mcdonald's and
there was this train track that was right

636
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:17,401
by,

637
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:22,350
and you would throw some of your French
fries to the seagulls and you get to see

638
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:24,540
a train go by and he'd be sitting outside.

639
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,190
And it was like some of my fondest
memories as a kid and um, you know,

640
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,730
yeah, there was no, yeah. You know
that they will roughly the same age.

641
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:37,350
So it was just all a, you
know, peanut butter and fluff
and all these, these, these,

642
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:40,120
these, and um, and there's
some of this out about it.

643
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,350
When did you even realize what
Mcdonald's was bad and what,

644
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:46,980
like how old were you when you were
like, I guess I shouldn't eat that? Well,

645
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:48,900
you knew fast food was bad,

646
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,420
but he didn't know to the
point like I make Mcdonald's,

647
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:53,640
remember a few years ago they had a bolt,
a bulletin board,

648
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,050
a billboard just came out and
it's like now with a 100% beef,

649
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,980
which is obviously, well, what
the fuck was it before the page?

650
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:06,450
Did you watch that movie founder with
Michael Keaton? Oh, you got to watch that.

651
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,940
Michael Keaton's amazing in that movie.
And it's such a,

652
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:13,260
it's such a well done movie about
like all of that type of stuff. So,

653
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,540
um, but then, you know, your wife says,

654
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,880
I want to give her the good and
some Mcdonald's and you're like,

655
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,260
and they get lengthy.
Awful.

656
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,360
Now I have the police and I have the
reverse with my wife. Used to be poison.

657
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,950
I think now it's more like,
it's a little more healthy right now.

658
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:29,810
It might be just nothing blank,

659
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,580
no positive anything.
But my,

660
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:37,590
my wife early in our relationship when
I would get Mcdonald's would look at me

661
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:41,040
like, what is wrong with you? Are
you an adult? Like you eat this food?

662
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,510
She was so disgusted.

663
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:47,810
She shamed me to such an extent that
I don't even sneak out and get it.

664
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:52,950
Like she, she programmed
me to be disgusted by the
thing that made me so happy.

665
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,780
Yeah. My thing was when I
was going to be healthy,

666
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:59,670
I went to Wendy's cause Wendy's seemed
like it was actually burger meat. Yeah.

667
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,750
Probably wasn't either. No, it probably
wasn't. Well, dude, I gotta tell you, man,

668
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,470
it was, it's such a thrill to have, uh,

669
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,920
someone like you come
on on the show in like,

670
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:12,480
and I really appreciate the advice both
on this and an off that you've given me

671
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:16,770
as far as like, how do you know, you
know, keep it all kind of going without,

672
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,880
without screwing it up.

673
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:20,040
