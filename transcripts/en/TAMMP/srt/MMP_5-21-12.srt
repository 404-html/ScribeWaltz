1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,270
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts for Monday.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,850
Uh,
the hell month is it?

3
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:13,500
May 21st, 2012. What's
going on? How are you?

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,180
Did you have a nice weekend?
Are you looking for,

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,920
it's a memorial day.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,880
Do my buddy's got a fucking boat kid?

7
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:29,800
We're going to get out there with
some fucking boy. Wise's dude,

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,610
guys weekend. Fuck the ladies. Um,

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,170
yeah, that's coming up
right? I had no idea.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,150
I had no idea that next week was
a three day weekend. You know,

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,870
because I'm a comedian. Every week's
a three day weekend, you know,

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,940
I don't have shit to do. I
just sit around now. Actually,

13
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,970
I've been working my ass off.
I just did. You know, I didn't,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,380
but I've got offered to
do another episode of a,

15
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:03,330
of Glee. They liked what I did so
much last season. It's a possibility.

16
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,760
It's not a definite,
all right,

17
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,110
so I'm already a going to my vocal coach,
you know,

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,660
just working out some songs,
you know,

19
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm a dreamer or does it go,

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,430
you know, they probably turn
that into like a melody, right?

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,560
They'd start singing that and then
they'd go into another one. Right?

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,630
I had to run away.
Hi Mca.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,330
Why do they always do that? And then
the crowd always goes, oh my God,

24
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,550
it's a different, I didn't
see that. They, Dave,

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,810
they connect all those Sears.

26
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,580
I have both those songs on my iPod and
I just never saw how they connected.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,260
It took a bunch of twinkle toes
and a cafeteria to show them.

28
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:52,170
They're always singing in a cafeteria.
What is the deal with that?

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,400
What's the deal with gay
people? Sooner? Goober. Dude.

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,820
Is there something for my, yeah, my
gay listeners out there. Do you guys,

31
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:04,230
do you guys feel the need to sing
whenever you're in a cafeteria?

32
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,270
Is that what it is? You know,
come up to the football players.

33
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,400
Semi bent at the waist. Snapping your
fingers, moving your arms vertically,

34
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,070
don't you? Of course you don't, right?
Isn't that TV's version of what you do?

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,180
You just like us. You're looking
for a closet to rub one out. Okay.

36
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,910
Except you thinking different shit.
See that?

37
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:32,520
Bringing people together on the podcast.

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,840
Speaking of a singing,
I'm going to order this thing.

39
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:41,070
You guys know that I hate
country music. You know, I,

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,300
I liked the oldest shit.

41
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:45,960
I don't like the new stuff where
they just pander to their audience.

42
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,630
You know what I mean? I lock
America puppies, you know, lock it.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,280
We're going to put a boot in your ass or
whatever that fucking jerk off is with

44
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:00,790
the hat pulled down over his face. Almost
like he's ashamed of what he's singing.

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,080
Okay.

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,000
Ah, what the fuck is, wow. What
the hell is his name is? Oh,

47
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:14,290
Toby, Keith, Toby, Keith,
that guy. All right.

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,790
He always has that hat pulled down low.
You know,

49
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,960
he's a man yet he's wearing chaps. I
like that guy, that guy. And he's got,

50
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:24,650
he's a Lotta Lotta Lotta
like contradictions, you
know what I mean? He's like,

51
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:28,220
you know, rough and tumble
guy, yet he's wearing chaps,

52
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,480
like the guy in the village people and uh,

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,740
he looked like a racist yet. His
first name is Toby, you know,

54
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,790
which I think is a shout out to roots.
So you know, I can't figure that guy out.

55
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,640
Um, anyways, so I was watching
this a risk commercial.

56
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:51,641
They had like 150 of of a
country music's greatest duets,

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,430
you know, a lamb, Dell
apartment, Conrad Twitty.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,590
That was the only guy I found creepy.

59
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,930
I don't know if he was
nervous that he was on TV,

60
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,960
but he would not move a
fucking muscle on his face.

61
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,730
And he had this just as big fucking,

62
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,520
I don't know, pork shoulder
fucking head, you know what I mean?

63
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,950
Like if he had shoulder of Bison,
like the size that he had a big fucking,

64
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,343
you know,

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,580
just 40 years before P90x no
guy was doing cardio. Right.

66
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,290
All you doing is yanking your fucking
pants up or pushing them down and he's

67
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,940
singing some fucking song

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,410
about some girlies with, I can't, I can't
remember how the whole metal he went.

69
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,420
But it was something to the effect of
being a locking tail when I hold you let,

70
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:52,010
you'd never been this far before,
something like that. It was,

71
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:56,810
she had something to do with him holding
this trembling virgin in his arms as he

72
00:04:56,811 --> 00:05:01,310
sat there with this
fucking 600 yard stare,

73
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,380
like he's waiting for Charlie to come
over the fucking wire, you know? Um,

74
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,850
or let,
like maybe he was like confessing

75
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,480
to being a sexual Predator and like,

76
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,320
he was just waiting for the FBI to come
out and just arrest him in the middle of

77
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:21,380
singing that song. You know, like after
a while you just want to get caught.

78
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,060
Isn't that something that they do?
I'm not saying that he's a sex offender.

79
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,260
I wouldn't say that. All I
can say is before he got his
perm, he looked like one,

80
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,820
you know, he had that Elvis
just going straight back,

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,140
but just a giant fucking head.
Just a huge head.

82
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,950
Um,
you know,

83
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,150
he looked like he looked like he was
already murdered and was fished out of a

84
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:44,984
lake.

85
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,003
Okay.

86
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,350
Just a fucking bloated,

87
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,440
gigantic head and he wasn't moving.

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,010
He looked like dead dead fucking thing on
the other first men in black. Oh, right,

89
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,420
Bill. We got it. He's got an
awful head. Well, fuck you.

90
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:06,260
I got a whole hour to fill here. I'm
only six minutes in, so you do it, Huh?

91
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,010
And your cubicle. Somebody sent
me the creepiest, creepiest,
yeah. Email last week.

92
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,770
They said, hey, you know,

93
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,540
did you ever know anybody who jerked
off in a cubicle.dot. Dot. Well,

94
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,820
now you do.
You know,

95
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,840
and it's not that he
jerked off in a cubicle.

96
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,090
It's the fact that he emailed me his
name, his email, all of that shit.

97
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,760
It's just like, I mean, uh,
you're playing a dangerous game.

98
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,500
Maybe you want to get caught,
sir. Is that what it is?

99
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,750
Do you habitually jerk off
and you're fucking cubicle?

100
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:41,860
What if that went to the wrong person?
What if you sent that to your boss?

101
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,500
And he just got done
yelling at you saying,

102
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,910
you need to need to show some initiative
in 20 minutes later, you know,

103
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,540
he gets an email from you. And
he's like, all right, maybe, uh,

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,940
maybe it finally stuck and I
don't have to fire this guy.

105
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,860
And he opens it up and he says,
hey,

106
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,210
did you ever know anybody jerked off in
a cubicle.dot. Dot. Well, now you do.

107
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,303
Okay.

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,120
Maybe meant to send it to his boss. I
mean, that was his way of going out,

109
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,443
you know,

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,630
just fucking impregnated
his laptop and walked out.

111
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,590
Nah, there's no way he did that.
How could you ever get another job?

112
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,550
There's no way around that. Um, anyways,

113
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:25,090
it's Monday morning and I'm doing
the podcast and for new listeners,

114
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,170
I know what you're thinking.
Well,

115
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:29,710
I live in fucking a Scandinavia and
it's not Monday morning over here,

116
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:32,020
but listen, I don't care.
I don't give a fuck.

117
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,750
The only Monday morning I
care about is in my time zone.

118
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,360
It's nine 17 in the morning.
All right.

119
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:41,890
Those douchebags on those morning
shows are still on being Sassy,

120
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,330
showing spunk. You know,
those are all morning words,

121
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,360
you know what I mean? Nobody has get up
and go at 6:00 PM. Right. That's all.

122
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,370
That's all 6:00 AM shit. Uh, she,
she's just a firecracker, right?

123
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,910
Nobody says that if 5:00 PM
Ron quit and tech, you know,

124
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,780
we got just, well, why do I these,

125
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,750
you know what this podcast is just
to be me stating the fucking obvious.

126
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,183
Um,

127
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,050
how much for a drive
yesterday and my Prius,

128
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,760
um, somebody, actually,
some are redneck guy,

129
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:23,140
was talking to me about my Prius go
and you know them things ain't, oh no,

130
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:26,860
they don't do anything for the
environment. You realize that don't you?

131
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:31,360
I mean them batteries and batteries,
they putting them cars, you know,

132
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:35,570
long it takes for them to break down.
Ooh, let me tell you they're doing that.

133
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,423
They're actually,

134
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,000
they're actually doing more damage
there and then I can have a regular gas

135
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:43,230
combustion, Corey, you know, telling
me all that shit. You know what I mean?

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,800
Half of it's true. The other half, he's
like making up as he's going along,

137
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,270
you know, almost like he's talking about
the big game. Then he never played in,

138
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,710
in high school, but there's no one
around that he went to school with.

139
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:56,990
So now he's quarterback.
Right. And a, I know it,

140
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,330
a lot of people listening right now
gone. That's actually true. All right.

141
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
I don't give a fuck. Okay. I never
said I was saving the planet.

142
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,500
Did I? I don't think I did. I
probably did. I'm hypocritical. Um,

143
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,210
okay.

144
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,400
I see it. There's nothing you could,
everybody should be, you know,

145
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,340
if there was the right amount
of human beings on this planet,

146
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,790
we could all drive tanks and it would
have no effect on the ozone layer.

147
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,770
Alright? That's my new philosophy.
Stop trying to make cars,

148
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,180
have better gas mileage.

149
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,170
Tried to have less people driving them.

150
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,680
Okay?

151
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,540
Oh Jesus.
Is this my final solution?

152
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,240
So many fucking people. People.
That's what the problem is. All right.

153
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,110
It ain't the cars. Cars don't
kill the ozone layer of people do.

154
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,700
Um, anyways, I get them into the biggest,

155
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,230
dumbest fucking fight last
night with my girl. Right?

156
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,340
We had this great day. You know, it
was on the road again. I could do,

157
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,990
do, do, do up above.
Oh, hear that. Hear that

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,720
you that bump up bub bub bub.
That's what I have to have it on.

159
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,780
If for some reason that that noise that
alert on my phone doesn't freak out my

160
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:18,661
dog,

161
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:23,661
but every other sound on it freaks out
my dog and it starts fucking shaking like

162
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:27,140
a goddamn junkie.
And a,

163
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,540
that is an embarrassing tone to have
when you're walking around with your

164
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,280
friends,
you know,

165
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,850
and it always comes on when you're in
the middle of some story that you're

166
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,940
exaggerating what you really did. So I
walk up to the guy and I'm like, no buddy.

167
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,030
Fuck you.
You want to take a fucking swing here?

168
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,790
I'll give you the first punch
right here. Body pump, pump
pump, pump, pump. Yeah, no,

169
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,010
fuck it. Then it goes down
the Goddamn damn toilet. Um,

170
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,270
so anyways,
the hell did we do yesterday?

171
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,110
Okay.

172
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,250
Oh, we went out to Brunch, right?
I had already eaten breakfast,

173
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,600
so she got a brunch and
I got up here and uh,

174
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,270
some guy next to me
with the big red beard.

175
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:10,300
He'd been growing it for like nine years.
It was like Zz top level,

176
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:13,780
I think a little bit longer. It was
like reverse crystal Gayle, you know,

177
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,150
like don't like the guy version
of it up as a redhead and uh,

178
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,080
so whatever. And then I'm like, Hey, you
know, let's go for a drive. She's like,

179
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:27,370
I want to go to some shops. Let's just
walk down the street, you know that,

180
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:30,430
and they grab your arm and you're
just sitting there, you know,

181
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,930
walking down the street,

182
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,910
just thinking what have I just elbowed
him in the ribs and ran across the street,

183
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,930
you know, right there, that fucking
bar now was actually a good time.

184
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,510
And then after that it was like,
you know,

185
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:48,511
I will always fly out lax and I always
see the beach and up in Malibu and Santa

186
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,670
Barbara and all that type of shit.
And I'm like, you know, it's,

187
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,110
I sh we should fucking shut
that part of the city out.

188
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
So we drive over there and the Prius,
that's not saving the environment,

189
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:00,070
but getting great gas mileage,
great gas mileage. Um,

190
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,450
and we fucking get up there and what a
bunch of Douche bags up there. All right.

191
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:09,020
I got to shut my phone off.
What the fuck? Bump. Bump.

192
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,090
What the hell is it? You know what, that's
just going to go off in the background.

193
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,040
Yeah,

194
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,540
we put it on mute here. Don't you wish
there was a mute button for people?

195
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,000
What's the deal? Um, yes, we go
up there. What a bunch of cons.

196
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,070
What a bunch of cons
live in fucking Malibu.

197
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,890
I want to go up there and I was
trying to find like their town center,

198
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:32,050
I don't even know if they
have one or what, but every,

199
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,880
it's all gated communities to
keep out the riff raff. Like me,

200
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,110
I can't even drive by and just look at
their houses, you know? So what happened?

201
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,980
Whenever we're having a good
time, we drive back, we're
going through the canyons.

202
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,110
I pull over on the side of the road,

203
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,090
we buy strawberries off some guy who
claims to be an organic farmer, right?

204
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,330
Privately stolen from a trader
Joe's who gives a shit, right?

205
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,820
Everything's going great. So I stay in,
take a night off from comedy and I say,

206
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:06,230
Hey, why don't we watch, why don't we
watch your movie? You know what I mean?

207
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,520
Cap Off this wonderful fucking
day. Everything's going
great. What could go wrong?

208
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
This is like the beginning of a horror
movie where they just show like the

209
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:17,300
perfect family and everything's great
and people are wearing like white linen,

210
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,860
you know?

211
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,130
And then all of a sudden they just start
showing the camera and the bushes like

212
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:26,750
a POV of like Mike Myers. This
is basically what happens.
So 60 minutes comes on,

213
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,290
right? Who doesn't want to watch that
show and pretend they're smart? You know,

214
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,480
I like it some more Morley
safer comes on and you know,

215
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,570
we smells like an old person. Some old
people don't smell like old people,

216
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:41,240
but he looks like he smells
like an old person, you know,

217
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,300
smells of cigars, ash trays,
you know, couple of wars,

218
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,550
maybe a date rape.
Um,

219
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,280
so he's interviewing Meryl Streep.
All right.

220
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,660
The Great Meryl Streep when they're going
through all our own oral frigging life

221
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:04,500
and all the movies and all the different
characters that she's played. Oh,

222
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:05,580
first of all,
they start,

223
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:10,470
they start the report off with
Morley safer just sitting there.

224
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:13,290
Right. Smelling a fucking
Ben Gay in Whiskey, right?

225
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,130
And he says, how, you
know, wow, over in England,

226
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,140
you know, they, you know, I dunno,
they make their, their actors,

227
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,320
they, they award them by calling
them lords and they night them.

228
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,210
But over here in America,

229
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:32,470
all we do is just give him the
shiny statue and it's just like,

230
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,170
starts off right off the bat for
some reason just shitting on America.

231
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,660
I don't know why like an
Oscar is somehow beneath,

232
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,150
okay

233
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,350
sir. Uh, Anthony Michael
Hall. I mean, or, or Lord,

234
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:50,850
what it Lord of what,
what are what

235
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,450
lease. You can fucking hold our
statue, your lord of what kingdom,

236
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,580
that phony horse shit that you have
with Prince Charles and the popper or

237
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,460
whatever the fuck is going on over there.
You know,

238
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,920
look up the Rothschilds night you over
there, then that fucking means something.

239
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,810
Then you can come become
part of their yacht.

240
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,380
Convoy is they go around the world
figuring out how to take over another

241
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,940
currency, right? Then you're in with them,
okay. But if you're, if you're fucking,

242
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:24,890
you know, Lord of this and your, your
wing man is the Duke of Elton John.

243
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,920
I mean that's the whole thing is fucking
stupid, right? So right off the bat,

244
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:31,440
it's already bugging me. But I know Nia
hates when I talk to the TV, right? So,

245
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,473
you know,

246
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,360
I keep my big fucking Yap shut and they
start talking about Meryl Streep up a

247
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,690
Papaya,
gone through the whole thing.

248
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,010
And then I'm the old guy
there smelling of a, you know,

249
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,630
prescription meds goes, uh,
you know, whenever they talk
about the roles you play,

250
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,240
they always say, you know, he
play independent minded women,

251
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,960
very strong women and Merrill goals. I
know that's, yeah, that's what they say.

252
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,180
You know, when a guide,
they never say to a guy, oh,

253
00:15:56,181 --> 00:16:00,890
you're playing a strong willed character,
Yadda Yadda Yadda. I let that go.

254
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:04,880
Whatever, no biggie. I'll
take that. It's probably true.

255
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,700
The fuck do I know I'm not a woman.
Right.

256
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,140
But then they show her after
she played Margaret Thatcher,

257
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:16,430
and she's given a speech to a bunch of
women's young girls and she's trying to

258
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:20,320
inspire them and she,
she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher.

259
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,920
It was something along the lines of,

260
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,960
if you want a bunch of
people to talk around,

261
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,860
talk is standing around talking
about doing something, you know,

262
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,490
something a go, yeah,
you got to talk to men,

263
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,780
but if you want it to actually get done,
you got to get a woman.

264
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,020
And then all the chicks go,
whoo, like flipping out. Right?

265
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:42,830
So I laughed and I'm like,
Yay. Reverse sexism. Right.

266
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,870
Just seeing,
you know,

267
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,190
my, my whole fucking theory, how
everybody is just a piece of shit.

268
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,730
You just don't have the power to act
out what the fuck you want to do because

269
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:57,300
that, that right there, if
you flip that around as a guy,

270
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,990
if you're running for president,
it's fucking over. He can't be like,

271
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:02,490
let me tell you.
I'll tell you what,

272
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,080
after I get you jobs and after
I fixed this economy, okay.

273
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,480
And I'm the man to do it
because I'll tell you right now,

274
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,630
if you're looking for someone to stand
around and talk about doing something,

275
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,840
you get a woman. You want to get
it done. You got to get a man,

276
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,390
here are my nuts right here on the podium,
volt from me,

277
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:22,940
November 4th go fuck
yourself. Right? You did that.

278
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:27,260
Your presidential campaigns over.
She does it. It's fucking adorable.

279
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,160
And it's just this fucking ignorant,
you know what I mean?

280
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,360
What a fuck do you get off saying
that we stand around and do nothing.

281
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,410
Meryl Streep. Ah, or quoting Margaret
and youtube. Margaret Thatcher

282
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:47,120
me tastes you bitches something. Alright,
we faked a fucking lunar landing. Okay.

283
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:52,110
You think that's just talking. Anybody
can land on the fucking moon. That's easy.

284
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,970
But to pretend you did it all right and
get everybody to shut the fuck up about

285
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,270
it. That, that, that, that right
there, that takes skill. So whatever.

286
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:04,230
So I make that little comment and um, did
I just go with that? That, that, that,

287
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,660
that, that's the only
fucking porky pig. So,

288
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
so I make that comment and like,
you know,

289
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,390
I've been with Nia long enough that I
can tell by the side of her face when

290
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,920
she's just thinking about like,

291
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,920
what if I just grabbed everything I
really cared about and walked out of this

292
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:21,270
house right now.
She got like that fucking mad at me,

293
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,900
you know?
And I'm like,

294
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,040
she's just like right
after the story was over,

295
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:32,950
she just shut the fucking thing
off. And uh, I don't happen to,

296
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,130
cause now I'm walking to seven 11 to get
some ice cream. I haven't, I've not even,

297
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:41,690
what happened was all going great.
You know,

298
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,420
I might be asshole there.
What am I?

299
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,500
Am I supposed to just fucking sit there
with my mouth hanging open with drill

300
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,230
coming out when I watch TV,
if somebody says something Douchey,

301
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,580
I'm not supposed to say it.

302
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,450
Okay.

303
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,050
Yeah, whatever, whatever.
So I just finally just said,
you know what? Fuck this.

304
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,740
I take the dog out. I go
around the block. What do I do?

305
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,980
I'm calling my guy friends,
right? They're all backing me up.

306
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm not saying who I called,
I don't name names. Right.

307
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,480
And they're all laughing their ass
off and they 100% agree with me,

308
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,100
which is all I'm looking
for at this point.

309
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,670
I just want people to say that I'm right.

310
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,910
I don't want to learn
anything from this experience.

311
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,480
Just tell me I was right so I
can be an ignorant ass again.

312
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,650
I don't know. Why don't you guys weigh
in on that? Am I a Dick for saying that?

313
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:30,090
Should I just let that one go? You
know? Ah You know what she said?

314
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:32,640
That fucking drove me up the
wall. She goes, why are you,

315
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,560
she didn't seem intimidated.
She used one of those words.

316
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,460
Why you threatened by what she said.
It's like I'm not threatened.

317
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,390
I Yeah Jesus Christ.
Then I take the bait,

318
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,260
you know it just sends me right over day
like threatened about what? Oh my God,

319
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:58,400
this person that I don't know who has
never called me nor will ever call me,

320
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,730
who has no effect on my life.
How do you get threatened by that?

321
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,850
I'm just calling it for the bullshit
that it is, cause you know what?

322
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,680
This is what fucking drives me nuts.

323
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,720
I can't stand when somebody tells me
that they're shit sandwich tastes worse

324
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:15,830
than my shit sandwich.
Okay, go fuck yourself.

325
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,540
At what point am I supposed
to have empathy as I'm
sitting here eating the shit

326
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:24,370
sandwich and you're telling me how much
worse your yours, yours, this, you know,

327
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,460
at the end of the fucking day. You know
what I mean? Sure. Mine might be on a,

328
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,110
you know,
a better slice of bread,

329
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,530
which I guess would make it
taste a little bit better,

330
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,590
but at the end of the fucking day,
right the end of the fucking day.

331
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,600
All right, I'm going to end up
in a FEMA camp with you. Okay?

332
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:46,280
You think when the next fucking psycho
comes along, I'm going to make the cut.

333
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:51,130
What the fuck do I, what do I
bring to the world? Huh? Exactly.

334
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,900
I'll be standing right next to you. So
go fuck yourself. You just fucking woman.

335
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:58,720
Every time she sneezes,
they give her another God damn award.

336
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:02,490
She's still pitching. Still fucking
bitching. You know it's rough.

337
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,840
I remember when I did
this Oscar nominated part.

338
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,500
Oh go fuck yourself with your wigs.
The whole thing. Just, you know,

339
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,010
that's what fucking pisses me
off when I watched this shit.

340
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:15,880
If you really want to know my
perspective is from where I come from,

341
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,910
I can't bitch about shit cause
everybody's like, oh go fuck yourself.

342
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,790
You hit the lottery. Right. But I got
to sit here and listen to you bitch.

343
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,290
Even if you fucking killing it,
even if you're killing it,

344
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,200
you know Yale School of drama
and he's still up on the bull.

345
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,790
Go Fuck yourself with your
God damn yachts. All right,

346
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,290
there you go. That felt good. It
was probably ignorant, but whatever.

347
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,650
Um, all right, let's get to a,

348
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,990
and let's get some advertising
now that I trashed. Um,

349
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,660
Lord Meryl Streep. What did, what does
she call, is she a prince princess?

350
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,553
Is that what it is?

351
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,563
Okay.

352
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,430
You know what,
if I ever get to that fucking level,

353
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:01,300
which God knows I'm not going to cause
you have to have an unbelievable body of

354
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:03,310
work by the time you're my age.

355
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,600
Okay.

356
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,030
You know,

357
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,300
to even remotely have a shot and then
they're not going to give it to you until

358
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:12,410
you're like fucking 60.
So that's a, that's out,

359
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,370
that's out the door.

360
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,460
That's like when I wanted to go to
Notre Dame when I was in high school,

361
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,550
I wanted to go to that college
and by my sophomore year,

362
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,960
I knew that that dream was over.
And

363
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,700
so the same goes for
ever getting knighted,

364
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,760
but let's just say for some fucking
reason, they lowered the standards

365
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,840
and I get knighted.
Right.

366
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,290
Okay.

367
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,510
Um, or asked to be knighted. Like
that's some shit I'm not showing up.

368
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,450
Why would you show up for that?
You know, do, do you want to,

369
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,320
do you want to get knighted
in our a fake kingdom?

370
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,280
You know, uh, I dunno, but who am
I gonna get knighted by fucking,

371
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm mister McFeely. Is that what I'm
going to do? A, you're fucking Weirdos.

372
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,420
Okay.

373
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,960
Why don't you guys fuck outside of your
gene pool and then maybe I'll show up to

374
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:05,070
become a sergeant and your little fucking,
uh, that's what, that's that whole,

375
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:07,470
that whole royal family like
a bunch of God damn rednecks.

376
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,850
She's my third cousin blow me.

377
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,453
Okay.

378
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,330
It's why they were all weird looking.

379
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:19,770
Okay.

380
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,260
Prince Charles is a weird
look and son of a bitch.

381
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,820
Look at his fuck is awful teeth.
Those ears. He really does.

382
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:31,590
He looks like a, he's missing
some parts. You know what I mean?

383
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,830
He looks like, you know, if you have like
a fucking 66 Mustang and then you gee,

384
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,840
he looks like the, the piece of shit
one that they're not going to restore.

385
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:42,960
And everybody, you know, everybody going
in there taking carburetors out and uh,

386
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,220
radiators and shit. He looks like
he's missing some stuff. You know,

387
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,300
Princess Di was hot though. She
was hot. She had big feet though.

388
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,980
Didn't she had big feet right now of
losing anybody gay listening to this.

389
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,140
Right. That's like their, uh,
that's there. Jesus. I think,

390
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,880
isn't it that a fucking why do I
try? All right, let's, let's get,

391
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:11,420
let's get on with the advertising
here. Um, what do we got here?

392
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,270
What do we got? Oh, let's
go. Oh, you know what?

393
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,820
In honor of Memorial Day weekend,
this is a big man holiday,

394
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,120
right? We got to sit there and
act like you don't cry sometimes.

395
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:27,720
Do yourself late at
night. Um, what, what do,

396
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,470
what are you gonna do this weekend?
Huh? You're going to get some alcohol.

397
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,580
You're going to rent a boat,

398
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,890
you're going to hit a rock
and then say he didn't see it.

399
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,010
And then there's going to be some sort
of big insurance claim or you could stay

400
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,790
on the land and he can, you
can, you can grill, you know,

401
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:44,420
and I'm not just saying what that normal
grill that you have that you've been

402
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:49,310
using for years with those little
skinny Pretzel Rod, you know,

403
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:53,990
great state you have on it. You know
what you need. You need the man. Great.

404
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,310
All right. For this weekend. All
right. And if not for this weekend,

405
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,640
you can do it for father's
day is the copy says, yeah.

406
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:04,430
Why don't you hook up your dad for
once you dad never gets anything. Okay?

407
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:08,780
This father's day, there's only
one perfect gift, all right?

408
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:11,870
Cause every other gift you get him,
he's going to throw it in your face.

409
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,970
You want to get them this right here.
It's the man,

410
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,990
great grill enhancement system.
What's the man? Great you ask. Well,

411
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:21,860
I'm glad you asked that because I have
the answers in this copy right here, man.

412
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:26,530
Grates are 100% made in America.
Cast iron, grilling greats.

413
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,680
All right? And all you do is you just
take off your little pretzel rod once.

414
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,440
You know what I mean? This is
like putting like a, you know,

415
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:36,770
yanking out the awful engine and
putting a bigger one in. All right?

416
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,860
You take off your old ones and you
slam this one down. All right, there.

417
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,930
These are heavy duty
grilling grades to deliver a,

418
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,480
exactly what you need to achieve the
steakhouse flavor you've been looking for

419
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:50,660
with the mangroves, patented
design, chicken states or veggies.

420
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:54,350
We'll have never tasted so good.
No more flare ups. No more dry

421
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,210
meant, you mean no more

440
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,223
MMM.

441
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,270
Anyways, you know, stuff that
Margaret Thatcher and that,

442
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:13,820
that chick who view the
original cook on TV,

443
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,030
they look the exact same as
far as I'm concerned. You know,

444
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,480
and Meryl Streep,
she won awards for both parts.

445
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,880
You know what I mean? Did she
still complaining? You know what,

446
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:29,720
she wasn't really complaining.

447
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:32,240
She brought that one point and I totally
blew it out of proportion and that's

448
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:35,880
what the fuck I do. All right.
All right. So now that I, I,

449
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,200
I did a little advertising that is a
couple of things that I actually wanted to

450
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:43,010
bring up that have nothing to do
with advertising just to two awesome,

451
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,460
uh, youtube channels that, um,

452
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,020
okay.

453
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,801
That I found,
you know,

454
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,290
now that I've got a house and I've been
trying to learn how to fix shit because

455
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,280
you feel like a moron,

456
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,840
you don't want some other guy has to come
over and rescue you from your problems.

457
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,160
Um, that Dude El Cheapo.
I tweeted about this guy,

458
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,360
uh, I'm going to have a link
to a, one of his, uh, his,

459
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,980
his youtube channel is to shit.
This guy can fix anything.

460
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,470
Plays Guitar. This guy, he's like the
macgyver. He's like a bargain basement.

461
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,110
Macgyver. I don't mean he's
bargain basement. I mean,

462
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:23,490
he can do anything for like no money.
He does everything for cheap.

463
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,960
And uh, believe me, after your,

464
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:29,580
you were in a house or something like
that or if you've got a shit job and the

465
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:31,830
bankers of fucking you in the ass,
this guy,

466
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,330
we'll show you how to fix anything
for cheap. It's the Shit El Cheapo.

467
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,430
Um, and then there's
another dude, you know,

468
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,770
I don't know about you guys,
but I always found car engines to second.

469
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:45,930
They turned them sideways
and it became fuel injected.

470
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:49,740
I don't even know what the fuck's
going on. This guy, Eric, the car guy,

471
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,340
you know, I'm telling you,
if you're a moron like me,

472
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:57,690
if you just watch this guy after
a while you start going like,

473
00:28:57,691 --> 00:29:00,690
I could do that.
I could unplug all that shit.

474
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:01,980
And yanked that engine out of the car.

475
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:06,420
Same thing with El Cheapo digits
to fucking awesome channels.

476
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,130
And a, I probably watched just about
all of their videos at this point. Um,

477
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,560
okay.

478
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,500
Like what's his face, Eric? The car guy.
Watch that guy like for like an hour.

479
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,250
Okay.

480
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,770
Hour's worth of video is a
45 minutes with the videos.

481
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,420
I'm watching them change
a water pump on a 2002

482
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,680
Chevy cavalier or something.
What the hell? It was, um,

483
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,310
unreal and, but you just keep watching
it and after awhile I swear to God,

484
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:39,160
it's like you start to Geek,
you start building your confidence.

485
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:43,960
Now there's no fucking way I would
try do that on my car. All right.

486
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:46,840
But some other stuff that outskirts and
going into it a little bit wouldn't be

487
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:50,670
that bed. So there you go.
All right, let's get back.

488
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,090
Let's get back to the podcast.
Everybody. Um, oh, by the way,

489
00:29:55,091 --> 00:30:00,010
real quick. Guess who's going to be
performing in Burbank, California? Huh?

490
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,400
This the city that, uh,
Johnny Carson made famous.

491
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,620
I'm going to be at flappers
on May 25th and 26th.

492
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,150
Uh, out in Burbank. Tickets
are going fast. Two shows
Friday, two shows Saturday.

493
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,110
I'd love you guys come down and I'm
gonna be trying out some new stuff while

494
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:20,870
also playing some classics.
How about that? You like dead.

495
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,170
You want an overrated for this week?
Overrated. Underrated. He's overrated.

496
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:31,060
A napkin holder, napkin holder.
Overrated. They don't fucking work.

497
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,440
All right. You want to make money
selling something for 1995 late at night.

498
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:38,680
Why don't you come up with a fucking
Napkin holder that works. All right.

499
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:41,560
This is the problem.
If you don't put enough napkins in there,

500
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,290
gravity takes over and they
fucking fall out of the thing.

501
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,200
So you've got to always have
to put too many in there.

502
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,450
So then as you go to pull them out,
they start tearing.

503
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,550
Then you always got to
grab like 40 of 'em out.

504
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:52,960
Take one out and stick the other thing.

505
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:57,800
And you might wanna just leave it in
that plastic hunk of shit. Really? Bill,

506
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,070
what are you really mad at? Oh go fuck
yourself. So this is a rough week for me.

507
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:06,020
You know what? What am I up to here? How
much, how much time is left in class?

508
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,130
31 minutes. All right. We're
at the halfway point. Good.

509
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:14,450
I go to the bathroom. Can
I relieve my bottles? Um,

510
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,380
no you can't.

511
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:18,350
You have to sit here and listen to me
pontificate about this bullshit that I

512
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,300
stopped caring about the
third year I taught it.

513
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,830
How do high school teachers do that? Teach
the same material over and over again.

514
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,220
You know, wonder why they always have
their hands in their pockets, you know,

515
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,520
rubbing that balls.
Just trying to do anything.

516
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,680
Okay.

517
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,260
Make it more, I don't know,
stimulating for him. All right, Bill,

518
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:40,060
you're not stupid is what this call is.
What's this called?

519
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,640
Is is what this is called bill.

520
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:45,610
I've been listen to your podcast for
the past two months and I honestly don't

521
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:46,630
think you're stupid at all.

522
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,730
Just the mere fact, sir, that
you have to defend me. You know,

523
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,790
if the gloves don't fit,
um,

524
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:01,120
you give great advice and it's not just
some hollow cookie cutter bullshit.

525
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,880
I Dunno about your educational background,

526
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,480
but you have an excess of
common sense and wisdom.

527
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,150
Uh,
if I have an issue,

528
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:14,230
I will definitely bring it to you and
hopes that you have advice for me.

529
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:18,610
Anyone who thinks you're retarded is
just covering up their retardation by

530
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:22,270
taking it out on you. Keep that shit
up. Thank you, sir. You know what?

531
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:25,270
That was all good to your last two
sentences and then everyone just realized

532
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:28,690
that you had the same intellect I do.
Which is why you don't think I'm dumb.

533
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,960
Okay.

534
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,320
Anyone who thinks you're retarded is
just covering up their retardation by

535
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:38,700
taking it out on you. Keep that shit
up, dude. You Ain't fucking stupid.

536
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,780
Keep that fucking shit up. I
appreciate that, sir. All right,

537
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:46,460
let's talk sports.
All right.

538
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,820
At the risk of having all the fucking
people got picked last in gym class,

539
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,650
wine to me on Twitter,

540
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:59,130
it's somebody's yet another person
threatened to unfollow me on Twitter if I

541
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:04,670
didn't stop tweeting about
sports threatening. You know,

542
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,920
if you don't stop talking about
sports, I'm going to stop. I'm,

543
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,690
I might stop listening to you.
I don't give a fuck.

544
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,500
Maybe Meryl Streep is right.
I think women just unfollow.

545
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,870
You guys sit in there,
they talk about it. Um,

546
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,040
this is my prediction
for the, uh, for the NBA.

547
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,020
I think the spurs are gonna win it all.

548
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,780
You know why the Spurs play basketball?
The way your dad fights,

549
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,640
you know he's, your dad is
too old to fuck around. Okay.

550
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,850
He's just going to end it with the
fucking throat shop is just sitting there

551
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:46,050
trying to do some Floyd Mayweather
shit that you saw on TV. Okay.

552
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:48,210
That's what's happening to
the La Clippers right now.

553
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,430
I don't even know if they're still, even
if they got swept or not, it was three,

554
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,110
three, zip last I saw watching them.
They would just do it. You know

555
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,710
the fucking clippers.
They're out there. Lake Boom,

556
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,860
trying to throw fucking alley. Oops.
And Shit. Goddamn spurs are sitting in,

557
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,420
half of them are fucking bald.

558
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,110
It just sitting there picking
and rolling them to do

559
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,983
death.

560
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,810
You know, every 14 year old kid at some
point squares off with his dad. Like,

561
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:19,930
all right, I've had enough of your shit.
Old Man. Right. And what does he do?

562
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,590
Fucking hit you with some shitty
learned in the navy and it's over in two

563
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:24,424
seconds.

564
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,880
You sitting there watching the UFC and
rolling around on the Mat thinking you

565
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:30,820
know some shit. You don't. All right,

566
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,580
okay.

567
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,610
This is the thing about old guys.
They're very fucking efficient.

568
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,260
Tim Dunkin doesn't have time for
your fucking bullshit. All right?

569
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,830
He's going to score as many as he needs
to and then he's going to expression

570
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,330
with no expression on his face.

571
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:48,300
He's going to walk off the court as
you sit there scratching your young,

572
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:51,930
full head of hair, wondering what
the fuck just happened. All right.

573
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:56,880
I know a lot of people are thinking,
uh, possibly, uh, Oklahoma City who,

574
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:59,940
I love that team, but a, I'm telling you,

575
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,700
I think the spurs are going to
do it. Um, and I've actually,

576
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,440
because uh,

577
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,500
I was just in a part of the country where
they weren't showing any of the hog or

578
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:13,830
I couldn't, I was in a hotel room
and I couldn't get any of the hockey.

579
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,050
Every time I was working
it was on and I missed it.

580
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,100
But I kept catching the basketball
games. And I've actually, uh,

581
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,750
NBA hoop is way better, way fucking
better than I've been given a credit for.

582
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:28,080
The games have been great.
And actually in the end,

583
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,160
even with the timeouts and all the files,
shots does a ton of drama.

584
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,990
It is a great sport.
You know what it is?

585
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:38,991
I think it's just regular season games
when like playing fucking Toronto and

586
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,550
they're doing that timeout,
timeout shit.

587
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,230
I think I judged them
on the regular season,

588
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,210
which is what a lot of people
do with hockey. Right. Who's
kitten hopes? So my bed.

589
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,140
All right. I have to apologize for
that NBA hoop is actually the shit.

590
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:53,580
I'm actually, uh, I'm,

591
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,570
I'm back into it and I
really want to see the spurs,

592
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,190
you know,
throat shop,

593
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,700
Oklahoma City after they finish off the
fucking Lakers. And by the way, though,

594
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,150
how right am I about pog with salt?

595
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,070
If you ever seen a fucking face like
that when he gets called for a foul or if

596
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:14,904
they led a,

597
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,940
I saw one where he didn't touch the ball
and they said it was a Oklahoma's ball

598
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:25,050
because they claimed it went off him.
Dude, his fucking face. I'm telling you.

599
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,343
Ooh.

600
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,520
And then when he'd dunks
it, he's fucking, you know,

601
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,300
acting like he's in the Wu Tang clan.
That's not who you are. Paul was Saul.

602
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:44,250
Oh Woo.

603
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,840
Oh, am I going to enjoy watching them
fucking loose? But even as a Celtics fan,

604
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:53,860
I fucking, I love Coby
Bryant. That guy is the shit.

605
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,170
Um, I saw the, uh, the first Celtics
game. You know, I'm bandwagon Celtics.

606
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:02,830
I saw a game one. I saw the
highlights of the end of game too.

607
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,630
And uh, once again, I was working
and I missed three and four.

608
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,550
I heard the last game we were up like,

609
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,760
like 16 and nothing and
still lost the Goddamn game.

610
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:16,870
So I'm going to be watching
that one later on tonight. Um,

611
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,090
but I'm psyched that the
Celtics and sixers are,

612
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:25,630
are playing in the playoffs just
because it takes me back to the,

613
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,240
the unbelievable.
And he has an underrated for you,

614
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,040
underrated Boston Celtics,
first to Philadelphia,

615
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:37,890
70 sixers in the early eighties.
Those were some of the, the,

616
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,710
the greatest wars I saw. Everybody
always talks. Celtics Lakers,

617
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:45,310
they forget about the Celtics.
76 years. I remember one year,

618
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,480
the sixers were up three games to one,
and that was 1981.

619
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,550
And uh,
we ended up coming back and we,

620
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,250
and we beat him for games to three.

621
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,540
The next year they go up again,
three games to one,

622
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,340
then it's three games to two,
then it's three games to three games,

623
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:11,140
seven in the Boston Garden. And the
sixers came in and were like, fuck this.

624
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:13,290
And they beat the Celtics.
And next,

625
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,010
I remember that on that week's sports
illustrated, the cover was Dr Jay.

626
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:20,800
I still remember it says Julius Jams Jinx.

627
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,600
And they had him Duncan and he had this,
go fuck yourself. Look on his face.

628
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,830
Uh, but the six, I think they
lost in the finals to the Lakers.

629
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,080
They even made it that far.
I can't remember.

630
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,560
And then the next year they got
Moses Malone in the shit over.

631
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,640
And that's the one of the most
underrated teams of all times in 1983,

632
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,210
Philadelphia, 76 years. I put
that team up against anybody.

633
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,240
They asked us that classic
when they asked Moses Malone,

634
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,540
what do you think's going to happen in
the playoffs? And he said, full, full,

635
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,770
full meaning we're going to sweep
everybody think they lost one game.

636
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,090
That was the other Celtics got
swept by the Milwaukee Bucks to

637
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,030
another underrated team. Sidney
Moncrief kid. Um, all right.

638
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,700
Did that bore you? Did that make
you turn off the Goddamn thing?

639
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,300
All right. What are we talking about
here? All right. Interesting subject.

640
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:14,190
Interesting situation.
Hey Bill.

641
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,810
I was dating my girlfriend for three
years since the end of last summer.

642
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:20,010
We had been on and off.

643
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,390
One Week I say I'm done with her and the
next week I'm taking her out to dinner.

644
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,710
All right. That's codependent. You
know what that just says to me?

645
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:31,440
Either you're afraid to be alone or
she's fucking the shit out of you.

646
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,740
One of the other, uh, we
didn't speak for about a month.

647
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,710
Then I saw her out with a
guy making out with them.

648
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,660
I lost my cool and punched the guy.
I'm usually a laid back person,

649
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,640
but seeing that drove me crazy.

650
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,200
I realized that if I continued to play
this game with her, I'll lose her.

651
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,490
So for the past month,
I've been great to her wait time out.

652
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,030
Time out. Time out, dude, you already,

653
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:01,830
you saw her in a bar making out
with another guy. All right?

654
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:08,290
You, you, you, you got to walk away
from this one. This one's over, dude.

655
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,070
Okay.

656
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,590
You guys, you get together,
you break up, you're, you're,

657
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,680
you're on the outs for a month,
then you're back together.

658
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,040
You don't want to do this. That's like
one of those curtain Courtney fucking, uh,

659
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:24,800
uh, sid vicious kind of fucking
relationships. You don't need any punch.

660
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:26,570
This guy in the face.
What did that guy do?

661
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,600
He's doing what guys are supposed to do.
He's trying to get laid.

662
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:33,470
He doesn't know you, right? You
punched the wrong person if you ask me,

663
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,280
but she can't punch the ladies.
So you've got a dumper

664
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,380
right before you'd dump
or take a really nice,

665
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:44,680
getting a really nice camera and take
a picture of a face and then go buy a

666
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:49,630
heavy bag and just put it on that and
just go to the fucking ribs. Um, anyways,

667
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:53,140
he goes,
I've been great to her dinners,

668
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,890
going out with their parents, doing
all the little things that she loves.

669
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,130
We got close again.
So she's been sleeping at my apartment,

670
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,170
has been and has been leaving things
here and has been asking if she can go,

671
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,300
go to my apartment when I'm not
there. Dude, if she, if this,

672
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:15,280
this story ends with her bang in some
dude in your bed, in your apartment.

673
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,420
All right. Then when she sleeps
here, she keeps leaving. Well,

674
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:24,390
I already said that one. Blah,
blah, blah, blah. Alright. Oh well.

675
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:25,230
Then when she sleeps here,

676
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:30,231
she keeps leaving things here in
anticipation for her next sleepover,

677
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,860
which is usually the next night.

678
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,050
One of my problems has always been that
she doesn't give me personal space.

679
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,870
So this definitely has been bothering me.
Also,

680
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,120
I hate making out in
public and she loves it.

681
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,580
I think it's immature and unnecessary.

682
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,990
Last night we were out with my
friends and she kept like yelling,

683
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,310
let's make out. And I was so
annoyed. I said, not right now.

684
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,920
She then got off my lap and walked away.

685
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,390
She was doing little annoying things
like this all night. So, uh, so I left.

686
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,650
So now I am very annoyed with this
girl and I'm definitely back in. Uh,

687
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,320
I don't want to see her stage.
Only problem.

688
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,240
My Mom's wedding is this Thursday and
she's going with me and her parents are

689
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:12,074
invited.

690
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,510
So do I pretend that everything is good
and continue to lie to her and myself

691
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:19,100
and fake that everything is great.

692
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:20,850
MMM.

693
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:25,020
To everybody at this wedding and my
mother or do I man up and go sold to the

694
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:29,880
wedding and stop faking that
this is the girl from me. Yeah,

695
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:34,530
he answered you. You, you know what you
gotta do. You get yet dumper. It's it,

696
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:35,364
it's over.

697
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,463
You know,

698
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,140
you have a wedding to go. Do you want to
have a good time? Maybe you'll meet you.

699
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,540
Maybe. See a nice girl there that
you want to be with [inaudible]

700
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,793
you know,

701
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,210
and then you won't be able to go there.
And then she,

702
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,720
her whole first vibe is she's going to
see you with this other girl and you with

703
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:50,770
a scowl on your face.

704
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,590
And she's actually gonna feel bad
for the girl because of your energy.

705
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,300
When you're the God damn victim here
as far as I'm concerned. Yeah. Dumper.

706
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:00,880
Okay.

707
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,140
Dumper. Make a list of Shit you have to
do today. Go to the bank, wash a car,

708
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,780
dump girlfriend,
and just fucking just,

709
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:12,670
just knock them right off and
just sit down and it's gonna suck.

710
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,550
She's either gonna cry and she's going
to yell at you, but you know what?

711
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,520
In a fucking hour, hour and a
half, it's going to be over.

712
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,363
All right.

713
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,370
You know what you want to do?
Talk to Al Madrigal.

714
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:25,900
Okay.

715
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:30,100
Al Madrigal, the Great Al
Madrigal, the daily show zone.

716
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,230
Al Madrigal, a minivan
men podcast. Al Madrigal.

717
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:38,980
You ask him,
Al Madrigal knows how to break her.

718
00:43:38,981 --> 00:43:40,570
He should have a fucking billboard.

719
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,070
He told me one night's these hilarious
stories of when he was going to break up

720
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:48,730
with somebody, how he went about it
and it was fucking brilliant. Uh,

721
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,590
he had had the element of surprise. He
was totally prepared. Bing, Bang, boom,

722
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:56,830
go fuck yourself. It
was over. It was like a,

723
00:43:56,831 --> 00:44:01,600
it was basically the same way a
corporation fires a longtime executive.

724
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,080
The only thing that's missing with the
way Al would break up with somebody with

725
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:07,990
security walking the person out.
All right,

726
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,840
so email Al Madrigal at minivan.

727
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:13,590
Men just go to that
podcast and you'll see a,

728
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,970
he'll tell you what to do. He'll tell
you how to, I'm telling you what to do,

729
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:23,120
which I think you already know and
Al will tell you how to do it. Um,

730
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,220
they should really have
like courses on that.

731
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,440
I don't know why they don't have that,

732
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,440
especially for young people when you
just don't know how to do it. You know,

733
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,750
they should just teach you how to fuck it,
do it the most effective way.

734
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,550
I think I, I break, I broken up
with girls like every possible way

735
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:51,110
from just never calling them again to
sitting down and watching them fucking cry

736
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:55,800
their eyes out, which is the
fucking worst to, uh, you know,

737
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:59,790
getting dumped myself. I've done all
of that shit. I've been the guy where,

738
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,560
you know, you know, I think I'm pulling
the trigger and then she's like,

739
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:09,360
well good, I don't care. I made out
with somebody six months ago, you know,

740
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,930
and they, you know, which does hurt,
but then also makes you site like, okay,

741
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:17,850
now I'm definitely doing the right thing
because I had no clue. You're such,

742
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,110
if you have the ability to do something
like that and I can't even pick up on it.

743
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,130
Like, uh, yeah, your poker
face is too fucking dangerous.

744
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,920
Um, so anyways, dude, that sucks.

745
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:33,921
But you're going to be site when you go
to the wedding and you don't have that

746
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:38,910
fucking lie tied to your ankle.
Okay.

747
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,190
Macro is just weird. Let's
make out like that seems to me.

748
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:47,670
And all your friends are there. There's
no like, emotional connection to that.

749
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:51,480
She just wants to,
she just wants to like engage in that act.

750
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,890
She sounds like she's sort of like
an exhibitionist a little bit. Like,

751
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,470
you know what, that little thing
right there. You know what?

752
00:45:58,471 --> 00:46:01,980
I bet that you could,
uh,

753
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,270
you could probably round third with
her in a bar if it was crowded enough,

754
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,500
you know, if she was standing up and no
one could really see what was going on.

755
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,240
She's one of those girls. All right. And
uh, you know, to each your own, but uh,

756
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:20,190
that's not the mother
your kids, uh, Daddy,

757
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:22,110
tell us how you mad mob.
Well,

758
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:26,520
I was finger banging her at a Denny's
and I was like, wow. The combination is,

759
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:31,410
and these pigs in a blanket, this must be
the one I'm fresh off a date. Hey Bill,

760
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,690
I'm writing this directly after getting
home from a date. Needless to say,

761
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,950
my depression is higher than normal.
Uh,

762
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:45,300
I will try to make this as short as
possible. In January, I met this girl,

763
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,790
this lady,
and we really hit it off.

764
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:51,270
We went out for about two
weeks and everything seemed
great. Then out of nowhere,

765
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:55,020
she stops responding to my texts,
slash, calls, et cetera. Yeah,

766
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,040
that's one way to do it. Then five months
later, she texted me out of nowhere,

767
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,620
she's drunk and pretends
like nothing happened.

768
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:05,520
She's a psycho and wants to get
together again. Mistake. Uh,

769
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:10,350
we went out tonight and we had,
we had fun,

770
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,060
but the goodbye was fairly
awkward realizing that she's
sober and you're not the

771
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:18,890
person once again, um, I can't
tell if she might be interested,

772
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:23,520
interested in me or if she just bored
in one. Is someone around exactly.

773
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,340
In any advice for a schmuck like me?
Any advice for a schmuck like me? Uh,

774
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,930
I don't have any advice. I
have a compliment. All right?

775
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,310
You actually know what's going on
and that's a huge thing. All right?

776
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,620
Um, look, this girl is
wherever she is in her life,

777
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,880
and that's not your fault.

778
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,620
You went out on this date with
sincerity in your heart. Okay?

779
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,300
So you're not a schmuck. All
right? You're a patsy. No.

780
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:53,223
Okay.

781
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,080
I just pictured Lee Harvey
Oswald walking into the, uh,

782
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,920
you walk in in like Lee Harvey Oswald
into the fucking police station with that

783
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:07,970
big knot in your eye. Oh, so on
the patsy. So on the, I get it,

784
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,630
I'm the guy that this is all getting
blamed on doing this. This isn't you.

785
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,210
You liked this girl.
You thought it was great.

786
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,090
She hurt you when she
didn't text you back.

787
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,050
Five months later she texts
you again and you got excited.

788
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,330
Then she went out with you because she's,

789
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:26,570
she's trying to figure herself
up and she keeps a, you know,

790
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,100
coming back into your
life, you know, just take,

791
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,690
take comfort in this, know that she's
miserable and lonely too. All right?

792
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:38,720
You guys aren't right for each other and
you're not a schmuck. You're a good guy.

793
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,260
All right? You didn't go
out there thinking like, I'm
going to fuck this chick,

794
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:42,801
you know,
and Blah,

795
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:46,190
Blah Blah and all that evil crap that
guy's usually think you went out there

796
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:47,150
cause you actually liked her.

797
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,810
You're a good guy and there's nothing
wrong with that. Okay. Some day.

798
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:53,930
You're going to meet the right girl. This
one isn't it, but you're not a schmuck.

799
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,590
All right. Just stop looking
down at the ground. You know,

800
00:48:57,591 --> 00:49:02,580
staring at your fucking shoes
as other girls.

801
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:06,800
Right? Fuck her. How's that? Huh? Tell me.

802
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,980
Your friends are going to give you
better advice than that. Um, all right.

803
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,710
Where the hell am I?
Why does it keep fucking doing that?

804
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:19,400
I swear to God I'm the worst
with this shit. All right,
let's, let's get to the uh,

843
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:36,721
like 20 minute chunk like some of
the shed had been working on and uh,

844
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:42,250
just tell a couple of stories.
What did I want to talk about?

845
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,960
Oh, I'm going to talk about, uh,

846
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,420
sex scenes in movies and
why think they're stupid?

847
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,410
And that might lead into something,
I dunno what,

848
00:51:56,411 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't know where I'm going
to go with this hour. I mean,

849
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,110
I can't really just sit here.

850
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:06,150
Am I really going to dedicate another
fucking 20 minutes to ragging on

851
00:52:06,151 --> 00:52:09,570
relationships? This gotta be, there's
gotta be a left turn in there somewhere.

852
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,910
You know,
I'm trying out new shit.

853
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:16,440
I'm fucking trying to rebuild this Goddamn
carburetor. Just got the parts, uh,

854
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:21,200
the other day. You know what, here's a
question for all you gearheads out there.

855
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,790
I'm trying to get it. I
got the, uh, I got the, uh,

856
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:29,740
what do you call it? The uh, Jesus.
I know what the fuck it's called,

857
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,600
the fuel bowl. You know, they got
the primary and the secondary.

858
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,280
I can get both of those off, but then
there's that next piece that's behind it,

859
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,570
you know,
up against the,

860
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:44,750
basically the main body
of the carburetor and a,

861
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,660
I know there's a gasket
on the other side of that.

862
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,610
And this thing is really old
and it's a piece of shit,

863
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:49,780
so it's really stuck there.

864
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,570
So I got a small screwdriver
and I'm sorta tapping at it,

865
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:56,680
but I'm worried that I'm going to do
damage to the metal and I'm going to have

866
00:52:56,681 --> 00:53:00,070
to get it. Machine does. If you have
any ideas on how to fucking get it off,

867
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:03,080
I don't want to damage the carburetor.
Um,

868
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,510
but this is the thing about doing
all that type of stuff is uh,

869
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:10,150
there's really no comedy in science.
It's just so fucking,

870
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,090
you know,
reading about the elements and everything.

871
00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:18,091
I guess the comedy is how fucking stupid
I am or blows your mind or whatever.

872
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:19,570
But like,
um,

873
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:23,903
I dunno,

874
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,900
I think in a time I'm going to do like
four years worth of science classes

875
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:29,910
because I've become obsessed with it.

876
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:34,020
Like my birthday's coming up and I
asked Nina to get me this book on, uh,

877
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,860
like just a electrical,
you know,

878
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:41,310
for houses and that type of stuff because
electricity is fucking magic to me.

879
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,210
I don't understand it at all. Then I
just watched a couple of youtube videos

880
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:51,750
and I, I kinda, I kinda get it now.
Like I, I didn't understand like,

881
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,440
like this just a power
source and all the wires are,

882
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,310
are just bringing that
electricity. I, you know,

883
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:02,950
I didn't know that's basic to you guys
are right. Go Fuck Yourself. What?

884
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:04,660
I give you shit.
If he didn't know how to write a joke,

885
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,610
I never even thought
about any of this stuff.

886
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,510
Why is it keeps signing me out
of my fucking God damn account

887
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:18,010
signed back in? What is the
fucking problem anyways,

888
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:23,140
but I was watching that Eric, the car
guy and he was trying to figure out,

889
00:54:23,141 --> 00:54:27,730
you know, why? You know, the Dome
light and his car was fucked up and a,

890
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:31,480
and I watched him just take the thing off
on the side of the car and it's just a

891
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:35,920
little fuse in there and it's just how
the whole thing works in it. Actually,

892
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:38,440
it started to make sense.
Speaking of Eric, the car guy,

893
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,820
he just uploaded another one,

894
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,110
Eric decar guy just
uploaded another video,

895
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,050
a Chevy Tahoe rear shoe replacement.

896
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,430
I'm such a fucking psycho. I literally
want to get, I want to learn how to weld.

897
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,820
I want to learn how to do all this
shit. All this shit that it, I don't,

898
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,180
my whole fucking life, I watched
these guys, I respected what they did,

899
00:55:01,181 --> 00:55:05,230
but I always thought like, you know, I
remember the kids who took shop class,

900
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,000
you know, they were fucking up in every
other client. Maybe they just had a gift.

901
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:12,220
I have no idea.
You know what it is.

902
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:16,570
You just feel like such a bitch as a
guy when you have to bring a, you know,

903
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,010
have somebody come up like,
you know what,

904
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,830
this one actually
sometimes I just tap out,

905
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,310
like I got to get some
screens for a window.

906
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:26,020
One of the windows has like
an arch on it, so they go, oh,

907
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:29,260
you got to make like a cardboard cutout
of it to measure it like that. I'm like,

908
00:55:29,261 --> 00:55:31,180
I'm not fucking doing that.
Just come over and do it.

909
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,840
Sometimes you just got to tap out. You
know, like when it comes to dinner,

910
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,990
I can make dinner, but you know,
you just got to tell you, you, you,

911
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,590
you're a woman to go in there and make
it go in there and make me a fucking

912
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:46,140
sandwich. You know what I
mean? That's why you're here.

913
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,850
I kill it. And then you make it.
Except I don't have to kill it anymore.

914
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,830
Somebody kills it for me.
But I, you know, I bought it.

915
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:57,090
It's the same goddamn thing now. I'm
like, I'm like the kingpin, you know,

916
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:57,840
I got this,

917
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,770
this fleet of hitman killing cows and
fucking chickens in that type of shit.

918
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:06,900
And then they bring it to me, you know,
like Al Pachino, I take the tool myself,

919
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,230
right?
So go in there and prepare it.

920
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:16,170
That's not sexist is it? Um, all right,

921
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,290
let's talk about some dates
they have coming up. Everybody.

922
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,080
This is my whirlwind tour of,
uh,

923
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,180
of cities. What do we got to
hear? What are we going to hear?

924
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,220
A San Jose June 15th to the 16th,

925
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,840
working with Sacramento's
own Chelsea Peretti, um,

926
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,400
Ontario, California. I'm going to
be at the improv inland empire.

927
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:44,401
June 29th 30th and July 1st they
Hampton Beach Ballroom Casino,

928
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,860
July 14th and the Newport
yacht and set up in Newport,

929
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:52,330
Rhode Island,
July 15th.

930
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,980
Don't let that yachting center
name scare you like you.

931
00:56:56,981 --> 00:57:01,630
It's like a $40,000 a plate for Obama's
campaign and everybody's going to be

932
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:04,000
there wearing Tuxedos.
It's not going to be like that.

933
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:09,170
It's a giant tent in a parking lot
in Newport, Rhode Island. All right.

934
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,630
You'll get to be able to go down there
and be just as dumb and fucking as you

935
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:17,980
would be in any other place. All right,
so please come down to that. And uh,

936
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,790
let me actually look up.
I got a couple others.

937
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:24,790
I got one in Charlotte
and one in Jacksonville,

938
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,170
Florida that I haven't put up yet.

939
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:29,320
So I'm going to search for this email
if you guys could just be patient.

940
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,750
Um Oh and I got Cincinnati coming up.

941
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,060
There you go.
October 19th

942
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,210
and 20th. I'm going to be a
go bananas and Cincinnati.

943
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,790
Bear with me.
Bear with me.

944
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:52,050
I'm a blowing through here.
Where else? Where else?

945
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:56,880
The comedy zone in Jacksonville,
Florida. September 27th,

946
00:57:56,881 --> 00:58:01,881
28th and 29th going to the Jaguar game
on that Sunday and I'm going to the

947
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,970
Pittsburgh Steelers,
Cincinnati Bengals game on the other one.

948
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,530
And then the comedy zone in Charlotte,
North Carolina. September 13th,

949
00:58:10,531 --> 00:58:14,220
14th and 15th going to the
Carolina Panthers game that Sunday.

950
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,260
You like that? See, that's how we do the
road. Doesn't have to be miserable people.

951
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,820
Um, all right. Do we have anything
left? I feel like I'm coming up short.

952
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,600
This fucking guy's going to be here any
minute with the goddamn screens. Oh,

953
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:32,040
58 minutes. I can tap off.
I can leave. Um, all right.

954
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:35,640
You're not stupid. I already
read that. Oh, here's something.

955
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,680
Here's something a buddy
of mine came up with,

956
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:40,350
and this has nothing to do with
advertising. This is a friend of mine.

957
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:44,550
I was trying to get an,
uh, an iPhone application.

958
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,170
He made this new iPhone application.
It's a, it's called Word Nair.

959
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,400
W. O. R. D. I. N. A. I. R. E. Warden Air.

960
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:57,140
It's a reverse dictionary. So if you think
in like a, you know, what's a word for,

961
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:01,380
uh, it'll give you a
comprehensive list. Um,

962
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:06,960
God knows I could do something like that
cause I'm a fucking moron. Um, all right.

963
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:10,230
Is that the podcast for this week? I
think it is. I got a couple more raw,

964
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:15,600
anything else that was going on in
my life that I wanted to talk about.

965
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,181
Oh,

966
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:19,980
I'll get my truck back today after talking
all that shit about learning how to

967
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:23,370
fix stuff.
I problems with my brakes and uh,

968
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,640
that's not something I'm
going to try and do myself.

969
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,990
I'll fuck with something that,

970
00:59:30,991 --> 00:59:35,210
that after I fuck with it
might not make my truck start.

971
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,850
I'll fuck with something like that.
Like I actually at this point, um,

972
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,730
would have the balls to try
and change a head gasket to,

973
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,710
to put in a new head gasket. You
know, my engine, I think, you know,

974
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,440
what do I have to do? I just take
off the, uh, the air filter housing,

975
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:00,260
you know, take off the carburetor
off the manifold. Right.

976
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,810
Then I imagine there's some
other shit that's in the way,

977
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:07,580
but as long as I take it off,
whatever, I probably fuck it up.

978
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:10,340
But the bottom line is
nobody would get killed.

979
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,200
But when you talk in breaks
and that type of Shit, uh,

980
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,730
there's no fucking way I'm doing
that myself. I'm going to, uh,

981
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,040
that was very least would
have to have somebody there.

982
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:26,360
So I'm actually getting my
truck back today. Um, but yes,

983
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:29,930
I do feel like a little bit of a bitch
because I didn't figure it out myself.

984
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:31,550
But you know, fuck you. I'm trying.

985
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,630
You want to think about is when you
first start to learn how to fix things is

986
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:41,890
the hardest thing I find is not having
the balls to just start taking it apart.

987
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,050
It's, um, it's the overhead,

988
01:00:47,051 --> 01:00:50,500
the amount of fucking money you have to
spend in tools, but once you buy him,

989
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:53,170
he got him forever, man. I
want, speaking of which member,

990
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:56,830
I bragged that I fixed a blender, it's
fucked up. All the lights are coming on.

991
01:00:56,831 --> 01:01:01,360
I don't know what I did to it, but uh,
but I ain't going to quit. I'm underrated.

992
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,670
Overrated, underrated for
this week. Uh, overrated.

993
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:07,270
Fucking voicemails leaving
them as the most awkward thing.

994
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,790
I've always said that I'm
terrible at leaving them,

995
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,850
but whenever I say that everyone else,
whenever I say that,

996
01:01:12,851 --> 01:01:15,250
everyone else always says it too.

997
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,640
So I'm putting my foot down on the
issue and calling it right now,

998
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,220
leaving a message for
someone on the phone sucks.

999
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,180
There's no way to start your message
normally without sounding like a Douche.

1000
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,350
And then five minutes later you realize
you've been trailing on and on while

1001
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,620
saying, uh, um, too many times
making you want to kill yourself,

1002
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,530
ending with the inevitable
a. Okay, thanks.

1003
01:01:35,531 --> 01:01:40,280
By reminding them that you're
still a Douche. Fucking awful. Do.

1004
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:44,260
This is something that's really like
an epidemic in this young generation is

1005
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:47,650
everybody just feeling awkward
and feeling like a Douche.

1006
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,630
I don't know what happened to you guys.
I think this last generation of fathers,

1007
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:55,300
they flipped. Like, I'm not going
to beat the shit out of my kid.

1008
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:00,640
Not Hug them and never tell him that I
that I, that I love him. Uh, you know,

1009
01:02:00,641 --> 01:02:03,700
I'm going to do all of that shit and you
end up with these people who can't even

1010
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:06,100
fucking leave voicemails.

1011
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:07,990
Okay.

1012
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,420
What is so awkward,
you know?

1013
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,390
Okay.

1014
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,940
I, I, you know what? I have a hard
time getting off the phone. I forget.

1015
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,790
I forget what I used to say,
but I don't feel awkward.

1016
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,990
Well, I just feel like an idiot, I guess.
So I guess I kind of relate. I just go.

1017
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:27,160
All right. That's it. I'm Outta here.

1018
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,820
I will say that, but leaving a
message, I like leaving messages.

1019
01:02:34,821 --> 01:02:38,570
I sing on people's voicemails,
you know,

1020
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:42,230
whenever I call up fucking
Blob, Yay. Bobby Kelly,

1021
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:48,110
or in fucking Joey roses,
I call him up and I,

1022
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:50,420
I'll just immediately, I'll
just, whatever comes to my mind,

1023
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:54,800
I'll just start singing. Who's
the con to that? I love the most.

1024
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:59,640
Who's that fucker?
Who eats the toasted Joey?

1025
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:04,850
He's such a big FHEG.
Derosa what's going on?

1026
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:09,200
It's bill. Give me a call back.
You can't click. That's it.

1027
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,530
Why don't you try singing?
You can do it for anybody.

1028
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:18,860
Hey Mom, what's up you
sweetie? Thanks for having me.

1029
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,480
40 years ago I sent you some flowers.

1030
01:03:23,481 --> 01:03:24,770
You didn't call me.

1031
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,120
Do you like my siblings better than me?

1032
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:33,220
Click right? Why don't you
do that? Try that search.

1033
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:36,980
Try singing first. Um, all right.
Underrated. Overrated, underrated.

1034
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:40,880
Sitting Down to pee. If you're a guy, uh,

1035
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:49,950
is it that, how old are you?
Is it that hard to stand up?

1036
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,870
What is wrong with this fucking
generation of guys? You Know,

1037
01:03:55,871 --> 01:03:57,040
Sitting Down To pee,

1038
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:00,970
it's actually easier and you don't get
varicose veins from all those years of

1039
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:04,360
stand. There's nothing better
than just pulling out your Dick.

1040
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:09,190
It just fucking pee and all
over everything. You know,

1041
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:13,980
you fucking shooting the toilet paper
around. It's fucking good time. Um,

1042
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:17,800
anyways, it says the guy who drives
a fucking hybrid. Um, anyways,

1043
01:04:17,801 --> 01:04:21,520
there are many benefits to being a guy
and sitting down to peace such as not

1044
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:25,000
having to hear your chick
complain about peeing on the seat,

1045
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:30,030
even though it's on the fucking top of
the bowl and it's not actually the seat.

1046
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,640
Yup. Here's a guy. He's, he,

1047
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:38,500
he's literally sitting down to pee, so
his girlfriend will stop yelling at him.

1048
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,340
Okay.
I don't know what happened.

1049
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:44,890
People a hundred years ago,

1050
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:47,710
we could hit them with mop handles
and I don't know what happened.

1051
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:52,000
They got organized and we didn't, and
now we're sitting down to pee just still,

1052
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:56,140
they'll stop yelling at us. Um, all
right, number two, if you like me,

1053
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:58,510
if you're like me and you
wake up to pee at night,

1054
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:02,830
you don't have to fuck with your eyes
and turn on the bathroom lights to aim.

1055
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,030
Oh Dude.
You take it all the fun out of it.

1056
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,930
That's how you train your ear.
All right,

1057
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:13,450
that sounds like the back of the ball.

1058
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,200
Where's the water?
That's the floor.

1059
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:22,150
It is one small step.
Um,

1060
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,750
number three, not bending down to lift
up the seat out. You know what, dude?

1061
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:29,830
You're a fucking pansy.
Not Bending down to clean off the seat.

1062
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,850
Less bending in general. Why don't you
just bend over and Suck Your Own Dick?

1063
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,770
He's just sit on the bowl.
You fucking Douche.

1064
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,120
Fuck that guy peeing sitting down.
Do you know

1065
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,020
what else, sir? What? What, what else
is overrated? Lifting weights. Um,

1066
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:53,800
owning a gun. Chewing tobacco.
Eating steak. What else?

1067
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:58,780
Drinking Scotch. Smoking cigars.
Fixing your own car. What?

1068
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:00,880
What else?
Or what else is fucking overrated?

1069
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:03,130
Everything that makes be
in a guy fucking awesome.

1070
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:08,170
Losing your shit because some guy you
don't know the field goal that really has

1071
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:12,040
no effect on your life talking shit.
Is that all overrated,

1072
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,180
Lee Marvin?

1073
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:15,753
Yeah.

1074
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,730
The only thing that saved you surge,
you didn't leave your name so that,

1075
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:21,920
that's the only thing that I can say is
I can at least see that there was sort

1076
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:25,970
of some,
some sort of shame in your email.

1077
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,670
All right, what do we got here? Why
don't we get here with the man? Great.
