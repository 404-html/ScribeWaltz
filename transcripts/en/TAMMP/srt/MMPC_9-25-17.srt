4
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:16,530
What's going on? How are Yah, what's up?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,250
I am back from Toronto, Canada,
and every once in a while,

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,990
every once in a long while I have a, I
have a guest and I always get good guests.

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,480
And this is, no, today is no exception.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,340
We have the great Philippe aspires are
on here who has a welcome, first of all,

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,490
welcome.
[inaudible] was so full.

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,710
They go fully based bars if fun
of what's selling podcast. And uh,

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,420
let's get all the hype out of the way.
At first we got a,

12
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,130
you have a new HBO special?

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,770
Yes.
A new HBO special on so 30th 10

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,520
September 30th at 10 on Hbo. That's
where the HBO specials are. Culled.

15
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:56,350
Translate this. So, uh, let's
get into it. Tell me about that.

16
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:59,570
What's it like to shoot a
hour long special for HBO?

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,040
Um, it was, it was good. Um,
I showed him myself. Um, I,

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,750
I, um, I got the money together.

19
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:11,040
I stayed up the money and
my wife and I are, we, um,

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,050
we chose that Jose Improv
and we got cloud shires and,

21
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:18,160
um, it was all DIY, you know,

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,980
so you did it yourself and HBO liked
it so much. They bought it. Oh,

23
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,100
so when you were doing it, you weren't
thinking like, Oh shit, I'm doing an HBS,

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,720
Mashallah, no. To Go, they open,
go to Netflix or even Amazon.

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,420
No, but that's, I think that's
a, uh, that's a great way to do,

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,240
I had a fuck is nobody giving you a shot?
I don't know.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,190
You know why you're not white
like me. Um, I gotta be honest,

28
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,240
before where I did this,
you know,

29
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:45,480
I was looking up like videos and all
that type of stuff to make sure I got

30
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,210
something to talk about. So
it doesn't become this, like,

31
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,030
my biggest fear with these interviews
is it's just gonna become this horrific

32
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:54,180
staring contest because I'm
such a huge fan of what you do.

33
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:59,070
And I had never seen the, uh, the Irish
when Ari Shaffir was hosting the show.

34
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:03,900
Uh, this isn't happening. When
you told that whole story about,

35
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,650
uh,

36
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,040
being in the gang and fight and the
guy biting his air off and shit,

37
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,000
it's just like, like I was listening
to that, that story. It was like,

38
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:17,001
this is like at least three different
Tarantino movies and then you ended it and

39
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,060
just such a nice place. I don't want
to force you to tell the story again,

40
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,630
but if you could just recap mine.

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,550
Um, I like to start by where did you grow?
I grew up in Boyle Heights, California,

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,300
Los Angeles, but east la,
but he called Boyle Heights.

43
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,980
East la is like further east,
east.

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,760
I love that. Engineers, you know,
is by almost close to Monterey Park,

45
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,450
but Boyle heights in the neighborhood.
Right, right. How far away is that?

46
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,440
To put it in white perspective. How far
away is that from the staples center? Ooh.

47
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,840
If I were to walk it'll
take me like an hour.

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,160
And so if you were to drive
probably 50 minutes with him.
He's minutes. Okay, cool.

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,980
A 30 minute bus ride.
Okay. 30 minute bus ride.

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,470
So you grew up, uh, what,
what, what decade? You were a
child of what? You're the 80s

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,700
and we're been 80. So that was
the real deal. Yeah. I grew up in,

52
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:10,430
my neighborhood was in
the housing projects,

53
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,290
Pico Gardens and the one like
three separate out in projects.

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,310
Those Aliso village peak or at least so
and then Pico Gardens from first street

55
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:23,870
to like sixth street. Okay.
And there was like say man,

56
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,480
it was like a shit load of gangs.
Like maybe 11.

57
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,560
How did you, now, when you're not
in a gang and you're a young kid,

58
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,550
how do you negotiate?
Like I got to get from my house.

59
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,570
I gotta go pick up my, my fuck, I got to
go do my laundry. I got to go to school.

60
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:43,040
How do you negotiate? Uh, is
it, uh, now our gangs 24, seven.

61
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,030
Oh Yeah, man, the 2,400
neighborhood, there were 24, seven I,

62
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,030
how we start that came out around five,

63
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:53,090
like anybody with like just
live in a regular lifestyle,

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
goes to bed and then they just kind
of give up this, the area. Yeah.

65
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,270
Then those gangs,
they come on at five.

66
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,440
They're let the gangs that there are
still living in a gentrified neighborhood.

67
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,750
Okay. They don't come on a data, they
might call the cops on them. Oh yeah.

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,330
Remember most guys, you know from
Echo Park, they come on at night, man.

69
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,180
Robbing people. Really? Yeah. They
come on at night. Those guys were,

70
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,550
were those jetro vacation?

71
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:20,551
Those gangs are still around but they
come on at night and the gang bangers,

72
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,640
different areas, you know. But there's
still gang banging. They don't have yet.

73
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,800
How old were you the
first time you got mugged?

74
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,600
I got mugged the first time when I
was like 18 years old. My friend,

75
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:34,150
I'm coco. That's pretty good math. Yeah,

76
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:39,151
I got all the 18 downtown crossing when
I was like in eighth grade that I was

77
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:40,240
like,

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,830
I was selling crack on my first day like
that where they one hour I got robbed.

79
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,940
Somebody put a knife behind my back
under the knife in my like in front of me

80
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,220
and they took all my crack away.
Tacony crack away.

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,810
So then what do you have to do?
Oh,

82
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,770
I have to go back to the guy who gave it
to me or a friend of mine who I grew up

83
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:00,250
with and you know he passed away already
because they used to call them cocoa

84
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,440
and we grew up together. Him and I
were, I'm from second grade to adults.

85
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,460
I needed money at the time I got somebody
pregnant and I didn't know how to make

86
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:14,140
money. So I asked him for a
job in the criminal business,

87
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,370
can I, you know, hey man, I had
no money. How does that go down?

88
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,290
You'd probably avoid it. It's like
I don't want to sell drugs, but I,

89
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,930
I kind of have to now I got a kid comment,
so help me.

90
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,590
So he gave me like $100 of crack,
you know,

91
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,580
a hundred to bring me back a hundred
they didn't give you more to sell.

92
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,830
So as soon as I got out, they didn't
know who I was in that neighborhood.

93
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,800
They just came around me
and he took all my stuff.

94
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,000
They didn't hurt me or anything.

95
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,830
I was begging for my just can I
keep my id and the Game Id Alec did.

96
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,550
How scared I was scared. I thought they
were going to kill me right there. I was,

97
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,890
I felt like oh young. I was really scared
but I'll calm, you know, I wouldn't like,

98
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,230
uh, all right, just take your man, just
take your, leave me alone, you know,

99
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,030
just walked out of I take it,

100
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,330
I didn't fight him or nothing cause I
knew they would have killed me or stab me

101
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,590
or worse.

102
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,750
So went back to my friend Coco and I
told him what happened and I thought,

103
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,230
you know, he was going to be okay
man. You know it's all right.

104
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,500
You know it's your fault. It
happens. It happens. No Man man,

105
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,650
that night escalate it like it took it,

106
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,660
he gave you the crack
and I go on midnight,

107
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,280
I go rather than one 30 at two 30 in
the morning and back at his house. What?

108
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,030
Who robbed you? Cause so what
happened? He gave me a gun,

109
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,110
he gave me a pistol, he got himself
a pistol and he, and he put a,

110
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,120
a blue handkerchief on his head and he
put a black beanie on and we both were

111
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,090
looking for those guys.

112
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,330
And you must have been praying to God
like I didn't want to murder somebody the

113
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:51,430
first, Oh hell yeah. Mel Praying,
please don't find it guys. Wow. Cause I,

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,270
there I was like,
I would've probably with done anything,

115
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:57,080
he would have told me all the vulnerable.
I was weak, you know I have no,

116
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,340
I didn't know what to do.

117
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,340
So we went together and we saw one guy
that saw what happened but he didn't do

118
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:08,990
anything and, and then like he kinda
like hit him real hard. And who did it?

119
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:12,110
Man where the ad then I say manual
is in here, man. It wasn't him.

120
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,560
So it wasn't him. Wait, how did
Danny, so you go, oh there's,

121
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,010
I remember that guy standing
there watching me get broad.

122
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,550
Now this poor pastor to gets dragged into,
which he gets dragged into anything.

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,430
He got like, he got a gun
slap, you know by my friend.

124
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,310
He's my friend name and no question,
he just hit him in the face hard man.

125
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:34,100
And like he started to believe, I
mean the year and I just say, wow man.

126
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:38,060
He was looking at me like, come on man,
please tell them what they mean to you.

127
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,960
Wait until after the pistol slap. I meant
meant to tell you this. It wasn't him.

128
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,500
So we got nothing happened to him and
we went back and later on those guys who

129
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:52,110
actually did it, walked back
and gave it back or everything.

130
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,610
Get back to crack to that
guy and everything was cool
because of what he has to

131
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,100
have. Sorry, we didn't know that
they were afraid of that guy. Yeah.

132
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:03,460
So we didn't know Batman. We're with
you. We should street nickname. Yeah.

133
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,260
So then after that then they
knew that you were with him.

134
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,870
So then people stop fucking with you.
People Start Messing with me. Yeah.

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,910
Jesus Christ.

136
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:14,150
This is what kills me about you is you
have like a thousand of those stories and

137
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:18,470
you're the most relaxed,
laid back guy ever.

138
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,140
Like where did it all go?
Because due to I look at me,

139
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,800
I sound like I lived your life and
you sound like you lived my life.

140
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,370
Like you sound like you grew up in a
nice little cul de sac area and played

141
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,680
street hockey and I'm all fucking
wound up. How did you do that? Well,

142
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,120
I have a mom.
I have parents,

143
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,810
I have my mom and dad and most of my
crazy friends in the projects, you know,

144
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,650
the crazier ones, they didn't
have a mom and dad. Right.

145
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,590
They had nobody telling him you better
come home early or there was nobody

146
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,440
telling those kids to come home and
the lights go on in the streets.

147
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,800
So they had no really nobody telling
them what to do, how to live. Right.

148
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,970
No discipline.

149
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,990
I have my mom and dad mom and worked
and my mom stood up on my work that a

150
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,610
elementary school and then be home from
selling crack when the streetlights came

151
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:06,810
on. Right? Yeah, yeah, you had that.
And I've always that family foundation,

152
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,720
but I've always out. But I don't
get that. I just now you're talking,

153
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,411
you got a home life,

154
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:13,170
but you're telling you you're doing
all this other shit will know the kid.

155
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:17,820
You know when I was like 13, 12, 14
years old, I wasn't crazy. Oh, I see.

156
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,870
Crazy. After high school, that's the
one pregnant. I didn't know what to do,

157
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,180
but it was always like
a little hustler man.

158
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,390
My mom will saw a bond and I
will collect the money for her.

159
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,940
He knows who I learned how
to collect money for people,

160
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:34,440
at least from my mom was always
telling, um, herbal life, a bond.

161
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,940
She was always studying something.

162
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,790
Can we live by the warehouses in
downtown la where the factories are Rad,

163
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,650
where other trucks will come in and pick
up stuff on the trains and take them to

164
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:44,484
like stores.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So when Mama knew where like we used to
go to this one factory and we used to,

166
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:55,380
um, put a bunch of that synthetic
cotton, the plastic one,

167
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,490
they will throw it away. And my mom and
I will put it in bags, like hefty bags.

168
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,310
And then we go to another place where
they will throw these raggedy old sheets.

169
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,600
And then my mind was so those raggedy old
sheets with the cotton and then we'll,

170
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,730
we'll, we'll, we'll door to Dell
door to door in the housing projects,

171
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:14,790
selling pillows.

172
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,230
So you guys were real green family man.
You were there, you were there. Recycling.

173
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,580
That's wonderful thing.
We've sold,

174
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:29,000
we've borrowed the trash and we
sold it like we've so pillows.

175
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,220
I used to when I was like 14,

176
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,750
I used to walk to Delta
to do with pallets.

177
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,140
Would you build a little house and then
sell that? No, that's too much work.

178
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,260
I want to, we want fast
money. Oh, okay. Cash.

179
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,410
Although there's a bunch of
batteries where I live, you know,

180
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,530
I felt like I felt like Henry
Hill from Goodfellas, right.

181
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:52,070
Because they were always stealing stuff
from the airport and we always taking

182
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:54,920
stuff from these factories.
I wasn't stealing from these batteries.

183
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,810
My friends where I was taking
stuff in the trash like, um,

184
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,050
though there was a watermelon factory and
they will throw away run water matters

185
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,960
and I will get the watermelons
and clinicians, watermelon,

186
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,080
they make waterman grew them.

187
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,110
Know that they were getting from
the farmer I guess. And they right.

188
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,520
They would hold them there.
They have pallets full of watermelon from,

189
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,090
cause there's like a grocery area of
downtown la where every grocer oh gets all

190
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,560
this other stuff. Flowers, stereos,
you know, you name it bananas.

191
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,760
I know where everything is that suits
you. Cheap suits. I know everything's at.

192
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,480
So we'll get the wanting to hang out
with and just go to the dumpsters and

193
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,850
whenever they threw out you
would then go sell. Yeah,

194
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,150
I will cut that water money to have
and then go sell it to the Mexicans.

195
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,840
They laborers,
everybody working in the factories.

196
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,940
Much a bunch of immigrants.
Right.

197
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,430
And always thought though the
half a watermelon for a dollar,

198
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:54,431
$2 five I'll just cut
the running piece off.

199
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,970
You know what I mean? Oh it once
in a while. Nobody is looking.

200
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,050
I will stay in my little home girl.
This girl,

201
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:01,630
the little less well should a lesbian now,

202
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:04,180
but we didn't know she was a lesbian now.
She was like a tomboy.

203
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,530
I was sending her in there
with my brother and then went.

204
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,590
There was like when they were,
everybody was looking,

205
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,600
they would throw good
watermen in the trashcan too,

206
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,280
so we had to make sure of
good and bad water, mountains.

207
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,010
How long did you stay in that whole world
is selling crack and all of that and

208
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:21,250
and all those fights and bite and
the guy's ear off and all that shit.

209
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,380
Before you became a comedian,
like how long,

210
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,670
how long was that period of your life?

211
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,830
That was my period of from 18
years old to like 21 and a half,

212
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,450
21 and a half because at 21 is when
I was like messing up already man.

213
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,390
I was like,
I'm smoking a lot of PCP.

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,980
That was like my drug of choice
for the time being and man,

215
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:46,570
I used to get all crazy, see PCP and like
I think it's an elephant tranquilizer.

216
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,650
That's what the people tell me.
I saw he's here that grown a PCP,

217
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:55,300
angel dust and all that and angel angel
does is like coming crystallized PCP.

218
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,620
You could put it in a cigarette
but PCP in my neighborhood,

219
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,520
we were at the PCP capitol,
the of Los Angeles,

220
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:07,570
like in my neighborhood they sold
gallons of it. People had to,

221
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,561
they would have,

222
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:13,090
I'm sparkers water full of
PCP so everybody had PCP.

223
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,220
Wait a minute. And you how did, how
did you ingest it? You smoked it.

224
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,260
No you did like a,
I'm giving away secrets here.

225
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,590
I'll tell you why I'm asking.
Cause everybody tries to act like,

226
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,850
oh you understand all no man,
I don't know any of that stuff.

227
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,060
You will get a Newport cigarette.
Oh for real menthol cigarette,

228
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,190
a new port and then you put you or you
and you dip it instead like a little jar.

229
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,480
Like I'm just the tip and
that's a $5 tip as a $5 dip.

230
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,960
He did put again at 10 you dip
a whole one is 20 you know, you,

231
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,300
you soak it is $30 and it's by
Deb. You know. Now I get it.

232
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,410
That's like when I drank booze,

233
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:53,400
there's like the 10 year old
shit that you're only up to 25.

234
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,030
Then you get into the cognacs and
that can be like, I dunno, like a fun,

235
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,420
I don't know. Wines and shit could
be like a century or older some.

236
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,130
So there's one night I was smoking PC
just cause I'm stupid as hell when it

237
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:06,760
comes to it. So what is it?
What's that highlight is mad.

238
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,230
It's like you're the incredible hoke.
Oh, if somebody attacks you, oh,

239
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:14,370
this is a shit when like five cops up
and they got to see that I've marked,

240
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,880
did you see that Charles Bronson movie?
There's worse three. One white boy,

241
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:23,570
like a surf fourth. He's been,
he's fighting other police
officers. He's on PCP. Oh,

242
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,760
okay. I got to rewatch that. Yeah,
about PCB. You take, you have, um,

243
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,800
like incredible host strength, but you
just have like, you don't feel pain,

244
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,580
but while people are hitting you, man,
you could just keep attacking forever.

245
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:37,360
You know what I mean?
Right.

246
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,210
And then the next morning you wake up
and you feel like you played 12 years in

247
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,740
the NFL. Yeah, man. Alright,

248
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,820
so the first time you smoked
PCP and that shit hits you,

249
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,450
it's like literally like you're turning
into like a superhero. Yeah, man.

250
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,180
Well, the one time, when did you do,
did you try to bend something? Nah,

251
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,710
that's what I was taught. Cops. No,
no, that's what I would've done it.

252
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,950
I want to try to pull something off
the fucking wall a bit ago. The Rona,

253
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,560
well when I, when they work in a row,
I'll be coming to be known as Batman.

254
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,900
You know, he's crazy. We'll chop.
We're here. Why did they call you?

255
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:16,640
Why did they call you Batman? Cause um,
I love Batman and I used to wear my, my,

256
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,650
those um, superhero on
the rules and 18. Yeah,

257
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,460
man.
Well the Batman shirts still fit,

258
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,050
so I wore it and I don't know where
to go to a Batman shirt anywhere else.

259
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,300
It was the underoos factory
right down the street.

260
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,520
It took it out of the dumps to the
bad projects. Yeah. That's amazing.

261
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,400
All right, so you don't
want all that. I'm watching,

262
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,440
I'm driving the theater with my friends
smoking PCP watching terminator two

263
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,070
asking what I was saying.
I'd fight that guy. Yeah man.

264
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,540
And I'm thinking about the guy that
bullied me for the last two weeks.

265
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,570
So I go wait,

266
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,240
if you smoke that she say say a guy views
I fuck I shouldn't do this cause I'm

267
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,810
like doing a commercial here for the
drug sane is somebody bullying you.

268
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,370
You can't beat that guy.
Right.

269
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:05,810
If you were to smoke some PCP it
definitely would give you the belief.

270
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,570
But can it overcome how slow you are
and your inability to slip a punch in or

271
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,270
you just walked through his shit? Yeah
man, you're throwing punches. Cause um,

272
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,240
when I, when I got into a
fight with his guys, I will,

273
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,700
they told me I was doing things
though I remember doing that.

274
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:24,020
They told me that took my belt off
in a whipping them all over the,

275
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,470
we keep alluding to the story. You got to
tell the story, right? So you're Batman,

276
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,740
you got on your under roofs,
you smoked PCP at the driving.

277
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,960
He saw the terminator two
when I left the Terminator two movie,

278
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,530
I come back into a project and I see
this guy that he looked like an old dude,

279
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,280
man. He's like 30 years old. He just came
out of prison. He don't know who I am.

280
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,060
He's like calling me bad names and um,

281
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,770
pushing me and pushing me and I, I want
to fight him pushing me. They finally,

282
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:54,760
I socked him in the face
but I kind of missed that.

283
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:58,430
He hit me right in the eye and he hit
me hard and my, I got black right away.

284
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,750
He punched me in the pace. I started
bleeding. Then he started choking me.

285
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,290
So when he started choking me,
that's when I like, I went crazy.

286
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,520
I went crazy man. I lifted
him up, dropped him, period.

287
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,780
I bet his dear our first of our period,

288
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,630
the era of malware at the whole Kogan
retire brother, let me ask you this,

289
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:20,750
when you build a zero, if we were
underneath, are you on top of him?

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,780
I was like underneath him,
he was choking me and you just,

291
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:28,770
all of a sudden that PCP, I paid it off,
man. I never thought mass gain his solos.

292
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,190
Easy to bite off and spin. Crochet. No,

293
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,053
not even man.

294
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,870
I spit it out and I started punching
him and then my friends told me that um,

295
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,740
wait, what did he do? Or May
took the hits like a soldier.

296
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,470
So when you bend his ear off,
this guy [inaudible] he's,

297
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,590
he's screaming like a little
girl. Okay. Do you think pain?

298
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,850
So actually he's kind of screaming like
a guy who got his ear bit off point.

299
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,080
I think you're still a man if you,

300
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,930
if you go up a few octaves when
you're missing a fucking year.

301
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,020
But I don't know why. I believe
the Arab, I mean I had no,

302
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,360
I get the handle of choice,
you know, he was choking me.

303
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,690
Sounded like that was the move.
No one helping me. He wasn't,

304
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:08,740
didn't seem like he was going to be
stopping. All right. See you beat,

305
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,440
then you took your belt off and you were,

306
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,370
my friends told me that I took him my
belt off and I thought it were whipping

307
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:18,780
him. Like he will like chasing them
with a bout whipping them like,

308
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,420
like he was like, oh, runaway
property or something.

309
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,740
And how many people are witnessing
this? I think it's wild. 15 people,

310
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,740
but they're all like cheering
me on, cheering here, Mar.

311
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,780
Nobody's helping Denomie hits that
would get like nowadays if they were to,

312
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,830
that would be, that wouldn't be
like, it would be epic PCP guy,

313
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,610
epic belt guy. They'd be something
like that or been a rap song. Autotune

314
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,100
man, we're, yeah, so wait a
minute. So when you, so you
don't remember doing that.

315
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:51,190
So there was like, oh fuck,
this guy's going to kill me.

316
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,320
Then you start to bite his
ear off. You're like, wow,

317
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:55,210
here's come off really easily.

318
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,700
Then you sort of blackout and then like
when you just sorta came to with like

319
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:03,620
blood all over, you going
like, uh, the nicest seat,

320
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,680
a hot dog or something together.
Next day I wake up,

321
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,430
the next day I'm walking around,
it's like a seven in the morning,

322
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,810
eight in the morning. I don't know, man.
I'm looking at, my body is full of blood,

323
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,340
my pants, my face. You know my, I have a
black guy, my shirt, it's full of blood.

324
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,360
I have no idea what happened.
I have no idea what happened.

325
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,050
You probably thought it was your
blood. I didn't know that. Whoa man.

326
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,370
I was like checking steel. I got shot
or stabbed by somebody they didn't know.

327
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,640
Then my friends told me what happened
and the guy was in the house,

328
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,540
he went to the hospital for
like a broken ribs missing,

329
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,470
missing an ear, you know, where he's
just putting neosporin on that has it.

330
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,760
And they went to,

331
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,540
he was laying in bed and they asked him
if you want to press charges, you know,

332
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,880
cause everybody know there was witnesses.
Everybody knew who did it. And um,

333
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,470
he said, no, we're going to handle
the right way. And I was like, oh,

334
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,290
I didn't even know. No, there's a little
later on, like a week later you go,

335
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,790
yeah man, I think there's like
a green light on you right now.

336
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,420
And the mean like green light. What
do you mean green light? Yeah man.

337
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,190
Shoot to kill and they see you.

338
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,580
What the fuck. So that's the first
time you ever heard that. So now what?

339
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:19,640
Now what do you do besides not go outside?
Do they know where you live?

340
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,390
They know where I live, but I don't
know. He's still in the hospital though,

341
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:26,170
but everything's calm, you
know. But he's doing a hospital.

342
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:31,171
But I can feel tension from people who
are who I thought were my friend one time

343
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,120
who had, who I grew up with, you know,
you know they were turning on me like,

344
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,410
cause I would never in their gang,
I was in another gang.

345
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,880
When you watch the wire, do you like
fall asleep as it like boring to you?

346
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,870
Because you don't need to.
You lift it. So I'm like,

347
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,970
it sounds like an

348
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,630
award winning series to me. I'm more like
blood in blood out. So wait a minute.

349
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:55,030
So now, now there's a
green light on you. Yeah.

350
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:58,510
And think at some point you got to go
outside to get food because you're hungry.

351
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,710
Yeah. So I'm going to take, when you
have a green light on you in, in East La,

352
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:05,080
what's a good time to go out to?
If you've got to go hit,

353
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,440
hit the Mayfair market or whatever.
What's it called? Man Do. And you know,

354
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,520
when you have a green light
and in from anybody, you know,

355
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:17,030
whether it comes from prison or ever
come from just the neighborhood,

356
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:22,010
it's just relieve man, move
somewhere safe. Like Modesto.

357
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,340
What's a more serious greenlight?

358
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,830
If it came from prison or from the
neighborhood? And if it come from prison,

359
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,730
you're a dead man man. I mean there's
nowhere to go. They're nowhere to go, man.

360
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:38,450
And um, I read about these things,
you know, on kind of it on books.

361
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,610
There's no way coming back from that.

362
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,850
But then it was like only like a green
light from his neighborhood. You know,

363
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:48,430
let's go to the mall, like the Grove, pick
a really white mall. And you know what?

364
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,260
All those thoughts came to my
mind at that time. Like, man,

365
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,190
I wish I would like the
fresh prince of Bel Air.

366
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,650
I wish that a rich white guy didn't
take a rich white guy or a wish. Fuck,

367
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,260
you're Mexican guy. Oh No, wait.
They weren't wearing that show.

368
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:03,140
That was different strokes, those
different struggles. But to drumming,

369
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,050
they switched it up. They're
like, it's different strokes.

370
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,040
Except the marathon allowed into right
now. Yeah. That's what they over there.

371
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:14,490
They always do that shit. So my
mom called out farther. Greg Boyle.

372
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,160
He's like this priest that I
grew up with in the neighborhood.

373
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,170
He's from the homeboy industries
hearing our name. That's a thing.

374
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,670
Yeah, he helps. He helps them. Gang
members. That's a cool name. All right.

375
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:30,570
Father Greg Boyle, he'd like a
priest from my neighborhood and um,

376
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,620
he's always helped the neighborhood.
Like he will go on his way to help people.

377
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,640
He was like, if he like if
he's driving and then you like,

378
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,960
he will pick up kids that were drunk
off the streets and take him home.

379
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,010
He did that a couple of times for me.
In a good way. In a good way. Yeah.

380
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:51,060
Like if you're a gay member in the wrong
neighborhood and then you know you're

381
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:51,894
pretty much,

382
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,290
someone's going to kill you in that
neighborhood for the great boy would tell

383
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,600
you, get in a van. I think
you're back home as a, as,

384
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:02,840
as a gang member, how do you end up in
the wrong neighborhood other than a woman,

385
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,210
a man on PCP, the Goddamn PCP. There's no,

386
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,520
there's no heroin in your neighborhood.
So nothing there.

387
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,840
Go buy heroin or somewhere else, you know,
there's no crack in the neighborhood.

388
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,660
You know, there's, it's a dry spell
somewhere and you've got to get high,

389
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:20,310
so you got to go to another neighborhood
and buy it. Oh God. Oh, you have a,

390
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,370
and so how did they know you
were in a different gang?

391
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:26,410
You don't go over there wearing your
whole, your colors. Right. Most of the,

392
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,830
the hardcore gang members, they
were the colors, man. They,

393
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,170
they're not going to stop
wearing their colors. Yeah. Boy,

394
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,470
they're now on the cover there 24 seven.
But I was one,

395
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,400
I wasn't even one of those guys.
I was nothing like that.

396
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:42,910
It was just a guy who will just
hanging around with these kids.

397
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,980
And the one thing I get jumped
into a gang and I'm getting

398
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,210
into so much trouble,

399
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:52,211
but I don't no idea to get beaten into a
gang just in case I ever fucked my life

400
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,370
up and I go to prison,
you know when I go to prison,

401
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:58,520
my only hope is I got to
join the area and Nazi guys,

402
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,290
I can listen to their bullshit and
pretend I believe it just to save myself.

403
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,810
How long is that beat though?

404
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,360
Um, well in, in, in the
streets it will be like,

405
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,590
I guess whatever number the gang is.

406
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,500
So with 18th street you going to get
beat up for 18 seconds. That's it. Yeah.

407
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,930
Or, but I mean, how many guys are
all of them? Oh Jesus. Okay. Fuck.

408
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,230
Can I strike thing? That's
it from the record there.
Because when I got jumped in,

409
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,650
I was just hanging out man. Like I was
just hanging out and then somebody said,

410
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,780
I'm a man, you want to get jumped in. And
I wasn't going to say no. If I say no,

411
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:39,290
I'm a punk, I'm gonna get jumped in.
I'm going to get Joe for being a punk.

412
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,780
So I said, fuck it, let's do it.

413
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,840
And then I punched the guy
next to me for no reason. Well,

414
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,950
because I want to prove that I'm, I'm,
I'm tough. So the guy next to him,

415
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,670
I just knocked him out with one punch man.
And then I hit like,

416
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,030
he wasn't even looking. I said, let's
do this. And then like I hit him. Right.

417
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:59,310
You know,
you gotta be really big dog to look

418
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,190
God homie. They said Warren Sapp moment.
Keep your head on a swivel. Look good.

419
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,320
I bet he get the other
guy shit later. Like, Hey,

420
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:08,790
next time you're going to jump somebody.
Yeah.

421
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,660
Can you not say what I'm sitting
right next to you knew he was a lefty.

422
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:17,661
What the fuck you get beat up and I
got a job by everybody that one in and

423
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,580
they're, did you get more than one
ended? You get one. I've got two in one,

424
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,780
him and another guy.

425
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:26,670
But then after that I felt like
Nike cortex all over my face.

426
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,780
So you just laying on the ground and
you just go at one Mississippi two.

427
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:37,470
We're just waiting for this reign of,
of footlocker to stop coming down on you.

428
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,130
Yeah, man. I was like, I tried to never
going to stop, man. So what do you do?

429
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,910
I would just, Oh, they're funny. They
still all right. Hit enough, hit enough.

430
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,360
Then everybody's hugging me. The same
people that were beating my brains up.

431
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,320
We're hugging me and kissing me.
You'll, I love you. You're my boy.

432
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:54,300
You're my family now.
And they're like, wow.

433
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,940
So then you come home. Okay.
And then you just sit in there,

434
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,510
all right with Huc and sneaker mocks all
over you and you're going like, okay,

435
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:09,130
now I guess I'm in a
gang. Jesus Christ. Okay.

436
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:11,500
So then what happens?
Um,

437
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,680
I thought what happened was I started
hanging around with white people.

438
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:17,950
Talk about white privilege going to, what
the fuck is that? This is what it is.

439
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,020
Totally.
Yes.

440
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,740
It can sit there selling lemonade at the
end of your driveway and accidentally,

441
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,220
did I just join a gang? There
was, there's a green light on you.

442
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,670
You were selling lemonade at
the end of the wrong driveway

443
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,000
neighborhood. Okay. Was dumb.

444
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,740
But you know like there was two white
boys in my neighborhood that were gangs

445
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,930
was one the red headed
kid from children of the,

446
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,680
exactly. He was. He was.
He said, well the one guy,

447
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,840
he was a blood actually guy. He was
from east La. Slow man. Econom okay.

448
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,680
Those are, those are actually two
white boys had offensive by the way,

449
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,930
but continued.
There was two white boys in the hood man.

450
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:01,260
And they were both gangbangers and one
thing about bought white boy Cholos like

451
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,520
when you see a white boy join a gang and
when you see a white guy that someone

452
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:07,890
like you and you're hanging around
with them, nothing but Mexicans,

453
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,930
white white guys are the
most craziest gangsters.

454
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,860
When they were in a Mexican gang and
they do stuff that a Mexican man would

455
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:21,330
never think of. Like I remember this
one white guy, slow man. He was a blood.

456
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,430
He said, man, let's go do
a home invasion. And I,

457
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,600
and everybody was asking him
where he goes, my mom house.

458
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,730
Oh, he wanted a home game.
All right, that's not right.

459
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,980
And he wanted them,
he wanted the Ibrance,

460
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,700
the other homeys to rob his house
because he wanted his mom and dad to get

461
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,860
robbed. Why? Cause I don't know

462
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,860
man. They're probably saying stop hanging
out with all those Mexicans, his idea.

463
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,140
And I was like, Damn. So they
probably behave that way. Cause they,

464
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,380
they felt no matter what, they had
to constantly proof, constantly men,

465
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,800
because technically they could
just get a haircut or whatever,

466
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:02,360
put away the flannel and just slip, slip
away, man. Slip away down at the Grove,

467
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,900
slip away,
become a social worker and that'll be it.

468
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,050
So how long were you when this gang for,
and did you ever get beaten out?

469
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,610
No, I was in his gang, um, when
I'm father Greg Boyle and a,

470
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:16,980
but they go to the year off. I went
to Rehab. My Father Greg Boyle,

471
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:21,180
took me to rehab and I'm, I, I
disappeared for, I'm still gone.

472
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,670
I never went back. Oh, he never went back
or when you get beaten out of a gang,

473
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,100
how uh, how long has that beat
though? As long as they want to. Um,

474
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,550
I knew what we had. I had a guy in
the podcast named Fabian who was in a,

475
00:28:36,551 --> 00:28:40,230
in a gang and he talks about
he got beat up, beat out.

476
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,860
He got jumped out and he said that when
he got jumped, they just last longer.

477
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,151
But I'm,

478
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:50,151
his uncle is doing the gang simple
expression is doing the gang.

479
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:56,901
So his uncle over saw him getting jumped
out so he didn't get hurt that bad.

480
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,630
Uh,
I don't have a no go.

481
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,330
I probably would have got killed if I
got jumped out with him when I was 20

482
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,440
white version of that
is our dad's the judge,

483
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,560
so we don't go to jail or
whatever the fuck we just did.

484
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,240
Your version is that you got an uncle
that overseas being jumped out? Yeah,

485
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,890
I got tagged to it. I'm, I'm learning
all kinds of stuff. Like I wonder,

486
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,350
I don't know my case, somebody
just walking by somebody recorder.

487
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,340
So he's feels weird to have
to like re hype something.

488
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:27,341
So your special on HBO that you shot
yourself learning all of your do it

489
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:31,130
yourself stuff from fucking
going around in those warehouses,

490
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:36,140
making pillows out of nothing. You
ended up shooting and said, uh, the, uh,

491
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,050
the Improv in San Jose, which is one of
my favorite color and then a great club.

492
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:41,620
Cause you feel like you're doing a
theater even though even it's a club,

493
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,483
it's tremendous.

494
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,020
And a,
you shot it there.

495
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,770
It's going to be on Hbo September 30th
at 10 o'clock called translate this.

496
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,210
Now are you, I know you're a
great joke writer, but you,
uh, I saw an Irish affairs,

497
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,540
you told that and he told the amazing
story that you, you touched on today. Um,

498
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,640
is your standup style on this more joke
telling, more storytelling or both?

499
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,870
You know what my common special
is? It's more about, um,

500
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,470
it's more about how I got to this country
with my parents and I'm being as a

501
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:14,870
single father and being a cheater.

502
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,850
But yeah, I cheat a lot.
I get caught, cheat,

503
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,790
cheating all the time.
I'm bad. I can't help it.

504
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,160
I love women.

505
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,460
I tell her about getting caught
cheating because I will cut cheating.

506
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,680
You Know Bert? Both girls
showed up to my house. Oh God.

507
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,020
You know what I mean? Aliyah in a
man. It was crazy and he asked me,

508
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,520
are going to save for yourself?
How long have you made?

509
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,440
How long was that beat down? Was that
long in 18 seconds. It was crazy.

510
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,020
They showed up in the same car. Oh they,
they talked to each other. Yeah, man.

511
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,520
On how they film it and Shit.

512
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,860
And then you go in there and then you're
going to do like an apology and all

513
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:02,570
that shit though. First
48 yeah. Wow. Okay,

514
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,610
so you got to do it. I can't wait
to see this photo, Michelle. I see.

515
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,900
I really honestly do.
All right,

516
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,330
stand up comedian. I cannot
wait to see this. Thank you.

517
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:12,800
One of the most interesting dudes.
How are you so fucking happy?

518
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,630
Go lucky. I don't get it. I don't know
much. I love life. You know, I'm never,

519
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,980
I'm never going to go back
to that type of life though,

520
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,910
that I had in my twenties.
And I'm just love living life man.

521
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:26,400
And I'm not going to say
that I'm perfect because I'm,

522
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:29,760
I did fall off two hours
where after I went to Rehab,

523
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,890
I was sober for 11 years. I didn't touch
no drugs. I didn't trust no alcohol,

524
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:37,620
no beer or nothing. But, um,

525
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,120
along the way you know that the more that
the standup comedy, the more you know,

526
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,110
I did it. I'm not going nowhere.
I went back to smoking crack.

527
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,630
She went right back to crack. She
never really wear a booze guy, huh? No,

528
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,870
it's probably an on
booze. And he said, dude,

529
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,160
it's like Ralphie may retweeted
my tweet the other night and I'm,

530
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:03,030
I don't understand what he meant at
first because I was in Houston and he

531
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:07,470
retweeted, um, what cha
full of spoons, bro.

532
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,550
And then I, what the hell is Rafi? We're
talking about them spools. Then I say,

533
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:16,530
Oh shit,
I got so coked out in Houston,

534
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:21,170
Texas. I, I, they known for that day.

535
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,610
I couldn't do no more coke
and my nose was bleeding,

536
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,500
so I wanted to rocket up and smoking
crack instead. You know, cause I want to,

537
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,280
Oh see you just like, I'm
just going to snort a couple
of lines. Yeah, but did you,

538
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,220
did you anticipate like,
we were like, fuck this,

539
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:40,221
when I go to Houston I'm going to party
or was was it just a spontaneous thing

540
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,880
and all of a sudden you just said,
fuck it. Oh Man, I was over there.

541
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,130
I'll working the last stop in Houston.

542
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,680
Shut out to Pete [inaudible] book in me,

543
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,610

got, I've got, I started party man.

544
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,750
I uh, I started partying and I
couldn't find no powder, no coke.

545
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,490
So I'm, I hope you don't mind me Italian
dude. But I call it with Joel Diaz. I say,

546
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:07,580

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,590
Ah,

550
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,930
I wrote that grant. Joey. I know somebody.

551
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:21,110
Ah,

552
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,430
So I knew he knew somebody.
I know he, he, uh,

553
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,090
we go talk to this comedian.

554
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:33,300
So I spoke to this comedian and then I'm
this little Mexican food showed up all

555
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,030
week taking care of me.
I give them free tickets every day.

556
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,750
I think you and um,
I,

557
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,100
I don't know what happened man,
but I, I did too much coke.

558
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,900
I felt like I can't do no more code
through my nose, so I'm going to go bad.

559
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,500
I want to smoke crack now. You know
what I mean? I don't want to stay.

560
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:57,520
I want burgers now. Dude. A
reoccurring story with you is,

561
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,370
I don't know what happened last time.
He didn't know what happened.

562
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,780
You were whipping somebody with the belt.

563
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:05,340
Now you don't know what happened is like
a fucking hole in your nose. Jesus do.

564
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:09,420
Well, how long ago was this? This was
them 2006. All right, so you, okay,

565
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,730
so you broke your record.
You've gone, you've gone, it's
11. Yeah. Yeah. I called up,

566
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:17,200
um,
room service.

567
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,140
The one is more cracked and I call
it a committee of a color room.

568
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,230
Service Room Service.
I'm going to need,

569
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm a big spoon and a baking
soda brought over right now.

570
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,480
And they did not bring that to
the room. Oh, they brought it man,

571
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,530
they did two guys that brought
here the governor front dead.

572
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,480
He knew me cause I'm,
I made friends with him,

573
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:42,481
I already know from previous times and
he brought it and it was like a big spoon

574
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,540
and he brought the arm and hammer
baking soda. And the guy with him,

575
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,830
he just went with him to laugh
at me, I guess. He goes, Hey,

576
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,770
I guess he couldn't believe it.

577
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:54,570
You know this guy just order baking
soda and spoon. No Way. Let's go see.

578
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,410
So the bolt open a door. I they,
they give it to me. They both laugh.

579
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,760
But yeah, man, I wanted
to smoke crack. Okay, so,

580
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,070
and then, and then how long were you
off the wagon for? From when? Okay,

581
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:13,060
so you're sober for 11 years.
You go to Houston,

582
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,710
you order a spoon and some baking
soda and now you snort coke,

583
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:21,370
now you're smoking. I got you partied that
weekend. Did you just come back and go,

584
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,151
what the fuck was that?

585
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:24,690
And were you able to or did you
have to go to rehab and no man,

586
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,230
I continue party man from that moment
on and the grow with, with man,

587
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,980
she ended up being a hermaphrodite but
that was another story for another time,

588
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:37,850
you know? But yeah, sure.
The hermaphrodite she had,

589
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:39,840
you were born with a peanut,
then a vagina. Right?

590
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,590
So like how long was she your
girlfriend before you figured that out?

591
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,950
Well, we were part of that three
months. You must be a gentleman. Yes.

592
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,030
That's what it was. I was a
gentleman. I didn't want to touch her.

593
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,480
Nothing because she broke freak,
cold man. I can be that guy.

594
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,950
So I just kissed her a couple of times,
but then by the third night, you know,

595
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:03,090
we're, we're, oh for three nice to rate
her an I. But when I finally found out,

596
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:07,470
I was like, whoa man. Yeah, that's
a big skin tag you got there.

597
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,080
So it was that. So was that enough
to get your sober again? No, man.

598
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,340
I think he's sober again to a
2009 that stop sign. All right,

599
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:25,170
so now we're still going. I didn't
get sober till 2009. Oh fuck.

600
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,240
And you were already doing it.

601
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,680
So during those periods he was
still doing stand up and you won't

602
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,870
y'all doing standup?
I won't even know.

603
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I even got to go to Montreal
comedy festival in 2005 and um,

604
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,450
I was bad. I did the young
comedian show and I did well.

605
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,000
I guess I did well,
I got a little,

606
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,830
a little print on the Hollywood reporter.
I got an agent.

607
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,330
Uta,
actually

608
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,620
they didn't have any idea you were high.

609
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,160
No ma'am. I was on, I was smoking crack
in Montreal too. I hooked it up. I mean,

610
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:01,860
I found crack and Montreal.
It's funny,

611
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,890
I saw a Mexican guy in Montreal and I
knew he spoke Spanish and I told him,

612
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:10,830
man, could you tell him? I just could
tell him, man, he had the boots, you know,

613
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:15,030
he had that look like I need a job. You
know, I don't even know what that means.

614
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:18,990
It's hilarious. He got the boots,
you know, he had that look like I,

615
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,670
I just got here cross country.
So he spoke Spanish,

616
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,680
he spoke Spanish, no
English, but he does know,

617
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,090
he knows how to speak French now.
But with a Mexican, you know,

618
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:35,790
Mexican accent.
He was doing all the romantic languages.

619
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,870
Dawn bubble ball to Doug and he comes back

620
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,930
a romance languages.
Yeah, man. Crag. Well,

621
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,610
all right dude,
you are,

622
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,150
I could talk to you for like fucking
10 hours and you just don't run out.

623
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,520
It's amazing man. I don't have, thank God
you're still here. Oh, I'm sober. I know.

624
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,090
But all this stuff you've done,
you know,

625
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,560
like realistically you probably could
have died in 80% of the stories. You just,

626
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,440

Mvmt also known as movement.

00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:23,180
The company that started what was started
by two broke college kids that wanted

661
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:25,730
to wear stylish watches
but couldn't afford them.

662
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,090
They had no money at somehow
they started a watch company. Uh,

663
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,130
so they started their own watch company.
Um, how is this like how you started?

664
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,940
Well, I didn't have any money and

703
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,050
All right, that's it. Okay.
Stomach is growling here.

704
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,350
I'm still on my fucking
diet. Oh, Billy died.

705
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,990
Some fucking asshole sent
me a tweet going like,

706
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,670
you are obsessed with your fucking weight.
You look fine. Get help. It's like, dude,

707
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,990
that's why I look fine. You fucking moron.
You don't give a shit. You potato skins,

708
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:10,100
eating fat. Fuck these guys
with your thick fucking torsos.

709
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,150
You know what I mean?

710
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,750
Making that noise when you
reached back to get the seatbelt,

711
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,300
trying to pull it around
you running out of material.

712
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,850
I don't want to be that guy.
You know what I mean?

713
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,080
That guy who gets killed by his airbag
because his fat face is too close to the,

714
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,190
the miniature explosion. Um, anyways,

715
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,050
all things comedy festival by the
way, podcast festival, October 26th,

Ticket links@bird.com.
By the way,

718
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:44,261
I am going to do my first ever live Monday
morning podcast there at the standup

719
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:49,280
live, um, comedy club.
I'm going to do it live.

720
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,550
I'll do it live and I'm going to do
it just how I do it my fucking house.

721
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,850
All right. I thought about getting
a guest and I was like, fuck that.

722
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:59,540
That's not the Cham of what it is
that I do, so I'm just going to do it.

723
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,730
I Dunno what I'll lay down on the stage.

724
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:02,780
I don't know what the
fuck I'm going to do,

725
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,670
but I'm going to do it the exact way I do.

726
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:07,880
So if you ever wanted to see this
shit life, this absolute train wreck,

727
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:11,950
if you wanted to see what it looked
like in real time, come on down to uh,

728
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,520
the stand up live comedy club in Phoenix,
Arizona. October 28th. I will be there.

729
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,180
I don't know when tickets go on sale.
They aren't, I guess they're on sales now.

730
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,560
Their own ticket links for it. Bill
bird.com. There you go. All right. Um,

731
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,060
anyways, let's talk some NFL football.
Went back, got bad. Boonoo Beatty.

732
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,620
Did you guys enjoy it? Did your team. When

733
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,190
my team won the New England patriots,

734
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:38,520
who everybody said was going to go
undefeated and then we lost to the Kansas

735
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:42,180
city chiefs and then everybody said,
oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

736
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,990
I think Tom Brady is old now.
I think he's washed up.

737
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:50,280
I think the Kansas City chiefs are going
to win their first Superbowl since 1970

738
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,710
that's what everybody said,

739
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,450
because the Kansas City chiefs beat
the New England patriots in September.

740
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,800
Now all of a sudden they can see
January. How fucking crazy is that? Um,

741
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,260
how many fucking times?

742
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:07,170
How many times are you going to watch
the giants go into when Owen three and

743
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,410
just start writing them off. You
saw all the points they scored. Huh?

744
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,330
You think they're not going
to come back and beat Philly?

745
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,570
They're not going to come back and
be Dallas later on this fucking year.

746
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:17,070
When they all get on the same page.

747
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,720
They were protecting Eli much better
according to the 30 seconds of highlights

748
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:26,010
that I saw. I'm sticking by my
prediction. New England patriots,

749
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,960
New York giants, Superbowl
rematch. All right.

750
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,910
Until the Kansas City chiefs who I
actually like until Andy Reid, who,

751
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:40,250
I'm not saying he's fat until those
fuckers do something in January.

752
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,830
All right. I think all you
need to sit down a little bit.

753
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:49,480
If fucking relax with all your shit talk
and how many fucking guys have you seen

754
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,340
throw for 500 yards in the regular
season and get bounced out and the first

755
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:54,941
round of the playoffs,

756
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:58,090
how many times did you see a fucking
guy zigzagging all over the field?

757
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:00,220
You can't tackle them
and come playoff time.

758
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,670
He sitting on a fucking exercise
bike wearing a tinted windshield.

759
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,380
Crossed his eyes.
Huh?

760
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,380
The incredible lack of fucking respect
that you gave our little quarterback that

761
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:15,190
could Tom Brady. How
dare you? How dare you?

762
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,790
Right off the New England patriots
after one fucking week. Huh?

763
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,100
It's all wishful thinking.
What common again,

764
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,970
and we're going to take your hearts out
and we're going to pull them out of your

765
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:25,361
chest.

766
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:29,430
We're going to show him to you and then
we're going to under inflate them honor

767
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,020
away to another fucking, actually,
we never got caught doing that.

768
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,590
They just suggested that we did it
and they got laughed out of court. Um,

769
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,620
and then do what I really need to address.
Um,

770
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,950
these stupid controversy of the fucking
people taking a knee during the national

771
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:48,010
anthem. You know, watching all these white
people getting fucking upset by that.

772
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:48,701
Like it really does.

773
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:53,290
It really affect your fucking life and
all these fucking idiots trying to make

774
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,740
the point of what they're doing.
It's not about your point.

775
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,620
The people who started this thing,
it's about my point.

776
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,680
It's about the way that I see it. You
know, I had a buddy of mine go, yeah,

777
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:07,010
these fucking guys are making $1 million.
You know, he'd take his bad here.

778
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:10,250
Why don't you go fucking move to Syria?
It's like, why do they have to move?

779
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,530
Why can't they just live here the way
you do? I don't understand that dumb,

780
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,690
but Donald Trump is a fucking genius.

781
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:22,700
Daddy has everybody talking about
this issue because he is trying to get

782
00:47:22,701 --> 00:47:27,701
everybody to stop focusing on the pool
party he had with fucking Vladimir.

783
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:31,810
What's his face over there in Russia? He
doesn't want you watching that. He goes,

784
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,390
oh, look at this over here. Right?

785
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,410
He goes down to Alabama and he gets
all them fuck and paypal all riled up,

786
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,770
and he keeps talking about this
fatty over and fucking North Korea.

787
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,900
That's what he's still one. It reminds
me of when, oh, fucking slick Willie,

788
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,251
you know,

789
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:51,910
bombed that country because he stuck his
cigar and that woman's Nether region,

790
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,270
this is the type of sick people that
become president. This is what they do.

791
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,480
All right?
They get caught doing some fucked up shit.

792
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:01,360
And then I will say this about Trump
least they didn't go bomb. Some people,

793
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,060
unlike what's his face
with his bitch hands,

794
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:07,750
who now gets treated like a fucking hero.
I don't understand that guy at all.

795
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,910
You know what I mean? Ah Ha. Oh,
that's great. Oh, I got caught.

796
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,300
Get my Dick sucked on the overall office.
So I bombed a country.

797
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,830
I'm out of killed the baby, but
I sleep lock one every night. Um,

798
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,550
I know I'm a conspiracy theorist.
I fucking hate them all.

799
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,630
You just see that thing. Uh,
what's his face and fucking, uh,

800
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,510
Korea considered that we declared
war on them, right? So, uh,

801
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:37,720
uh, Maggie Magen Hall, whatever
fucking name is, uh, Maggie Gyllenhaal,

802
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,550
what is it?
What is the fucking,

803
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:42,940
the poor woman who has to go out and
fucking give the press conferences now

804
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,150
because that dude with no neck,
you know,

805
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:50,290
who kind of looks like the
political version of Roger
Goodell went out there and

806
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:53,380
fucked it all up. The hell's her name?
She's got a classic political name.

807
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,330
I don't know what the hell it is.

808
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,480
She said the fact that North Korea
thinks that we're at war with them is

809
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:02,650
absolutely preposterous or something
like that. And then like a week before,

810
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,400
what's his face?
Trump basically tweeted like that,

811
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,560
that fatty over there
wasn't long for this earth.

812
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,900
And it's like you kinda just
said he's not gonna last,

813
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,750
he's not going to be around long.
That's what he said. Yeah. I mean,

814
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:18,220
I would take that as a threat. We'll
have a dash for his habit. Daesh,

815
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,100
um,
you know what they really need to do?

816
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,440
They both need to just go to a whorehouse
together and fucking grow up, you know,

817
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,740
Bang, a couple of whores they
need to do a threesome, right?

818
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,700
One of them is getting blown the others
hitting it doggy style and just their

819
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,810
eyes meet and they just start laughing
being like, this is a great life. Right?

820
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,700
You've got a personal chef to yeah, it's
fucking amazing. You live in a castle,

821
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:42,940
live in a White House. I mean, it's fun.
It's cool. They should just talk about,

822
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:46,720
you know, trade stories, the way
comedians trade stories about bombing.

823
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:51,340
They could just talk about fucking bomb
and other countries and I dunno what

824
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,800
fishing, whatever, whatever people
at that level talk about. All right,

825
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:59,180
let's get to the questions for this week.
So I don't have any fucking problem. Uh,

826
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,120
with these,
these guys taking a knee,

827
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,790
I try to listen to what it's about rather
than getting wrapped up in what, uh,

828
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,730
what, what it means to me. Um, uh,

829
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,240
pharmacists writing in
dear Billy bag chaser.

830
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,830
I don't know what that means. Um,
by the way, people 39 days sober,

831
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:22,650
39 fucking days. And this is, this is
how well I'm doing with my sobriety. I,

832
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:26,960
when I flew to Canada, I went by
this duty free and there's this, uh,

833
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,920
Macallan rare cask. They got this new
one black oak or some shit like that.

834
00:50:31,921 --> 00:50:34,550
And I was like, I'm
going to buy that. Okay,

835
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,760
I'm not going to take it to fucking
Canada then suck it down like a fucking

836
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:42,650
jackass. I'm just going to have this thing
waiting for me. You know what I mean?

837
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,720
For whenever I fall off the wagon.

838
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,410
So this is like what I was thinking
the whole ride in and like, you know,

839
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:49,580
I'm getting off the plane,

840
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,360
I'm trying to beat the crowd to get over
to the taxi line cause I don't fucking

841
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,960
Uber, I never remember to set up a car.
So I always go to the fucking taxi line.

842
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,490
And what's great at lax is,

843
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:00,920
is never anybody there because
nobody fucking takes a taxi.

844
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:05,120
Everybody's got a friend to pick him up.
Um, I don't know what the fuck they do.

845
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:06,080
There's always plenty of cabs,

846
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:09,830
so I don't even try to be
first in line at the cap stand.

847
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,680
I go out of my way over to this duty free
place and I grabbed this fucking thing,

848
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,530
you know,
and I like

849
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:22,150
bring it up to the counter and the lady
goes, Oh my God. She goes, fucking, uh,

850
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,400
what a wonderful choice and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

851
00:51:24,401 --> 00:51:27,370
You have great tastes like I am. I
go, I'm on the wagon when I come off,

852
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:31,720
this is the bottle I'm opening
up. She goes, are you going
to Canada? I said, Nope,

853
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,160
I'm going home. And she goes, yeah,

854
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,180
Oh, I'm sorry I can't sell you this.
And I'm like, why not? She goes,

855
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:40,760
you have to be going to Kansas, some of
the about the duty free. And I'm like,

856
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:45,190
it's, it's legal though. Do they sell
this anywhere else in the airport?

857
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:46,024
If you just going back right

858
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,230
to your home? They're
like, no, no, we don't.

859
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,750
So I dunno.

860
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,570
So I had a fucking hissy fit.
I had a fucking hissy fit

861
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,630
hi to hissy fits. One of the way
they're going through Canadian customs.

862
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:03,710
When they made me take the delined green
plastic cover off of my fucking laptop,

863
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,060
like I somehow had a bomb in there
or some sort of bomb residue and I'm

864
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:10,370
literally taking it off going, I'm
going to crack this thing. And they go,

865
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:12,050
well just try to take it off easily.

866
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,243
Okay.

867
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,030
It's just like when you look, I love
it. Like fucking howdy duty. What? What?

868
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,400
I'm in this matrix.
I like what's going on?

869
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,920
Tell me what you want me to do the fuck.

870
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,520
So they make me take that fucking
thing off. Ended up cracking the cover.

871
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:30,130
Some are in a bad mood.
So rather than, you know,

872
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,500
growing up and realizing that
these fucking people at that,

873
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,520
what is it that to Tca TCP, whatever, fuck
it took a tea, what is it called? Tsa.

874
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,830
Tsa.
The fucking Tsa.

875
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,310
Rather than just realizing these
people are trying to protect me,

876
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:46,510
which I don't think that trying to do.

877
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:49,030
I think they're trying to make it
as inconvenient as fucking possible.

878
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,480
So I'll agree to have my fucking retina
scan so they can share that fucking

879
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:54,880
information and gradually
build a fucking robot.

880
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,680
Sorry, put this fucking
headphones back. Um,

881
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,700
yeah,
so all I wanted was a bottle of booze.

882
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,410
That's all I wanted and they wouldn't sell
it to me. They wouldn't sell it to me.

883
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:14,500
So I went online and off. I'll figure
out a fucking place to get it. All right,

884
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:17,140
let's, let's do the
little right in here. Um,

885
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,090
pharmacist writing in a
dear Billy bag chaser.

886
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:26,220
Your rant on pharmacists last week
was hilarious. We have to be able,

887
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,810
able to laugh at ourselves.
Right.

888
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,290
I just wanted to weigh in on
a couple of things. First off,

889
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,000
the medication you were prescribed,

890
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:38,001
the antiinflammatory drug you received
was in the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory

891
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:43,410
drug class. How to fuck. Do you
know you didn't even look at it?

892
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,890
Maybe you've just be, Ya know, I can tell
just by the way he's talking about it,

893
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:47,724
I understand.

894
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:52,850
Basically these drugs
decrease the formation of
prostaglandins and thromboxane

895
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,500
named those chemicals are involved
in the inflammation process,

896
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,030
which itself causes pain.

897
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:05,031
So these drugs cannot just decrease
inflammation without also decreasing pain.

898
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,060
That's being labeled a
painkiller. Oh, okay.

899
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:10,240
Yeah.

900
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,840
End Saids are not in the opioid family.
Okay.

901
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,080
Are Not happy habit forming. I don't
know what this guy's talking about,

902
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:20,290
but it sounds like he's blowing my
argument out of the water. However,

903
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,900
they can be very dangerous in susceptible.

904
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,120
Okay.

905
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,860
Populations. Why can't you
say with addicts, society,

906
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:32,150
the bull populations, you guys are
such fucking creeps in that world.

907
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,320
And Sade's n s a I. D. S.

908
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:36,900
Yeah.

909
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,890
And ceds increased the
risk of cardiac events,

910
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,090
kidney damage and stomach ulcers.
I'm sorry, recovered addicts. Uh,

911
00:54:46,091 --> 00:54:48,900
usually in the elderly or those
with preexisting conditions.

912
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,970
I'm not sure what the
other drug you receive was.

913
00:54:50,971 --> 00:54:54,720
If it was a narcotic opioid painkiller
and the doctrine pharmacist did not

914
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:58,740
discuss it with you, they would be now
negligible on their parts since when?

915
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,970
Since when? I want to
know now that the, uh,

916
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:07,560
the fucking heroin epidemic is completely
out of control in the state of Ohio is

917
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:09,630
suing pharmaceutical companies.

918
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,110
I guarantee I graduated four years
ago and the dangers of narcotics was

919
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:14,310
extremely stressed.

920
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,940
Now all the medical bodies are
communicating the dangers of narcotics to

921
00:55:17,941 --> 00:55:22,320
practitioners and overseeing that
prescribing is done appropriately.

922
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:24,300
And maybe this is just the fucking,

923
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,750
okay.

924
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,390
It's just how we are. You
know, like when we first,

925
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:31,720
they first had that DDT and they sprayed
it all over the place and this is like

926
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:35,110
great. We just end it all these plagues
and then we did all this damage to the

927
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:35,591
environment.

928
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:39,760
We created this fucking window that is
starting to close I feel where it was

929
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:43,450
this golden age of not having to walk
around with a fucking boil on your face

930
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,810
and dying of the black plague.
And um,

931
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,060
okay.

932
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,560
We just got a little
out of control with it,

933
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:53,940
which would have been great is if as
we eradicated all of these different

934
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:56,970
diseases,
if we somehow didn't grow the population,

935
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:58,620
I feel like that's the sweet spot.

936
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:02,910
I feel like that's what the
fuck [inaudible] Illuminati
should be discussing is

937
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:07,560
like what is the optimal number of people,
including ourselves of course,

938
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:12,140
who should be allowed to survive while
we keep all the modern day technologies.

939
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:17,100
So we can still live this awesome
flat screen life with no plagues.

940
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,560
Okay.

941
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,550
But like we also can still sustain
like living on this fucking planet.

942
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:24,070
What is thing?
What is,

943
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:27,610
what does that number and they're not
taking college cause they're a fucking

944
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:29,650
close to entity. All right, let
me read a few more of these.

945
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,820
How much time are we up to at this point?
We're at 18 minutes.

946
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:38,350
18 minutes plus 37 is 55.
Okay. All right, so here we go.

947
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,790
Gold money.com day or Billy copper nuts.
Uh,

948
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:47,850
I heard you talk about gold money.com
on your pot Monday morning podcast,

949
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:50,500
wherever emailed you about it.
Didn't explain it very well.

950
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,950
I feel like all these are just
like free commercials. Um,

951
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:55,660
I haven't put any money into it yet,

952
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:59,020
but now I'm going to speak
about it as an authority. Uh,

953
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,990
but I am considering it
as it seems pretty legit.

954
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,870
If you listened to Rogan's
podcast with Peter Schiff,

955
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:08,230
he explains it pretty well
and makes a good pitch. Yeah.

956
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:11,860
But that guide stands to profit off it
granted shift admits that he invested

957
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,650
money in the company. Yeah.
So he's out. He's out.

958
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,420
I want an independent fucking data.

959
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,520
I can even find that anymore.

960
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,520
Evidently they sell you the
gold at a low market price,

961
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,460
half of 1%,
I think.

962
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,030
What do you mean ha?
Half of 1% of what?

963
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,630
That's just sort of a number
floating out there, right. Uh,

964
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,140
stored for you in a vault of your
choosing with your name on it.

965
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:42,380
And if you want it, they will actually
mail your goal to you for free.

966
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,200
Minimum of them have like
five grams or something.

967
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:49,790
You also get a mastercard debit card
that you can use to spend your gold slash

968
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,320
money.
Evidently you can use,

969
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,590
you can even get a debit card
that is made of real gold,

970
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,290
which sounds fucking baller. The
Federal Reserve and powers that may be,

971
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,070
may never let it work, but it seems
like a great idea. At least. Thanks.

972
00:58:04,071 --> 00:58:07,370
And Go fuck yourself. Yeah, there's
a bunch of great ideas. Yeah,

973
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:11,280
I'm all set on that. Hey,
you give me your cash and uh,

974
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:14,040
we'll put it in gold in
a vault that you choose.

975
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,440
That's not where you can say it. Um,
all right. Dating and Saudi Arabia.

976
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,710
Now mate, maybe. I Dunno, I, it
sounds like a, even if their,

977
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,830
their mind is in the right place,

978
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:28,800
it's going to go belly up and then
they're all gonna write themselves bonus

979
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:31,200
checks off your gold.
That's what I would guess what happened.

980
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:33,990
Or the Federal Reserve will come in and
say this is all illegal and take all the

981
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:37,650
gold and then act like it's in Fort Knox
when it's really fucking, uh, I dunno.

982
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,310
I Dunno what the fuck it is.
Somewhere in the Hamptons. All right.

983
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:45,600
Dating and Saudi Arabia. Hey there,
Billy pie. Billy the pie maker.

984
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:47,070
Hope you're having a great day.
Anyways,

985
00:58:47,071 --> 00:58:51,440
I wanted your advice on this problematic
shit that I'm stuck in. I met this

986
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,170
lady

987
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,970
through a common friend of ours.
Oh God. We talk, this is nuts.

988
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:59,730
It's going to get messy when you break
up with her and you're going to lose her

989
00:58:59,731 --> 00:59:01,980
Anna Front. Uh, we talked,

990
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,470
she's really cool person and we've
got a lot of things in common.

991
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,820
Then we met again twice as a friend
and now I want to ask her out.

992
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:09,930
But here's the thing,

993
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,100
she is a Gypson and I'm Indian
and we live in Saudi Arabia.

994
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,290
Rabia and dating is illegal here.

995
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,720
Well then what the fuck did
you go out with their four?

996
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,390
Now your heart's going to get cause you
to get your fucking, what did they do?

997
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:24,740
Have their beat your feet in the square.

998
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:29,210
You're going to fucking slap your
dick around in public or something.

999
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,370
Whatever the punishment is over there.

1000
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:34,820
I made the authority could
deport you immediately or worse,

1001
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,940
send you to jail for years.
Now,

1002
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:40,160
I really liked this girl
more than your freedom.

1003
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:46,710
All right? Now I really liked this girl
and like, you're not even love this girl.

1004
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:51,711
And I've already thought of of names
for our kids before she even said yes to

1005
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:52,650
me.

1006
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:57,390
But I'm really stuck on
thinking through my brain.

1007
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,550
Okay,
this is second language here.

1008
00:59:59,551 --> 01:00:02,280
I'm gonna try to help this out
here from really stuck here,

1009
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,850
which she should I think through my
brain and through my Dick. Uh, should, I

1010
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,720
will do none of that is your heart.
So you should just leave.

1011
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,760
Should I ask her out and open for a
whole nother level of problems or so they

1012
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:17,970
just shut the fuck up. Any advice
from, he was highly appreciated.

1013
01:00:17,971 --> 01:00:20,250
Love the podcast and love you
as a brother. Go Fuck Yourself.

1014
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:25,251
There's not a woman or a man out there
worth going to fucking prison in Saudi

1015
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,140
Arabia.
I know a bad the prisons are of here.

1016
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,480
I don't know what they like over there.
You guys got a lot of oil money.

1017
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,590
Although I did run into this guy from
Saudi Arabian who is laughing his ass off

1018
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:37,530
and he goes, dude, we don't, we don't all
have oil money. Now's a sec. All right,

1019
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:41,520
fair enough. There's oil men over here. I
don't have any of that money. Yeah, do it.

1020
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:45,990
I would walk away from the shit. It's
fucking illegal. You could go to jail.

1021
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:50,040
You get deported. You know what I
mean? And even if you love somebody,

1022
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:51,750
they're going to annoy the
shit out of yourself. I mean,

1023
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:56,040
is that worth going to jail for? You know,
I mean, is it illegal to just banger,

1024
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:00,630
but then if you love her, I
dunno. I Dunno. I, I would,
I would get out of that.

1025
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,670
Uh, I get out of it. All right.

1026
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:09,070
All right. Great movie scene,
unknown actor. All right. Oh
yeah. I was talking about,

1027
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,480
uh, this is the, uh,

1028
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:15,850
this is a new topic here where I was
talking about actors that you saw just to

1029
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:20,290
like five lines in a fucking movie and
they absolutely destroyed it and you and

1030
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:23,020
your friends still quote them.
You don't even know their fucking names.

1031
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:26,890
I brought it that guy last week,
the guy from pulp, a reservoir dogs,

1032
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:32,290
the guy in,
you know when Tim Roth's character is a,

1033
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,820
what is he? He's in the fucking bathroom
and that cop's telling that story.

1034
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:40,240
I said, buddy, I am going
to shoot you in the face.

1035
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:43,900
You don't put your fucking hands. And that
dashboard, love that guy. So he, he goes,

1036
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,950
one of my favorite scenes with an unknown
actor was kill bill to bill's brother

1037
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:51,580
Bud. I wish I need to see these
movies to do this justice. I mean,

1038
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:55,690
I saw this but I don't remember it.
Um, she, she wore the same outfit,

1039
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:57,010
that fucking yellow outfit,

1040
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:00,850
both movies than she bill's brother Bud
is working as a bouncer at a rundown

1041
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:05,440
strip club. He shows up late for work,
gets called into his boss's office.

1042
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,130
His boss,

1043
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:11,130
Larry Gomez is played by actor Larry
Bishop and he looks like half a wolf man

1044
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,880
after doing a line of blow with
the haggard looking stripper.

1045
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:20,220
I vaguely remember this. He levels
his gaze at buzz and bud and says,

1046
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:21,421
uh,

1047
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:25,920
I don't know what car wash you worked
before you came here that let you stroll

1048
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:29,940
in 20 minutes late.
But it wasn't owned by view of what,

1049
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:33,000
it wasn't owned by me and
I own a fucking car wash.

1050
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,060
I just butchered that line.
People I can't really,

1051
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:40,010
I realized that I needed glasses
and I have slight dyslexia. Um,

1052
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,810
like I was trying to write squawk
today and I knew all the letters.

1053
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:48,830
I just could not remember cause I was
trying to remember what squawking 7,700

1054
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:52,430
versus 7,500.
I always get those two mixed up.

1055
01:02:52,431 --> 01:02:54,620
If that's an emergency landing
or a fucking hijacking,

1056
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,420
I was cause one stay alive and
the other is fucking go to heaven.

1057
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,070
Um, all right. Sorry. That's how
you remember it. 75 stay alive.

1058
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:07,460
77 go to heaven. All
right. 75 is hijacking.

1059
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,450
77 is emergency and 76 Nita fixed
meets you fucking radios out.

1060
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,700
This doesn't mean anything to you guys.
Um,

1061
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,320
I don't know what car wash you worked
before you came here that let you stroll

1062
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:22,070
in 20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned
by me and I own a fucking car wash day.

1063
01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:26,960
You Go. That was a good fucking read.
That makes me want to go see that movie.

1064
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,430
He said he then proceeded to give this
worldclass assassin a humiliating dress

1065
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:31,940
down,

1066
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:36,940
telling him he's as useless as an asshole
on his elbow and crossing off all his

1067
01:03:37,071 --> 01:03:39,680
scheduled work days on the calendar.

1068
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:42,620
He finishes by telling him
never to wear his cowboy,

1069
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:46,340
had to work and has cleaned
a clog toilet on his way out.

1070
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:50,000
All Bud can do is stand there and take it.
I hope you've seen this great movie.

1071
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,700
If not, it's worth the watch.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1072
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:55,070
I'm going to go watch it again.
All right.

1073
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,720
I think I'm a think this bit is going
to make people go see these cool movies

1074
01:03:59,721 --> 01:04:02,840
again and it's also going to make
everybody laugh at how bad I can't fucking

1075
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:07,220
read out loud. All right bill. My favorite
line in a comedy ever might be from,

1076
01:04:07,221 --> 01:04:07,260
from

1077
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,900
blazing saddles delivered by slim pickins.

1078
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,610
He rides into the scene where
his workers are singing,

1079
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,750
uh, camp. Is it Camptown races? I was,

1080
01:04:17,751 --> 01:04:22,751
I was camp Camptown races and says what
in the wide wide world of sport is going

1081
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:27,270
on here.
I hired two people to try to get,

1082
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,580
I had you people to try to
get a little track late,

1083
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:34,950
not to jump around like a bunch of Kansas
City faggots. I remember that line.

1084
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:40,230
Whatever the hell that means.
And I'm quoting a movie by the way,

1085
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:43,920
before everybody gets all fucking
uptight about the, uh, you know,

1086
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:44,940
Richard Pryor road on that.

1087
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,850
And he was actually supposed to be the
leading it and then they went with the,

1088
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:50,160
the other actor and I don't know
any of the actress names. Okay.

1089
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,570
Three number three,
Bill,

1090
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:56,280
you asked for movie lines said by a non
movie star actress that your listeners

1091
01:04:56,281 --> 01:05:00,120
friends talked about from my group of
friends. It's aligned from Ghostbusters.

1092
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,940
When Peter Venkman,
uh,

1093
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:07,970
Bill Murray shows up to Dana's w weaver
apartment right after the dog monster

1094
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:12,240
runs loose from Louis.
Tell you I've never seen that movie.

1095
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,300
I've never seen Ghostbusters.
Just not a Scifi guy.

1096
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,900
Vanke is that considered vanquish shows
up to this scene and asks a cop what

1097
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:25,850
happened. And the cop
nonchalantly replies, uh,

1098
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,740
some more on brought a cougar
to a party and it went buzzer.

1099
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,033
Yeah.

1100
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,960
My friends and I have been
quoting that cop for years.

1101
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:39,800
Check it out at two 30 of the following.
Oh, I can, I can look at these. Fuck,

1102
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:42,590
I can click on the links.
This is even better.

1103
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:46,130
Why have me read it when I can
click on the links. All right.

1104
01:05:46,131 --> 01:05:47,300
We'll compare my read.

1105
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,420
I get around.

1106
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,830
It was 120 to three k is
the mold off the board

1107
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,850
when you were a slave, you
sang live, Bert. Come on.

1108
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,710
How bad our good old nigger work song.

1109
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:12,060
Jesus Christ. What the fuck?
Kind of lucky is sending me here.

1110
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:17,430
I thought that was going to
go to your fucking oh boy.

1111
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:21,870
Oh boy. Am I going to have to
have an apology video here?

1112
01:06:21,871 --> 01:06:25,550
What the fuck just happened? Oh it,
let's do I do this other one. This one.

1113
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,290
How are you doing?
Why didn't you have some of the free,

1114
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:29,480
it's at room temperature if you
think it's too warm in here.

1115
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:33,960
All right.

1116
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,560
Fuck. All these things he thinks are
going to be too long and evidently they,

1117
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:40,710
they have the n word in them. Yeah. Boy,
do I need to take a knee after this one?

1118
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,760
All right.
Number four.

1119
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,470
I have two unknown and unheralded
actors with memorable movie lines.

1120
01:06:46,471 --> 01:06:50,790
Both are the Great Mel Brooks movies.
Uh,

1121
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,330
the first one is the Roman soldier in
the history of the world, part one,

1122
01:06:54,331 --> 01:06:57,150
the emphasis is approaching, but
the, there's a horse and a carriage.

1123
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:00,690
And the way the Roman soldier looks
directly at the camera and says,

1124
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:05,760
move that miserable piece of shit. Uh,
the over the top way delivers the line,

1125
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,570
comes out of nowhere. I say
it all the time and the, uh,

1126
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,830
and the best impression I could,
do you know what I gotta do?

1127
01:07:10,831 --> 01:07:14,940
I have to get the actual clips for this
to work because what I'm now doing is

1128
01:07:14,941 --> 01:07:19,050
ruining. I'm ruining great movies. All
right. Girlfriend believes in ghosts.

1129
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,510
Uh, all right. Girlfriend believes
in ghosts dear grandmaster be,

1130
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,650
I met this lady a few weeks ago.
Things went really good.

1131
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,300
She's very cool.

1132
01:07:30,301 --> 01:07:34,200
I found her good looking and we
have a lot of stuff to talk about.

1133
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:37,680
I didn't have a great a lot of, I didn't
have a lot of relationships in the past.

1134
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:41,400
I'm 32 and I picked up my
game about four years ago.

1135
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:44,430
Everything was great until we went to a
restaurant one day and she told me she

1136
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:45,330
believes in ghosts,

1137
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:50,660
not just that she said she actually sees
them and even God patients who come to

1138
01:07:51,241 --> 01:07:55,140
her for treatment about it. I tried
to be open minded about it. Oh my God,

1139
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,600
I can just hear the silverware
hitting the plates at this point,

1140
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,840
trying to compare it to
people who believe in God,

1141
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:06,000
but her believing in this keeps bugging
me. I'm not saying she's crazy or wrong.

1142
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,930
Who am I to know? But she doesn't
sit right the way I see the world.

1143
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,900
Well then fucking dropper.
This is the thing.

1144
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:16,400
Now this is whole fucking
straight across the board.

1145
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:21,110
You have to look at everything like
all the leaves are brown and the sky is

1146
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,030
gray. Like if you're dating and somebody
does something and it makes you buddy,

1147
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,750
you just body literally go like, what
the fuck? And then you're literally,

1148
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:33,230
you're going to fight that feeling and go,
well,

1149
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:37,160
maybe I need to stop being so
ghost of phobic. It's like, no,

1150
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:40,640
it's fucking ghost. It's
weird. You know you,

1151
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,820
you're going to fucking live with
Whoopi Goldberg's character from ghosts.

1152
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:44,541
That's what you're gonna do.

1153
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:48,530
People trying to sit on her and shit
trying to sit on your [inaudible].

1154
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,780
That's what you're going to sign up
for me if that's what you're into.

1155
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,240
By all means do it, but if you're
on a date and that there's like,

1156
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:56,830
that's a major fucking thing because
it's not like she just believes in and

1157
01:08:56,831 --> 01:09:00,770
every once in a while she's going to hear
a thump in the house and start telling

1158
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:04,160
you it's a ghost. When you're like, honey,
it's fucking air in the pipes. All right,

1159
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:06,820
we just have to fucking turn
on the faucet. You know?

1160
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,920
Remember if the plumber did work today
and they shut it off for a second,

1161
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:13,250
that that's what that is. You
know, that's not that she actually,

1162
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:17,360
she's going to become like a ghost
hunter and all of that stuff and uh,

1163
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,950
gradually she's going to get,

1164
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:23,330
start dressing more and more like she
can predict the future and you don't want

1165
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:24,320
to fuck that.
You know what I mean?

1166
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,660
When they start wearing those long
flowing things, you know, just,

1167
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:31,070
you just so many layers of clothes to
try to pick up to just get it going.

1168
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:35,390
You know, you start wearing like curtains
and shit. You don't need that anyways.

1169
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:39,680
All right. I'm sorry. That whole
fucking movie thing, just, I dunno.

1170
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,700
Can you guys just send me the Goddamn
clip or I guess you sent me the clip.

1171
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:46,340
What I should've done was cue it up.
I tried to do too many things.

1172
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:48,140
I tried to promote shit.

1173
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:51,410
I tried to do all that and then do the
whole thing and the whole fucking thing

1174
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:55,290
just fell apart. All right. Let me
just finish with this last thing. Uh,

1175
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,130
a buddy of mine is opening a fucking,
uh,

1176
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:04,280
a new comedy club on the upper west
side in Manhattan. Okay. Friday,

1177
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:06,260
October six and October 7th.

1178
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,310
It's like a little 100 seat fucking club.

1179
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:15,500
I'm going to be coming to the town in
November and I'm going to pop in and do a

1180
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:20,110
spot. I love little clubs like that.
Uh, let's see here. Uh, Russman.

1181
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:24,470
Money's going to be there. Greer Barnes,
Mark Norman, John Fisch, rod small,

1182
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:28,550
Brian Scott McFadden. Uh, and many more.

1183
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:31,370
It's going to be a great show. Uh,
if you're on the upper east side,

1184
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,450
upper west side,
sorry,

1185
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:35,750
it's on a two oh one west 75th streets
right next to the beacon theater,

1186
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,880
which is also cool.
You know what I mean?

1187
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:41,060
You go in there and you fucking do your
spots and you come out and you go, wow.

1188
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:45,530
Someday I'll be across the street.
It's tremendous. Give it a shot.

1189
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:50,540
If you're in town, uh, Friday, October
six and October 7th, I got the hiccups.

1190
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,670
That's the podcast. Please check out.
Philippe espouses a standup special.

1191
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,650
Um,
what's it called?

1192
01:10:57,651 --> 01:11:01,280
Translate this September 30th on Hbo.

1193
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:05,510
10:00 PM it feels more like indigestion.
I have any meeting today. All right.

1194
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,120
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
