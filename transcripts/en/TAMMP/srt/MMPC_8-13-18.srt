1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,041
Hey,

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:05,970
what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,250
August 13th, 2017 what's
going on? How I, yeah.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,080
Um, I figured out what the problem was
with the volume last time. You know,

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,830
all my podcasts,
I think I can't figure this out.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,400
I had some guy how to a volume II.
I remember. I'm like, I gotta go.

7
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,280
Everything all turned up.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,410
I actually had two microphones plugged
in and I was on the one that was turned

9
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,180
all the way down.
So you were hearing it.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,490
I was speaking into a dead mic next
to him, Mike, that was live. Oh,

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,340
bill is so unprofessional.
Hey Man.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,730
Um, I had a major breakthrough,
major breakthrough in my life.

13
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:44,580
I don't know if you've read
about it in the New York Times,

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,370
The Washington Post,
the fucking de Moines.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,490
Uh, what would they say that
the morning Herald, I dunno. Um,

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,373
yeah,

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,420
I moved in my house fucking seven years
ago and one of the house warming gifts

18
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:08,461
that I got was a food processor
or should've said process.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,050
Right? I got a food processor and
this fucking thing. Never worked.

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,020
I plugged it in. I did there, but that,
but dad just would not fucking work.

21
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:23,530
So years later I bought a smaller
one for when I was on the road,

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,290
when I was going to make myself
some smoothies. Hi Fellow.

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,210
It's going to make myself some smoothies
so I could get my abs, you know,

24
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:33,640
so I could show up at the clam
bake and everybody can be like, oh,

25
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:37,420
what happened to bill? He's still blinding
white, but good God. Is He chiseled?

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,170
Is He chiseled? Can't you can't
tell. That's one of the sad things.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,700
No matter how good a shape I get it,

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,730
you won't notice because I'm
so blindly a white chalk white.

29
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,710
It just, you just can't see
it. You know what I mean?

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,510
Okay.

31
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,310
You don't put, you know,
where's my Hashtag? What
about me? What about my pain?

32
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,003
I'm

33
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,420
having to wear sweat pants all the way
through summer just to avoid the bullying.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,130
Uh, anyways, he's fucking food
processor wasn't working, wouldn't work.

35
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:11,200
So I got the little one,
the little one worked a couple of times,

36
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:15,740
then it wouldn't work. Then sometimes it
work and that wouldn't work. Am like, boy,

37
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:17,960
what the fuck are these things short out?
What's going on with them?

38
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:22,070
So you know what, I fucked, you know.
So anyways, I'm on this diet right now.

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,890
I got a nutritionist. Every fucking
thing is, you know, uh, you know,

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,800
take some almonds in,
fucking dice them up with,

41
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:30,290
I don't know if you've ever tried to do
that on a cutting board with the knife.

42
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,970
They go flying all over the place.

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,480
But if you have a word
or a food processor,

44
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,680
I always want to call it a word process
of food processor. Why? Why? It's a Jiffy,

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,750
you know, he just put it in and it's
easy. You feel like fucking Rachael Ray,

46
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,670
you spinning around and you're like,
how come I'm not hosting a cooking show?

47
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,420
All that's right. Because the last
red head was out there grabbing.

48
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,080
So there's another black hole and this,

49
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,200
okay.

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,260
Foot judges.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,273
Yeah.

52
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,040
First, the guy from Nyp de Bleu
takes off from his fucking series,

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,510
like after one season to have a movie
career in jade and all those movies,

54
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,690
which were good, they didn't do well at
the box office and then they would like,

55
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,290
that's it. Fuck redheads, fuck
redhead males in the lead. We know it.

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,340
We knew it from day one,

57
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:27,880
even when we were making black hat
black and white fucking movies,

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,490
fuck red heads,
you know,

59
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:34,540
and Eric Stoltz immediately
felt the effects of that.

60
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,410
Um, so I'll take one red head to go out
there and fuck it up and then they just

61
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,680
stick it on the bench for a while.

62
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,440
I'm just fucking with you guys anyways.
Um,

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,150
I'm on my own journey.

64
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,860
What I do and what I asked the universe
for. It's what I'm going to get.

65
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,880
You have to have blinders on yet.
Pay,

66
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:02,350
be empathetic and be aware of others.
Um,

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,873
so anyways,

68
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,420
I went to this kid's birthday
party on Saturday and uh,

69
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,250
it was just Christmas themed party,
which seem nuts to me.

70
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,970
And then I showed up, but it was
fucking awesome. They're the AC crank.

71
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:21,580
And they had the Christmas sogs going.
It was a kid's birthday.

72
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,200
It was incredible. It was
actually, it was a great time.

73
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,900
They had a basketball hoop. All the
little kids were out there trying to dunk.

74
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,970
That was funny. Every kid was
Dunkin cause that's all they show.

75
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,480
That's all they show.
Um, on the highlights,

76
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,170
you know,
you only way you can take,

77
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:45,670
the only way a jump shot makes a highlight
now is if you cross the other guy

78
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:50,360
over and he fell down and 30 people
have to run by the screen going,

79
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,780
ah,

80
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,590
after you did it. You know, like
if Larry Bird played right now,

81
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:57,480
he would never make an
under sports center.

82
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,010
Um, I don't understand the
running around all day.

83
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,940
Like somebody could literally take a full
water bottle flipping upside down and

84
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:14,050
if it lands on top,
hey buddy,

85
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,390
acting like the dude just levitated
Oh,

86
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm an old man.
Whatever.

87
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,790
I'm slowly feeling it's slipping away
and I'm watching young people enjoy

88
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,720
themselves the new way that human
beings enjoy themselves and never deli.

89
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:33,300
I don't approve. How were the
millennial generation survived?

90
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:35,920
Do you have any idea what
the fuck my dad does?

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,150
So anyways, I, uh,

92
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,090
I come home all right. Everything they
had at the birthday party, I couldn't eat.

93
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,760
I was being that La
Douche that was on a diet.

94
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,930
These wonderful people made all this
amazing guy. It was fucking unbelievable.

95
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:58,360
They had gingerbread men in August.
Okay.

96
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Gingerbread men that could
fuck with anybody's December
level gingerbread men as

97
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:09,640
a ginger. I wasn't even offended.
Okay. That's how good these cookies,

98
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,990
Alia cupcakes,
they're rice krispie treats.

99
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,250
Then they had this, this breaded
chicken that just, it just look bites.

100
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:26,120
I just looked fucking incredible. Right?

101
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,070
And it was also at the thing and, and uh,
one of the, the husband was a, uh, was,

102
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:35,360
was, uh, uh, uh, a bourbon
whiskey scotch guy.

103
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,110
And he's the only guy I've ever
seen that had a bottle of monkey.

104
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,680
And that's when I found
when I was over in France,

105
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,480
but that I finished in three nights,
by the way,

106
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:49,220
which is why all freckles are still
on the wagon. Okay. My fucking,

107
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:52,400
my liver is still, you know,
talking to me about that one.

108
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,780
Now they're going to let it go. You
know, just like you check, you know,

109
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,600
you did that one fucking
thing. Oh, they're going to
bring it up for years, right.

110
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,880
So anyway, so I come home and
you know, I'm fucking starving.

111
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,380
All I drank there was waters and um,

112
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,240
I had a Santa hat on. It was
fucking awesome. Anyways, so, uh,

113
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,830
come back to the house and now I'm
trying to chop up these God damn fucking

114
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,330
almonds. I'm like, fuck this, let me
get that little food processor right.

115
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,040
And it fucking put it together. And Lo
and behold, the fucking thing works.

116
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm like, fine, great. So an pill,
I take the top off, whatever,

117
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,470
and I go to put my shit in,

118
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,240
I put the top back on and that doesn't
fucking work again and I'm losing my shit.

119
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,450
So my wife keeps coming in and out.
So now we have an outlet for my anger,

120
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,350
my poor wife. Right. You
know, it's one of these deals,

121
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:44,030
like I'm frustrated over here
and then just becomes like,

122
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,730
how many times you going to come
in here on a door, you know,

123
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,730
you do one of those and then look,
what is your problem?

124
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,290
I can't fuck Jesus Christ.

125
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:55,850
That's going to be a fucking 40 minute
conversation there. It goes my evening.

126
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,600
And that's exactly what
happened. Well, long story short,

127
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,840
I was trying to make some almond
crusted baked chicken breasts,

128
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,480
eight ounces to be exact,

129
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,730
saving the rest for my lunch
tomorrow with a Greek Yogurt,

130
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,720
yogurt and in fucking dill dip or
whatever the fuck I had, you know?

131
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,430
And um,

132
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,000
yeah,

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,410
you know, the whole, I just said, fuck it.

134
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:22,180
I'm just going to make this
chicken plane and I'll,

135
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,120
I'll just eat it with the dip. And that's
what I did. And I've stuck to the Diet,

136
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,420
right. So, you know,

137
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,800
my wife read me the riot act, what
an asshole I am. And you know,

138
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,740
I couldn't argue because
she was right at that point,

139
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:41,100
my stomach was full and I was able to
look back on what I had just done pretty

140
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,780
clearly at that point.
I was just like, yeah,

141
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:46,110
I don't think I would be
liking me right now either. Um,

142
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,750
so I sat down and he nodded and I agreed.
And then I tried to make some points,

143
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:54,180
which is always bad when you're that
much in the wrong, but you know,

144
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,950
it's just how I'm wired. You know, as I
said, you know, I'm down 40 to nothing,

145
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm still gonna try to kick
a field goal. Okay. Um,

146
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,460
so
that took a day and a half,

147
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,080
still apologize completely for,

148
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,390
and I had to make her laugh a lot and
she already doesn't like me. You know,

149
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,080
we're having like a,

150
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,890
a rough time right now because I'm on this
diet and I keep making extra shit and,

151
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,290
but it's so my next, you know, meal
and she just, she just, you know,

152
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,020
she's coming by like it's a buffet.
She'd be like,

153
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,350
I like Veggie Tacos.

154
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,531
I'm like,
yeah,

155
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:32,300
but there's only like this is all measured
and they wait to after you fucking

156
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:33,134
make it.

157
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,400
Okay.
Oh good.

158
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,990
And then you gotta be like, no, you can't.
Well, you have to eat all of it yet,

159
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:45,810
but I might have it tomorrow.
This is how this works.

160
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,190
Okay. Turn your key does. It does.

161
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:53,310
There's a launch sequence to this.
It already started.

162
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,143
Um,

163
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,770
so that just keeps being a problem
because she feels like I'm not sharing.

164
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,390
And so when I keep doing is I keep giving
her a bite of this bland sugar-free

165
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,300
salt free shit than I'm eating. I'm like,
you sure you want some of this? You know,

166
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,590
she had some of my oatmeal and
Allman fucking pancakes yesterday.

167
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,640
Peaches in a peaches in it. The chopped
peaches in it. That was the tree.

168
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,510
That was the oasis.

169
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,770
She had to keep running to as you worked
your way through all of that stuff.

170
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,730
All right. But I will tell you, you know,

171
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,130
I feel fucking tremendous. My energy is
through the God damn roof. Um, so anyways,

172
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,260
the next morning I wake up to make my
fucking Allmond Goddamn motherfucking

173
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,920
oatmeal pancakes. Now I'm calm. You know,

174
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,370
I had my hot water with lemon
sitting there. I'm by myself,

175
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,750
you know, am I? No, no, no. I'm
never by myself. That's right.

176
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,160
I had already brought my daughter up and
I've fed her and she was watching puppy

177
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:57,300
dog pals and I had her in the
highchair. She was locked in, you know,

178
00:10:57,301 --> 00:11:00,540
she had a little sippy cup and she
was fucking, you know, love and life.

179
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,690
So I went out there and I was just like,

180
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm going to figure out how to use these
fucking work with these food processors,

181
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,440
not word processed food processor.

182
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,850
And I got this giant bin where I
keep all the instruction manuals

183
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,840
throughout the years, every fucking
thing I've ever owned. Okay.

184
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,630
Instruction manuals for my refrigerator.

185
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,980
Like what do you need to know how to
open and close the fucking door? Right.

186
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,670
I Dunno, I wanted it to
be colder temperature down
Arrow, Arrow, arrow. Right.

187
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,810
Um,
anyways,

188
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,140
I ended up finding the fucking,
um,

189
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,040
instructional manual for both of them.

190
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,240
And this fucking food processors
that I got seven years ago,

191
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,000
I realized always worked.

192
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,510
It's just with the food processor,

193
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,510
there's only way that it goes together.

194
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:57,510
And I know this is basics for a lot
of you fucking do you know people,

195
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,650
you know who don't think
outside the box the way I do,

196
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,820
who don't have faith in your own
abilities to just put something together.

197
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,410
You have to cheat and look at the
instructions. So what I'm doing here,

198
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm making myself a
hero anyways. Yes, Bill,

199
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:18,200
we do see what you're
doing here. Um, so I, uh,

200
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,520
I got it out and it's like there's only
one way that it can go together where

201
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:26,520
it's still going to work because there's
no way they're going to let you put it

202
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:31,260
together wrong or have the top off and
have that blade spinning because you

203
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:35,800
know, somebody somehow fucking stuck
their hand or their face in it. Yeah.

204
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,710
And died. Right. You know,

205
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,580
or had the top off and then realize
they had some ingredient and on the top

206
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:46,790
shelf and the cover right above
it and they got up above it.

207
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,780
You know when they was squatting and
say we're going to stand up, you know,

208
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:54,410
and old Matt and Ben Hung Down there,
right? They've got all shredded.

209
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,060
Okay.

210
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,530
So what kills me,

211
00:12:57,531 --> 00:13:02,210
what I've learned about food processors
is all of them will go together about

212
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:04,850
three to four different ways,
but only one way.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You can put it together and it will work.
And that's what the problem was.

214
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,500
The problem is really that I didn't,
um,

215
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,630
I didn't read the manual,
but now it's kind of fascinating.

216
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,140
It's sort of like this, it's like
this electric current fucking thing.

217
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,670
It's just like,
it will go to here.

218
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,200
Now we will go pass through the handle
and then pass through the top and now you

219
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:28,470
can fucking dice your goddamn almonds.

220
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,500
Get it fucking text message here.
What is the problem?

221
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,030
Yeah.

222
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,470
Oh, Jesus quitters. Anyways, Shell, I
now have a word processor in my life.

223
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,060
A food processor.
Fuck.

224
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,733
Okay.

225
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,410
Processes the food. And I gotta
tell you it's been fucking awesome.

226
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,930
And I got that little one.
I know how that works.

227
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,400
So now I can bring that on the road.
It makes some smell.

228
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,093
You know,

229
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,630
there's nothing worse than eating
right while you're eating right.

230
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,320
But there's nothing better after. And
when you eat bad, it's the opposite.

231
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:03,090
There's nothing better
than eating like shit.

232
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,510
And there's nothing worse than right
after, you know, for the next morning,

233
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,420
it's usually two days later. So you
look down and it's just like, oh my God,

234
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,110
am I preggers? Um, all right.
So anyways, that's, that's,

235
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,840
that's my food processor story. So if
you're like me, if you ever got a gift,

236
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,820
a food processor gift,

237
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,270
okay.

238
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,760
And,
uh,

239
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,160
it never quite worked for you and you
have like massive add or are you just a

240
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,990
fucking scatter brained moron?

241
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,780
Which I sometimes think
add is a euphemism for, uh,

242
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,160
just go back and look at the manual.
All right?

243
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:44,090
Usually the handle has to face you
and then the top goes on just so, uh,

244
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,980
then you have your, just, your life will
be so much fucking easier. So anyways,

245
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,250
the first week was detox.
I already did that.

246
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,950
And now this second week is healthy gut.

247
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,510
So it's a bunch of Greek yogurt that,
you know, it has probiotics in it,

248
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,300
which is great because you know,
when you drink booze,

249
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,580
I guess booze kills the good bacteria.

250
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,930
See there's good bacteria and
there's bad bacteria in your gut.

251
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:13,290
The bad bacteria is therefore who else
all day when you die, when you die, the,

252
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:18,291
that's the bacteria that then begins
to feed a jeweler as you decompose.

253
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,530
That's actually true man. And a lot it
turns into like gas and shit like that,

254
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,770
which is why they always find like a
headless torso floating in the bay.

255
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:35,180
It's the shit in your gut that turns
to gas and it's like a fucking water

256
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,250
balloon. And you'd go up not to
mention, you know what I mean?

257
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,130
If you've already got some blubber on you,
if that's probably another reason.

258
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:43,610
But I remember reading that
book, uh, the West East,

259
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,050
that that movie state of grace
was loosely, loosely based on,

260
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,040
and um, they used to do,
they used to, you know,

261
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,920
they kill somebody and they used to
call it that the Houdini because the guy

262
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,530
would disappear and what they would do,
they always made sure that they,

263
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:01,730
they would, they chop them all up, but
they make sure that they got them too.

264
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,060
So then he would never come back because
if he, if he didn't take the time,

265
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:09,500
but you know, get the guts out of them,
then, then they, they would, they,

266
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,680
you'd have a floater.
Goddammit. I'm, there you go.

267
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,690
Now you know how to murder somebody,
but not an emergency,

268
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,524
but you know how to get rid of them.

269
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,250
Okay.

270
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,020
Um, anyways, uh, what
did I do this weekend?

271
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,350
Red Sox, keep winning.
You spend enough money,

272
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,900
you can sweep the oriels.
That's what we paid for.

273
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,730
We've won nine of our last 10.
We won nine out of 10 games in August.

274
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,200
We lost one game to go. Blue Jays
swept the Yankees, uh, went to,

275
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:41,350
and one against Toronto. Is that
right? One for against the Yankees.

276
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:42,810
Okay.

277
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,960
21. That's three. Yes. Right. And
then what's swept three with a,

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,170
the oriels now we've got the fillies
coming up who always play as tough.

279
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:52,080
Got to games with them in leg excitement.

280
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,130
Then we got Tampa Bay and then
we got our uh, another big test.

281
00:16:56,131 --> 00:17:00,720
We got the Cleveland Indians, uh, scary.

282
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:05,010
Terry Francona I still think is
the best manager in baseball.

283
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:08,610
He's got them playing great
with what he has and um,

284
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,150
yeah,
we'll see how we do against them.

285
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,960
We've got two series with them and then
the Houston before we play too with the

286
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:18,810
Yankees and then we're done. Then we
go into the playoffs. God willing,

287
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,681
God willing,

288
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:24,630
but evidently it's the whole fucking
thing is over because we swept the Yankees

289
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:25,590
in the beginning of August,

290
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:29,580
despite the fact that Yankees have
come back down 18 games against us,

291
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,790
we blown in eight,
we blew that fucking lead and 2012,

292
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,330
I'm never comfortable
until you won the division.

293
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,790
But then at the Yankees
get the fucking wildcard.

294
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,880
It's like you did not dispose of them.
It's just like,

295
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,470
well here we go now with zero,
zero.

296
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:48,000
So all that we didn't really didn't
mean shit cause the greedy cuts,

297
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,300
what fucking rounds of playoffs.

298
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,760
Playoffs. Everybody makes it.
Everybody makes it. Everybody makes it.

299
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,680
Hey,
if you want to hear something hilarious,

300
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,820
listen to Paul versus these Diversey
effect this week because he watched the

301
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:05,870
giants first preseason game and that
absolute beast that they drafted,

302
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:08,030
his name escapes me.
I saw him play in the rose bowl,

303
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,640
the running back from Penn
state. He said, he goes, dude,

304
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:13,560
you got to see his first run.
You said he fucking,

305
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,530
he went one way and then
he had it all sealed off.

306
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:19,340
He ran the other way for like 40 yards
and I guess uh, the giant faithful,

307
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,330
we're going fucking crazy or you will
not find a more loyal spill sports fan

308
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,070
that Paul Versey and I know it's been
easy to be a giant fair during the fucking

309
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:28,910
Eli days,

310
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,210
but he has been our hardcore New
York Knicks fan since I met him.

311
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:37,400
I can only feel so bad for him because
he is a giant set, a Yankees Fan.

312
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,400
He said plenty of success right in
his lifetime that he's remembered.

313
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,160
They have won five world series and
two Superbowls is pretty God damn good.

314
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,430
Right? He doesn't give a fuck about
hockey. They brain just won a Stanley Cup.

315
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,590
He's not a mets fan. They want
an 86 a, here we go. Belt.

316
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:01,490
Now you got to work it all out, don't
ya? Then who's left? Oh, the jets.

317
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,970
Jesus Christ and I think it
just goes downhill. Um, anyways,

318
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:09,050
he was all excited about that. I did
not see all my patriots were doing. Um,

319
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,360
this might be Tom Brady's last year,
maybe next year.

320
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,580
It's all winding down and I'm waiting to
see who in the AFC is going to step up.

321
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,810
I mean from the rumblings I heard that it
seems like the jets seem like the, the,

322
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,950
the odds on favorite to be the next one,

323
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:29,951
to have a run as long as bill Bellacheck
sticks around after Brady leaves,

324
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:33,920
at least within the next three years.
We'll see how that goes. But what a,

325
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,970
what to run til they got another
one in them. I don't know.

326
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,250
We won five out of eight, I
couldn't be fucking happier. Um,

327
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,560
speaking of not being,
could not be happier.

328
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,590
Did anybody watch any motorcycle racing
yesterday or these past two weeks?

329
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,340
Believe the one last, uh, two
weeks ago was in, uh, Berlin.

330
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:56,450
I think it was somewhere in Germany.

331
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,860
These last two fucking races
had been so god damn exciting.

332
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's just talk about
yesterdays Austrian Grand Prix.

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,480
Okay.

334
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,310
Austrian. I believe birthplace
of Adolf Hitler, I believe. Okay.

335
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,073
Um,

336
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,540
okay.

337
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,480
You know, it's so fucking, well, I think
it's just because I live over here.

338
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:23,130
Whenever I go over there, that's
all I ever think. All right.

339
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:26,310
Whenever I'm in Paris or Mikey and I
walk up the shops, Elisa, I'm like,

340
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:30,750
Hitler drove down this fucking street
in a Mercedes Benz standing up fucking

341
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:34,650
waving to the crowd. Like he
just won a super bowl, you know?

342
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,390
And I think if you just
grow up over there,

343
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,600
it just seems like olden day shit because
you know when I sit out here in Los

344
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,570
Angeles, I don't think like a, there
was some native Americans here,

345
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,990
you know, living off the land dead,
not, not stealing any water. Um,

346
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,300
anyways, you got to watch that fuck you
get if you're going to get into racing,

347
00:20:57,301 --> 00:21:00,270
if you're like, eh, it just seemed like
they ran, you ran the fucking circle.

348
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:03,030
You need excitement.
Motorcycle racing is where it's at.

349
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,380
Moto GP is the best racing out there.
Okay.

350
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,010
And the show the past two
weeks that Jorge Lorenzo, mark,

351
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:15,230
Mark Marquez and Andre
De vi Andres Divisio.

352
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,630
So I hope that's how you say
his first name, um, have put on,

353
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,800
it's been, it's been, I,

354
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,990
they had me off the couch
miming rolling on the throttle.

355
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,060
Yeah,

356
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,620
I was screaming at the fucking TV the
last couple of laps. They basically doing,

357
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,520
I don't know, 160, 170, 180 miles an hour,

358
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,260
almost bumping into each other
like they're racing on horses,

359
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,560
which is dangerous enough.
And what did they,

360
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,540
what I'm finding is,

361
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,570
is these Ducati's have an incredible
amount of torque that the Honda can't fuck

362
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:55,700
with Jorge Lorenzo and the
visio. So both are on the, uh,

363
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,370
on the um,

364
00:21:59,410 --> 00:21:59,940
okay.

365
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,840
Ducati team, Jesus Christ
spaced took on the Ducati team.

366
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,770
A Mac Mac has is on the Honda and I
heard Latin that I heard yesterday that

367
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:10,260
Jorge Lorenzo's is going to go
to the right a Honda next year.

368
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,460
I don't know why the fuck he
would do that with his skills.

369
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,360
Why would you want to be on like a
slower bike? But Mark Marquez I think,

370
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,950
yeah,

371
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,200
I dunno. I, I think he, he just,

372
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,830
he just rides perfectly so
he gets them in the corners

373
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,340
and he just takes the perfect
line around the track beef,

374
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:34,280
literally the fastest
way around the track.

375
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:37,600
And then in the beginning of this race,
cars, uh, last week's right Keith,

376
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,610
he came in third, which is
a massive failure in his
world. And uh, Dubitsky Ozone,

377
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,670
Jorge, Lorenzo's just, they passed each
other like three times on the final lap.

378
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,300
And this week Mark Marquez
and Jorge Will Lorenzo.

379
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:54,110
There was three passes on the final lap.
It was fucking unbelievable.

380
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,420
Okay.

381
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,350
And,
um,

382
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,660
okay.

383
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,730
In the beginning of the race, mark,
mark has, I think it was just,

384
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,930
he kind of knew the power
that the Ducati's had.

385
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:06,931
So he was just trying to fucking put
as much space between himself and other

386
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,740
Ducati's as he could. It's so fascinating
that the tire that they're on,

387
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,700
and then Jorge was kind of like
laying back or Davinci also was,

388
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:17,700
I think was laying back,
couldn't get around Lorenzo.

389
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,120
But then you don't know if
that's a strategy, like,
ah, you're on soft to tires.

390
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:24,060
Go ahead and let you run a little bit,
let you chew up your fucking tires.

391
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,690
I'm on a heart attire and then I'm going
to fucking, you know, after the races,

392
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,350
like halfway over. Um, but they
do this subtle thing where they,

393
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,300
they hang back but they
still press the person. Um,

394
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,460
so hopefully the tires are all fucking
chewed up and they don't have as good a

395
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:41,880
grip and then they can, they can
run them down in the end. Uh,

396
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:44,190
I barely know what I'm talking about,
but I have to tell you,

397
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:48,710
it is fucking incredible.
Uh, you have to get into it.

398
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:52,370
And here's another great thing. Most
racist, it's like 25, 26, 27 laps.

399
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:56,900
There's no pit stops. It's a perfect thing
for an American to get into. It's fast,

400
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,410
it's exciting, and
there's no breaks. Okay.

401
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,910
Even though we have a bunch of
timeouts and shit, it's like,

402
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,670
it's like you fast forwarding
through the commercials.

403
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,360
It's like no fucking commercials.
Um, cannot say enough about it. Um,

404
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,450
and for those who actually pay attention,
mark has,

405
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,580
it looks like he's going to win the
championship. He's way out in front.

406
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,090
I don't know what happened to
Rossi this week. He, uh, must,

407
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,880
they had some sort of grid penalty.
Yuri crashed. I don't know what,

408
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:26,660
but he started in like 14th place.
But that fucking guy is,

409
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,320
he's second in points.
But as far as wins,

410
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:34,010
Golf Marquez says one five this year,
Lorenzo's one three.

411
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,900
[inaudible] has one too. And a Marquez
has been on nine different podiums.

412
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:43,070
He's like on the pony. He's been on
the podium every race but to, um,

413
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,860
so he's way out in front. He's like
200 points in the next closest guys.

414
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:50,420
Valentino, I think he has like 130,
140, so it's pretty soulful safe.

415
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,610
Barring anything, uh, major that
market has is going to win this again.

416
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,870
Uh, but I'll tell you that the show, the
three of them are putting on his fucking,

417
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,250
it's unbelievable. And I have, I
got to go to that moto GP race.

418
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,360
There's only one in the United States if
you want to go. And there's only one, uh,

419
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,500
formula one race.

420
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,240
If you want to see Louis Hamilton who's
going to go on to be one of the greats

421
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:18,860
of all time, uh, it's
an Austin, Texas and uh,

422
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,550
I highly recommend it. Um,
anyways. All right, let me do a,

423
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,630
let me do a little couple of fucking
reads here for the week there. Uh,

424
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,550
are right hotel tonight.

425
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,281
All right,

426
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:39,170
tonight is hotel tonight is the Goto App

he's fucking wicked smack.
Um,

448
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,650
life insurance is really important,
but it's also really confusing.

449
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,920
The one to four out of
10 people don't have it.

450
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,320
And maybe you're one of those people.
I have it. I have it, you know,

451
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,430
tell you right now I have such,

452
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,260
I have such an incredible
amount of life insurance.

453
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:19,590
I bet my wife last night when I was such
a dick to her probably thought about

454
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:22,470
taking me out. Um, but if
anything were to happen,

455
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,380
it's important that your
loved ones are taken care of.

456
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,310
That's so true because I know a lot of
guys that died unexpectedly and they did

457
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:31,110
not have their affairs in order.

458
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,570
And A to say that that's a
little bit of a curve ball is a,

459
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,490
is an understatement.

511
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,260
confused me just a little bit
here. I just got, I love that.

512
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,300
I love the walkaway and then he would

515
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,000
we [inaudible] just one more question.

516
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,260
Yeah.

517
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,100
And then that's the question that
gets the guy's fucking brow sweating.

518
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,923
Okay.

519
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:18,880
Unbelievable fucking show. One of my
favorite memories of my adult life was,

520
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,010
uh, I was in Rome, Italy.

521
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,440
Okay.

522
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,470
As opposed to roam North
Carolina. Bill. I was in Rome.

523
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,180
I was getting ready to do a run of dates,
so I had to get acclimated to the time.

524
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:34,980
So I went over there five
days early because my lovely
wife and my mother in law

525
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,360
and,
uh,

526
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,180
we were all jet lagged and at three in
the morning we will watch and fucking

527
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:45,020
Colombo. Somehow it was
in English, I believe

528
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:51,170
add open because we were
watching it. And uh, we just,

529
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:53,750
it was a fucking greatest night ever.
It's just one of those fucking nights.

530
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:55,790
She didn't go on vacation,
didn't have anything to do.

531
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,950
And then Colombo comes on
at three in the morning.

532
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,350
Okay.

533
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,300
And, uh, we just had the best
time ever watched it. Oh,
it's such a great show. Um,

534
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,920
but is there anything else that I wanted
to talk about before I get into your

535
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:09,630
questions? For the week. I'm a
little pressed for time here. Um,

536
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,440
oh. So, oh God. You know, I,
I been going to the gym now.

537
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,600
Everything's going great. I'm turning
my, uh, my ass cheeks. I don't know if I,

538
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,430
I mentioned to this,
I did mention since you,

539
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:24,320
but people who might've
missed last week's podcast.

540
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:29,321
I figured out the reason why I kept
having this sciatic nerve problem was

541
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:34,750
because of 20 years of being on the road,
sitting in writer's rooms,

542
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,650
just sitting down in general and
not doing legs the way I have.

543
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,183
Um,

544
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,020
my fucking glutes turned into fucking
two pieces of veal cutlet and I'm just

545
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:51,050
sitting on skin and bones back
there. So, uh, after a while, the,

546
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:55,490
the Sadek nerve gets Impinj death.
So,

547
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,270
um, anyways, I, uh,

548
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:05,050
I been doing my legs religiously and,

549
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:07,970
uh, I dunno, I'm starting to have
a little bit cube steak back there.

550
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,010
Still a poor cut of meat.
But I am a,

551
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:16,760
I am dedicated to doing this as somebody
told me a long time ago that, um,

552
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,780
one of the great things to do is to
constantly to never stop doing squats

553
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,880
because uh, you know, as you become
like an older person and everything,

554
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,860
you want to be able to
get up and out of bed,

555
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:33,020
get up and out of a chair
and that type of stuff.

556
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,310
And then also your quads are
the biggest muscle in your body.

557
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:41,240
So it's going to burn the most fat
and all of this shit. So anyways,

558
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,480
I'm not gonna lie to you guys. I,
I've been, I've been really, uh,

559
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,980
talking to some people for the first
time in my life and I realized how many

560
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,910
exercises I did it,
the gym with terrible form.

561
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,650
So now I have my form down pat.

562
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:02,480
Like I have my shoulders down
and back and speaking to my back.

563
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Like I've really been working all my
back muscles and everything because you

564
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:09,230
know, being a child of the 80s, it
was all do it working your badge,

565
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,170
what can your bench, right.
And it was all bench in.

566
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,050
And currently you do tries or whatever,
but you wouldn't do it and you would,

567
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,380
you would you do that shit, you know, like
I was talking about where it'd be like,

568
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:21,980
you know, uh, if you're picking
up somebody luggage, you know,

569
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:23,660
straight up to do your trapezius there,

570
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,300
but you wouldn't do the middle of your
back, your lower back or anything.

571
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,560
Your shoulders would get pulled forward
and up and then you'd be benching like

572
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:33,090
that and then eventually you'd
blow out your fucking rotator cuff.

573
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:36,650
So I now know not to do that.
I'm still not benching.

574
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:38,870
I'd bench now I do like,
uh,

575
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,290
eventually I'm just going
to do like dumbbells cause
it allows your shoulders to

576
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,260
move independently, you know? Uh,

577
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,700
so you're not married to one shoulder or
the other, you know, it's almost like,

578
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:53,240
you know, the different holiday
differential works and your car right.

579
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,940
It allows both wheels in the
back to turn independently.

580
00:34:55,941 --> 00:35:00,941
So one doesn't get fucking around the
turns fast than the other for your

581
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,690
mechanics out there.
Um,

582
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,990
so I was watching this guy
at the gym today and, uh,

583
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,560
like the lat pull down is the big
fucking exercise that I need to do.

584
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,180
If I'm eventually going
to get back to doing,

585
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,900
be able to handle my body weight
to do a polyp again so I can,

586
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:22,550
when my bet of being able to
do 10 of those when I'm 70,

587
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,780
um, I have less than 20 years before
him 70. If you could fucking believe it.

588
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:30,750
That's how fast life goes by. Started
this podcast, it was only 30 days.

589
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,210
Um,
so this guy comes in,

590
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,160
he's probably my age,
but in my vein, Venus,

591
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,180
I probably thinks he's like
five years older than me,

592
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,560
but I do that a lot where I think
people are 10 years older than me.

593
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,580
They'd like three years younger than me
and it's obviously not because the way I

594
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:50,910
look, it's my fucking
vanity. So, uh, this guy, he,

595
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,140
I think he's in a hurry or whatever,

596
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:55,140
but he was doing these lat fucking
pull downs and it was like,

597
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,060
rather than sitting up, you
know, sitting up straight,

598
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:03,240
shoulders down and back and then not
letting your shoulders coming up,

599
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:07,520
standing up, grabbing the bar and
then coming down. And I do, you know,

600
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,980
explode down one, two and then
one, two, three, four going up,

601
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,850
right with weight that you can handle,
keeping your shoulders down and back.

602
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:18,380
This fucking guy was doing
almost the whole stack. And what,

603
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,400
how he would get it down
was as he brought it down,

604
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:22,830
he would like lean back and then he would,

605
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,800
he would use the momentum of
leaning back and then pull it down.

606
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,700
And I took video. Really, I would
never show this guy in the internet,

607
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,660
but just to show

608
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,300
my trainer and I was just like,
just out of curiosity,

609
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:41,301
what muscles is this person actually
working instead of their lats?

610
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,530
Cause it's the lat pull down and the
person looked at it and said he's working

611
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:49,260
his triceps,
his groin,

612
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,340
and he's on his way to
having a herniated disc.

613
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,240
And I got to tell you the amount of
fucking people that I've, I've seen in,

614
00:36:57,241 --> 00:37:00,090
and I'm not trying to be, you know,
I know a couple, I know my form now,

615
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:03,000
so I'm trying to be like to Snob at the
gym. I'm just letting you guys know,

616
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,120
having worked through this fucking
injury for the last two years,

617
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:08,970
because I was that guy,
I was never quite that bad,

618
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,680
but my shoulders were up and all that
and I had this big fucking problem.

619
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:14,820
Um,

620
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,530
that ended up being a blessing because I
found out how fucked up my body was and

621
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,770
I needed to get it all twisted and I'll,
you know,

622
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:27,210
fucking yoked and all these different
places and now I'm trying to build it back

623
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,180
up again. But, uh, I was always
one of those people like,

624
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,740
why am I going to get a personal trainer?
Like,

625
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:34,140
I would always just look at somebody
doing an exercise and be like, oh,

626
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:36,990
what's that for? Okay,
I'll try those. And I, I,

627
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,380
it's fucking pointless
unless you get the form down.

628
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,450
So you really should get a trainer.

629
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:46,380
And then I imagined trainers are
just like comedians where you know,

630
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:47,970
you have your top 10%,

631
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,520
the David tells the Dave Chappelle's
those level and then you got a bunch of

632
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,400
fucking Dick joke hacks out there that
you've got to make sure that you have

633
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:59,130
like the right fucking person.
Um,

634
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,810
and I guess the red flag would be if
they just said, hey, do this exercise.

635
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,810
And they didn't work too
much on your form. Um,

636
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,970
make sure you get somebody that,
that teaches you the form and all of that.

637
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:16,890
And uh, so you don't hurt yourself in
an end up in the situation that I'm in.

638
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:19,710
And that poor bastard at the gym,
I wanted to say something to him,

639
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,030
but he had like this fucking crazy type A,

640
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:25,320
I'm in a fucking rush.

641
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,800
Fibe I think I have a,
I'm not gonna say,

642
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,540
it's almost like telling somebody that
they're working out wrong is almost like

643
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:37,030
going up to somebody you don't know and
giving them advice on how to raise their

644
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:41,320
kid.
I feel like this,

645
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,200
what do you guys think?
And it's just something you don't do.

646
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,480
I think if you will
like a personal trainer,

647
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,660
you almost have to come
in like an apology. Amen.

648
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,930
Not trying to get in your kitchen
here, buddy, but, uh, you're gonna,

649
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,690
you're gonna get a
herniated disc doing that.

650
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,710
Yeah.

651
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,040
But then [inaudible] going to have to
like go into his ego and be it, hey,

652
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,460
take half of what you're lifting
and then do it the right way.

653
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:05,840
And I just don't think he's,
you know,

654
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,390
you know what back
doctors need business to,

655
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:12,060
why the fuck am I going to get involved?
You know,

656
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,310
what am I good am I go there and start
mansplaining and then all of a sudden the

657
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:20,380
lesbians at the gym and
the feminist start yelling.

658
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,890
I actually should say lesbian,
I should say feminists. Right?

659
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,610
Yeah.

660
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,240
I'm sure there's some openminded
lesbians out there that wouldn't mind

661
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,000
a little lat pulldown fucking a

662
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,260
okay.

663
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,093
Explanation.

664
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,073
Yeah.

665
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,310
All right. If you were confused by
that, don't worry. I was to, okay,

666
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,350
let's get into the
questions for the week here.

667
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,153
MMM.

668
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,270
All right. Fresh box. Okay, wait,
wait. Let me see here. Okay, bill,

669
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:53,500
great emails for the week. A fresh
box 23. Got a lot of responses.

670
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:58,501
Your request for advice for the 23
year old virgin in London with strict

671
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,344
parents.

672
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,580
Uh,

673
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,720
I only included responses
from chicks because

674
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,800
that's who you asked, uh,
to get emails in from a,

675
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,590
but it should be noted about 50
guys wrote in with their advice.

676
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,640
Responses are from around the world
with different advice. Yeah, I figured,

677
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:19,850
you know, women would know better. So
anyways, there's this woman, she's 23.

678
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:23,000
She's working on her goddamn doctorate
or something crazy like that and she

679
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,740
wants to know she's a virgin.

680
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,940
She wants to know how to get out there
and meet a nice fella instead of, uh,

681
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,520
some guy on Tinder I believe is, is the
bad dating site. If that's a reference.

682
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:37,520
I hear younger comics using all
right. Fresh buckets. Here we go.

683
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:40,820
Here's some women
helping out fresh box 23,

684
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,810
uh okay.

685
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,270
Cause cause her vagina's fresh
as in any dirty dicks in there.

686
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,410
And she's 23 years old. That's right.
Fresh box. 23 was in the subject. Okay.

687
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,710
All right. Clam podcast listener.
All right. Uh, hey there,

688
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,800
Bilbo Baggins.

689
00:40:57,801 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm a fellow clam podcast listener
of responding to the 23 year old lady

690
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,150
who wrote on your Monday morning podcasts.
Uh,

691
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,810
don't go on them.
Don't go on them dating apps.

692
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Most of them just want to bang or they
are closet gay men or they are serial

693
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:20,630
killers who still live with their moms.

694
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,550
I also did not date until my mid twenties
for the same reason and I found that

695
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:30,551
the most effective way to meet guys was
to get a bunch of single girlfriends and

696
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:34,380
go speed dating.
You get to meet these

697
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,210
men in the flesh and see them
sweating in their shirts awkwardly.

698
00:41:39,211 --> 00:41:44,070
Palming they're sweaty drinks.
Where do you go? Speed dating?

699
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,750
Uh, it's funny and endearing and you'll
have a better chance getting matched to a

700
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:52,560
human being. The fact that they were
nervous. I would think that there,

701
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:55,230
there's something about, and that
they're a better guy, you know,

702
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,700
I can't say it better guy,

703
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:59,670
but then you don't want to be all
nervous when they're going out in the job

704
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:03,330
world. It's a difficult, difficult thing
trying to pick the right person anyways.

705
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,420
Other options are to join a church group
that does charity work or meet affairs

706
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,971
at good day.

707
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:13,560
You meet somebody or as a fellow
studious working professional,

708
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:16,620
it's school but don't bang anyone at work.

709
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,840
That's how I am now. That's how I
met my now soon to be ex husband.

710
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,490
Oh my God,

711
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,120
she just gave all of this great advice
and then you have a failed relationship

712
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:30,810
at the end. What is she supposed to do?
I think there was some good things there.

713
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,140
Do you want a church group
that does charity work?

714
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:37,200
Maybe not to the church if you're not
into that shit, do some charity work.

715
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,890
But then, uh, just make
sure you, you have your vet,

716
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,660
cause that's also where I would think
a psycho Miko to try to get some,

717
00:42:45,661 --> 00:42:46,780
you know,

718
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,590
some open minded slash a little
naive when it comes to street smarts.

719
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,220
Always have your guard up. Uh, oh,

720
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:59,570
did I mention I saw that movie eighth
grade? Did I tell you that? And I, I need,

721
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,790
I went to go see it.
I didn't even know Bo Burnham directed it.

722
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,370
I just heard it was good and God damn it,

723
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:09,850
I wanted to see a movie and I
went to go see it. And it's,

724
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:11,640
it's fucking great.
It's great.

725
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:14,490
There's one scene in there
that is excruciating to watch.

726
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,700
But I think it's important that,
uh,

727
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,093
you know,

728
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:25,120
like preteen, teen girls see it. Uh,

729
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,120
cause there's, it's really a, I dunno,

730
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,140
it's fucking brutal slot creatures out
there. All right. But it, it doesn't get,

731
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:34,720
you know, it gets creepy enough, but
not to the point where you're like,

732
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:37,570
I wish I never saw this fucking movie.
Um,

733
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,500
okay.

734
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,370
But it's a, you know, the way it
was handled, I thought was, was, was

735
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,250
perfect. And, uh,

736
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:48,310
it's quite to see a fucking comedian out
there directing a movie that good. Huh?

737
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,220
Everybody thinks all we could do is
jump around talking about our dicks.

738
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:56,020
Look at that. Look at Boalt burner.
Crushing it. Um, so go check that out.

739
00:43:56,021 --> 00:44:00,790
Support a fellow comedian and
support cinema. Live cinema.

740
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,480
Uh, all right. Fresh box
23. Hey, Billy bobbled Dick.

741
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,700
That's a great one.
I frigging love your podcast.

742
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,050
You're truly the inner monologue in my
head for almost every scenario in my life.

743
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:17,540
I find myself in, I'm a 29
year old front door, right?

744
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,673
Sure.

745
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,090
Jada have dude, Dorchester, mass at m,

746
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,300
a biology student in a
committed relationship.

747
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:32,400
My advice to this broad from England
looking for love dating apps or what I

748
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:34,500
would describe as a last resort,

749
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:36,510
and I believe that's something
that I suggested to her.

750
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,070
Maybe I'm just old school.

751
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:42,450
But the reality is most people are
dating apps are most people in real life

752
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:44,280
these days.
Uh,

753
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,690
what you see on bumble is
what you see in real life.

754
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,420
There's not really one app
that's better than the other.

755
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:55,650
They all house most of the
Douche baggery in the world.

756
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,990
So what's the difference? Meet people
platonically is what I would suggest.

757
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,610
Who wants a baby daddy from Tinder? All
right, well how did she do this? But Hey,

758
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:07,770
who am I to judge?
Get some girlfriends.

759
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,830
Then they introduce you to single friends
at a fucking barbecue or some shit

760
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:14,280
like that.

761
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:18,450
I do know some girlfriends who have
met their husbands off dating sites,

762
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,830
but hey, come to think of it.
Their husbands seriously suck.

763
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,480
Seriously suck. Just so many dicks
on so many levels. All right.

764
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,510
So I think dating apps is out.
That's what I've learned so far.

765
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,440
Keep on keeping on. I can't wait to see
it. The garden. Oh wait, wait. That's it.

766
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,470
So what was your advice? Okay. Basically
stay away from the dating apps.

767
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,650
It seems like he get with
a group of girlfriends,

768
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,500
you go out in a herd, there's the
guys are in the tall grass peaking up,

769
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:53,400
waiting to find a weak one. And I
guess somehow your, I dunno. Anyways.

770
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,190
Um, right. Let me just
read the rest of this.

771
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:01,890
Keep on keeping on. I can't wait to
see it. The guide in October, Bill,

772
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:06,660
you red headed stepchild and Hey
England broad, it's, it'll get easier.

773
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:09,510
Just stick your tits out there and it,

774
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,940
it's like flies to honey.
You'll quickly realize how easy it is.

775
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,050
Uh, all right. There's a lot of advice and
a lot of different directions in there,

776
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,660
but you know she's studying biology.
She's from Dorchester,

777
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:24,240
so she's getting a lot of mixed
signals, sir. All right, fresh.

778
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:27,510
Brock's 23 from our lady.
The ability, big tense.

779
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,410
I just finished listening to your
podcast of August 6th and I have a few

780
00:46:31,411 --> 00:46:33,720
suggestions for the girl
who's late to the dating game.

781
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,280
I'm only 21 but I'm certainly not fresh
out of the box that I know a few things.

782
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,940
Number one, use bumble, not Tinder. Okay.

783
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:44,680
Now she's saying she's saying
a dating app on bumble.

784
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:48,480
The girls have to message first
so you could do some flirting.

785
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,530
Okay.

786
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,450
Oh,
so you can do all the for flirting.

787
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:56,920
You could do some filtering out of due
to seem creepy without feeling pressured

788
00:46:56,921 --> 00:47:01,210
to respond to a message. Tinder
is good. If you want to get laid,

789
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,470
if you're trying to weed out the guys
who just want to get their dicks wet,

790
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,380
tell them you're saving
yourself until marriage.

791
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,330
You can always change your
mind later. Uh, quote. Oh,

792
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,030
so you just tell him you saving yourself
till marriage and that just makes a

793
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:19,030
bunch of good. Most of the guys will
just, who are just looking to get laid.

794
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:23,290
I guess we'll leave you
alone anyways. Number two, my
friends love to pimp me out.

795
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,550
I'm sure if you asked yours, they
would, two, three, like bill said,

796
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:31,390
find an activity. Lots of cities
have sports leagues that could,

797
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,570
that could be a good place to spark
to start. Thanks and go fuck yourself.

798
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,660
I really think out of all the
advice that I just read there,

799
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,650
I would say stay away from all dating
apps and I, you need to get a hobby.

800
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:48,600
You need to carve out some time,
some social time and like,

801
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,340
you know, some sort of
sport, charity work,

802
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,820
um,
a cooking class.

803
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,810
Just get yourself out there where
it's like, those are really good.

804
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:05,610
I feel like there's a lot of a
decent people in those things.

805
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:09,930
Sports, you know, he could
find the controlling type a
dick, but you know that guy.

806
00:48:09,931 --> 00:48:12,090
Who else is going to crush it a
lot of times in the real world.

807
00:48:12,091 --> 00:48:14,790
So depends on if you want
an in ground pool or not.

808
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:19,440
I don't know what you're
looking for. Um, but they go,

809
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:22,530
there is some advice for you. Good
luck and don't settle. All right.

810
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,690
Don't settle for guys. Be a dick.
Fuck him. There's this, you know,

811
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,530
the, the, there's going to be
a good guy out there for you.

812
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,290
You don't ever have to fucking sell. Send
it back. It's votes too cold. All right.

813
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:39,750
Black Guy's perspective on
stand your ground. I dear bill,

814
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,700
I hope you the lovely Nia
and the tet talented toddler
are doing well. All right.

815
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,940
First off, there's a lot of white guys
saying they're black guys on the Internet,

816
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:52,180
so we'll see how this goes.
Uh, or there's a lot of, uh,

817
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,110
Republicans saying they're
Democrats and vice versa. You know,

818
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:59,040
I'm a Republican and I got to say no,
I hate Donald Trump.

819
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,170
And I'm a Republican.
They always do that shit.

820
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:04,320
So who knows if this guy is black
or not. But anyways, here we go.

821
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:07,470
I wanted to share my opinion on the
growing frustrations with situations like

822
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,900
this and how they are handled,
viewed and discuss.

823
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,450
No resist respect to you or your platform.

824
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:16,290
I respect where you're coming from
on this topic. I am a 28 year old,

825
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,400
born and raised in Brooklyn. That
may not mean what it used to. Uh,

826
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:23,130
but I know you're familiar
with what this detail implies.

827
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,810
Imagine Boyz in the hood,

828
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:29,811
but dial down to about four out of
10 that's roughly what I grew up in.

829
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,530
I had to learn how to avoid and resolve
conflicts like the one that led to that

830
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:36,750
disgusting and pointless loss of life.

831
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,430
I want to begin by disagreeing with the
shooter deciding to pull the trigger.

832
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,630
Yeah, it was ridiculous. He got
pushed down on the ground. Okay.

833
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,490
And the guy started to walk away.

834
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,390
I personally could not pull the trigger
on a person like that though I can

835
00:49:50,391 --> 00:49:53,390
imagine being in a position
leading up to that moment.

836
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,960
I don't want to live in a world
where this behavior is condoned.

837
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,230
I'd also like to point out that people
where I'm from pulled the trigger for

838
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:04,730
less.
Yeah.

839
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:08,720
I'm not advocating that one group of
people shouldn't shoot people and other

840
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:11,150
people should. I'm just saying, okay.

841
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,250
That if you yell at somebody's girlfriend
or wife and the guy comes out and

842
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:20,150
pushes you down to the ground,
that's not a reason to use deadly force.

843
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,030
I mean that's like, that's like
wild west Shit. Um, anyways.

844
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:29,880
I think all of the adults made bad
choices that escalated to the situation.

845
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:34,881
100% agree with that first using the
differently labeled parking when there are

846
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:37,410
other available spots is a dick move?

847
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:41,370
Absolutely arguing in defense of a
move like that. This is even worse.

848
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,080
This is speculation,

849
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,770
but knowing what I know about my own
people in a certain type of black woman,

850
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,150
if I as a black man even politely
said something to that woman,

851
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,390
there is a very little chance she
respond politely. And this is where,

852
00:50:54,391 --> 00:50:56,460
I don't know if this is a fucking
white dude or a black guy,

853
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,330
insert me in that situation on our demand
would have knocked me down just like

854
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:04,660
he did the white to the
white guy and fuck me up. Uh,

855
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,460
no news coverage. My own people would
have said, I should have shut the fuck up.

856
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,030
Yeah. But he didn't fuck him up. He just
pushed him down and started to walk away.

857
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,770
If he pushed him down and
started swinging on him. Um,

858
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,270
I gotta be honest even then.

859
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:19,950
Okay.

860
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,280
Even then I feel like to then pull a gun,
this guy's throwing hands,

861
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:27,630
don't you throw hands back
is just like the untouchables.

862
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,560
So brings a knife and you bring a gun.
I mean,

863
00:51:31,561 --> 00:51:34,890
this is literally a fucking
gas station anyways.

864
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,100
This is why I wouldn't have said Shit.
I would have minded my own business.

865
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:42,870
That's the school I'm front, but that
is the pro and con of where I come from.

866
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,300
And the world in general.
I suppose you mind your own business,

867
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:49,350
but then you add to a culture where
people disobey laws bigger, small,

868
00:51:49,351 --> 00:51:51,690
and no one is supposed
to stand up for decency.

869
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,570
Though it is not hurting
anyone in that usual scent.

870
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,730
It's not cool to park in those spots
and it shouldn't be tolerated. Yes.

871
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:03,510
But shouldn't that guy of step to the guy,
you know,

872
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:07,620
rather than waiting to the guy leaves
in the yells at the woman, then he put,

873
00:52:07,621 --> 00:52:12,621
he kind of put them in that fucking
macho position to stick up for his lady.

874
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:18,060
Yeah. Everybody was wrong in
that, you know, but I mean

875
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,290
to then turn around and fucking shoot
that guy, I mean it's just, it's as he's,

876
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,930
you know, starts to walk away. It's just
fucking insane. And he was the black,

877
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:31,680
I should not have initiated the
physical contact. Uh, never wound what?

878
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:36,260
You can't kill. Uh, or the black version.

879
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:39,240
Don't start shit. You can't finish. Um,

880
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:44,290
it didn't even look like he tried to
dissolve the conflict in another way.

881
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:48,620
Also, you never know what a stranger is
carrying legal weaponry or otherwise.

882
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:52,580
Yeah, that's true. In New York everything
is illegal, but that doesn't stop anyone.

883
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:57,050
The black guy was about to stop that
white man out. Do you think that,

884
00:52:57,051 --> 00:52:59,870
cause I thought he pushed him
down and then walked away.

885
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,330
I recognize that body language anywhere.
He only backed up after seeing the gun.

886
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:09,560
At which point the entire
situation should have been over.

887
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,790
That's another thing.
He could have waved the gun at him.

888
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,130
I'm not saying that the lady driving the
car or that guy did everything right,

889
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:20,060
but to just fucking shoot the guy.
Um,

890
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,360
okay.

891
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,580
It's not somebody who, who, who
continues to charge when they a gun.

892
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,980
I'm a detailed,

893
00:53:27,981 --> 00:53:31,370
I'd like to point out is that the black
guy did not put his hands up when the

894
00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:35,270
white man pulled on him.
This is because we,

895
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:38,900
black men have to look bad ass to matter
this or I don't fucking know about this

896
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:39,734
shit.

897
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:41,803
Yeah,

898
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:46,820
I dunno, but I dunno who fucking wrote
this. You said, this is because we,

899
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:49,430
black men have to look bad ass.
No matter the circumstances.

900
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:54,200
Whoever my hands would bent so high in
the air, I could have tickled God's feet.

901
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:59,201
The white guys supposedly known for
fucking with people over disabled parking

902
00:53:59,691 --> 00:54:03,770
spots.
He also supposedly mentally unstable.

903
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,240
If those are facts,

904
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:08,390
he shouldn't have been on the street or
allowed to carry a fucking gun. Yeah,

905
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:10,790
well that's another thing too. They,
I actually do a bit about this,

906
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:14,630
how they shut down and not houses. When
I was a kid, you will fucking crazy.

907
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:19,631
They put you in the nut house and
you combine the fact that not houses,

908
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:22,820
they just have those people walking down
the street now and people who are into

909
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:25,430
guns don't want to wait more
than 15 minutes to get one.

910
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,880
You're going to have a
fucking problem anyways.

911
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:31,850
None of this shit should have happened.
I'm tired of seeing my people,

912
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:36,050
especially men die over dumb shit and
it only becomes news if there is a white

913
00:54:36,051 --> 00:54:37,100
person involved.
Also,

914
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:41,390
men have to rise above getting into
goofy arguments on behalf of women,

915
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,410
especially when they're wrong. She's
likely not going to get hurt, but you,

916
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:49,190
you are as a dude. Yeah, that is true.

917
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,900
Not sure if you can feel
where I'm coming from,

918
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:53,900
but I want to make my fellow
black men to be smarter and safer.

919
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,660
Kids need their father's
best of fan for Brooklyn.

920
00:54:56,661 --> 00:55:00,980
Ps met you once at the beacon
theater show. We'll see you at MSG.

921
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,570
You are awesome. Well,
thank you very much.

922
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,190
I agree with everything that you said
there. Uh, although I don't think it,

923
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:11,960
it looked like he was gonna stop him out,
as you said.

924
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,100
I also think that all you need, you just
take out a gun. If you take out a gun,

925
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:19,960
everybody fucking runs. I don't know
why that guy didn't fucking broad.

926
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,620
That'd be it.
Just stunned.

927
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:26,480
Although I remember being at a meet and
greet one of the last ones I did and

928
00:55:26,481 --> 00:55:31,481
this guy fucking went to take a picture
of his girlfriend or wife wanted a

929
00:55:31,641 --> 00:55:33,710
picture with me and he went to reach into,

930
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:38,740
pull out his camera in a fucking loaded
nine millimeter fell on the floor.

931
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:40,830
Yeah.

932
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:44,370
And this is how I reacted. I
went whoa. And pointed at it.

933
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,250
Then he picked it up.

934
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:48,990
Yeah.

935
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,890
And ran out of there because we were in
a casino and it was on native American

936
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:56,250
land and you're not allowed. It turned
out he was an off duty cop. You know,

937
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,510
they kind of fucking handled it.

938
00:55:57,511 --> 00:56:01,620
But I remember saying to the
security guys at Jesus Christ,

939
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,510
I go, you fucking see that. He goes, what
happened? I go up, fucking guy, just,

940
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:09,960
I had a loaded nine millimeter,

941
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:12,500
just fell on the ground and
the security guy goes, oh,

942
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:16,760
he's lucky I didn't see that. And I
was like an almost 10 in the, but, um,

943
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,780
that's where my,

944
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:22,780
my culdesac suburban upbringing came
into effect where that was my first with

945
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,750
that.
So I was stunned.

946
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,720
But now I've played that over
my head a zillion times over.

947
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:28,900
Okay.

948
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,810
That ever happens again? Kick the fucking
gut wall. If it's a glock, you know,

949
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,770
she can kick it. Anything else that
might go off? I, I tackle the guy.

950
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,090
Run anything other than be like,
oh, your gun's right there, sir.

951
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,100
Um,
all right.

952
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,750
Okay.

953
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:48,170
Uh, out of everything you said, I
really, truly believe that whole,

954
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,960
the reason why I don't fuck with people,
aside from the fact that I'm,

955
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:56,880
I'm half a century old and you know,
never really took any martial arts. I,

956
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:59,790
you don't know what the
fuck you're running into.

957
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,190
Okay.

958
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:05,750
You have no fucking idea that training,
the weaponry, the level of psycho,

959
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,370
the kind of day they're having.

960
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,470
MMM.

961
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,290
If a loved one just passed away,

962
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:14,710
you have no idea what's going on to
somebody fucking life and you are rolling

963
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,660
the fucking dice with your life
when you make a move like that.

964
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,380
And um,

965
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,340
which I owned it,
I understand,

966
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:28,341
but I think it is fucking insane that
there's a state out there that allows

967
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:34,041
citizens like the fucking wild west
to solve their problems like that.

968
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,153
You know?

969
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,640
Okay.

970
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,730
That you could just shoot an unarmed
guy that pushed you down on the ground.

971
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:43,140
It's just fucking, it's just, it's, that's
such some shit out of like Wyatt Earp,

972
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,820
you know, and I, I, you know, all your
gun guys are going to flip out. Okay.

973
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,650
Just just picture how the,
imagine the,

974
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,020
like the average fucking person drives.

975
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,380
Okay.

976
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:01,270
Just watch the average person go through
a fucking security line at the airport.

977
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:02,500
Okay.

978
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,820
The amount of awareness, the
amount of empathy, the mouth,

979
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,740
a mouth breather and fucking morons.

980
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:11,620
And the fact that any of them
can go out and get a fucking gun

981
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,220
and then stand their ground using debt.

982
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:22,080
Fucking 20 year old laptop between
their ears. That is their fucking brain.

983
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:27,000
I mean, that is some crazy,
crazy level of fucking

984
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:33,470
second degree. I mean, second
Second Amendment fucking freedom.

985
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:38,020
That usually leads to fucking second
degree murder as far as [inaudible].

986
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,800
And I am, I am not an anti
gun guy, but I am also like,

987
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:44,640
you know, I just don't
want people, you know,

988
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,680
walking around like they're
in fucking Westworld.

989
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,613
MMM.

990
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,820
All right. Girlfriend's parents
know in defense of Florida,

991
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:59,320
you don't see that every day though.
You know, you do not see that everyday.

992
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:00,620
So I don't know if they'd be,
there's already,

993
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:05,110
there's always arguments on both sides.
Girlfriend's parents know, hey bill,

994
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:09,850
I'm 17 going into my senior year of high
school and I'm dating this amazing girl

995
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,740
who's about to be a Jew.
Yeah.

996
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,670
Uh, she's half black, half Filipino,

997
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:22,760
Filipina IA is that he said Filipino.
Um,

998
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,370
I'm a few days darker.
I'm a few shades days,

999
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:30,720
few shades darker than a
piece of printer paper.

1000
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,350
Anyways, uh, Hey, welcome
to the club buddy. Anyways,

1001
00:59:37,351 --> 00:59:41,190
we'd been dating for about a month now
and obviously we've hooked up a couple of

1002
00:59:41,191 --> 00:59:43,530
times and neither one of
our parents even knew,

1003
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,420
uh,

1004
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:50,910
a couple of days ago her parents asked
her if I was a virgin and for some God

1005
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,740
unknown reason,

1006
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,050
she told them that I had been with a
couple of other girls during high school.

1007
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,200
That wasn't a big deal until today when
they started asking if her and I had

1008
01:00:08,201 --> 01:00:09,730
ever had sex.

1009
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:16,090
Apparently she didn't get the female
line gene and told them everything.

1010
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:21,610
Well, I mean, sounds like she has a really
open relationship with their parents.

1011
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,710
I don't know what to do.

1012
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:27,910
I'm sure as a dad you can imagine
what you would do to a guy.

1013
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:32,911
In my position and her dad is six
foot four 260 pound black dude,

1014
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,300
I'm about six foot two
one 60 on a good day.

1015
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,520
So I'm not stacking up well against that.

1016
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:43,270
I'm not looking forward to going back
over to our house and talking to her

1017
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:47,860
parents or meeting her older brother
that's coming to town on Monday.

1018
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,120
Any advice from you and Nia and how to
not get killed would be great. Yeah.

1019
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,770
MMM

1020
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:55,703
yeah,
dude.

1021
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,880
I would be a fucking man about
it and I would go over there

1022
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,480
and just be honest.

1023
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,750
Just say what you'd done and how you
feel about her daughter and then what?

1024
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:13,450
What are they gonna give me? What
are you going to do? I, I don't,

1025
01:01:13,451 --> 01:01:17,830
I dunno. I Dunno. How old are you?
Is is how old? You're 17 okay. See,

1026
01:01:17,831 --> 01:01:21,820
I don't know what the fucking hell.
How old is your girlfriend? Do?

1027
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:26,710
Don't listen to me. I Dunno what the
fuck to do. I don't know what to do now.

1028
01:01:26,711 --> 01:01:28,090
You got me all fucking nervous.

1029
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,730
I would have to think that if she fucking,
if he asked her,

1030
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,210
they asked her what she's doing
and she was just honest about it.

1031
01:01:37,211 --> 01:01:41,920
They seem a little fucking
open minded. Like if, if, if,

1032
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,420
I dunno, this is crazy
thing to say, but if,

1033
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:48,760
if she knew that he was going to
flip out and try to fucking kill you,

1034
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,080
why would she say something? Uh, she
could be scared of him. I Dunno dude,

1035
01:01:53,081 --> 01:01:57,250
you got yourself into a little
bit of a quagmire. I have no idea.

1036
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,770
I have no idea,
dude.

1037
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:03,450
Okay.

1038
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,120
I would go over there and when he says,

1039
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:07,103
hmm,

1040
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,620
what's up little man, I'd be like, Hey,

1041
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:18,640
um, you know, I guess
that's when, as a man,

1042
01:02:18,641 --> 01:02:20,420
you get into your hypocritical years

1043
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:25,190
when you meet another guy who is doing
or trying to do exactly what the fuck you

1044
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:26,540
were doing when you were 17.

1045
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,050
It doesn't sound like you'll be a running
around trying to dog at the checks and

1046
01:02:30,051 --> 01:02:34,130
do all of this type of shit. I don't
fucking know. You know what? I don't know.

1047
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:37,920
I don't fucking know.

1048
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,680
And now I'm thinking of what's going
to happen when my daughter gets that

1049
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:42,450
fucking age.
I have no idea.

1050
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,360
I have no idea.
Um,

1051
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,780
all I know is that I'm hoping she's at
least going to be a brown belt in Jiu

1052
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,840
Jitsu, you know, which I
actually, I, I, you know,

1053
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,120
I think every woman
should learn that shit.

1054
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:59,783
You know,

1055
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:03,700
it's perfect. It's in close.
And if a guy's, you know,

1056
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,540
doing something you don't want them to do,
it's so fucking easy.

1057
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,020
Okay.

1058
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,320
Armbar get them in a triangle because
there, you know what the fuck, you know,

1059
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:16,000
choke 'em out and then just call
the cops. There he is. It's perfect.

1060
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,753
You know,

1061
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,040
I don't fucking know. I,
anyways, Jesus' question.

1062
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:26,190
I get me thinking all this crazy shit.
I, all I can say is good luck to you sir.

1063
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:31,140
And, uh, you've got some
decisions to make. I mean, what,

1064
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,270
don't you want to keep seeing this
woman? I mean, what are you going to do?

1065
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,140
I feel like you kinda gotta go over there,
so the guy respects you.

1066
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,060
Then what's he gonna do?
Six foot four.

1067
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:43,040
He's gonna beat the shit out of a 17 year
old. Wait a minute. You're not Florida,

1068
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,310
are you?
If you're in Florida,

1069
01:03:44,311 --> 01:03:47,130
don't go over there cause he
might stand his ground. All right.

1070
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:50,640
I gotta go you guys.
Uh, thank you so much.

1071
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:52,590
You're awesome for writing in
all you women who wrote in.

1072
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,670
All you ladies are rolled in.

1073
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:56,490
I really appreciate that because I wanted
to give that woman some good advice

1074
01:03:56,491 --> 01:03:59,430
and we needed to hear it from the ladies.
Um,

1075
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:03,850
I'm going to be in Las Vegas
this weekend with Joe. Nick,

1076
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,010
I'm flying out in the fucking helicopter
and then the day after I'm getting up,

1077
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:08,761
before I go home,

1078
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:12,390
I'm flying over to Utah to fly through
some like fucking canyons and all this

1079
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:15,270
shit that I'm coming back.
It's going to be fucking incredible.

1080
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:19,140
And I'm picking up eight hours on
the stick, creeping towards 200.

1081
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:21,600
That'll get me up to about a buck 85.
Okay.

1082
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,673
MMM.

1083
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:25,130
And, uh, I'm very,

1084
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:30,080
very excited and I've decided that I want
to get my instrument rating as a pilot.

1085
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:32,720
Cause every pilot I talked to is like,
that is a fucking game changer.

1086
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:34,820
I just have to carve out
some time where I can do it.

1087
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:38,180
And I figure if Tom Cruise could figure
out how to point it at the ground and do

1088
01:04:38,181 --> 01:04:41,610
fucking three sixties as he stored it,
goddammit,

1089
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:45,020
I could get my instrument rating. All
right. That's it. Go Fuck Yourself.

1090
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:46,610
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
