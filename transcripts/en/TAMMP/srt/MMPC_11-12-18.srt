1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,990
Okay.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,980
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:06,970
It's bill burr and it's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,260
November 12th,
2000 and fucking 18.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:15,620
I still haven't fixed this stupid
microphone. Um, how are you?

6
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:18,550
How's it going?
How's it going in your world?

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,180
I know everybody who hates the
Patriots is, is, is happy today.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,450
Jesus Christ. What? A
bunch of babies, man.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,420
I've never seen a fucking
team while maybe not to dupe,

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,420
I guess we used to fucking
hate the Yankees like that,

11
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:35,870
but it's just like every time we lose a
fucking game, it's like eight days. Yeah.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,490
Other wheels coming. Oh, I
mean, how many fucking times?

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,110
One of these times it's going to be the
end. Cherub. Brady's fucking 41 years old.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,890
All these fucking jerk offs talking shit.
And by the way,

15
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:51,560
Dion Louis out were really
disappointed with that.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:52,990
Yeah.

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,560
They asked them, was it personally? He
said, is it personal? He said, hell yeah.

18
00:00:56,561 --> 00:01:00,760
It's personal. That's what happens when
you go cheap. You get your ass kicked.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,430
It's like, dude, this
isn't something new. This,

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,490
this was going on way before when you
would like fucking eight years old.

21
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:13,030
This is the way they ran the team and
you went in there and you got yourself a

22
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:17,470
ringer to, what's the problem? Jesus
Christ. Yeah, it is what happens.

23
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:19,620
Would you go cheap?
You'll lose a game in November.

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,570
These guys just acted like they just
knocked this out of the fucking playoffs.

25
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,400
Um,
however,

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,240
I couldn't help but think when I did
not watch one second and that game

27
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,190
yesterday, sorry, I was
flying back from Chicago.

28
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,620
I watched some highlights of it and uh,

29
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:37,880
I hadn't seen my Kiddo in
like a week. So, you know,

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,940
obviously I'm not going to come home and
sit down and watch a fucking football

31
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:43,820
game. I do have it on tape. I am
going to fucking watch it or whatever.

32
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:47,720
What have you, what? Whatever
you kids call it. I have
to, I have it on the cloud.

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,740
Um, yeah, it just sounded like, you
know, they, they were the better team.

34
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,870
They fucking came in. They
were ready to go. We weren't,

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,730
and we got behind early in
and, and we didn't win the
game, you know, I don't know.

36
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,510
I want to be seven and three. I don't know
what the fuck everybody's is. You know,

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,710
this guy just goes, it's just, just
a blip on the radar as it were,

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,630
played 700 ball.
That's how high the fuck standards.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,420
So anyways, um, have a,

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,820
I think the titans just won a fucking
championship according to Dion Lewis.

41
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,780
You know, I don't get it. I love
that guy. But like I was, you know?

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,680
Okay.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,110
You know what I mean?
I like it.

44
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,600
I don't understand why people
say shit like that. In November,

45
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,850
if you learned anything in New England,

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,020
you know that November you didn't
win anything. You won a game.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,830
That's it. Congratulations.
I got to tell you though,

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,570
I couldn't help but think about that
lunatic that I saw in that sports bar in

49
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:52,750
New York City a few weeks ago when the
Patriots were playing the chiefs and now

50
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:57,140
that guy was just yelling, go and
fucking, you know, this is it.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,340
This is how it is. Now you guys are
over looking around the bar. It's over.

52
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:04,890
Right? I can't imagine. I was psyched.

53
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:08,940
He was yesterday when the Patriots loss
and the chiefs one cause now I believe

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,130
the chiefs have a two game lead despite
head to head. You know, we won the game,

55
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,780
but like that's a really good look for
them. If we got to try to beat them again.

56
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,970
Uh, in Kansas City, well the cheeks
finally pushed their way through.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,790
I gotta be honest, if the chiefs still
get through, if they do get past us,

58
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,470
if we can actually make it there,

59
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:32,570
if I can fucking hear myself and this
fucking piece of shit. Microphone.

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,213
MMM.

61
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,910
If they do beat us or whatever that,
that,

62
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:40,710
that will be the team that I root for
in the Superbowl because Jesus Christ,

63
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:45,030
they m and a one and since like
fucking Bart Starr was in the league,

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,370
I think he might have just retired.
By the way,

65
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,430
the last great number 15 at quarterback
brightstar no offense to Neil Lomax.

66
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,090
MMM.

67
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,060
Anyways, what else? I
am done for the year.

68
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:03,620
People with road dates other than this
little trip I have to take to New York to

69
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,690
promote F is for family season three,

70
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:08,090
which comes out in
November 30th on Netflix.

71
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,600
Um,
I mean Tom

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,710
and I ain't doing fucking shit
except hanging out with my daughter.

73
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:17,544
You know what I,
I

74
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,190
okay.

75
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,630
We are relative. Ours got out, got her
out one of those electric fucking cars,

76
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,530
you know, that they can sit in. I came
home and I put that thing together.

77
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:30,590
It was fucking hilarious.
She got on the thing,

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,220
she didn't get it and took a couple of
times just pushing the button and then

79
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:36,560
she just,
she actually took a finger off the button,

80
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,450
laughed and clapped her hands.
Like this is the shit. So

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,950
okay.

82
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,410
You know, cause one of my big
days is a dad coming up. I Dunno.

83
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,200
Maybe depending on how tall she is,

84
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,540
sometime when she's around 11 or 12.

85
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,130
So I'm going to teach her
how to drive my truck,

86
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:57,760
which shifts a three on the column,
you know,

87
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,790
which no fucking kid in l for the most
part knows how to drive a stick anymore.

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,330
Forget about one in the column.

89
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:07,570
So I think it'd be pretty bad ass
if I teach her how to do that.

90
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,940
And that's something when I was a kid,
my dad used to do that.

91
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,740
He used to take us down to the South
Shore Plaza when I was like 12 years old,

92
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,080
11 and 12.
And I go down there.

93
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,610
Okay.

94
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,420
Yeah. 1978, uh,

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,470
Chevy Chevette four speed transmission.

96
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
And that was back when,
um,

97
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,750
okay.

98
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,750
The uh, the mall was closed on
Sunday cause everybody, you know,

99
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:37,751
allegedly was going to church and
on the seventh day God rested and,

100
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,270
and you know, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, all that shit. So, you know,

101
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:45,380
you couldn't sell any liquor,
you couldn't sell any booze. Um,

102
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:47,520
you couldn't be open like
grocery stores would be open.

103
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:51,920
But that was basically it. And, uh,
they had like Sunday hours, you know.

104
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,040
So we used to go down there
in the empty a parking lot

105
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,020
and he would, she taught all his
kids out of drive down there.

106
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,360
We learned on a stick shift.

107
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:10,380
And I remember when I went to go get my
driver's license, I took it on a stick.

108
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:14,880
I think it was that car. Now we would've
got rid of it by that. No, no, no,

109
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:18,150
that's right. That'll, we
still had it. We still had it.

110
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,190
1984 would only be six years old,
even though a fucking tree fell on it.

111
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,490
We got it fixed. Yeah.
I went down and took in.

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,570
I don't remember the guy made me park
on a hill, you know, doing that shit.

113
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,550
And I was like, ah, fuck.
All right, here we go.

114
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,190
Just don't stall out here and
then you're going to be fine.

115
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,940
You've got to be fine.
It's one of the few tests that I passed.

116
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,530
Okay.

117
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,150
During those years,
everything else,

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,730
everything else that I guess really
fucking matter that would have led to a

119
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:45,930
nicer car.
I failed.

120
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,980
But then I,

121
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,470
I started doing comedy at all.
Boy,

122
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,280
everything happened for me. I got to
play at the Chicago theater. Everybody

123
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,890
for foreign, credible shows. I want
to thank everybody that came out.

124
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,480
We had such a great time.
Um, when we were there,

125
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:12,510
we didn't make it to the Liar's
club. I, as you can tell,

126
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:14,160
I've been fighting off a cold and it just,

127
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,700
the last time we went to
the Liar's club and man,

128
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,900
I was there till like four in the fucking
morning and didn't wake up till five

129
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,640
in the afternoon and then did
a show at the Chicago theater.

130
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:25,080
I felt like it was breakfast time.

131
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,660
I had literally just had
eggs and walked on stage.

132
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:30,060
And these poor people who have been
working all fucking day, Anna came out,

133
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:34,920
they're like this fucking bum
silicon shelda cause I'm a pro.

134
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,660
I'm fucking with you.
Anyways. Um, we ate it,

135
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:41,930
this place,
a new place we went to in Chicago.

136
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Splays Gibsons and we got a stake
creamed spinach was fucking unbelievable.

137
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:52,560
And then in the end I got to get the name
of this fucking thing that these guys

138
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:56,610
said. They go, do you want dessert? And
you know, when you go out and get a steak,

139
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,170
you know, if you get like the filet
minion and it's the smart way to go,

140
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,630
but there's no flavor in it.
It's really bland.

141
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,610
They was going to have a
lead dipping sauces with it.

142
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,130
So I got some bone in Ribeye.

143
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,660
I hate that thing like fucking Fred
Flintstone. So now I'm sitting there,

144
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,350
even though we didn't get potatoes or
anything, I'm still, I'm fucking leaning.

145
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,550
I eat the whole thing. I should have cut
it in half. I didn't fucking leading.

146
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,340
And then these guys come over and they
were like, hey you do you want dessert?

147
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,390
And we'll like, Nah, Nah, Nah, we're good,
we're good. And they were like, no, no.

148
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:32,530
So some of the wages went to the show
last night. They want to bring you over a,

149
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,950
they want to bring you over
a fucking desert. Right?

150
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,790
Trying to find this Gibson's
menu. Chicago. Hang on a second.

151
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,240
I got to, I have to upload a
fucking picture of this thing.

152
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:44,890
They brought this God damn piece of cake.

153
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,390
It's fucking piece of cake. All
that. I swear to God. It was like,

154
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,620
it was like a whole cake.

155
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,000
Something like Banana Dream Boat. When
I saw the menu, I was saying to my,

156
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,660
Oh somebody, I forget who
I said and he's like, go,

157
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,970
I'll give you 20 bucks if
you just fucking order this.

158
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:05,570
Just cause I want to hear you say it
out loud. Gibson's menu. All right.

159
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:08,930
What is it called? Hair. Hang on. Hang on.

160
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,800
All right, here's the menu. What do
we got here? The meaning of life cake.

161
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:19,610
That wasn't it. Pumpkin Pie, but any
cream pie. Ah, yeah. Then fuck it.

162
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,453
Habit.

163
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,400
Okay.

164
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,660
With something like Banana Dream Boat.

165
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,510
I already know what it was,
but it was also,

166
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:33,800
it was these birthday and we
took him out to breakfast. Right.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,430
And we ended up getting them. They
know we go, it's his birthday.

168
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:41,090
So it was breakfast and they brought
over like some fucking one of those

169
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,930
chocolate whipped cream.
Uh

170
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,910
Yeah,

171
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,470
fucking waffles or whatever.

172
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,970
Okay.

173
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,180
Can we sang happy birthday to him is
loud as humanly possible in the thing.

174
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,980
Just getting right in his face. And I
was actually joking with furs. He has go,

175
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:57,581
you know what I got?

176
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:01,690
That's why guys are funny because if we
were women that actually would have been

177
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:02,524
sincere.

178
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,700
He was just sitting there
fucking embarrassed to shit.
It was such a great time.

179
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,700
So, um, anyways,

180
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,620
I'll be honest with you, I really
don't have a lot to fucking talk about.

181
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,070
I've been just fighting off this God damn
cold. Oh I know. And I can talk about,

182
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:26,910
so when I was in, yeah, when
I was in Chicago, you know,

183
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,580
I told my travel agent,
I go book me,

184
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,940
book me in a Nice Hotel, close
to the fucking um, the venue.

185
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,810
Now I'm a fancy man at this point,
so I don't even handle any of that shit.

186
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:43,020
I finally learned how to delegate stuff
cause I was doing my whole career.

187
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:44,430
I was like fucking Chuck Berry.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,480
The way he drive up to the venue in his
own car with his fucking guitar in the

189
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,390
backseat. That's what
I was doing, you know,

190
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,320
which adds a ton of fucking
responsibility and shit.

191
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,290
Cause then you got to tell your
openers were all where the hotel is.

192
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,740
You got to go in and you got to check out.
I never had a fucking tour manager.

193
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,180
Never did that shit. Cause uh, you know,

194
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:10,330
I'm an antisocial son of a bitch and all
I'm thinking is this is just going to

195
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:14,830
be another fucking guy I have to talk
to and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

196
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,700
And I'm just going to be that down to
Earth fucking guy who just fucking blah

197
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:22,450
blah blah. You know, just
comes walking in. Well that's
what I did. And guess what?

198
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,210
Now I'm getting text messages from
people who work at fucking Avis,

199
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,500
where I rented a car, you
know, fucking eight years old,

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,180
you remember me,
you rented a Ford Focus.

201
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:38,560
You could to get stupid
stupid fucking move.

202
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,970
That's what being down to earth gets you,

203
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,660
gets a bunch of people fucking
calling you up. You know the did,

204
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,640
she had a two second interaction with her,
right?

205
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,090
So if you learn anything on this podcast,
all right?

206
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,910
As you move up the ladder,

207
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,530
it's very important to forget
where you came from. All right?

208
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,700
And what you want to do is treat people
who you feel your ego tells you are not

209
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:10,500
a year level. You want to
treat them less than. Okay.

210
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,180
But there is, there is a
certain level, you know.

211
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,540
Yeah.

212
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,920
Well you have to kind of dial it back.

213
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,600
Like I went out and I did
a fucking meet and greet,

214
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,700
you know one time when I was in Reno this
guy goes take a picture of my wife and

215
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,900
I got find any reaches in his jacket
to fucking take out a camera and a nine

216
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:30,760
millimeter fell on the fucking ground

217
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,510
and I pointed at the gun and went oh shit.
And watched him pick it back up again.

218
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:38,950
Like a fucking,
I should have kicked it.

219
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,880
I should have done some sorta Steven
Seagal move. But you know that's,

220
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,770
I mean I didn't grow up around guns.
I was just like,

221
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,300
Oh I think you dropped something. Serve.
Fortunately it was an off duty cop,

222
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,350
although he ran out of there cause
it was a native American reservation.

223
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,290
They weren't, we were on their land
in union, not allowed to bring a, a,

224
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,000
a weapon in there.

225
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,540
Probably your specialty as a white man
considering what happened the first time

226
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:01,781
around,

227
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,570
they probably don't want fucking white
people coming in with guns anymore. Right.

228
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,230
So, um, there was that,

229
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,430
there was another time I had a group of
people followed me home from the venue

230
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,420
and I got out of the car and there
was the, hey, bill is, I got out.

231
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,560
I was just like, oh fuck, what's
going to happen? You know,

232
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,840
that little mini heart attack.
Are you going to kill me? Oh,

233
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,870
you just want a picture,
right? So anyways,

234
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,240
okay.

235
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,370
Um,
I'm one of those people,

236
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:31,060
I know what airline of flying as I drive
to the airport, I do that Shit, right?

237
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,780
So we're on our way to Chicago,
uh, like the night before.

238
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,540
So I asked my travel agent,
you know, where would stay?

239
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,800
And he said the Trump hotel and I was
like, Oh shit. All right, Trump hotel.

240
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,750
Donnay okay, so we fucking stay
there man. And I didn't understand.

241
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,940
I know that people don't like
Donald Trump, but I don't want,

242
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,220
I didn't understand that they
also don't like his buildings

243
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,760
because the fucking jerk off his,
put his name on every building.

244
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,350
So now when people hate him, they,
they, you know, his name is there.

245
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:05,980
So they stand in front and they do all of
this fucking Shit, right? Like, you know,

246
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:10,530
fuck you done outside of the thing.
So anyway,

247
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:14,470
so we go in there, of course,
it's fucking incredible.

248
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,030
It's fucking beautiful. The service
was amazing. The food was incredible.

249
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,490
Everything. And there was great,
like, this is what he's good at.

250
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
This is what he should have stayed doing.
This is his wheelhouse.

251
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:29,470
You know what I mean? This is like
Elvis, keep singing. The songs do,

252
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:32,560
don't make the fucking movies.
So anyways,

253
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,490
okay.

254
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,000
We were saying in there all weekend,
we had a great fucking time, you know,

255
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,070
quick walk down to the,
uh, the, uh, the venue,

256
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:48,220
right? So I say to Nia, I go near, you
know, I go, you're not believe what?

257
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,570
I'm Sam standing in a Trump hotel. She
goes, no, not, I'm like, yeah, yeah,

258
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,070
I had him fucking, I didn't book
it. You know, I just, I show,

259
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,200
I worry about the shows now.
This is great.

260
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:03,490
I don't have to fucking think
about anything. So she's
breaking my balls, right.

261
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,840
Going like, is it the greatest hotel
ever? You don't do on that show? I go,

262
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,460
you know, it's kind of fucking
nice. I'm not gonna lie to you.

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,980
So I actually took a video,

264
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,250
okay.

265
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,120
Um, of the, of the Roman, all that
and the view I had and everything,

266
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,470
and she wrote back to me,
she goes,

267
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,450
I got to admit that best
it makes it nice hotel.

268
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,010
So anyways, I, uh,

269
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,540
okay.

270
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,340
I ran into somebody that I knew at the,
at the airport, he's like, oh, you know,

271
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,460
where were you working with talking blah,
blah, blah, blah. And he's, you know,

272
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,160
somehow where I stayed came
up and I mentioned it to him,

273
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:41,310
so he starts breaking my balls.
He's like going, you know,

274
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,060
that guy's not a good person. It's like,
yeah, I agree with that. And he goes,

275
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:48,810
you should spend your money
elsewhere. And like, well look,

276
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:52,680
he's still fucking president.
So like me not staying there.

277
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,250
Is that somehow not going
to make him president? And
he's like, no. He's like, Oh,

278
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,070
you know a horrible fucking person
and Yada Yada Yada. And I go,

279
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:03,130
so where should I stay there?
The Hiltons,

280
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:07,390
the Sheridans like they're all good
people, aren't they all billionaires?

281
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:10,910
Like who the fuck do you think they voted
for? Like, yeah, you know, I don't know.

282
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:15,520
I've kind of bugged me a little bit with
everybody having to give everybody a

283
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,271
fucking lecture.

284
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:19,570
It's like you're really going to sit
here and as you hold the fucking apple

285
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:21,700
laptop computer,
have you ever read about them?

286
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:25,360
I'll tell you the ones that had people
leaping to their deaths at their fucking

287
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,500
sweat shop, cause they, they, they,
they had to work so much. It didn't,

288
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,200
you made so little, their
lives was so helpful. Helpless.

289
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,670
They were jumping out of the factory.

290
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,320
So they had to fucking putting nets
up around the fucking thing, you know?

291
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:41,800
And then they played soothing music and
then they considered possibly giving

292
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:46,000
them more money, which was
really the solution. So, I mean,

293
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,480
okay,

294
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,890
all the clothes I'm wearing,
what?

295
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:51,560
I really want to see the people's lives
who have to fucking put it together.

296
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,990
We wake up, we're going
to stop this. You know,

297
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,290
you gotta give me a lecture as we're
getting on a fucking plane that uses fuel.

298
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,120
Where do we get the fuel to
get it from the Middle East?

299
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,440
What the fuck's going on over there?

300
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,050
How many innocent people have died over
the bullshit that we're putting in this

301
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:06,760
fucking plane? Okay. While
we're trying to liberate them,

302
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,720
you know, so I dunno. It's just, it's
a, it's a, I understand. You know,

303
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,253
I dunno.

304
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,140
I don't like Donald Trump.
Okay.

305
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,460
Mostly just his racial views is
what really, you know, that's,

306
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,790
that's what I really don't like that guy.
Okay. I didn't fucking vote for the guy.

307
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,640
All right. Why don't we tell you this?
The guy makes a hell of a fucking hotel.

308
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,890
Okay.

309
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,420
I wish that's what he was still doing

310
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,740
exclusively. And I'm sure you guys are
gonna give me shit and some out, you know,

311
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:44,630
take out your frustration on him, on
me. The fact that I fucking, you know,

312
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,670
stayed there, but I'm
telling you, you know,

313
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,330
okay,

314
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,030
if you kind of play that fucking game,
you

315
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,220
got to, you got to do with
straight across the board,

316
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:55,600
where are you going to go pick and choose.
Okay.

317
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,370
Because you know that's another, that's
like another, like I feel like it's, it's,

318
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,970
it's almost the way,
like when you go to a,

319
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,030
when somebody goes to a comedy show
and they laugh at all the fucking jokes

320
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,250
until I drive across their front yard,

321
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,580
then all of a sudden I didn't do a joke
now and making statements and their

322
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:13,480
feelings are fucking hurt. It's like
if you really care to that level going,

323
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,550
this guy's a bad fucking person,

324
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,850
then I would say that you would really
be limiting that you should be staying at

325
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:25,540
some sort of mom and pop fucking hotel.

326
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,560
If you can find it

327
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,660
as you then go down and try to find
some organic fucking guy that's not a

328
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:36,620
corporate farmer, you know,
cause they've poisoned the food.

329
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:39,410
I mean you start going
down that road or maybe,

330
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,030
I guess you could just pick your battle.

331
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,300
Okay.

332
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,470
I have no idea. But I will tell you
this, that hotel was so fucking nice.

333
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,490
I actually weighed my wife getting
mad at me. I just call I Sydney,

334
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,580
are you gonna get mad if I stay at
another one of these? And she laughed.

335
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:57,490
She goes, yes, you fucking assholes.
I said, all right, fair enough.

336
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:01,840
So whenever I'm wanting done what had
done like the titans beat the Patriots,

337
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,570
congratulations on your
huge victory in November.

338
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,863
You know,

339
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,550
they should have a trophy
for fucking teams like that.

340
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,500
And I can't say I'm not picking them.
I may pick on the titans.

341
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,480
I just didn't like what Deon Louis said,
you know,

342
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,690
you didn't talk any shit before the
fucking game and then you fucking win and

343
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:20,990
now you're going to run your fucking Yap.
The Fuck Outta here.

344
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,200
You hate this organism. You, you just,
you know what it is. You know what it is.

345
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,140
He said, fucking, you know,

346
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,750
he's fucking mad that he wants to please.

347
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:34,200
All I hear is I still want to
play for the Patriots. Well,

348
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,720
use it to page agenda. They got a
woody way here. They got the flu,

349
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,760
whatever the door is working
with blah, blah, blah, blah.

350
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,330
And all of a sudden when you
get caught up in the Washer,

351
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,720
that all of a sudden the
patriots are fucking assholes.

352
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,690
Patriot's day at a Trump hotel.
Some of them do. Anyways.

353
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,880
Um, anyways, is there a
Clinton hotel I could stay at?

354
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:56,490
Maybe get back in your
people's good graces.

355
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,053
Jesus Christ.

356
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,720
We got to meet to Robin. That
one. Oh, Bill, come on. You know,

357
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:08,060
I just feel like you're better than that.
Hey,

358
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:11,210
let's bring people back together here.
Um,

359
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,370
where was the, what the fuck is
this story? I was Google news. Hey,

360
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,570
about those Bros, man, they're
starting to play out, right? Oh,

361
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,230
the side of the fucking put it
together. I watched them play, uh,

362
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,250
the Toronto game when I was
there in Chicago and I had
a flashback when I played

363
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:32,560
the Chicago theater with Jamie,

364
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:37,561
nor a Jim Brewer in David
tell on the antisocial tour.

365
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,100
I can't believe it was seven fucking
years ago. And I remember I was in uh,

366
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,433
the green room.

367
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,030
Yeah. At the end of the, and I was late

368
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,360
to the meet and greet cause I was watching
the fucking Bruins win the Stanley

369
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,530
Cup.
Yeah.

370
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,170
Former Clinton advisor,
Hillary will run in 2020.

371
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,970
If she ever becomes president,
that's going to be a great 30 for 30.

372
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,123
MMM.

373
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,230
Cause she's going to run again.

374
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,760
She feels she's thinks it's her job.

375
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,210
Please Democrats don't fuck it. Oh my God.
How many fucking times? How many times?

376
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:22,110
How many times are you gonna play Marty
Ball? Can you get somebody in there?

377
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,483
All right.

378
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,560
There's gotta be somebody else.
They can't tell me.

379
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:30,260
The Democrats are going to be dumb
enough to hit shift fucker wagon again.

380
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,693
How many times?

381
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,360
How many times do you put that person
under center and you come away with a loss

382
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,390
before you don't go to your second string
quarterback. That's all I'm asking.

383
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,890
This has gotta be the most politically
charged podcast I've ever done.

384
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,511
Where do I get off?

385
00:21:48,511 --> 00:21:52,950
Not Paying attention for getting
to submit an absentee ballot,

386
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,740
telling people who
should run for president.

387
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,510
Where the fuck was that
story I was looking for?

388
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,270
Oh Wow. The guy was in the voice
of the computer in 2001 die.

389
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,820
Yeah.

390
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,460
Do you have to Abbott there was a woman
out there was such a big fan of that

391
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:16,290
that fucking wanted them to
talk like that during sex. Um,

392
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,540
sorry.
What the fuck is this story?

393
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:22,500
I was looking for some fucking guy in
Texas broke into a house and bled out

394
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,150
cause he cut his arm on the window.

395
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,880
I'll, I can take is how nice
was to stuff in the house.

396
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,210
Okay.

397
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,040
Getting Dizzy.
Oh look at that vase.

398
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,580
Um, anyways. Is it time for the Oh Geez.

399
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:46,240
It's time for the advertising
there. Um, oh, when our hotel,

400
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,060
that was Jesus Christ.
What a fucking hotel.

401
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,760
The steam room was incredible.

402
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,950
A lot of these hotels you go to write
other than the festival in Milwaukee,

403
00:22:56,951 --> 00:23:01,150
you go into the steam room and they, uh,

404
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,780
they always have it on like we'd
all want to hurt anybody level.

405
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,400
Okay.

406
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,800
You know, Trump doesn't give a
shit. He'll fuck hill. You know,

407
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,620
you'll put kids in cages.
That guy does not give a fuck.

408
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,060
You think this Steve's
not going to be hot.

409
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,610
I'm fucking eucalyptus was like
fucking versus he was like,

410
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,650
ah, hey. Its burden by eyes. Right.

411
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,190
There was so much eucalyptus in
there. I, I dunno, I felt like Yo,

412
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:33,100
when you chew like a really like
winter fresh God, more like,

413
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,730
like minty fucking gum.
That's what my eyeballs felt like.

414
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,573
MMM.

415
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,150
It was tremendous. Where the fuck
am I going to know? I'm trying,

416
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:44,670
I'm trying to find the advertising. All
right, here we go. Oh look who's here?

417
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:46,040

all that type of stuff.

553
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:19,970
When she was laying on the changing
table and she reached up and she gave me

554
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,490
like, I swear to God,
like 12 hugs in a row.

555

got to know him way back when I was on
breaking bad and we were both huge fans

573
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:38,080
of the show and we would fucking geek
out sending each other emails trying to

574
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:43,240
figure out where the show was going to
go next. And it was such a great show.

575
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:45,520
I was actually on it for
a couple episodes that he,

576
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,060
I couldn't even figure out where I
was going to go. Uh, but whatever.

577
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,070
So I'll be very excited to,
uh,

578
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,760
okay.

579
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,370
Do I get on that show?
They listen to this podcast.

580
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:57,800
I imagine he'll give me shit for
staying at the Trump Chicago.

581
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,053
MMM.

582
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,450
I would've stayed at the Obama, but he,
you know, he doesn't fucking have it,

583
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,510
you know? Does he get a fucking ice
cream stand so I can be a, you know?

584
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:09,850
Yeah.

585
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,500
Is it, this is not partisan.
What would that be?

586
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:13,830
If I actually stayed at
a Trump hotel and ate it?

587
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Obama's ice cream stand then when I
truly be independent or I'd be called a

588
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:22,180
centrist.
And who made that ice cream?

589
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:25,720
How many cows had to die to make that
ice cream? Well, Bill, they don't die.

590
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:27,550
They melt them. Well, you know what?

591
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,620
I guess I don't know what I'm
talking about anyways. Uh,

592
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,810
when in Thailand towered a bill?

593
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:39,250
Where did Tallinn Estonia try
the pancakes in compressor.

594
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,100
Just do it. All right. Well you like
Nike. There's another green hope.

595
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,470
Everybody likes it. Jordan's right? I
do. What do you get into Jordan too?

596
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:50,080
You're doing bad injuries.
Go to the fucking factory.

597
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,670
Okay.

598
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,250
Jesus Christ. I mean, I don't
understand how they get,

599
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:56,170
they just fucking get away
with all of that shit.

600
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,503
Yeah,

601
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,330
yeah. That you can just treat people like
that. Why don't you fucking, you know,

602
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,590
fly commercial.

603
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,490
You can bump up the price of
the sneakers a little bit,

604
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:09,380
but went back to the day when I was a kid,

605
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,640
like shit was made here and it wasn't
ridiculously expensive cause they was

606
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:16,130
going, hey, you want us to
make shit over here? Okay.

607
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,950
It's going to be $9 million for
some shoe strings. It's like,

608
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,740
that's cause you don't want to take any
money out of your pocket. You can't,

609
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,043
sorry.

610
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,040
Um, all right. This
should be a global union,

611
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,520
which you'll never be able to do.
You'll never be able to get that done.

612
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,810
Uh,
talent Astonia here we go.

613
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,110
Okay.

614
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,690
A Global Union of just regular people
against these fucking rich content.

615
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,060
That should be the new world order.
All right.

616
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,430
Okay.

617
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,060
Yeah, but then, you know, yeah. You know,

618
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,500
the thing is you can't have one side
either side, having too much power.

619
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,590
Because back in the day when unions,
what really powerful here,

620
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,500
let me look what you did.
They didn't take advantage of that.

621
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,220
They weren't guilty of kind of driving
some of these factories like to,

622
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,840
I can't deal with these fucking cuts.

623
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,990
You know I've dealt with you
and you'd fucking houses.

624
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:11,620
I tried to shoot specials in, in, in these
places. They gouge the shit out of you.

625
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,050
You show up and they're like made a toy.

626
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,950
You just gotta be 20 fucking fucking
people to put a mic stand at a stool on a

627
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:20,320
stage because that's
how many people we need.

628
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,740
When a a Dave Matthews shows up,
you know,

629
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,860
well they bring in Carter Beauford is
fucking 900 piece drum set and I'm showing

630
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:29,460
up.

631
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,550
You don't microphone bike stayed at his
stool and I've got to have fucking four,

632
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,830
four guys gotta be up there.

633
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,930
You had peak for fucking guys and
everything goes through the God damn roof.

634
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:38,930
Yeah.

635
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,460
So maybe corporations aren't bad.

636
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,000
Maybe they're just human
beings with too much freedom.

637
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,280
Okay.

638
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,113
I think that's what it is.

639
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,840
Where do you get too much
free to be acting like a
cunt? White people. All right.

640
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,510
Talent. Wikipedia. Guilty
as charged. All right.

641
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,570

That's a bad. Alright. Images.

646
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,693
Oh my God.

647
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,800
Okay.

648
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,220
I am not showing any of these
pictures to my wife. Well,

649
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:21,860
I know this has to be the
picture as downtown area.

650
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,043
Yeah,

651
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,310
but still what a downtown it is.
Oh my God.

652
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:30,920
Okay.

653
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,110
This is how much I love my wife.
Want to go to places like this.

654
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:34,280
I actually feel guilt.

655
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,910
Oh my God.
It's fucking beautiful.

656
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,650
Okay.

657
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,740
Oh, I bet they'll have great
fucking stories to the studio.

658
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,610
World War II. This is all you do.
What? Where? Where were you guys?

659
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:50,750
What side of the fence?

660
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay.

661
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,370
World War II.

662
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,623
Yeah.

663
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,820
Oh,

664
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,560
did they side with you would have stayed
in those countries to decision they had

665
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:01,220
to make,

666
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,850
do I go with style in order to go with
fucking Hitler to the biggest fucking

667
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:08,360
mass murdering lunatics of all time.
You know,

668
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:11,270
sometimes you just not left
with the good fucking choice,

669
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,000
like a last election.

670
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,480
Sometimes it's 2:00 AM at a bar.
You just got to pick someone.

671
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,970
Although I don't know if you know,

672
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,543
okay,

673
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,650
you still have to go style it. You
know what I mean? Just, I mean, Hitler,

674
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,200
Hitler was d,
he's Hitler's is that dude?

675
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,690
He's the fucking Freddie Mercury
of mass murderers, you know?

676
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,630
Okay.

677
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,390
He had like a 12 octave evil range.

678
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,670
Okay.

679
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,720
You don't have a lot of ways Stella.

680
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:49,190
He kind of looks like Tom Selleck a little
bit, right. It lives just a little be,

681
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:53,320
I'd fucking, anyways, before the outbreak
of the Second World War, Germany,

682
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,620
the Soviet Union's side,

683
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,650
the germy and Soviet nonaggression pact
and some little dose fucker with a does

684
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:06,160
pants sweeper have a mustache. He broke
that Denny concerning the practitioner.

685
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,770
That's gotta be one of the most fucked
up things ever that he actually thought

686
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:10,730
he was gonna beat Russia.

687
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,740
That little ass fucking country was
going to go with there. I mean, you know,

688
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,220
they will come in over there with
their fucking Mercedes Benz and Porsche

689
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:24,720
fucking machine guns and planes had
tanks. I mean, you could see why, uh,

690
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,930
the Republic of his sone,
it declared neutrality in the war,

691
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:32,730
but fell under the Soviet
sphere of influence. Do too.

692
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,990
Yeah.

693
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,800
Oh my God. The Mala Tav Ribbentrop pact.

694
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,310
Okay.

695
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,120
You know, it's funny. If you
watch jeopardy, somebody will, uh,

696
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,490
what is the Molotov Ribbentrop pact?

697
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,580
He only gets 50 points for of that.
Uh,

698
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,330
so they end up being occupied by the
Soviet Union in 1940 mass political

699
00:39:56,331 --> 00:40:00,740
arrests. So he's still got fucked
deportations and executions followed.

700
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,850
Oh, Jesus. And people who it. But what
about the Molotov Ribbentrop pact?

701
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,210
I have a little flyer here.
You want to look at it?

702
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,980
Jesus Christ,
whenever you read the sheet,

703
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:19,490
you just realize how fucking lucky you
are to be living in wherever the hell you

704
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:22,200
live in. If this is, if there's
not shit like this going on,

705
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,093
uh,

706
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,940
I love the guy from Estonia has got to be,

I didn't tell you to go that that deep.

708
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,060
Or let's look it up here.

711
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,190
Okay,

712
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,970
so it's like German pancakes.

713
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,580
Oh Shit. Okay. Oh Man.

714
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,210
Okay.

715
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,190
Oh,

716
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,450
Yeah,

717
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,690
it's got a pound of butter on it. I don't
know how that is or the metric system.

718
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,010
Yeah,

719
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,820
so like a caramelized fucking piece
of banana. All right. I'm there.

720
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,410
Jesus Christ.
I better start.

721
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,600
The only thing that sucks
about this tour is a Molly.

726
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:38,960

727
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,230

730
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:52,770

an eighth. Well, we started talking.

731
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:55,170

What body of water is that right?
Is it the Baltic Sea?

737
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,150
Okay.

738

She was like, oh, that's what you want
to play, but I'm not, I'm going to,

742
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,410
I think it would be in Warsaw.

743
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:39,750
Okay.

744
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,330
You all right there Fred, right in the
middle of the country, I believe. Anyways,

745
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:44,650
meet a buddy,
a huge fans of Poland,

746
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,140
and we hear you are coming to a
city in this shit hole country. Oh,

747
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:50,560
I don't fucking tell me that.

748
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,570
It'd be nice if we knew when
the dates were so we could, uh,

749
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:56,920
so we know if we could make it,

750
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,310
what are the chances you could tell us
all the best and go fuck yourself. Yeah,

751
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,860
that'd be,
it's all been announced in a week.

752
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,390
It was all supposed to be announced at
the same time, but Germany was all like,

753
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,550
we need to announce it now.
Right. At my age, it was like, uh,

754
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,700
why do you feel you need the, what else
are now trying to do Jackie Mason, right.

755
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:20,550
German talker to the Jew. Um,
so he ended up backing down.

756
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,410
He's like, all right, you
fucking load of Texas.

757
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,120
Announce it when you want to.
And they did and it went great.

758
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:32,770
So it tickets got sold over
there. Uh, anyways, uh,

759
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,490
best friends, it will be all be announced
in a week. All right. All right.

760
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:42,690
Best friends with best friends,
wife from a lady.

761
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,690
Oh, hello Billy Baldwin. I
get it. I get it once again,

762
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,170
making me feel bad about
my mood shaped head.

763
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,333
Yeah.

764
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,203
Um,

765
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:01,770
recently I've been posting pictures and
videos on my Instagram that are.dot,

766
00:44:02,861 --> 00:44:04,330
dot.
Not slutty.

767
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:05,800
Okay.

768
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,340
All right. So right there, there are
of a risky, okay, hang on a second.

769
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,980
I gotta I gotta I gotta clear my nose
here. Hang on a second. All right.

770
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,880
This is just one of these things where
if I lay down my nose just fucking just

771
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,380
blocks up. But if I'm a
second I stand up, it's fine.

772
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,680
I don't want to stand it anyways.

773
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,890
All right, so you're posting these
pictures that are not slutty,

774
00:44:29,891 --> 00:44:34,560
but I wouldn't show parents
either. Well, all right.

775
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,570
Okay. There is, there's a window in there.

776
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,030
There's a window in there cause
they're gonna be like you. You get,

777
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:41,360
your dress is too short. Come
on honey. What are you doing?

778
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,860
You get killing your father,
right?

779
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,440
I'm 26 years old and I had been feeling
very confident about myself and my body.

780
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:54,300
Good for you. I'm sick. I wish I
felt that they way above my head.

781
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,230
How can I,
when everybody makes fun of it.

782
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,970
I like my head and I
don't care what I believe.

783
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:04,400
Yeah.

784
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,980
Christina Aguilera said
it best when she said,

785
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:12,110
I am beautiful no matter what they say.
Right.

786
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,520
Okay.

787
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,090
And I believe her pussy was
as bald as the top of my head,

788
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:19,970
judging by some of her outfits.
You know what I mean? I mean,

789
00:45:19,971 --> 00:45:24,660
the skirts was so slow. The hair would be
hanging out underneath. Right. Oh, pill.

790
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,940
Why? Why? Why do you have to be so
crass? Cause I'm not funny. You know,

791
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:30,920
when you're not funny, you go right
to the genitals. I mean, it's,

792
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,520
it's one of the oldest, oldest is
one of the oldest things in comedy.

793
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,130
I'm 26 years old and been
feeling good about my body.

794
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,720
I'm single with no boyfriend
or even dating. Can I get
down? I have a good time.

795
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,210
Go by a fucking suitcase full
of condoms and a jump on it.

796
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,490
Oh, sorry. Anyways, my friend.

797
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,190
Okay.

798
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,791
Okay.
Anyways,

799
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:56,680
my friends since I was 16 has told me
that his wife has been uncomfortable with

800
00:45:56,681 --> 00:46:01,510
us talking because she's seen my pictures.
Well,

801
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:05,020
yeah, you sound like you're
in the prime of your life.

802
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,620
You're obviously crushing it.
Uh,

803
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,660
she told them she feels insecure and
sees my pictures even before he does.

804
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,710
He's expressed that he may not be
my friend anymore because of this.

805
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:21,090
While he's doing the right thing, you
know, happy wife, happy life. Hey,

806
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,440
she ain't happy.
Nobody's going to be happy.

807
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,963
Uh,

808
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,130
why does he just unfollow,
unfollow.

809
00:46:31,131 --> 00:46:35,570
You can you just do that and you guys
could be friends in a different way.

810
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:39,530
I don't know. It's weird. That's all
weird. I get where his wife's coming from.

811
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,140
Uh, she's, you know, if my wife
was Sunday, somebody, you know,

812
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:48,440
and he's keys, fucking posting
banana hammock pop pictures,

813
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:53,180
I don't feel like that would be too
comfortable with that. Right. Swing low,

814
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:55,550
sweet chariot. Sorry. Um,

815
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,580
she told me she feels insecure and
sees my pictures even before he does.

816
00:47:01,431 --> 00:47:06,320
He has expressed that he may not be
friends anymore because of this. Sorry,

817
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:07,280
I had to reread that again.

818
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:10,130
But I know a lot of you guys watch reality
shows and they always come back and

819
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:11,090
show you what you just saw.

820
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,540
And this is not the first time I've
been blocked by male friends because now

821
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,250
this is where we need Nia

822
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,350
because their female counterparts,

823
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:27,000
our social media stalking me and
claiming I'm trying to get there, man,

824
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,020
I,
I've told to tone

825
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:35,020
down my posts are not right how I feel
because the girls take it personally and

826
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:38,300
take it out on my friends. Now
on some level, you know, you,

827
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:41,370
you to know what you're doing,
all right,

828
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,830
here's the, here's the deal, okay?

829
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,460
Because men are weak,
women are fucking gorgeous.

830
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:53,510
There are certain rules that you
do have to follow, all right?

831
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,050
And for you to be as beautiful as you
are and feeling as confident as you are

832
00:47:57,051 --> 00:48:00,890
about your body, it posted those
pictures. Nothing wrong with that,

833
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,441
but when you're,

834
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:05,840
we start being friends with all these
guys that are in relationships like you're

835
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,980
single. Go be friends with guys
that aren't in relationships,

836
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:11,650
okay?

837
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,550
It's, it's a, it's a tough thing. It's
a tough thing. It's not your fault.

838
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:18,370
You're pretty and you feel like
fucking shown and off a little bit.

839
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,170
Not Too slutty. Not To fucking
dad will appreciate this. Uh,

840
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,250
anyways, I've been told to
tone it down or, or not to
write. I feel blah, blah, blah.

841
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:27,941
Uh,

842
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:32,941
are these my real friends or do
girls have legit reasons to be upset?

843
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,150
Yours truly a huge fan and
love to Nia and the baby.

844
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,573
Uh,

845
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:39,990
okay.

846
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,160
Fuck. I might have to do an epilogue
on this and getting the, uh,

847
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,410
you know what I'm going to
happen. I'm going to answer
this and on Thursday, Neil,

848
00:48:46,411 --> 00:48:50,340
we'll give her answer. Look at that
teasing the next episode like a pro.

849
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:56,050
Um, listen, if you're,

850
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,450
if you're not passively,
aggressively, you know,

851
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:00,600
okay.

852
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,950
Being a Dick Tease,

853
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,550
just cause you liked that attention
and you're just legitimately just

854
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:06,720
okay.

855
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,051
You know,

856
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:12,051
like how you look and saying how you feel
that then I don't think you're wrong,

857
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:16,640
but I don't think they're wrong either.
You know what I mean?

858
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,273
Okay.

859
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,780
I don't know how it works with women,

860
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:24,160
but when a woman is more attractive
or it makes another woman feel less

861
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,520
attractive and it's talking
to the dead guy. Yeah.

862
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,870
That's going to be guys get like that.
Right? Some guy comes up, you know,

863
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:36,220
he's all fucking jacked. He's got
pigment, he's got hair. I mean,

864
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:38,950
how am I going to feel,
you know,

865
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:42,970
you don't think I'm going to truck and
puff up my little freckled fucking chest,

866
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,523
you know,

867
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,180
try to recite some line from a
fucking Sylvester Stallone movie.

868
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:54,980
Huh? A, are you like Deb
apple? So whatever the fuck
it is, just combined movies.

869
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,310
Um, yeah. Like this is what I would do.

870
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:04,600
I would just say I would respect
the women in these relationships.

871
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,200
And what you need to do is,
uh,

872
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:11,020
you need to find some guys
that are single to follow you.

873
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,940
All right?

874
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,250
Knowing what comes with
that, like, oh my God,

875
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:21,140
you look so a lot like this once you're
going to be getting, uh, you know,

876
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:26,150
but I wouldn't worry about it. I mean,
these are great problems to have. I mean,

877
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:29,640
you can be fucking ugly living under a
bridge crying every Friday and Saturday

878
00:50:29,641 --> 00:50:33,510
night because they'll wants
to go near you. So, you know,

879
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:35,840
it's nice to have a lot of suitors.
Uh,

880
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,630
okay.

881
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,480
I, I, if I was you, I would
just, I would, I would expand.

882
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,520
Okay.

883
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,200
Uh,
my friend circle.

884
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,320
All right.

885
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,770
And also, you know, what can you say
that you weren't posting like that?

886
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:55,400
And then recently I've been posting
pictures of videos. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. See?

887
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:57,860
So everything was cool until
you started doing that.

888
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,320
So that's what changed seeds. Sometimes
when you change as a person, you,

889
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,780
you lose a few friends. So
that's, that's what I would say.

890
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,740
You're not historically been doing this.

891
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:10,840
Okay.

892
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,880
You know, I don't know what
your head like. You're fucking,

893
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,920
I sell real estate head shot on there.

894
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,700
Okay.

895
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,520
The family values one, and now
you're out there like, what the fuck?

896
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:20,840
I'm only going to be young ones.

897
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,410
Okay,

898
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,670
we're going to go out
and have a good time.

899
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:26,210
Then all of a sudden these people
locked out of relationships. Yeah, yeah.

900
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,170
You're gonna have a problem.
You're gonna have a problem.

901
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:31,580
So I don't necessarily think you're doing
anything wrong. I just think that, uh,

902
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,970
if that's the way you're going to be,

903
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,980
you can't be around guys that are in
relationships. And in fairness to them,

904
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:40,860
you're going to be causing them to
get into a lot of God damn arguments.

905
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,083
All right?

906
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,260
Okay.

907
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,070
And I guarantee you at least one of them
is thinking about one of your pictures

908
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,040
when he bends his fucking girl over.
I mean, I'm just telling you, okay.

909
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,070
As a guy that that's what's happening.
And the woman knows it,

910
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,540
especially when they mutter your
name, bumble it. What did you say?

911
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:02,730
I said, uh, we should
be shared more stuff.

912
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,290
What is sharing my life with you?

913
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,330
A husband having an emotional
affair while we are living in Tokyo.

914
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:14,880
Uh,

915
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,070
Hey, Billy boat act. How
do you know boat act?

916
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,080
India? That's a fucking inside
joke there. You fucking boat act.

917
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:27,780
That's an insult to a comedian.
Uh,

918
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,530
things have been difficult with my
husband and I since we moved to Tokyo from

919
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:33,080
the u s uh,

920
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:37,710
went through his phone to find him
messaging his new teammate all day.

921
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:42,120
Not just about work stuff either.
I don't know if it would be flirting,

922
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,430
but it made me uncomfortable.
There are things,

923
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:48,090
he's messaging her before he even
tells me. Yeah. None of that is cool.

924
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,141
I confronted him,

925
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:51,900
but he swears to me he would never
do something like that to me.

926
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,280
What should I do next?

927
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:56,910
It's hard to not want to go through his
phone or wonder what they're up to at

928
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:59,310
work.
Thank you so much and go fuck yourself.

929
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,130
I would just tell him that
because of his fucking behavior,

930
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:04,080
you now have urges to
go through his phone.

931
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,100
All right?

932
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,780
Would you be comfortable if I was
texting a guy that I work with that much?

933
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,190
If I was telling him personal stuff
about myself before I told you it's not

934
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:20,510
fucking cool. That's not cool on any
fucking level. And you're 100% right.

935
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,860
Uh, what you do about it? I don't know.

936
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,100
I Dunno.
I Dunno what the move is there.

937
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,183
I Dunno.

938
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,120
You gotta. Yeah, you gotta
fucking head. Jesus Christ. Ah,

939
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,720
relationships. Aren't they fun? All this
technology, all the new fucking ways.

940
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:47,750
So this is all,
there's so many fucking people out there,

941
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,200
men and women who we not doing
the shit that they would be doing,

942
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,520
posting fucking sexy pictures of yourself
at the whole fucking world. Could see,

943
00:53:57,521 --> 00:53:59,830
do you really sell fucking nuts
set is that you can do that now.

944
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:04,180
Then there's somebody can actually in
their house look at these sexy photos of

945
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:09,040
you in a robe jerk and their deck
to it and then their wife walks in.

946
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,880
What are you doing? Oh, I was
just pointing down low shit.

947
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,233
Yeah.

948
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,910
Uh, I think the way that you would
be are interacting right now.

949
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:25,210
We were never meant to interact this way.
Uh,

950
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:29,990
it is like the level of voyeurism
that is just fucking mainstream.

951
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,230
It's not healthy. All right. And I'm not,

952
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,950
I'm not wagging my finger at anybody
here. I mean, I stayed at a Trump hotel.

953
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,800
Who am I to tell anybody
anything? Uh, anyways,

954
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,850
tog cruise is added again.

955
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,520
Yeah.

956
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,000
All right. Y'All bill, read this
on Twitter. Read this on Twitter.

957
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,990
Wanted to hear your reaction.
You think Tommy boy can pull it off?

958
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,500
It's Tom Cruise. Whatever you're gonna say
yes, he can get you fucker. Pull it off.

959
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,360
I know you're not a fighter pilot,

960
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,200
but I figured you're in the aviation
world and understand this stuff. Okay.

961
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:06,880
That's a major, I have a private pilot's
license and I have under 200 hours.

962
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,660
Uh, but I'll tell you I'm a hell of a
pilot for a lot of time. I have, okay.

963
00:55:10,661 --> 00:55:13,510
That bar,
that boy Tommy Cruz is added again,

964
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,770
the actor who insists on doing his
own stunts might be taking things even

965
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:22,390
further on for Topcon
to Aka top gun maverick.

966
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,590
This is a,

967
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:28,591
this is a rubric for now because it comes
from an anonymous source over at the

968
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:33,010
Daily Mail. In other words, it never
happened, but I'll continue reading.

969
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:38,370
But Cruz apparently was to re re
really fly a fighter jet in the movie,

970
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,590
not just pretend if this is true,

971
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:46,591
we'll know about it soon because Cruz
is never shy about publicly about

972
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:49,240
publicity regarding his craziest studs.

973
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,690
I certainly wouldn't be surprised that
this turned out to be the real deal

974
00:55:52,691 --> 00:55:54,170
though.
Um,

975
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,003
yeah,

976
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,380
no,
it's not publicity.

977
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:02,520
He's selling the movie and if he fucking
flew a helicopter nose down and do a

978
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:06,660
goddamn ravine, yeah, they're going to
talk about it. Um, yeah. That's not true.

979
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,520
There's no way.
That's fucking true.

980
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,783
Okay.

981
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:17,170
I actually did a little research on this
question in f 35 costs just south of

982
00:56:17,601 --> 00:56:20,720
$100 million. You're not going to
stick a fucking actor in there.

983
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,460
Uh, now they might, if he could fly
two people in it, which I don't know,

984
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,970
they might put him up there with
the fucking instructor. Yeah.

985
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:30,360
Okay.

986
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:35,340
Okay. And let him fly the
fucking thing around and uh,

987
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,860
they could do it that way and then
just digitally remove that guy from the

988
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:45,070
fucking phone. The, uh, the,
the, the shot or whatever.

989
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,920
I Dunno, just Tom Cruise.
If anybody's going to do it,

990
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:51,000
I would imagine it would be him,

991
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:53,520
but there's no fucking way they're
going to let them fly one solo.

992
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,370
Okay.

993
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,740
I mean, that's probably the entire
budget of the fucking movie.

994
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:59,220
If he crashes that thing.

995
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:00,880
Okay.

996
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,800
He's going to parachute out. I Dunno. Uh,

997
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,870
yeah, I would, I would say, yeah, there's
no way he's going to fly it alone,

998
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,320
but I think there's a good chance that
he could, you know, flying around.

999
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:13,800
Yeah.

1000
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,350
If, uh, if there was somebody
else up there with them,

1001
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,710
which I would think just be
just taking the stick, you know?

1002
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,390
Okay.

1003
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:26,010
Right. I can't imagine how small
the movements are in that thing.

1004
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,460
Before you were inverted,
you know,

1005
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,870
terrified. It would be like, okay bill,
you have controls, I have controls,

1006
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:38,010
you have controls. Right. And
then yeah, you fucking, I,

1007
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:43,030
I would move that thing a fucking cunt
hair just to see because I worried that I

1008
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:47,170
would be like, totally did you
want to stay in like also like

1009
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,130
if you look at the trading of that,

1010
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,120
okay.

1011
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,600
But God knows he's going to do it.
Like when you've

1012
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:56,910
yeah,

1013
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,390
just, I don't even know what speed.
Anytime you, you do those maneuvers,

1014
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:03,780
like they have to like tighten
up their entire fucking insides.

1015
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,380
Are they a whole body to keep the blood
from going down to their feet and they

1016
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,950
then passing out while they're flying?
There's this,

1017
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,350
they have a suit at like
compresses it and like,

1018
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:21,090
I mean I don't know anything about it
but like what, what they're doing is,

1019
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,840
is just completely at like, you know, you
just look at f one racing, the amount of,

1020
00:58:24,841 --> 00:58:25,470
Geez,

1021
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,680
where they're calming down
the straightaway when just
sims hitting the brakes

1022
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,040
and then making that turn.
Like their neck muscles

1023
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,010
are literally off the fucking chains from
just being able to hold it up. Right.

1024
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:41,770
And I know they have that device in now
so they can kind of lead against it.

1025
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:45,280
But back in the day, like back
in the day, those old schools,

1026
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:47,650
stock car drivers like Dale Earnhardt,

1027
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:50,650
if you ever went to fucking
try to choke that guy to death,

1028
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:52,270
he could just sit there staring at you.

1029
00:58:52,271 --> 00:58:55,630
What he drank a beer is you squeezed with
all your might be like trying to choke

1030
00:58:55,631 --> 00:59:00,600
out a fucking Louisville slugger
and those guys who just go on,

1031
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:05,590
you know, 200 miles an hour,
I can't imagine, you know.

1032
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:06,690
Okay.

1033
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,950
Is every mach speed of sound, is that what
it is? Mach one is the speed of sound.

1034
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:14,220
Is that or is it a thousand miles an hour?
I can't even fucking remember.

1035
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,910
But those plays could basically do shit
that the human body can't even fucking

1036
00:59:17,911 --> 00:59:19,950
handle it this point.
Um,

1037
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,660
okay.

1038
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,080
If it

1039
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,280
wasn't Tom Cruise,
if it wasn't Tom Cruise,

1040
00:59:26,281 --> 00:59:30,960
I would be confident to say
that they won't let them do
it. But it is Tom Cruise.

1041
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,700
It is part of his brand and that's
how it works out here. Your brand,

1042
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:37,700
uh,

1043
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,860
I'm going to say he's going to go up
with an instructor or they're going to be

1044
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:42,694
flying.

1045
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,060
Yeah.

1046
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:48,890
Slow and he's gonna do some shit.
That's what I want.

1047
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:49,770
That's what I'm going to guess.

1048
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,530
He's going to learn how to
invert it and stuff like that.

1049
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:56,130
And this guy's going to be, he's going
to be on with him. In other words,

1050
00:59:56,131 --> 00:59:59,640
he's also on the fucking controls and uh,

1051
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,520
I dunno. I mean, Jesus quite,

1052
01:00:02,521 --> 01:00:06,000
you're talking about a guy that hung
onto the side of a fucking plane while it

1053
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:10,020
took off, flew the pattern in
Quebec around and landed. I mean,

1054
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:11,610
I wouldn't put anything past that guy.

1055
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,603
You know,

1056
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,590
and I get all the respect to the world
for him because all I do was memorize,

1057
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,560
memorize my lines. It'd be like I stop
on that piece of tape and then I say it.

1058
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,460
Okay. That's the level of
work that I put into it.

1059
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:33,110
I'm kidding. I actually think of a decent
actor. All right. Then you can see it,

1060
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:33,471
you know,

1061
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:36,630
right now in New York and La with the
limited release of the front runner

1062
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:37,640
starring Hugh Jackman.

1063
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,340
MMM.

1064
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:45,320
Who may or may not be a guest on
this podcast. Later on this week,

1065
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:49,580
we shall see. We shall
see all Billy a list. Huh?

1066
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,690
That'd be the biggest fucking
guest. Have a got, I think, uh,

1067
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:58,400
be right up there with all of them. The
biggest people I've gotten to this part.

1068
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,430
Okay. I have so few guests
that can't fucking remember.

1069
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:02,510
Yeah.

1070
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:06,170
Chris Leighton was a huge one drama for
Stevie Rayvon telling all those Stevie

1071
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:10,790
fucking stories. That was a
big one. Uh, but anyways, the
front runner will, will be,

1072
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:14,420
uh, have a nationwide release,
I believe later on this week.

1073
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,760
And why don't you swing
by and check it out.

1074
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:19,830
It's a great movie to Gary Hart's Story.
All right.

1075
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,460
You Grant Vera Farmiga
directed by Jason Reitman. Uh,

1076
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,730
an old freckles. Don't blink.
You'll miss me. All right.

1077
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,750
Have a great couple of days. Go fuck
yourselves and I'll check it on Thursday.
