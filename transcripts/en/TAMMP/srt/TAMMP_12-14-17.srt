1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,640
Hey, what's going on is bill burns
time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,330
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and yeah,

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,690
just checking in on you.
You liked up.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,890
That was my imitation of a car with no
balls going from first gear to second

5
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:21,180
gear.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,240
Ah,

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,050
well actually would start in
first. So that's, it's sec.

8
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:32,051
My impression of a car with no balls
going from second to third gear.

9
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,240
That's what it is.
Sorry,

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,630
I just wanted you to know every fucking
person out there listening to this.

11
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:40,900
I'll right. We get the joke bill. God,

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,060
speaking of jokes,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,010
I'm going to be at the hard rock cafe
tonight in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,070
Huh?
Jesus Christ.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,540
How many sexual harassments can happen
just on the fucking beaches out here?

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,630
Good Lord.
I mean,

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,960
is that story ever going to end every
time you think they got the last guy?

18
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,850
I mean that, that down to like fucking,
they're going to have to cook snow.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,790
How was making bacon and all of a sudden
I felt these heads and I was like,

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,340
wait,
is that squid still alive?

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,190
Turned around and all I saw
was orange and freckles.

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh Christ. Meanwhile, we're
spending $1 billion a month.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,800
I finally just,
I dunno,

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,060
we're spending $1 billion a month fighting
people that train on a fucking jungle

25
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:37,350
gym. I just, I, it's like,
it's like throwing $1 billion.

26
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,930
If you have a beehive on the
side of your fucking house,

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,470
you got to get rid of the
bees. Absolutely. You're
going to beat those bees,

28
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:48,440
but you're not gonna have
any fucking money. Sorry.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,520
Anyways, plowing ahead
here. Um, by the way,

30
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:57,521
I am in a week to week two
of 'em my Invisalign and I
just keep these fuckers in

31
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:03,290
cause I want this to be over as soon
as possible. Actually really like him.

32
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,910
I'm kind of used to it and now
my bite is totally fucking off.

33
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,940
I don't know what the fuck's going on with
me, but I'm, I'm, I'm riding this out,

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,000
but I only take these things out to eat.
You know,

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,470
I've already lost the little case. You
know that you're supposed to carry him in.

36
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,130
They give you a blue one that's
blue and the one that's red,

37
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,200
the blue one you supposed
to take out in public,

38
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:27,980
the other one's red and that
means stop leave it at home.

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,980
Okay.

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,980
So you know me, you don't know
me. You think you know me,

41
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:34,170
but you know a lot of what you
think you know about me is right.

42
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,150
So I've already fucking lost, uh, my, uh,

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,140
my container here,

44
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:45,141
but I got this container of icebreakers
mints and I noticed that their gum

45
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:49,740
container is the exact same fucking
shape as the other containers.

46
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:54,510
So I just figured rather than
going to, you know, fuck,

47
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,300
I lost my container.org,
Oregon,

48
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,380
you know, ordering another one. Um, I'll
just use the icebreaker mid thinking.

49
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,510
That's probably stupid.
Then I'll think it's governmental.

50
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,720
Shake it and I won't hear any gum
in there and I'll throw it out. Oh,

51
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,580
well we'll see.
You know,

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,170
I think Alannis Morissette said it best
when she said you have man, you learn.

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,233
Um

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,010
Huh.

55
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,780
Jesus Christ. What an album that
was. Huh? My God. Good Lord.

56
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,160
You know, looking back now, looking
back at that album, it's just like a,

57
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,920
I think you,
you need to go take like an MMA class.

58
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,410
Yeah.

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,230
And if you actually learned how to beat
the shit out of somebody who wouldn't be

60
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:40,090
so fucking emotional,
you could just be like a guy,

61
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,210
you know, sitting there all fucking
stoic at the end of the bar,

62
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:46,420
stewing in your anger, listening
to James Brown, the big payback.

63
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,330
Fantasizing about what the fuck
you want to do. You could do that.

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,040
Well, you can be like, you know,

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,250
freaking people out with the Goddamn
Ukulele sitting there going, hey,

66
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,580
hey, hey, hey,

67
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,270
wait, let us he's, he found somebody else.
He's not coming back. All right. Just,

68
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,990
you going to have to accept this. What
the fuck happened on my computer screen?

69
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,560
Yeah, that's, that's, that's computed
for go fuck is, oh, it's back.

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,820
Look, goes back, back again. Um, anyways,

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,870
a couple of announcements.
Uh, Patrice O'Neal benefit.

72
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:32,960
February 20th makes a great
Christmas gift. Come on people,

73
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,850
you getting down to the fucking why

74
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,590
it's December 14th, man. Hanukkah is
already three days in. I got to give it,

75
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,620
I got to give it up to fucking mainstream
people for putting up really going all

76
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:51,050
out with the minorities.
This year I was down the Improv.

77
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:56,051
They had a GI at fucking Christmas tree
in this little fucking piece of Shit

78
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,290
Menorah. You know what I
mean? It was fucking nuts.

79
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,190
As little piece of shit just
sitting on the fucking piano.

80
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:07,160
But there was two days late. That was
last night, right. With two nights ago,

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,700
we were in the fourth day.
On the fourth day of Hanukkah,

82
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,730
my Jewish friend gave to me a piece
of Shit Menorah from the Improv.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,900
Um, four days. Then I came
to the hard rock cafe.

84
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:23,900
They've got a couple of lights
fucking lit up there. I had no idea.

85
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:28,340
It took the red eye in, uh, flew in on a
fucking virgin airlines, which by the way,

86
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:32,690
I don't feel comfortable
flying that fucking airline
cause I think they put more

87
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:37,691
money into their fucking seatbelt song
video then they did on the actual plane.

88
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:42,020
Cause every time I get on that fucking
plane, you know me, I'm a fancy guy.

89
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,270
I spent 20 years in the back of the
fucking plane. I ain't going back. Okay?

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,330
What I have to pay, okay. I want to
be breathing down the pilot's neck.

91
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,590
That's how I fly commercial.

92
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,620
I want to know when one of them
gets up to go the bathroom.

93
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,170
That's where the fuck I want to fly.
All right?

94
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,630
That's my one diva
demand in this business.

95
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,310
I fly up front. That's it. Um, I'm
not, I spent 20 years back then.

96
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,420
I'm not fucking going back there.
You know, I might, you know,

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,420
you never know what happens in your
career, but if I end up back there,

98
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:22,421
I swear to God I'm packing like a rock
star when they go on tour for fucking two

99
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,760
years where they bring one pair of pants,
two tee shirts and a toothbrush.

100
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,270
That's the way I'm packing.
I'm going to start dressing all in black.

101
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,720
Like George Carlin had Johnny Cash.
I've already worked it out.

102
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,170
If I fucking go back there,
okay,

103
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,300
if I have to go to the back of the plane
again, I'm going Vegan, I'm doing yoga.

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,570
I'm to become this skinny
as I possibly fucking can.

105
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,710
And then I'm bringing this little fucking
nap sack with me because that's all

106
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:53,450
the back of the plane is.
It's just stress. Fuck.

107
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:57,830
How fat is the fat fuck sitting
next to me going to be, fuck,

108
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,610
is it going to be fucking
head space? Let me, sorry.

109
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,120
Overhead compartment space
for my little fucking bag.

110
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,580
That's all it is.

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,480
The whole fucking thing is that fuck
is the person next to me going to be

112
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,450
snoring. Fuck. Am I going to
sit next to the bathroom? Fuck,

113
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,130
I'm in the back of the plane.

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,900
After awhile I got sick
of it after a while.

115
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,100
Freckles got sick of it and I just
said, fuck this. How much is it?

116
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,870
I don't give a shit. Throw it
on the fucking card. So anyway,

117
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:34,450
so I said, I'm sitting up
front. All right. And uh,

118
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,130
he never threw flew virgin airlines.

119
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:41,000
If they have this fucking
music video that they did,

120
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,440
which I get doing the announcements, you
know, there are emergency exits are here.

121
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:49,220
This is fucking there. Don't do
this. Don't try to open any windows.

122
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,250
While the plane's in flight, you
know, whatever the fuck they say,

123
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,900
don't try to let your shoes on fire.

124
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,120
So they were like, this is
boring. Where the hip airline,

125
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,050
we have all this aquarium lighting here.
You know, let's, we liked the plane.

126
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,160
Like everyone's going to get a hand
job right after they fucking take golf.

127
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:11,750
Right. How long before they get
shit for their sexual harassment.

128
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:16,600
Fucking lighting. Yeah. Everyone
should smell like Cologne.

129
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:20,050
That's the way it's fucking lit on
those planes. And uh, so they, they,

130
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,080
they will make decide they decided out
of the bucket blue to make this music

131
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,104
video.

132
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay.

133
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,170
To like give you the announcements
and when I tell you this fucking,

134
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:32,880
it feels like it's 15
fucking minutes long. Yeah.

135
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,670
It's so fucking like loud.

136
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,500
And then everybody's doing that, you
know, Post Christina Aguilera singing.

137
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,030
Yeah.

138
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,940
You know where you got to hit
every note on the fucking scale.

139
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:50,780
Every three words like Christina
Aguilera singing, row, row, row, your

140
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,820
doing that fucking Jesus.
Like you tickle and a cat

141
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,420
and it's not enjoying it.

142
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,670
I'm not saying she's a bad singer,
but it's like I get it.

143
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,160
Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

144
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,270
So they have all of that fucking uh,

145
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,500
you know those fucking
women that when they sing,

146
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:18,090
they got a point where their voices go
in. Like it's like I get, I'm tone deaf,

147
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,070
but you know, I don't need you to
be doing like a fucking, you know,

148
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,380
leaving breadcrumbs of where the fuck
you going on the music scale. Okay.

149
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,480
I could tell by the way
my eardrums are vibrating.

150
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,580
You're getting up into
the stratosphere there.

151
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,183
MMM.

152
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,190
So this fucking song
goes on forever and ever.

153
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,580
And just when you think it's over it,
then they do this stupid robot part.

154
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,530
I don't even know what they're saying.

155
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,530
My grandpa painted bed, bed, bed, bed,

156
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,720
bed, Eh, Eh,

157
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,860
oh my God. Oh my God, I'm going
to light my shoes on, fire up.

158
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:54,980
This fucking thing doesn't end.
So,

159
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,880
and then what happens is I try
to put my headphones on, right?

160
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,840
And then you just say, excuse me. See
here, nine 11, support the troops.

161
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:05,750
Could you take your fucking
headphones off? Fortunately,

162
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:10,751
last night they didn't make me do that
cause I took the red eye in and the uh,

163
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,860
the stewardesses were were cool. Whatever
the fuck you supposed to call them,

164
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:18,290
flight attendees.
Um,

165
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,650
they were cool and they didn't make
me take the fucking things off,

166
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:23,790
but she's as fuck.
And then meanwhile they stay,

167
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:28,160
spend like fucking $1 million
on this goddamn thing. Um,

168
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,540
I'm all these fucking Waylon divas
and robot people in all of this shit.

169
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,380
And they then they take talks up in the
boring announcements that only took like

170
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:39,150
45 seconds.
Now it's like a 10 minute God damn video.

171
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,423
MMM.

172
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,480
And they spent all that fucking money
on that and I have never been on virgin,

173
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,560
flown up front and after I reclined the
seat, had the seat go a back up again.

174
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,750
The fucking stewardess always has flight
attendees always has to come over and

175
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:57,250
fucking windy to fly.

176
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:00,880
Any 10 year over year always has to come
and open that middle part and there's

177
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:05,380
some sort of secret fucking lever to
pull it up. So then that makes me think,

178
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,920
okay,
if this is what's going on with the seats,

179
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,870
like what's going on with the engine?
Um, all right. I was catastrophizing.

180
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,050
All right, but that's something
you do when you're on a plane.

181
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,700
Okay.

182
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,240
You know,
cause like when we were taken off,

183
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,390
it was vibrating a little bit too much.
I was just thinking like, you know,

184
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:25,310
it's lax. It's like, ah, fuck. What
if we crash into the ocean right now?

185
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,380
And even worse,
what if we have a really good pilot?

186
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:31,940
Like sully who doesn't have the decency
to just fucking knows it in and kill us

187
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,580
all instantly. Now we've got to
float. They're waiting for sharks.

188
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,700
The fucking Itas cause it's nighttime.
You know what I mean? During the day.

189
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:42,350
I want selly. Alright. At night, you know,

190
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,150
I don't know what I want. I want just,
just knows it forward. All right. Uh,

191
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
we don't get enough fucking
thrust to get lift here.

192
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,880
Speak for myself. I had a good one.
Yeah, just go straight down in. Um,

193
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,460
okay.

194
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,730
But anyways, uh, Jesus Christ,

195
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:03,090
I went to go buy a fucking magazine
before I got on the flight. My God,

196
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,170
everything was so fucking depressing.
Do you know the cover of Newsweek?

197
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,960
They got a picture of the earth,

198
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,020
like waterless saying that's what like
the future is going to be and it's just

199
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:18,420
like,
who in the fuck would buy that?

200
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,300
And I'm going to say I'm going to sit
there and read that and then do what?

201
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,960
Think about my [inaudible], my daughter
over there in, in some waterless world.

202
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,090
I Dunno. I think, uh,

203
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,580
you know, I mean I just don't
understand that, how that helps me.

204
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,860
And I also don't think that that's the
direction we're going to go in as much as

205
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,430
everybody's flapping their arms and
screaming, yelling and all of that shit.

206
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,970
There is some good news out there about
all of this type of stuff, you know?

207
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,500
Cause you know why I know this.
You know,

208
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:55,501
I know this because I'm getting sick of
all this fucking negative news and all,

209
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,180
you know the fucking iPhone now
they want you to fingerprint,

210
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:02,450
which I'm not sure doing so coincidentally
enough, all of a sudden my phone,

211
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:04,460
you know,
cause I didn't finish air quotes,

212
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:09,170
setting it up by giving a
fucking cell phone company.

213
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:10,650
Okay,

214
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,120
whoever the fuck it
is. Um, my fingerprint,

215
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,790
it's like, why would I give you my,
why would I give you my fingerprint?

216
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,310
You fucking assholes. First of all, I
love, oh apple keeps acting like this.

217
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:26,600
This epidemic of people getting
their phone's broken into.

218
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:28,190
Like if you set it down,

219
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,210
somebody's going to figure
out your 46 digit code.

220
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,710
Like they're fucking Christopher
Walken in the dead zone.

221
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:40,400
All they gotta do is touch,
shake your fucking hand, and
you're like, it's one, two,

222
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:44,570
three, four. Right? You're like,
fuck, he can get into my phone.

223
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,440
I've never had my phone
broken into because somebody
knew my fucking pass code.

224
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,890
I'm sure somebody has gone in another way,
sitting in the fucking,

225
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,380
you know their house.
I don't know how the fuck they do it,

226
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,240
but I know my thumbprint and showing
my face or whatever the fuck it is,

227
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:06,000
these assholes want from me.
Um,

228
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,640
oh fucking uh, Billy Apocalypto
here. I think I'm, I'm, I'm,

229
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,190
I dunno, I've made this claim before,
but I think I'm going to do it.

230
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,920
I might think I'm going to go,
but I'm going to go flip phone,

231
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:25,921
MP three player because the only reason
why I really liked the smartphone is I

232
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,940
loved it. All my music is on
there. I really enjoy that.

233
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,330
So if I was in the

234
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,780
cell phone fucking market,

235
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:42,781
what I would do is I would make flip
phones that could fucking carry the music,

236
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,450
you know,

237
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,680
flip phone slash MP three player and
I'm throwing that out there right now so

238
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:50,680
people can write me. Oh, actually
there is a phone like that.

239
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,150
It's called the MP three
player. Flippy. Uh,

240
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,430
it's made by sprint or whatever.
The fuck it, I'm going to go,

241
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,670
I think I'm going to do that.
And then when I'm on the road,

242
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,050
I'll just Skype on my computer. I
guess I'll do that fucking shit. Um,

243
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,980
speaking of which, by the way,
I've gotten into like fucking,

244
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,010
I downloaded this James Brown
album a long time ago. That was a,

245
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,010
let me see if I can find it.

246
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:23,570
Of course now I'm not going to be able to
find the fucking thing, go into library

247
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,030
type in his name. But
anyways, it's at this point,

248
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,380
even if you're a casual fan
of James Brown, you know,

249
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,490
they basically on the radio and
in movies and all of this shit,

250
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,430
all they do is they just, they,
they play like the same fucking,

251
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,930
you know,
the same five fucking songs,

252
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,570
20 songs.
You know,

253
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,730
Dan Patrick got a brand new bay.
They play that gut feel good.

254
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,820
The same ones. You got to get his fucking
albums where you can hear all the,

255
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:03,800
all the beside once. Um, and I've been,

256
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,470
you know, I bought this book,
this Trump book the other day,

257
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,620
which I'm just getting into it and it
looks like it's going to be one of the

258
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,000
best,
uh,

259
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,750
drunk books I've seen in a while
called the breakbeat Bible.

260
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,010
And it kind of breaks down. Um, we're,

261
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,480
although all the rappers and everybody,

262
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:24,470
like all the songs that they sample
all those drum brakes and then the kids

263
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:28,100
would dance to them, which, why are
they will call breakdancers all of that,

264
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:31,040
all that shit that the white guy like
me didn't know til I watched a couple of

265
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,430
Netflix documentaries and
I watched a drum cover of,

266
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:38,270
I forget what the fuck I was watching.
I think the funky drummer,

267
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,190
like someone was showing me all the
ghost notes and stuff and said that they,

268
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:45,470
that they had a good breakdown
of it. And this, this, this book,

269
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,900
the breakbeat Bible,
which I got.

270
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,750
And then it came with the little
fucking MP three CD. I'm like,

271
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,400
what the fuck is that?
How I do this?

272
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:56,690
And now all of a sudden I'm getting a flip
phone, an MP, three player. So anyways,

273
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,613
um,

274
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,340
I would highly recommend checking out
like some of all of his shit and like

275
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:07,180
alternate takes and stuff. Uh, what the
fuck is the name of it? Now, of course,

276
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:10,270
they're not going to show me the
name of the fucking thing are they?

277
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,740
It's called make it funky.
Uh, for God's sakes.

278
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,820
I even like it shit in like
the 70s when it's kind of over.

279
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,300
Like everybody's moved on to like disco
and shit and everybody's ripped him off

280
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:27,030
and stuff and he's
still fucking like ACDC.

281
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:32,080
He's just doing what the fuck he
does. All right, let me see. Yeah,

282
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:34,990
make it funky.
Dash the big payback.

283
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:39,490
1971 to 1975 a I get that album.

284
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,720
I would download that shit.
Yeah, listen to that man.

285
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:46,540
It's fucking incredible.
And um,

286
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,110

thinking of drums, drum songs.

288
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,370
I want to fucking be able to
play. Uh, speaking of which,

289
00:17:56,371 --> 00:18:01,020
I think I'm doing the goddamn
comedy jam next month at the Roxy.

290
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,970
I think it's January 22nd. Is
that a Tuesday? Is that a Tuesday?

291
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,980
Let's see here. Let's
see here. It's a Monday.

292
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,880
It's either the 22nd or the 23rd.
Um,

293
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,450
in the fucking Song Josh
Adam Meyers wants to do,

294
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,550
cause I want to do this fucking song
and it's just like, it's like, dude,

295
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,350
I want to go there and have a good time.

296
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,570
I don't want my fucking
arms to be fallen off.

297
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,310
He wants to do this fucking iron maiden.
So I'm one of those Clive burnt ones.

298
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,910
We either your arms or your foot
is going to fucking fall off.

299
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,550
Like I'd love to do a cover
of the prisoner, but that one,

300
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:41,050
when he does those for bass drums in a
fucking row, on a good day I can get that.

301
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,110
But in front of a room full of people
where I'll be in my head be like,

302
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,370
oh my God, don't tighten up. I
know it's just going to fuck it.

303
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm going to shit the bed.

304
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:51,550
I'll pay like two and a half and then the
whole band is going to look back at me

305
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:55,570
and smiling like, yeah,
yeah, just a comedian. Um,

306
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,510
I don't want to go through that. You
know, I want to live the lie. Like,

307
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,020
I'm actually,

308
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,980
I couldn't like light in myself that
I could have done this professionally.

309
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,510
That's all you want. Audio. Hobby. Right.

310
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay.

311
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,210
You don't give a fuck about
getting compliments that your job,

312
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,610
it's all about your fucking hobby.

313
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,780
Yeah.

314
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,050
Somebody's appreciating that you'd
be a goddamn neurosurgeon. Oh my God.

315
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:21,440
I can't believe the way you replace
my brain. I just want to thank you.

316
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:24,300
And the guy's not even thinking that he's
not even fucking, you know what I mean?

317
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:26,000
Not even hearing it.
It's not even listening to you.

318
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,340
Then somebody comes walking
in and you're like, Hey doc,

319
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:32,780
did you put this ship in this bottle?
That's amazing. And the guys, same guys,

320
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:33,614
just like

321
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,010
my wife doesn't support
me and says I'm bad at it.

322
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,250
Um, anyways, I fucked up people.

323
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:49,660
I went to a Goddamn cvs and I bought
the wrong fucking disposable fucking

324
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:54,040
raises. I should've gone to dollar
shave club and I didn't. I just,

325
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,100
in a spur of the moment,
I might get some cheap razors.

326
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,100
I can need to shape my fucking head
when I'm on the road and you can't my

327
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:00,641
experience,

328
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:03,940
you cannot have three blades when you
shave your head because you're going to

329
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,760
hack up the back of your head.
You need the two blades.

330
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:10,870
So now I got like three packs of
these fucking thing. Thanks. And um,

331
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,880
so next time I do a show in La,
if I remember I'm bringing them,

332
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,910
I'm just going to give them
away to somebody in the
crowd cause I'm not fucking

333
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,170
fucking throw them out.
Um,

334
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,340
Jesus Christ too.

335
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,120
I always getting patient in the end
when I do the back of my head after you

336
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:28,781
shave your head,

337
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:32,050
then you got to go over it one more time
to make sure he didn't miss anything.

338
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,590
I just, and that's the time I cut my head.
Just go quick, quick, quick, quick, quick,

339

it's just like Jesus Christ. You know,

340
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,180

of my head. You know, I'm fortunate.

341
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,050
It's on the back of my head.
So people come out to my,

342

343
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,870

my goddamn head. All right,

344
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,500

Thank God it's over.

486
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,720
So when you live in a world,

487
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:35,721
in a world where everyone's sexually
harassing somebody and Newsweek as a

488
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,450
waterless earth on the carpet,
you gotta be asking yourself,

489
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,000
where do I go to get out
of this negative cloud?

490
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,183
Hmm?

491
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,350
Where do I go? Well, I swear to God,
I'm so sorry I wore my Invisalign.

news and I found this thing,

495
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,040
the good news network,
man.

496
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,830
God Damn it.

497
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,660
he lets you want it to say some positive
news here. Let's end on a positive note.

498
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,460
Good news in history, December
14th, on this day, 40 years ago,

499
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:19,510

starring a young John Travolta.

500
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,290
Is it champion dancer with
all this date rape friends,

501
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,930
there's something positive.

502
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:28,900
I want to put my little negative
spin and all of this, uh,

503
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,920
burger king drive through worker goes
firewall after it helping a diabetic

did he give her on the menu

505
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,950
or is that a her? I think
that might be, or her.

506
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,480
I think that's a,
her um,

guy shows you how to use Amazon prime
to instantly help the homeless. Okay.

508
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:57,420
There's some fucking advertising
laden as a positive fucking story.

509
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,860
Okay.

510
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,740
Needle free injections is,
it's just all fucking commercials.

511
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:05,340
That was a burger king commercial.
This isn't positive. Oh.

512
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:08,910
And a historic announcement.
World Bank says it will no longer finance,

513
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:10,860
oil and gas exploration.
Okay.

514
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,380
The bank is walking away from oil and
gas exploration and they're going to give

515
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:17,730
the oil companies the sun.

516
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,980
Okay.

517
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,291
All right.

518
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:25,310
The World Bank has just announced their
groundbreaking decision to cease all

519
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:29,900
investments in oil and gas exploration
over the course of the next two years.

520
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,360
This,
this can't be true in two years,

521
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,250
they're going to have no
money to drill for oil.

522
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,760
We're going to flip over to
fucking solar that quickly.

523
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,850
The announcement comes as a
welcome followup to the, you know,

524
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,910
it kind of helps if you're
reading positive news and
I'd have a negative cunt.

525
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,790
Fucking,
I like to think I'm more cynical.

526
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,930
Um,

Yeah.

533
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,420
I don't know what I, I don't know where
I am right now in the Internet, but, um,

534
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,990
I kinda like it. This is the system
kind of light news that I like.

535
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:23,260
Why does my pet look like me?
Speaking of which

536
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,403
Cleo,

537
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,310
who was in town this week,
I got to take three days in a row.

538
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,490
I got to take her on hikes
and I gotta tell you, man,

539
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,850
I still love that dog with all my heart.
But I,

540
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,740
I made the best decision of my life.
Uh,

541
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,820
she's now living with my
trainer who has to skills.

542
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,570
The dog has never been happier.
She's never looked more relaxed.

543
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,520
And for the first time in her life,
she's actually friends with another dog.

544
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,310
How amazing is that off leash,
you know, going up, you know,

545
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:57,260
smelling each other.
You know,

546
00:32:57,261 --> 00:33:01,070
she's probably about a month and away
from laying in the sun with another dog,

547
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,010
just being happy as hell. And, um,

548
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,550
I wish I had the skill set to get
her there. God knows I didn't.

549
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,600
Thank God I did what I did.
And it's great that my trainer,

550
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,900
whenever he comes back to Los Angeles,

551
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:19,640
always brings her along and uh, it's
fucking awesome. It's really awesome.

552
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:24,470
I'm so happy for, although I still
miss her. I still miss that dog.

553
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,590
Um, anyways, but it had a happy ending.

554
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,990
Just like good news network.org.

555
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,903
MMM.

556
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,940
Okay. The announcement of the
World Bank comes as a week.

557
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,500
Welcome followup to the
financial institution's
decision to trop all investment

558
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,980
in the coal industry back in 2010 now,

559
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,770
after years of pressuring
from environmentalist,

560
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:50,150
the World Bank will draw up almost a
billion dollars in annual loans from oil

561
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:54,200
and gas groups. Well, this is just
a World Bank. It's not every bank,

562
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,360
so I'm sure chase and Wells Fargo will
gladly take that business that they just

563
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:00,194
dropped.

564
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,313
MMM.

we're not going to have a fucking world
without water and we're just not going

569
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,920
to do it. Okay. I refuse to,

570
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,470
I can't walk around with a kid
thinking that that's going to happen.

571
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,480
What's going to happen is basically,

572
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,110
this is just a bad hundred
20 years or whatever,

573
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,310
where we went in a direction we
zigged when we should have zagged.

574
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,280
Nobody's fucking wrong.
All right.

575
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,120
Quit pointing fucking fingers
at different colored ties.

576
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:41,370
Let's all get on the same fucking page.
It's a great way to,

577
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,720
I dunno, I went the fuck. Do I know
what I'm going to, Goddamn scientist.

578
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:48,270
My whole thing is let's stop fucking
spending $1 billion a month to fight the

579
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:53,270
fucking, uh, the, our gang from the
little rascals over there. You know,

580
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:58,050
they're bankrupt in us. You get
over here, you go fucking Sola,

581
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,870
right? And then those
people, first of all,

582
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,140
you don't even need to bankrupt
isis to second. We leave that.

583
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:07,590
Just going to go back to killing
each other. Just like when Russia,

584
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,620
when Russia left fucking, when Russia
collapsed and they're literally nineties.

585
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,570
I'm really going on in Olympia. I really
don't know much about world history,

586
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,310
but when Russia left Eastern Europe
right after they collapsed and all those

587
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:23,670
people got their fucking freedom again.
And everyone's like, oh, this is great.

588
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,910
All these poor,
oppressed people they meet.

589
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,100
They picked up fights that I had never
heard of because my entire, you know,

590
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:30,270
that whole Bosnian Serbs,

591
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:32,310
that whole fucking horrific
thing that happened over there,

592
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,790
I guess that shit was going on. And then
Russia came in, they had a common enemy.

593
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,560
They will fight in Russia
for the whole time.

594
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:40,620
And then the second they leave they
started right back up with their Hatfield

595
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,490
and McCoys Shit, you know? So,

596
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,500
which is always good. A war is
always good. That's another,

597
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,270
it's a very pro environmental,

598
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:55,560
I actually know cause the light fucking
oil fields on fire and all of that shit.

599
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:00,510
Uh, I dunno, whatever.
There's some, something will
happen, something will happen.

600
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,440
We'll fix it up, you know? Or maybe not.

601
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,340
Robots will come along and
they'll kill enough. Enough of us,

602
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,313
you know,

603
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,500
is there any good news on
this website about robots?

604
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,830
You know what it's really going
to take to turn this shit around.

605
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,430
It's going to take people like Elon Musk
not saying this guy's a fucking saint.

606
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,073
All right.

607
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,820
I'm just hoping he has a better product.

608
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:27,590
They have to start bribing politicians
the way oil companies and banks too.

609
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,350
Right?
That's where they have to do.

610
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,670
They got to get the electric people
have to get the politicians on the take.

611
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,130
So when the OBAMAS and they're fucking,
um,

612
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,770
they're run as president when they go
around and they give their speeches,

613
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,460
you know, the big
payback fucking tour, uh,

614
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,400
they would actually go to these companies
instead of the fucking oil companies

615
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:53,650
and the big banks and all of that type
of shit. That's all it is there a day.

616
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:54,560
Did you hear what I just said?

617
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:59,561
People I just solved the world's pollution
problems or financial problems and

618
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:03,620
our energy crisis all in one.

619
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:04,990
Okay.

620
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,800
One minute string of sentences that
was not even remotely released,

621
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,750
uh,
researched.

622
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,573
Okay.

623
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,870
And that's what you should be coming here
for. I'm going to make you feel better.

624
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,600
I will. I'll give you good news, Dude.

625
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,020
By the way, my condolences
to Philadelphia Eagle fence.

626
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,293
All right.

627
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,490
I finally just watched that fucking
eagles rams game, which was absolutely,

628
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,010
it's just a great fucking game
and all these fucking assholes.

629
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,750
[inaudible] it felt no.

630
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:45,610
You know what it is. You weren't
really a fan. That's what it was. Okay.

631
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,910
And what happened was too many
of the fucking sex symbols,

632
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,980
the quarterbacks went down this year.

633
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,140
And I think that that's why the product
is going down. All right, Aaron Rodgers,

634
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,900
Andrew Luck.
Now Carson Wentz is out.

635
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,540
You really have to enjoy football to
watch all their backups come in and play.

636
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,770
And uh,

637
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,800
what's great about when they go down
and then you get to see like how good it

638
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,000
had coached too.
They have,

639
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,780
can he design a game plan that can
fucking deal with the fact like bill

640
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:20,740
Belicheck did when we had a Freddy fingers
there when fucking the fuck with that

641
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:22,510
guys. Phil Mutchnik
what? That was his name.

642
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,320
Now he went to Kansas City and everybody
was all excited, including Paul verse.

643
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:31,050
He's saying the guy was a franchise
quarterback and I was saying, dude,

644
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:32,880
he was driving a fucking Lamborghini.

645
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,610
He was driving a Lamborghini
and fucking a new England. Now,

646
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,450
now they just gave him a z 28 and it's
going to look the same way. He's gonna.

647
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,990
He's not gonna look the same.
The hell was the guy's name.

648
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,570
I want to say his first name was Carson.

649
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:49,840
Considering so many fucking people's
name, quarterback named Carson, who?

650
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,130
Carson Wentz out for the goddamn season.

651
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,070
I'm going to,
I'm going to retweet.

652
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,930
Did you guys hear that Eagle's fan call
the sports show and he started crying.

653
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,823
Just let go of your way.

654
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,530
There's no way bureau,
if you're a Boston sports fan,

655
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,060
you're like over the age of
like 40, you know? Exactly.

656
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,040
I remember I had a buddy of mine after
the Aaron Boone home run called up and he

657
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:17,874
was like in tears.

658
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,650
There's one year I didn't
want to see with it.

659
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,940
You too much. I mean, Jesus Christ.

660
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,050
Okay,

661
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,870
there you go.
26 championships,

662
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,530
right? Then all of a sudden it's always,
it's always darkest before the Dawn,

663
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,640
you know, and now look
at us now, we're now,

664
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:41,170
we're the fucking spoiled rich kids
with all the goddamn championships. So,

665
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,004
um,

666
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:43,860
okay.

667
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,080
I Dunno, I dunno what to
tell you, but I swear to God,

668
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm really starting to
believe that Philadelphia,

669
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:52,500
Kansas City and San Diego,

670
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,530
like they built their stadiums on some
like ancient native American burial

671
00:39:58,381 --> 00:40:01,520
ground or something. I,
there's no other way to explain

672
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,640
it and it really comes to,
it's not

673
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,060
okay.

674
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,580
Death they lose.
It's still way that they lose.

675
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:14,581
It reminds me of being like a red socks
patriots and all a Bruins fan growing

676
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:20,020
up. We had the Celtics, thank God, but
it was just like all of those teams,

677
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,570
they didn't have the decency to just suck.

678
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,390
They had to get right there.

679
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,290
And when everybody was watching and they
then they had too many men on the ice,

680
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,030
Bucky dent roughing the passer, you
know, whatever the fuck. You know,

681
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,070
our fucking bill Parcells announces
to the team before the Superbowl.

682
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,220
I'm not going to be back next year.
I'm selling my house that fat to an cunt.

683
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,920
Um, who by the way, never won
shit without bill Belichick.

684
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,750
Overrated under it. Overrated
bill. Parcells Oh, Bill,

685
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,260
you're going to get some shit on that one.
I don't think he's fucking overrated.

686
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,680
It just pissed me off that he had
a fucking goddamn temper tantrum

687
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,950
about that cause you know,

688
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,180
because the owner overruled them
and made them draft Terry Glenn,

689
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,460
rest his soul who they then,

690
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,720
then everywhere bill Parcells went
after he fucking brought Terry Glen.

691
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,270
But when he was in New England is a Gui.
You want me to cook the meal?

692
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,450
They go to buy the groceries.
Yeah.

693
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:23,090
Well from the looks of you eating
everybody else's fucking meal. Um,

694
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,750
anyways, plowing ahead here. Uh,

695
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,420
and I didn't fro Cleveland in there and
I won't throw Cleveland in there because

696
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't have any sympathy for Cleveland
sports fans the way I don't have.

697
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:42,680
I'd never had sympathy for fucking cubs
fans just because everybody gives a shit

698
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:43,514
about you.

699
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,610
They're always doing stories about how
fucking sad you are. People give a fuck.

700
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,781
You know what I mean?

701
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:54,470
You like that little kid that fell down
and his mother was right there to hug

702
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:57,050
him and kiss him.
That's what Cleveland fans are.

703
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,440
Okay.

704
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,190
Nobody gives a fuck about Philly fan.

705
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:02,550
Somebody gives a shit about
what's going on in Kansas City.

706
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,150
Nobody gives a fuck about everything
that happened to the charger fans that

707
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:09,930
weather's perfect. Fuck them.
Nobody cares. And then the
team left. Nobody cares.

708
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,170
All right.
I love the browns.

709
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,180
I fucking, they fucked up
their uniform. So, and uh,

710
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,640
their quarterback has my, my favorite
quarterback name in the league right now.

711
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,780
The Sean Kaiser.

712
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,330
Okay.

713
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:29,720
African American, yet possibly a
Nazi. I mean, how do you beat that?

714
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,640
How'd he beat the duality of that?

715
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,560
Um, anyways, what am I do?

716
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,260
I think that's the end of
the podcast that I did.

717
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,320
I talk about everything that I want to
talk about. Oh, by the way, coming up,

718
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,370
I can't believe this.
This'll be my 10th rose bowl in a row.

719
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,670
I'm in double digits.
And if I keep going,

720
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:59,040
that means at some point when I die,
they're going to win.

721
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,780
I beat that old guy that they
announced, you know, and then

722
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,560
we went up 40 Shelburne
road bowls in a row.

723
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,150
Um, I was actually thinking
if I live to a hundred,

724
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,530
I'll have gone to 60 in a row or 61.

725
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:17,390
Okay.

726
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,930
Oh my God. How close to the fucking
stadium will I have to park?

727
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,320
We'll have to do you know,
you,

728
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:26,570
you're parked on a golf course still
literally have to send a golf cart out to

729
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:30,500
me. Um, and by the way,

730
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,360
I am really fighting, not going
off the wagon for one day that day.

731
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,960
I keep going back and forth.
Like I'll just go off one day,

732
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,880
one day I'll get fucking hammered.
And then I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

733
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,780
Cause I wanna go,
I wanna go a whole calendar year.

734
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:52,010
January,
right through to December without booze.

735
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,380
And that would put me at 501 days. And
then next year's Rosebowl not this one.

736
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:01,580
The next one I would come off the wagon.
I Dunno what,

737
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,530
I have no idea. I haven't, I
haven't figured it out, but um,

738
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,430
yeah,

739
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,230
let's just put it this way.
I'm getting weak.

740
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,710
Hey, you guys let me know some good
MP, three players, if you don't mind.

741
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,920
Oh by the way, Santa
Steve Simone, Santa Steve,

742
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:24,610
Steve's Simone and regulate hero are
raising money again this year for children

743
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:27,660
fighting cancer and their families.
Monday morning podcasts.

744
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:30,610
Listeners help raise 15
grand last year around

745
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,810
last time around and it, I dunno if
though they just fucked up the set.

746
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,170
We raised 50 grand last year and had
a huge impact on a lot of families.

747
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,580
Their stories are brutal.

748
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,730
We're going to spare you this stories
and every little bit helps this goal.

749
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,120
The goal this year is we're
going to try to raise 50 grand a,

750
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:50,610
I'm going to tweet the link today.
Retweeted,

751
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:54,930
I should say thank you for everybody
who's been helping out. Um, all right.

752
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:59,460
Is that it? Oh, I never talked about
the Yankees Getting Giancarlo Stanton.

753
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,510
All right.
And I know what you guys are thinking.

754
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,260
I'm going to be frothing at the mouth
and we talking about Derek Jeter,

755
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:11,700
the front office. If the Patriots did
some shit like this, they'd waterboard us.

756
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,700
Fuck all that.
All right.

757
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,200
I still will always hate the Yankees,
but like,

758
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,280
I can't get mad at that fucking
move. All right. They've,

759
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,830
they're doing everything I
wished the red sox were doing.

760
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:27,540
They built from their own system.

761
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,990
They have a young team
that way over achieved.

762
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,380
I mean even without gene Carlisle,
I was like,

763
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:37,990
these guys are going to get
number 27 they got 26 to 26,

764
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,640
28 they're going to get number
28 within the next five years.

765
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:45,980
That's what I saw this year.
And now they added this guy and um,

766
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,500
basically that whole fucking team is
from their own system essentially.

767
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:54,180
Especially all their great players.

768
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,100
This guy became available and they went
out and got him. Who gives a fuck? My,

769
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,950
my team, the Red Sox, we've been
buying up the league forever.

770
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,010
Like the Yankees were like that fucking
person that your mother said don't hang

771
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:09,450
out with him.
He's a bad influence.

772
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:12,780
And then we secretly hung out with them
anyways and then we ended up doing what

773
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:13,614
they were doing.

774
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,120
Now we're hooked on the junk and they
went into fucking rehab but which still

775
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:22,890
strung out trying to fucking buy a
championship and they're building one old

776
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:25,440
school shit. And then they're
adding a there and a free agent.

777
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,600
I don't have a fucking problem with it.

778
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,380
And plus the fact that it came from
the Miami Marlins who their ownership,

779
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,800
I don't know if it's the
same one historically does
this puts together a good

780
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:35,131
team,

781
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:38,220
then they win a world series and then
they just dumped the whole fucking team

782
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,040
constantly fucking over the fence.

783
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,370
And I actually liked how I want us, Jean
Carlos Stanton was about it. So, uh,

784
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:51,720
and it's also, it's good when the
Yankees are good. Um, so I don't,

785
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:54,000
I don't have a problem with it. And, uh,

786
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,960
I don't think there was some sort
of collusion with, with Derek Jeter.

787
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:02,250
I don't think there was that, you know,
I don't think he's the main guy in there.

788
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,170
MMM.

789
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,310
And knowing him, I bet he was concerned,
like, this is going to make me look bad,

790
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,630
which never happened in his entire
fucking career. So he's probably thinking,

791
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:13,980
I don't need to start now.
I mean,

792
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:18,870
this isn't like when Kevin Mchale
sent Kevin Garnett to the Celtics.

793
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:20,040
I mean,
if I'm going to get mad at this.

794
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:23,520
And what about the Celtics in
2008 so what are you going to do?

795
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,550
That's how the fucking game was played up.
Sick of being a grumpy old man.

796
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,260
Congratulations to the Yankees
and you knew fucking guy.

797
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:33,490
But we now we gotta go buy somebody
that can strike out. You know?

798
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:37,540
You know what was funny though? Here's
my buddy versus he was like, oh,

799
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:40,900
the Yankees, he didn't see what
they did. They never disappoint.

800
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,080
This was the same guy flipping out when
Katie went to the fucking Golden State

801
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,850
Warriors.
It's a great move by the Yankees.

802
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:53,620
It's not good for baseball to
have a fucking MVP leaving Miami.

803
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,200
That's their guy.
He should've retired with them,

804
00:47:56,201 --> 00:48:00,370
but you have to blame the fucking
ownership on that one. Um,

805
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:03,820
it seemed like he wanted to stay. I read
a great article where he was saying,

806
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:07,540
listen, I don't want to rebuild. I want
to move forward. Let's get some pitching.

807
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:12,070
We got a great fucking team.
And they were like, no, no.

808
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,360
We're just going to make money off of
people coming down to watch you hit home

809
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:20,650
runs as you lose fucking a hundred out
of 162 games. He was like, fuck that.

810
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:25,450
I'm out of here. So a good for him. Um,
all right. That's the fucking podcast.

811
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:31,300
Uh, or freckles is, um, 119 days in

812
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:37,350
and uh, he starting to get the
shakes here. This is a deal.

813
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:42,140
If I can just get past the
rose bowl, I think, uh, look,

814
00:48:42,141 --> 00:48:45,860
I gotta go. I can't, six months is a good
time to stop, right? I'm four months in,

815
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,050
you know, I think I'm going to be,
I'm going to be doing a college tour.

816
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,860
We're trying to put this together in,
um,

817
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,200
in February,
you know,

818
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:04,210
I was going to start possibly the dream
is on this tour is to go to a Kansas

819
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:10,241
Jayhawks basketball game and it
Kentucky wildcat game start with Kansas.

820
00:49:10,641 --> 00:49:14,830
So start with Kentucky and then in Kansas
or and in Kentucky, you know, book,

821
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,370
end them with Games. And, uh, I
was going to do an f is for family

822
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,520
college tour, you know, and hopefully
get a bunch of free swag, you know,

823
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,830
to fucking throw with the kids when
I go there. You know what I mean? Um,

824
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,150
that's the game plan.
That's what that one working out.

825
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,710
But if I did that then
I'd be road dog in it.

826
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:40,970
So we'd probably rent a bus and
then that would be hard. Oh,

827
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:45,590
that would be a hard one. So I don't
know if there's always those. Thanks.

828
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,400
There's always those times we shall
see. Um, all right, that's the podcast.

829
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:51,820
That Thursday afternoon podcasts.
I was just checking in on you.

830
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Just see now you fucking weeks going a
happy Hanukkah to everybody and a happy

831
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,020
pre Christmas, merry Christmas.
Whatever the fuck I'm supposed to say.

832
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:03,860
Happy Kwanzaa.
Happy Ozark Day.

833
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,820
Whatever the fuck you say to people.
I have no idea. All right. Uh,

834
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:11,260
have a great weekend.
You can't enjoy the music and uh,

835
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,450
we'll have another half hour of a
greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon

836
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:19,130
podcast from a Thursday in a year gone
by or possibly, or the earlier this year.

837
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:20,240
Right?
I don't fucking know,

838
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,470
Eh.

839
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,453
Yeah.

840
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,650
Well,
as she

841
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,830
is my one

842
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,523
question,

843
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,050
so much time

844
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:13,440
bully, I can beat up. All right. Well
if there's a bully you can beat up.

845
00:51:13,441 --> 00:51:17,880
He's not really a bully. He's just
an asshole. Right? Hey Billy boy,

846
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:21,450
I'm a 15 year old lad from
Australia and it's my problem.

847
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,080
There was a complete Dick
head at my school that always
picks on me. But here's,

848
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,110
here's the twist.
I could smash the shit out of this prick.

849
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,430
I'm 182 centimeters.
That's six feet tall,

850
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:37,770
fit 15 years old, six feet
tall. He goes 74 kilograms.

851
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,010
That's 160 pounds. Few people keeping
score and every other day what are,

852
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,130
and he's about five,
eight and weighs about 185 pounds.

853
00:51:47,131 --> 00:51:51,900
All right, so he's got, he's got your
bike, he's got, you buy 25 pounds,

854
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,760
but you have the reach advantage. This is
the tale of the tape here. I love this.

855
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,860
You got a four inch reach advantage.

856
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:03,000
Unless he has those fucking Kevin Mchale
arms that are almost dragging on the

857
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:07,980
ground. All right, you go. I lift weights
every other day and he's just fat.

858
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:09,440
Okay.

859
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,050
All right. You're definitely
the favorite so far. He goes,

860
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:15,270
but this isn't the biggest
reason why I could smash this.

861
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:19,470
Can I have about 20 years
of martial arts experience?

862
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,210
Okay.

863
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,690
Wait a minute.
You're 15 years old.

864
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:26,460
How do you have 20 years of experience?

865
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,670
Okay.

866
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,660
Oh,
he's going to break it down.

867
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,320
I have about 20 years of martial arts
experience when you add it all up.

868
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:38,250
I have seven years in karate,
five years in movie tie. Oh,

869
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,180
Jesus. Dude, you bring those
fucking knees so that fat belly,

870
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:47,800
Oh my God. Probably got shins
like a fucking street pole. Um,

871
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,030
Street Pole, stop sign, whatever
the fuck I was trying to say.

872
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,920
I pictured a telephone pole and a
stop sign made out of metal fun.

873
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,830
I came up with St Paul. Look at
that. I'm inventing words here.

874
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,500
Seven years of karate,
five years of Muay Thai,

875
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:05,180
five years a Brazilian Jujitsu,
Jesus Christ, standing up,

876
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:08,930
go to the ground. What do you want
to dope? And three years of MMA,

877
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,370
he constantly calls me
name like gay boy and Poof.

878
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,140
And he slaps me in the back of the head
every day. Dude, you can't have that.

879
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,160
Uh, this has been happening for like
two months now and I haven't fought back

880
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:25,800
because I'm worried about getting in
trouble from teachers at martial arts

881
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:30,300
classes. Any advice as welcome?
Uh, thanks for whatever.

882
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,570
Whatever helps you. Uh,
whatever help you can give me.

883
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,430
Okay.

884
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,750
Go Fuck yourself and have a good day.
All right, sir. Well, this is the deal.

885
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,170
You could, or if you actually
applied what, you know,

886
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,980
you could seriously hurt this guy,
but you do have to defend yourself.

887
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:50,690
So is there a way that the next time
he goes to slap you in the head,

888
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:54,080
you can put them in one of those fucking,
those holds?

889
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,960
We're just holding the person's thumb
and they're all of a sudden on their

890
00:53:56,961 --> 00:53:59,000
tiptoes going, all right. All right.
All right. All right. All right.

891
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,500
Is there a way to just shoot one across
the bow? That's what I'm suggesting.

892
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:07,580
I'm not saying that you fucked this kid
up and then ruin your standing with uh,

893
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,950
your, uh, your seafoods, your
Sensei's, your, your, your pastors,

894
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:16,270
whatever the fuck you call
them down at the Dojo. Um,

895
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,920
okay.

896
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,161
Yeah,

897
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:23,150
but there's no reason for you to go to
school and get slapped in the back of the

898
00:54:23,151 --> 00:54:28,100
head and being called names.
Okay? So what I would do is, uh,

899
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,900
oh, what the fuck he asking me?
This is what you do. Jesus Christ.

900
00:54:32,901 --> 00:54:37,760
Here's your solution. Talk to one of you,
your karate masters there and just say,

901
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:38,690
listen,
this is the deal.

902
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:41,720
I know after everything that you've
taught me that I could wish what?

903
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:46,650
Mop the floor with this fat tub of Shit,
but I don't want to get in, you know,

904
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:50,510
bad standing with you. What,
what do I do here? Have them,

905
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,170
have them tell you what
to do and cause they'll,

906
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,220
they could probably suggest they know
the name of whatever that fucking

907
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,280
had a choke out somebody's thumb.

908
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:05,370
Whatever that thing is that you guys
do that I wish I knew how to do. Um,

909
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,380
but here's the deal. One
way or the another. Uh,

910
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,040
there has to be a solution with this guy
slap and you this slapping you in the

911
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:15,740
back of the fucking head.
Um,

912
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,950
do you do, do you know how to do a death
grip yet? Have they taught you that?

913
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:21,880
Is that an actual thing?

914
00:55:21,881 --> 00:55:25,390
Why don't you do a double death grip to
his man tits and twist them before he

915
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:27,160
has a chance to slap you in the head.

916
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,150
Don't listen to anything that
I'm going to suggest here. Uh,

917
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,680
why don't you take some Twinkies?
What,

918
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,000
what could you do with the
twinkie and a martial art thing?

919
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,390
Why don't you make some nunchuck
Twinkies and it says on,

920
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:47,570
instead of slapping them in the face
with the, with a piece of wood, it's a,

921
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:51,950
it's a twinkie and it goes across his
face. He's humiliated. Plus, you know,

922
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:52,611
he's a fatty,

923
00:55:52,611 --> 00:55:55,850
so he's going to have to lick it off his
face and he'll get into that sugar rush

924
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,250
and his eyes will roll
in the back of his head.

925
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:00,080
And by the time his eyes come back down,

926
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:02,650
you're going to be across the room and
he can't slap you in the head out of,

927
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,140
there's gotta be something.
There's gotta be something to do.

928
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,300
Okay.

929
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,190
I mean, at this point, if you
don't want to go physical,
I would just go verbal. Oh,

930
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,270
I, you know, he's calling
you gay boy and poof. I mean,

931
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,690
why don't you just talk
about his fat tits.

932
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,430
Okay.

933
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,740
Just Act. Just be jazz used to
be really sincere. Just be like,

934
00:56:20,741 --> 00:56:24,520
just out of curiosity, how much
do your tits way, you know,

935
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,760
do you wear a sports bra or are you
going to kind of go with the, uh,

936
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,160
the giant pocket tee?

937
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:32,310
Yeah.

938
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,890
And the fact that you're already
this fat and our young age,

939
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,390
like how fat do you think you're
going to be when you're 40?

940
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:40,080
And these are just
questions, sir. You know?

941
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:41,970
And then when he charges you like a rhino,

942
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,890
just step out of the way and he won't
be able to slow down and maybe go flying

943
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:51,170
into some desks. I don't know sir.
But can you please tell me how this I,

944
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:55,610
I w I would go, I would go to your,
uh, your Dojo masters there, whatever,

945
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,870
and I'd ask them what to do,

946
00:56:57,871 --> 00:57:01,650
but there's no fucking way on any level
that you should have to tolerate that.

947
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:02,583
Uh,

948
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:04,610
okay.

949
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:08,030
Yeah, I would do that. Ah, Jesus.

950
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,430
Are they going to go even
really more mature? Well,

951
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:12,830
I think you should talk to your teachers
about it and then you become the

952
00:57:12,831 --> 00:57:17,430
fucking guy ratted out. Yeah, I like that.
It's a selection that's like this, uh,

953
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,460
solutions they come up
to on like the view.

954
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:24,710
You just turn around and you
just face, stop doing that. I, I,

955
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,920
I'm not going to tolerate this.
You know,

956
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:32,210
I'll give you like a rape whistle
or something. I don't fucking know.

957
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:32,870
I don't know,
sir.

958
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:36,590
But please let me know how that works
out because it's bothering me that,

959
00:57:36,591 --> 00:57:40,950
that dude is doing that to you. All
right. I don't like bullies. Um,

960
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,600
oh Jesus Christ. Do you know what
I really want to tell you to do?

961
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,553
And I'm not good.

962
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,633
Jeez.

963
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,790
I've been with my boyfriend
for two years now.

964
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:28,660
We're in college together
and he's currently taking a
semester abroad. Oh Jesus.

965
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,310
Where in Brazil?
Before he left,

966
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:36,600
we had a running joke that I was going
to need a vibrator when he left as a

967
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:39,390
surprise party gift.
He got me one.

968
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,070
I have a couple of friends whose
boyfriends bought them sex toys.

969
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,670
So while I was a little surprised,
he actually got me a vibrator.

970
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,180
I also happen to know that
it's a relatively normal,

971
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,520
it's relatively normal for a
boyfriend and do that. Yeah.

972
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:57,120
That's basically like this
era's chastity belt. You know,

973
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,720
you're trying to lock down the pussy.
That's disgusting.

974
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,760
But that's what he's doing now anyway.
Yeah. But it's done because those things,

975
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:06,481
you use them too much.

976
00:59:06,481 --> 00:59:09,420
They numb up your area there and then
the guy can't even remotely try and,

977
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,433
you know,

978
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,030
do something for her and then you
gotta be sitting there banging,

979
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,700
banging them as their user.
We're using the thing as you know,

980
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,670
it's like you want an alien
or fucking this girl has this.

981
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:29,420
That's just all dick has no body.
All right, whatever. Let's move on.

982
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,760
What I'm basing it on
based on my fucking life,

983
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:35,700
I did live a little bit of a life before
I met you. I realize that. All right.

984
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:40,420
Any way, fast forward to about a
week ago, we were on Skype. Uh,

985
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:45,440
he asked you to take this thing out. Um,
no, we don't have sex chats. Thank God.

986
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:49,880
And he casually asked me how
his gift for me was working out.

987
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,920
I told them it was
working out pretty well.

988
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,580
He then mentioned that he had
bought something for himself,

989
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:57,950
a flashlight.

990
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,270
Joe Rogan experience is brought to
you by the fleshlight every week.

991
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,240
He does every very weird,
those are very gay.

992
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,800
They look like that thing.

993
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:16,620
Boba Fett I fell into when he died
and one of those space movies. Okay.

994
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:21,760
Wow. Um, I knew how to be faithful
to her. That's nice. Okay.

995
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:22,660
He said,
she goes,

996
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:27,130
I knew what this was because I am an
avid listener of Joe Rogan's podcast.

997
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,113
How you doing?

998
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,770
Joe Robbins come up three times in this
podcast who raves about it constantly.

999
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,510
My boyfriend had never mentioned to me
that he was interested in anything like

1000
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:41,110
that and I always thought the
idea of it was totally creepy.

1001
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:44,500
I acted like it was totally cool,
but in all honesty,

1002
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,290
I really don't want him to be

1003
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,060
fucking a perfect fake wait,

1004
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:53,810
I got lost in that.
I actually was thinking,

1005
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:57,080
is Joe going to get mad that I'm
saying that this is weird? Okay.

1006
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,990
I acted like it was totally cool,
but in all honesty,

1007
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:04,340
I really don't want them to be fucking
of perfect fake vagina whenever he wants

1008
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:04,820
to.

1009
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:09,820
I'm finding myself getting crazy jealous
and angry whenever I think about it.

1010
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:14,390
I know, I know I'm jealous of an
inanimate object, which seems insane.

1011
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:15,200
Let me finish.

1012
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,400
I'm really struggling with this because
part of me wants to be completely okay

1013
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:22,670
with it since it's sort of a hypocrite.

1014
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,550
It's sort of hypocritical to get
angry when he got me a vibrator.

1015
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,130
But now I'm starting to think that maybe
he only bought me a Dildo so I wouldn't

1016
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:33,980
be able to complete when he
got himself a proxy pussy,

1017
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,210
Pussy.
So what do you think?

1018
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:42,440
Do I need to suck it up and get over
this or is my jealousy legitimate?

1019
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:47,530
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Go fuck is fake pussy.

1020
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,400
As long as he's not faking a real buzzy,

1021
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:53,900
I mean fucking a real policy
then you know it's all good.

1022
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:58,730
Plus you. It's not just like
the the pussy that it's,

1023
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,980
that he's missing.
He's also missing like,

1024
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:04,550
you know your touch and kissing
and the whole other part of it too.

1025
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,730
And that fake pussy cat low.
Am I there? No, he isn't.

1026
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:11,900
He's getting right to the dessert.
Don't be Japanese.

1027
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:15,650
Tried these Brussels sprouts.
Don't need them. Don't be jealous.

1028
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:19,800
I bring over the trace Lecce when he
comes back it will be even better because

1029
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:23,480
you both have been like doing it with
anatomy and objects and so it's, I don't,

1030
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,160
you'll be rediscovering each other
all over again. I'll be even better.

1031
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:30,600
I don't think. We don't even
worry. I don't think it's a
good thing. Why? Because,

1032
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,890
uh,
once you start down a path sexually,

1033
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,460
you know,
in order to get off that path,

1034
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,440
you don't just jump
over onto another path.

1035
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:43,050
You've got to walk all the way
back up the path you went down,

1036
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,500
get to the fork where you fucked up
and then head down the other one.

1037
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,840
What I'm saying is he might get used
to just doing that and the sensation of

1038
01:02:55,411 --> 01:02:57,000
that is what gets him off.

1039
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,470
And then when her pussy doesn't feel
like the fleshlight Hillary don't feel

1040
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:04,950
better, he'll, he'll
build bang her and then,

1041
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:09,270
and then when he needs to finish, he'll
be like, oh, hi. And now for me, hey can,

1042
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,500
can't take a day.
What that fucking yeah,

1043
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:15,410
no, no. She'll fall even better. If
anything, he'll be like, oh my God,

1044
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:19,130
I forgot what a real woman feels like
and he'll be done in like two minutes.

1045
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,360
That's what you hope.

1046
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,980
I don't think she should be
jealous of it though. They're both,

1047
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,780
they're both doing the right thing.

1048
01:03:26,781 --> 01:03:30,080
When you're in a relationship and you're
that far apart from each other because

1049
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:33,430
he took,
I bang all sorts of Harry European girls,

1050
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:37,280
no offense to Harry European girls,
but I'm just saying, you know, listen,

1051
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,710
I watched this thing one time or
listen to it on the radio. Uh,

1052
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:46,711
one of those Colin's sex shows
and this guy had a pull away.

1053
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:49,660
He jerked off. I see dry hump, the rug,

1054
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,340
it was causing like chafing on
his deck and it, but it, it,

1055
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:56,720
it was the only way he could get off
because he wasn't in a relationship for a

1056
01:03:56,721 --> 01:04:00,490
while and he kept doing that. And
I dunno. So I'm just saying like,

1057
01:04:00,491 --> 01:04:04,230
I would go easy on those.
It's like anything, anything
in moderation. Yeah. How,

1058
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:07,510
how often is he using this and
how often is she using that?

1059
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:10,000
If use a vibrate too much,
you're numb yourself up down there.

1060
01:04:10,001 --> 01:04:11,680
And then when you guys
down there, I, Daddy,

1061
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,800
I can't feel anything.
That's so disgusting.

1062
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,113
Jeez.

1063
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:56,460
Six.
