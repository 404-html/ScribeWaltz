1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey,

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,620
2014 and a I know you're a bitch and
you're saying this is late. You're right.

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,240
It is late.
I'll give it to you this week.

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:20,241
It is late but that's only because I'm
doing a very special episode of on the

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,770
Monday morning podcast.
Uh,

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,700
I alluded in past episodes that uh,

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,690
about this tour that was coming together
with the guys that I go out on the road

10
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:34,030
with, Paul Versey, Jason
Lawhead and Joe Barton,

11
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:38,040
nick that possibly the three of them
were going to come together like one of

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,070
those superhero movies and
do their own fucking tour.

13
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:46,071
And they are they all in tour and it
starts tonight and I'm at Lago in a seven

14
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,300
30 tonight and a right now a Joe
Barden. Nick isn't here yet, but uh,

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,080
Paul Dude,
I called it Versie is here and uh,

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,130
Jason Law had a bullet here so I want to
welcome both of you to the podcast. Oh,

17
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:03,360
thanks man. Thanks for having us here
at your lovely studio. No, thank you.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,300
This is all things comics studios.
It's late today. What is the podcast?

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,840
I noticed though, you take
a wow, what of what it was.

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,100
It was a matter of being
knighted. I sounded weird
there for a second. I saw it,

21
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,210
but they can't hear.
Okay.

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,570
You take a lot of flack for that shit
for like if you're like an a couple hours

23
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,280
late,
I noticed like you'll post your day.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,230
We'll, we'll, we'll go Billy
red fucking Dick. Yeah, so I,

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,900
I can't believe I'm going

26
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,580
to have the afternoon. It's Chang
guys internet. It's what people do.

27
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:44,300
Everybody's in the bushes so they
could say whatever the fuck they want.

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,180
Every just, I don't read
Twitter. That's hilarious.

29
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,020
I don't think they're really genuinely
mad. I think they just want to like,

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,790
you know, they want to get their
little, like I said this today,

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,400
are they not doing that?
They like that

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,300
general then not big on heckling
during the show, but afterwards,

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,930
if you're standing out there, whoring
yourself out, that's when they,

34
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,764
they'll come by and the

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,580
be like, oh, you're not as tall as I
thought you were going to be like that.

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,950
And I always, I always, yeah,

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,100
just give him, should I go? You know,

38
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:14,770
you had 90 minutes to say that
when I'm [inaudible] pussy,

39
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,950
it's always good when there's a woman
standing there too and then they go home.

40
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:20,090
They probably take it out on
her hate fucker or something.

41
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,760
I like to feel that I had,
I had something to do with that,

42
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,440
but that's not why we're here today.

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,810
We're here to promote, uh, your
guys, your guys tour and uh, do,

44
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,930
do you have any of the dates here that
I could actually start reading? Okay.

45
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:36,010
This is what we got tonight.
Tonight. It's already sold out. Um,

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,530
we're going to go ahead and answer it.
We'll still waiting for Bart. Nick.

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,880
Pardon Nixon. Answer it. Um, all right.

48
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,630
By the way, if you hear weird noises out
of Jason Law head, he fucked his back.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,510
Yeah. There you go. All
right, so here we go.

50
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,090
The all things comedy tours starring
Paul Versey. Jason Law hadn't Joe Barton.

51
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,150
Nick is, uh, tonight. It's
at the Largo in Los Angeles,

52
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:00,610
which is already sold and Tuesday,

53
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:05,611
April 1st tomorrow night if you
down in comedy starved San Diego,

54
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,540
a lot of comics never go down there.

55
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,290
They're going to be at the Mad
House Comedy Club tomorrow, Tuesday,

56
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:16,180
April 1st Sunday, April six. They're
going to be a parlor live in Bellevue,

57
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,700
Washington.

58
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:23,050
April 7th there at helium comedy
club in Portland, Oregon. Tuesday,

60
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,130
April 9th, they're going to be
at the punchline. And Thursday,

61
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,640
April 10th the punchline. So eighth,
ninth and 10th. 10th is in Sacramento.

62
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,420
Sacramento, sorry, eighth and ninth in
San Francisco and a 10th and Sacramento.

63
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,500
You go, there you go. And I'm excited
because I've never been to Sacramento.

64
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,960
I've never been anywhere.

65
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,350
Oh Jesus.
What are we doing here?

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
I've never been anywhere in California
other than Long Beach in La.

67
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,670
So I'm looking forward
to San Diego tomorrow.

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,520
See this is one for me because you're,
you're in California.

69
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,880
I've been out to see you in New York
at least a handful of times since we've

70
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,970
been friends. But you've never been
to California, you know in all verse.

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,800
He does his shit on California

72
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,650
as he got hammered when we were in this
cigar bar in Calgary and I was shitting

73
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:12,310
on the Yankees are shitting on golf.
I think he was shitting on golf,

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,420
golf. And then I, cause I was
saying about playing it or the,

75
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:21,130
or follow me like where I keep, where
I put it as far as sports competition.

76
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,660
Gotcha. And I put it in with
bowling pool shuffleboard where,

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,620
where it's one of those things.
So he gets mad at me and he starts going,

78
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,560
he starts going like, you know what
bill? He goes, I wish. He goes, he goes,

79
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:36,550
Brito suck. Comes me with
the cuisine. He goes,

80
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:41,080
all it is is beans and rice. And
I go, Yeah Paul, it's all it is.

81
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,380
No one ever thought to put anything
else in there. I got by. But you know,

82
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,200
you even said I got drunk. He said
it hit me like a, like a smoke bomb.

83
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,270
Like I that time you've started slumping,

84
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,910
but at the time he got hammered and
you were just like, you were a mess.

85
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,680
Like let me get my calendar. But can you
take, do you think that's bad though?

86
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:59,590
I saw you shaking your head that
that's where I put I put golf. I'm not,

87
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,070
not anywhere near bowling or
shuffleboard. The no, no, no.

88
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not saying that because there's all
different degrees of, of, of difficulty.

89
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:10,720
But I'm just saying as far
as you're playing a sport
where it's all between your

90
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,560
ears, between your ears. There's
nobody physically trying to stop you.

91
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,060
In other nations it's fall times.
I'll give me five.

92
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:22,590
I'm just saying when Wa, I mean
there's a lot of forest, well no,

93
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,900
I think
places and shucking,

94
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,210
but playing against of
what leaves us in the way.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm not saying that it's still wouldn't
hold that. Oh, a guy hits a home run.

96
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,620
Like know what I know. But when face ball
players talk about how difficult it is,

97
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,200
they talk about trying to hit a curve
ball. They don't talk about the wind.

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,490
I'll forget my hitting the golf ball
is in your, I forget mother nature.

99
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,050
There may in cancer they no walking.
No, but there's more than that.

100
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:53,801
It's not even that.

101
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:57,560
It's how about the fact that you actually
do have to have a proper swing posture,

102
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:58,340
your hips,

103
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,900
your legs, you're not listen to me
in tech to your body. Listen to me.

104
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:07,550
I'm not saying it's not difficult.
You Golfing zombies.

105
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,990
What I'm saying is, is it's not
fucking playing football, basketball,

106
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,420
hockey with is somebody
trying to stop you.

107
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,530
There's not a pitcher throwing the fucking
golf ball a hundred miles an hour at

108
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:20,170
your chin to Bacchae off the,
uh,

109
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,660
the t and then you've got to come up
there and settle back into your fucking

110
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:27,500
swing. Okay? That's all I'm saying.
I know it's mentally difficult,

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,480
but it's in the same family is
pool, bowling, shuffleboard,

112
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,540
horseshoes, all the way down to
some of the most simplistic sports.

113
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:39,160
There are tiddly winks.
Nobody's stopping you na,

114
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,820
I mean already stopping in Jacks.

115
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,640
You don't need to be in
shape to do shuffleboard.

116
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:44,840
You don't need to be in shape to bowl.

117
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,570
That's a such a terrible point to bring
up with. Cause I'll, I'll tell him,

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,990
I'll fucking show you Duke. First Time
I watched the masters, Kenny Perry,

119
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,030
he looked like somebody's grandfather
fucking came out. He blew it. He blew it.

120
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:58,970
And then some other fat Argentina
guy won it. They'll go fat.

121
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,810
Oh Cabrera fat guys still,
Ugh. I give up. Give up,

122
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:07,670
can see the fat guys can play golf. I
get to the sweat bill. Nicholas's man,

123
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,950
tits is so unacceptable.
He should always have. Why?

124
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:13,940
They should have married her own bag.
Yeah, but they're not piles of shit.

125
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,860
Kenny Perry is not a pile of shit.
Dude. What is he? Donna's? What?

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,780
Is he close to? Death
playoff. He is. No, no,

127
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,760
no. But what is he closer to? Is he
closer to an a donnas or a tub of shit?

128
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,180
Oh No. Yeah, he's, he's
definitely closer to a Tbi Shit.

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,560
Then another tub of Shit beat him
to fucking dude. Even that cow.

130
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,640
But the general Lee car,

131
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,800
he doesn't look like he did a
fucking pull up in his life.

132
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,040
He had those seventh grade
straight arms where you don't have,

133
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,000
you just have basically the humorous
bone with a little bit of meat hanging on

134
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:50,390
and you can still pick up a pencil
or a phone. Gene iron the the guy,

135
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:54,830
the guy who hit that amazing
shot and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, chef on the one.

136
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,310
Right, right. I love that. We're
cores light drinking. Come on.

137
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,550
He's like the guy that's,
he's a Digi jetskis.

138
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,560
He's totally the Kenny powers of May,
but I'm not disrespecting the sport.

139
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm not disrespecting the sport,

140
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:13,361
but I'm just saying the reason why I
find the sport boring as hell to play is

141
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,820
the fact that there's nobody
guarding me and I just get,

142
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,320
I get bored shitless by three,
four fucking holes. I don't care.

143
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,420
The whole thing is silly.

144
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,360
I'm trying to put this little ball
in a hole and the hole is on garden.

145
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,220
There's nobody trying to swat
it away as it goaltending.

146
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,960
It's this fucking hole in the ground that
you should have a good way to look at

147
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,840
it. He designed differently. It's
just a different game. Listen,

148
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,850
there's a reason why it should have been
a Getty shack too. There's a business,

149
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,920
there's a reason why a bunch of fucking
old people when they start putting on

150
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,410
weight, you know, and
they need to get active.

151
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,630
They always pick up that
sport and I'm telling you,

152
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,000
those fat fucks who if
you throw a baseball,

153
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:54,320
the the odds of them chipping that tooth
can somehow still get on a golf course.

154
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,190
And I'm not saying crush it like a pro,

155
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,490
but they can hit the fucking
thing straight enough.
They're, they're all right.

156
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,610
They're okay. They're okay.
They're good fun to play with.

157
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,070
They can shoot a one oh five I love our
colon millionaire golfers tubs. Yeah,

158
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,980
they're not fun. Not Daily. Used
to be fucking pounding beers.

159
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,720
John Daly was an animal.
I heard his book like he was an animal.

160
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,110
I used to fit. We used to go
to the a Firestone every year.

161
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:22,410
Some buddies of mine down at the
NAC and Akron and we used to follow,

162
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,610
this is back in their like late nineties
mid to late nineties when daily was on

163
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,950
top of the world. He was in every
tournament because he was, you know,

164
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:33,270
he was still exempt from all of his wins.
I love that guy too. He was the best.

165
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,580
We would follow him around and he
bombed the ball past everybody.

166
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:39,510
This is before tiger made a name for
himself on the tour and he was a smoking

167
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,440
Cha Cha Jim Jane Smoke.
You know they don't show it on TV,

168
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,650
but a lot of these guys chain smoke,
it's like they hit the driver,

169
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,940
they liked the cigarette and he literally
changed when the camera goes away from

170
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,860
him and the camera goes away from him. He
there, they don't put the camera on him.

171
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,400
And then a lot of times when you do,
they'll go back and be like,

172
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,450
we'll go to daily at 16 he's got a
cigarette burning in the fairway.

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,530
You just don't see it. He takes his hit
and they say, and then they show the ball.

174
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:07,710
You know, he saw it hit the green and
they show him like give his cloak.

175
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,830
And then once they show like
the trees and the leaderboard,

176
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,030
he's back smoking again. He carries
a, he actually smoked so much.

177
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,280
He's got an old coffee can with a
hook on the side of his bag when his,

178
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,430
when his as an extra.
Yeah.

179
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,650
So cause they don't want them litter and
up those nice courses, that's not cool.

180
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,090
So he is like,

181
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:31,140
you literally you would follow him and
his caddy had put the bag down and he'd

182
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:34,470
be waiting to hit is approaching and he'd
be smoking cigarettes as long as they

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,740
go and he throws it in the coffee can
or if he still had a cigarette when it's

184
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,130
time to hit, he throw it on the grass and
just let it burn. Wait till pick it up.

185
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:41,950
It's hilarious.

186
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,371
Well listen,

187
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:45,430
I know it's difficult because I've
actually talked to a professional athlete

188
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:48,820
hall of Famer who said those guys
mentally, the strongest athletes,

189
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:51,310
cause you've got all that time to stand
with a ball. Think and I understand that.

190
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,220
But there's just something about the fact
that there's nobody trying to stop you

191
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:57,430
but me. It's just the, the activity of it.

192
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:00,880
I feel like I might as well just sit in
a restaurant with a chopstick trying to

193
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:04,720
catch a fly. It's just like, why
am I doing this? This is dumb.

194
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm not working up a sweat.
Like I just,

195
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,530
I would rather play fucking horse shoes
and they just walked back over to the

196
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:15,630
grill and just grab a sandwich.
Like I decided to stay on what I'm doing.

197
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,790
Part of it might be because
I'm so pasty and I'm out there.

198
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,140
Do you know how bad I want to go out on
the course that you guys get you smoking

199
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,520
cigars and drinking? Like I'll meet
you at the fucking at the club? Yeah.

200
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,890
The drinking and the smoking on the
course is so fun. Oh, there's no,

201
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,860
I know, but this is the
thing. Maybe that's time.

202
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,930
That's how you have to sell the
sport because it's not like, yeah,

203
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,500
you want to go play hockey and it just
be like, Hey, you smoking stogies ah,

204
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,220
maybe I'll come down and have a,
and it's fun.

205
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,530
We should have an annual,
like we'll call it the cube it open.

206
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:48,360
We'll just get like a gag for eight guys,
get a couple of forums.

207
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,570
We meet at a golf course every
year and we just absolutely,

208
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,070
we just play like two rounds of golf
over two days and just smoke Cubans

209
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,080
and drink scotch. I got to
tell you this, if, if I,

210
00:11:56,081 --> 00:12:00,460
if I ever became a center and going again,
if I ever, if I ever became president,

211
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:02,860
one of the first things I would do was,

212
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,670
and I would risk my own assassination
by doing this because I would go against

213
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,740
all the corporate cons
and I would basically,

214
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,340
I would break bread with Castro and
those guys and I would just be like,

215
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,174
all right,
listen,

216
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,270
we will wrong to try and turn your island
into a bunch of Starbucks and casinos

217
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,510
and the end of the day it is your
property. Do what with it what you want.

218
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,340
We'll bring you some cars down here.

219
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:28,330
Just start sending us to cigars exam
and would just leave it at that.

220
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,520
But that's not what they're
actually waiting for him to die.

221
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,510
And then they're going to
turn that place into a,

222
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,000
it's going to look like Orange County.
It's going to be fucking brutal.

223
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,910
It's terrible. He, you know, I'm not
saying the guy's the greatest leader.

224
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,260
I'm not saying I'm going to be underneath
the guy, but in principle they will.

225
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,480
Right. It was their country.
They had the right to do. Okay,

226
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:47,440
we're going to take college here.

227
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,000
All of a sudden come see him like a
fucking place getting back to the cigar.

228
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm so fucking sick of
having to try and find,

229
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,860
it's kind of the excitement of smoking
a Cuban is trying to find one. Yeah.

230
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,380
You know, and uh, now you know what
everyone was saying, you know? No,

231
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,860
you've said up on the fake.
Yeah. Where you go. They are,

232
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,490
they're already on Twitter
doing it properly. They,
they do that shit. But, um,

233
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,610
what even know, like, you
know, if you order them and
they send them in, you know,

234
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:14,020
they get a little bit,
a little hard. What was,

235
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,080
I'm just getting tired of people talking
about like how it could get you sick

236
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:18,480
and how it could give you,
you know, get, you know,

237
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,280
give you a throat cancer and shit.
It's like, listen man, you know,

238
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,530
I'm not smoking these like cigarettes,
like a package.

239
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,920
If I'm going to smoke one or two
cigars a week, that's it. That's it.

240
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,780
I seen you smoke four and two nights

241
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,410
and I don't even live in New
York. I mean, it just happened.

242
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:35,510
I just happened to be there.
Yeah,

243
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,960
yeah. Well, you know. No, I was like,
fuck. It was, it was, it was a, yeah,

244
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,810
it was of Thursday. It was, wasn't
that was her back pedal at night.

245
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,530
There was a couple of days I went
a little bit does break down to 14

246
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,120
anyway, dude, I love it.

247
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,950
I fucking love them.

248
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:55,250
So do what now I gotta ask you guys
now when you go to go out on this tour,

249
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,730
being the Scotch drinking cigar smokers
that you are, uh, what, what is the,

250
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,540
what is the over under, on weight
gained on, uh, on this, the all the, uh,

251
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,800
the Olin tour here? Well, my, well, my
plan coming in and I told, I told my wife,

252
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:13,010
does my plan coming in was to, to
not try to hang with Bart. Nick

253
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,450
like, no, no, no. I'm not
even kidding. Like Bart,

254
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:21,220
nick is not like we're the bargaining to
be a day behind the tour when we're in

255
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:24,760
Portland. He's going to be the, in
Seattle when we're in Sacramento,

256
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:25,990
he's going to have to be in San Francis.

257
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,610
Never seen, I'm not even kidding.
I'm not even joking around.

258
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,460
I'm not just saying this,
you know,

259
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,460
I've never seen a grown man in door
what he can do and still be able to hold

260
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:38,930
this role back to throw it, like to
hold it together. I mean that dude,

261
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,550
like he was going back to the
bar. He's going, yeah, man.

262
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:43,190
How about another heater and member. I
had to tell him, I go, hey dude, listen,

263
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,560
I'm not hiding. I was at my wedding,
right? Yeah. At Bill's wedding he goes,

264
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:45,861
hey dude,

265
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:48,170
you guys would be a lot at versus you
want another heater and I literally,

266
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,230
you did it. Yeah, I got, I go
guys, I'm not going to lie to,

267
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,980
I can't do it like I need. I need a break
here. The bartenders at the wedding,

268
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,360
we're pulling, we're pulling bartenders
over from other bars to watch.

269
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,020
They were like, watch, watch,
watch, watch what he does.

270
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:06,050
The Guy Walking up now watch what he
does and like think about your wedding,

271
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,850
which was awesome. Was
there, it was never like,

272
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:10,850
it was never hard to get
either a be a hard liquor.

273
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:15,290
It was just always right there and the
guy knew what you wanted so Barney could

274
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,490
go, yeah, you guys want more heaters.

275
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:18,980
Another round of hears and he would
just start giving them Barton.

276
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:22,220
It's just drinking his crown and I just
patted him on the back and I was like,

277
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,170
you are at, and he just had that shitty
and green, but he was talking straight on,

278
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:28,180
but all the way into the bar, he said
for people who don't know him, he's a,

279
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,970
he's a mountain of a man. Like he could
give, he's like Cam Neely size man.

280
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:36,350
He said, well he's a, yeah, we're all
like, what? Like five, 10 or whatever.

281
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,180
Trying to keep up with a dude
who's like six, four. Yeah,

282
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,840
I mean me and you by the end of the
night we were shot and he was just like,

283
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,630
hey guys, you want one of these for the
road? He was like helping us. He was like,

284
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:49,570
Jason, when it comes back against, uh,
you know, a fast Eddie in the fuck,

285
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:49,921
you know what?

286
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:52,250
I used to sit in there and putting
the carnation back in his jacket.

287
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,920
Let's play some cool pop in.
Yeah. Well, that's how they,

288
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,280
that's funny is because like I think
over those heaters that all that drinking

289
00:15:59,290 --> 00:15:59,520
as well,

290
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,930
how we came kind of came up with this
idea for the door that that was at bill's

291
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:05,210
wedding in October. We'll see.
We just started joking about it.

292
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,730
Bill's not going to beat a
voice of reason on this one.

293
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,500
He's kind of letting us go. Bill's not
going to be around. Hey guys, let's,

294
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,550
that's a good sign. You're in trouble
when I'm the voice of reason. No,

295
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,610
but you would at times. How much do
you have to talk me into something now?

296
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,860
That's the thing. No, you know what
bill does? This is what he does.

297
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:22,490
He acts like he's the guy who like to
like to keep it cool. He'd be like, yeah,

298
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:25,400
really? I should go. Well,
this was so funny. We were in
Canada. He goes, listen man,

299
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,770
I'm not, I'm not trying to get tonight.
I'm not tryna get tonight. I swear to God.

300
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,850
I'm backstage and he's on stage.
He's onstage and I'm thinking,

301
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:34,010
I'm going back to the old ties
again. No, not tonight. Not Tonight.

302
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,690
He's onstage asking the
crap. You guys know where we
could, let's just say we did.

303
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,640
Let's just say we were to go out and
then after after I get, you know,

304
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,640
take close out the show, he'll be like,
yeah, we'll get one, we'll get one.

305
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,700
So like he acts like he's not going to,
but see Barton has just like,

306
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
I mean every tweet,
crowns,

307
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:54,890
crown like Barton examine like
what he saw when he's all in. Dude,

308
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:56,870
that was hilarious.
We were in buffalo one time.

309
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:58,400
He pulled the same thing in buffalo.

310
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,040
It was after a Bruins
playoff when we were in,

311
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,550
but we were in buffalo doing
buffalo wild in June. Right.

312
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,730
And then we were like talking to
the whole time, the place like

313
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,530
I couldn't really drink
tonight. [inaudible] we get
back to the hotel. He's like,

314
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,990
you didn't have Bruins game still on it.

315
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:18,470
Let's just go down to that little like
bar like yeah, we watch it Bruins William,

316
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,500
we celebrate e right there to the part
that we have one, we'll have one beer,

317
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:25,210
right. Wait one very of it ruins way and
we're going to celebrate the book part.

318
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,960
Then as the bill goes, hey,
if we weren't going to go out

319
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,520
next door,

320
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,440
next thing you know we're next door
getting hammered talking to these locals

321
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,630
eaten Bacon. Remember that Bacon, they
put bacon out as a bar snack. Remoteness.

322
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,330
That's right. So we had the
west man, I know it's buffalo,

323
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:44,300
but you're already north of Pittsburgh.
And then there's like peanuts,

324
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,730
peanuts and pretzels.
They can,

325
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,510
she bring hot bacon out in baskets for the
bars neck. And I'm like, look. And I go,

326
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,020
Bacon's not cheap man. I, I know, like I
asked the part, I'm like, wait a minute,

327
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:57,300
this is crazy. She's like, Hey, it's
Friday and Saturday nights only,

328
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:00,330
but it gets people drink, they, they
make the bake and I asked the guy,

329
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,680
he came out,
they make the Bacon,

330
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,320
they let it cool for like 25 minutes
so you don't burn yourself on it.

331
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:09,120
So it's warm but not hot and it
just comes in. He just, he was like,

332
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,460
I'm not gonna eat this.
And then it's like literally like crack.

333
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,420
You have a couple of handfuls
and then you get all that.

334
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,960
It's all salty and then you
want to start pounding. Yeah,

335
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,270
they was setting this up.
I gotta I gotta do some ads here.

336
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,300
Hang on one second. All right.
All right. Here we go. Um,

337
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,650
let's see if I can read these
without messing them up. All right.

338
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:28,450
Dollar Shave club,
everybody.

339
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,310
Nothing feels better than that first
shave with that with a fresh blade, right?

340
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,100
It's smooth. It's close in.
The blade is sharp and it's,

341
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,890
it's as shoppers it's ever going to be.
It feels fantastic,

342
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,160
but thanks to the big shave companies,
ridiculous prices.

343
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,470
You can't afford to use
a fresh blade every week.

344
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:48,790
Can you see a drag that Dulles blade
across your face for two, three weeks,

345
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,160
10 weeks?
Why do you do it to yourself?

346
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,430
Maybe because the only thing more
painful than shaving with an old blade is

347
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:57,400
shelling out 30 bucks for
a pack of new ones. Well,

348
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,080
if you want to enjoy the fresh bro,

349
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,990

fresh blade every week,

350
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,820
but you don't want to go out and take
out another mortgage on your house,

panty parried that one.
Dot. I was terrible. No,

385
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,710
but then you guys were moving in the
background and then when you guys started

386
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,890
talking about built how we finished,

387
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,250
that's what happened. That's
also basketball. That's

If you're trying to take a foul shot.
No.

389
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,040
What it was was I started thinking like
this is how uninterested people are at

390
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,150
home.
Listening to this shit be effected.

391
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,560
I love,
my favorite part is like when I watch,

392
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:40,590
I've been watching every dribble of
March madness is I've been having his bad

393
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,010
back. Like, I literally have seen like
more traveling calls in a reps have.

394
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,060
But the thing is,

395
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,930
I've been sitting there whole time and
I love like Vern Lundquist is the best,

396
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:52,230
cause you know we talked about like
dial and stuff in like, yeah, that guy,

397
00:21:52,231 --> 00:21:55,620
like when he's doing the, Oh yeah, he's
been broadcasting for a hundred years,

398
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,130
but he has to do those live spots for
like 60 minutes, you know? He's like,

399
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,990
well, 1218 to go and conduct
these right? Fag in it.

400
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,300
Now this one coming up 60 minutes.

401
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,910
Don't forget to catch the pink panthers.
Do we get the jewel? Thieves are,

402
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:13,850
don't wait tonight and 60 minutes
and you are like a horny aids.

403
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,530
Then he just totally

404
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,960
reading ads on a podcast that's
called. That's how tough. Right?

405
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:24,830
There you go. There's your
point made. All right,

406
00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:29,300
well let's get into how I
actually met you, how I met you,

407
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:31,310
assholes out on the road.

408
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,300
The fact that I would loan the Monday
morning podcast presents the all things

409
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,040
comedy tour for some reason,

410
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,740
you can't be late to this thing
because you downloaded it.

411
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:40,940
But if you know you're playing this in,

412
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:44,060
your wife is walking around in the
background or husband? Uh, once again,

413
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:48,100
the all things, comedy tours coming
to San Diego Tuesday, April 1st, uh,

414
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,890
it's going to be in Bellevue, Washington
Sunday, April six at parlor live,

415
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,160
a helium comedy club, Portland, Oregon
and then two nights at Saint and uh,

416
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,800
at the punchline in San Francisco,

417
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:01,660
the eighth and ninth in
Sacramento on the 10th. Um, yeah.

418
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,490
Then we're going to swing it over to
the east coast and a couple months more

419
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:06,200
dates to follow.
I think they're working on that,

420
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:08,630
but I'm looking forward to doing that.
Those dates are coming.

421
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,340
[inaudible] Boston bought,
we're [inaudible] all these guys,

422
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:14,570
all these guys opened for me.

423
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:18,800
If you've come out and seen any of
my shows basically in the last shit,

424
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:22,520
I don't know, five, six years. It's
been one of these guys open it for me.

425
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:26,000
So I'm excited for you guys. I was
actually trying to think who I met first.

426
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:29,450
I think I met you. Law Ahead. We've
known each other for a long time.

427
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,260
It's coming up on 10 years.
No

428
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,440
over 10 years. You know what's
funny is I didn't want to get,

429
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,470
I didn't want to get like sentimental
about it because my first whiskey,

430
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,620
but no, like we did that show. We
did that show on New Year's Eve.

431
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,030
We did that show on new years eve at the
Wiltern and that was literally 10 years

432
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:50,660
to the day we met. We like hung out on
New Year's Day, New Year's Day tenure,

433
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,790
like New Year's Eve.
You did Cleveland and then hung out.

434
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,130
We got and then that's when we,
that's when we became friends.

435
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:57,530
It's like you just came and hung out
with me on New Year's Day because you had

436
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,210
nothing to do.
We were dark,

437
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,130
but you had to stay in Cleveland
for like two more nights.

438
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,810
This was a deal like New Year's eve
was a was like, like a Thursday. Yeah,

439
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,160
there was a Wednesday or Thursday.

440
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,580
So then there was new year's day
and nobody's coming out that day,

441
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:12,350
but then there was,
you still had the weekend,

442
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,830
so I had this weird weekend there
where I was working new years.

443
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,060
I was doing a run the whole week doing
new years and I had a day off so I had a

444
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:23,890
day off and nick, the club owner
of the greatest guy ever at, uh,

445
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,420
hilarity is out there in
Cleveland. He goes, hey, you know,

446
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,820
just just watch out for the guy, you
know, keep them company, Blah Blah.

447
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,130
Do we fucking drank all day?
They actually lost me at one point.

448
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,440
We somehow ended up in this brutal titty.

449
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,060
Yeah.

450
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Rudel Silverhorse silver horse and a,

451
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,160
yeah,
that's a boring Cleveland as you need.

452
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:47,040
Like the comic needs to be
assigned somebody to just
invest. That's how it was.

453
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,050
I was like that guy. I was like,
Hey Jason, what are you doing now?

454
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,890
Well entertain this guy please.

455
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,920
Cleveland is way better than even,
it was like 10 years. What's wrong?

456
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,610
Like an attitude. I wish she had money
back then cause I was like, I'm, I'm like,

457
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:03,130
I'm going to buy a frigging building.
Cause you could see it in common.

458
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,110
It's common back around,
unlike Detroit,

459
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:07,140
which keeps starting
and stopping Cleveland.

460
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:11,920
You could buy a hospital for like 80
grand and Cleveland they showed me,

461
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:15,130
they showed how, I swear I'm
there, I'm closing on a hospital.

462
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,370
You could get like a four bedroom house
there for like $36,000. It's insane.

463
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,050
But I gotta tell you though, but like
when, when I first played hilarity,

464
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:26,800
he's in Cleveland. That was the
only game in town on that street.

465
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:31,390
You walk like you walked up that street
like a cotton and I crossed the street

466
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:32,224
out of my hotel.

467
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,310
It's the cop met you at the corner and
walked you up the street and now it's

468
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:37,780
like closed off to traffic.

469
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,270
They got the house of blues across the
street and they got all this stuff going

470
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:41,260
on,
restaurants and stuff.

471
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,290
I remember seeing this giant apartment
building like right across the way.

472
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:47,410
I think Mike was living there at the
time around the corner and I was thinking

473
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,010
like,

474
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,490
like I was literally thinking that I bet
you could buy that thing for 75 grand

475
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,030
and in 20 years it's going to be worth
like millions of dollars as this whole

476
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:58,480
thing eventually hopefully comes back,
you know, you know they've got the casino,

477
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:01,960
they just build another casino. Like
not downtown but somewhere else. But um

478
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,990
oh that's not a good idea
that I don't like that idea.

479
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:09,050
I just don't like the casino at the,
I think that we could have built that,

480
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,580
that there is no reason that that city
can't be built on its waterfront and its

481
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:17,990
character and its positioned
geographically in the
country through casinos.

482
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:22,690
Then casino nightlife for like toddlers.
The nice thing about the [inaudible],

483
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,470
we're close to DC,
we're close to New York.

484
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,970
There's no reason we can't be successful.
But you know, it's funny though,

485
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,560
the Nice thing was I said to, well you
know ball the color I love, but I said,

486
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,210
I said, he loves you pay, he loves
your parents. And I said to Bob, I go,

487
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,580
how come to, you know, where's the home?
Cause homeless is big out there. Big, big,

488
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:38,690
like they come after you and I go,

489
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:40,520
how come there is it just light
on the homeless? And he goes,

490
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:43,990
they're all at the casino. That's just
like all, yeah. Oh, is that right?

491
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,430
Yeah. They just all hanging out at the
workplace. A nickel slots all day long.

492
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,350
That was like the lottery for that one.
That was the lottery.

493
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,530
Then you're bringing in the trenches,

494
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,190
started stretching when that clicks again.
Wow.

495
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,460
Why would homeless people go to a casino?
They don't have any fucking money.

496
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:05,440
What are they doing that they,
whatever they make those,

497
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:09,450
some of those people make decent money.
It's amazing. I love that theory.

498
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,660
And it's all those guys. Yeah, they make
like a hundred grand. So of them do. Now,

499
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:13,800
I don't know about a hundred grand a year,

500
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,790
but some of them make their own
urine in that fucking cardboard box.

501
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:22,410
And we talk about committed to the free
scam. It's freezing fucking Ohio. Whether

502
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,520
it was fucking, uh, what's that shit?

503
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:31,410
When you feed a frostbite black toes,
making a hundred grand a year, you know,

504
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,670
you gotta make sacrifices.

505
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,950
Nfl guys smash their brains around
the homeless. They lose their toe,

506
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,460
do that scam and south beach to
call my own gift. Black Long.

507
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:44,990
You get a blood flow to it. I got to tell
you, when I was in San Francisco, uh,

508
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,530
I was just up there trying
to find someplace where I
could shoot my special and,

509
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,580
and I have never seen so many
people laying around not doing shit.

510
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,780
Then that city, I don't
know what, everywhere. Well,
they used to have a stipend.

511
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:00,240
They used to fucking give them
money. It was, this was hilarious.

512
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,360
Like gave the homeless, we would
give him enough money to get there,

513
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,350
tried to get him off the street.

514
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,290
That was one of those things where it
made sense if you were giving it to people

515
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:10,200
who thought sensibly, but they did and
they gave it to the fucking homeless.

516
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:14,970
So they would give you enough money so
you could afford rent in some flop house

517
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,863
for a month.

518
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,010
So what would happen is the first four
days of the month you wouldn't see any

519
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:23,100
homeless people.
They were all inside drinking,

520
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,890
you're shooting and drugs and
all that shit with the money.

521
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:29,070
They didn't have enough money for four
days and then by the fifth day they'd

522
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:32,280
start coming out like zombies and
then you had the problem again.

523
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,790
So they get with basically we're
buying themselves like a four,

524
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,980
five day reprieve. Now of course,
as always with all my stories,

525
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,930
that's just something that like four,

526
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,510
four or five people did tell
me that story in San Francisco.

527
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:46,290
I don't know if it's true, but I was
there and they had, um, they all have the,

528
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,760
all these beautiful parks and dude,
these people are snoozing to a level.

529
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:53,650
You actually start thinking like, what
am I working for it? Look at that too.

530
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:56,830
And I saw this guy like,
he was like face down in the sun,

531
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:01,050
like some old hound dog. And I was, you're
just thinking like this fucking guy.

532
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:05,100
Like I know he's living outside,
but he's eating. Yeah. You know,

533
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:09,660
he doesn't have any conference calls.
There's no debt. Doesn't wake him up.

534
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,020
This guy, dude, and it was
such a beautiful sunny day.

535
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,960
It was one of those days
where you actually would
entertain the thought that I

536
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:20,730
could like I maybe I could just
fucking live. I'll dad. Beautiful Dude.

537
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,550
I took a picture of the guy and I just,

538
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,950
I tweeted it and what was funny is I
didn't even realize that there was another

539
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:28,230
guy in the background.
It's like you can't just get one.

540
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:30,090
This is so many of them
when you get to the parks,

541
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:32,880
just fucking lying all over the place.
Um,

542
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,060
I saw what I was just there and do a is
a couple of weeks ago and I saw a guy

543
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:41,061
laying on a park bench sleeping covered
up champagne bottle ed is at his feet,

544
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,250
right?

545
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,100
Cop Strolling. I was sitting in another
part, but it's just people watching.

546
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,400
This guy's hilarious. He just bundled
up. Not only am I watching this guy,

547
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:50,080
he's got the champagne bottle,
have his feet,

548
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,210
two cops comes strolling up towards
him. They're like, Hey god, Hey,

549
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,640
let's go pick it up.
Let's go.

550
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,450
And one guy picks up and he like wakes
up out of a panic and he sees the one cop

551
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:01,610
holding is half empty bottle and he's
getting ready to go pour it out and he's

552
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,440
like panicking like it's not my wine and
I wanted a guy doesn't care. He knows.

553
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,280
He's like, yeah, I'm sure it's not.
He's like pouring it out. Right.

554
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,860
The funniest thing is is this guy,

555
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:14,800
when he got up and he rattled off and I
noticed it after he woke up and he put

556
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:15,580
it up there,

557
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,320
he had American Airlines I the
patches to cover your eyes.

558
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,830
You can sort of the sleep mask

559
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,220
on an American Airlines logo,
flimsy little woman.

560
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,820
They probably give you on the flight and
they were so then they were up on his

561
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:35,430
forehead as he was like begging
for mercy when the cop was,

562
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm looking at them going, wait a minute,
what are you worried about anyway?

563
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,360
Did I'm putting you under a route, like
a roof? What are you worried about?

564
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,410
Yeah, but dude, I would
rather sleep outside,

565
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,430
worry about getting hit over the head
with a log. Fucking take. One of my acid,

566
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,740
you know, hey, you know,
I heard I just like a bed.

567
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,100
They actually, uh, they actually, uh,

568
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,800
one of those cities when
they had like the stipend,

569
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,180
other cities were flying their fucking
homeless people in there to just get rid

570
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,910
of them because they were having,
and then they started sending them back.

571
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:10,580
I forget what the fuck happened.
Maybe that's where that guy got the mask.

572
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,200
I can't remember.
I can't remember what,

573
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:15,270
it would be hilarious if that's
where he got the legs still had it.

574
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,183
That's what I'm guessing.

575
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,170
The other night in New York
I saw a lot of the homeless,

576
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:21,830
they sleep on the top step of the church,
but the church never lets him in.

577
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,950
So like they're just laying
there like what? No, I know.

578
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,910
But after a while they got to be
like, listen, they're not listening.

579
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,850
They're not opening up. Let's go
somewhere else. You know what I mean?

580
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,210
Like they're just laying on the thing and
it's almost like sad cause it's almost

581
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:38,970
like they have the belief and the
faith and they're being shut out. Well,

582
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:41,680
I think that the church church,
and I'm going to Starbucks,

583
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm going to somewhere else because it's
no one, someone's not listening to him.

584
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm showing my faith. No, but it's good
business for them to let them stay there.

585
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,460
Like they give a fuck, but they're
not going to let them in. Um,

586
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,620
but I don't know.
That seems like a safe place.

587
00:31:57,621 --> 00:32:00,230
You want a safe place
to sleep if you're home.

588
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:02,810
I want if any homeless
people in the church floor,

589
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,490
cause I don't want it in there to say
this part about how this conversation got

590
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:10,070
steered into is we were
talking about Cleveland.

591
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,610
It's the saddest part of it all.
Oh we,

592
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,150
we've just gone to the dregs of humor
comics, dark Cleveland. But anyway,

593
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:22,661
no,

594
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:25,600
but I find that interesting when I kept
seeing you don't want a bunch of smelly

595
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:29,380
homeless people sticking up the church
for the decent people who've come in on

596
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,260
Sundays. And that might sound like
Fox News. But at the end of the day,

597
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:36,230
if you smell like urine, you smell like
urine. You gotta go outside with the dogs.

598
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,620
What if to do doesn't smell and
he's just freezing, you know, put a,

599
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,230
put them in one of the
pews and let them get home.

600
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,040
Fucking let him sleep in your base,
but smell only thousand. I said, look,

601
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,760
I understand. Going to let him see my
butt. You smells good though, Paul.

602
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,880
You got it. You've just got
some Irish spring. Me, just
stranger. There's a church.

603
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,150
He's going to go in there and steal all
the chalices that they stole from the

604
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:53,930
other fucking people.

605
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,510
I just feel like if he's saying
that he's got faith in that church,

606
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:59,060
they should do something. And that's
all. That's what churches should be.

607
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,630
That's what it's about. Should be
homeless after cost. Money, baby.

608
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:06,320
Put a little in the back. Exactly.
But that's my point. That's my point.

609
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,670
What is your point, Paul? My point is that
like, they kind of get faith on us here.

610
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,970
No, no, no. I'm just saying like,
uh, you know, uh, I know, you know

611
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,290
what I'm saying is I,
I,

612
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,790
I see them laying on the front step of
the churches and it's kind of a sad thing

613
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:26,360
to see because they're wrapped up in
their blankets and they have so much faith

614
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:30,310
in that belief. Yet the doors are
never opening and it was just a,

615
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,240
an observation that I've found fucked up.

616
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,840
Why do you think that the fact that
they're sleeping on the stairs means they

617
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:40,700
believe in Jesus Christ? I'm not saying
that. I'm just saying that it's just,

618
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:44,150
I, I think the people that show thing
is unraveling. No, I think that,

619
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,060
I think the fact that these
people choose to be on the,

620
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,790
on the top step at the door of a church,

621
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,810
it tells me that they have some sort
of faith because I think I put it down.

622
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,880
What if it rains? You want to be
underneath the arch. There's a million.

623
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:59,420
You could go under, you know, awnings are
places or you could go on dirt, you know,

624
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,110
buildings. They have a little
one. The church stairs. Yeah.

625
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,490
It doesn't mean you believe in
Burger King, but you know what?

626
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:07,670
The church that I saw this guy on, there
was no roof. He was just sleeping there,

627
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,630
man. So I just put, I just pushed off.
I don't think he believes in it. Okay.

628
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,350
I don't think he does. Cause you know,
no, but you don't know him either. No,

629
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,600
I don't.
But I think it's he could or he might not.

630
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,100
It's that just because
you're sleeping on church,

631
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,660
there's doesn't mean you fucking
believe in anything. Well,

632
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,420
what did you think it's a good guest to
think that he's got some sort of faith.

633
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:24,650
If that's his choice of,

634
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,490
I would think it would be safer to sleep
there then outside of white castle.

635
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,860
This is the first dude you've
called it on a homeless.

636
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,600
What a fuck is Bart? Nick
say he ain't making it. Yeah,

637
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,990
that's Barton nigger.

638
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,490
He ain't gonna make it cause it's
gonna make it. This is, this is this.

639
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:47,330
So this education,

640
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,250
this is the dedication we're going
to have with this fucking tour.

641
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:53,510
Is that what we're saying here? Um, no,
but going back to drinking on, let's,

642
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,810
let's start some more arguments here.
Hey, so you're a Cleveland Indians Fan,

643
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,190
a red sox fan. He's a Yankees
fan or all American league east.

644
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,840
They're all American league east night.
Um,

645
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,170
w how do you feel about both of our teams
and the way we spend money each year?

646
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,970
I think it's disgusting.
Now.

647
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:14,930
I will say that Boston last year wanted
in a way where they didn't go out and

648
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,460
over, like they didn't spend any more
than they kind of had been spending. Uh,

649
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,680
I love the fact that most of the,

650
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,700
most of the trend is all these deans
that are spending money aren't really the

651
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,890
teams that are being successful.
At the end of the day,

652
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,420
the doctors were $135 million.

653
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,560
Any outspend the Yankees
and the number one to you.

654
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,310
I loved it. That sits, you can
finally say that. See, I loved it. No,

655
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:44,280
not because of that. I just love the
fact that like the Dodgers are trying to,

656
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:46,290
you know, the Dodgers are
going all in. Well they hell,

657
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,870
they have to all link towards what's he
know because they've been, they've been,

658
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:55,270
they've been 25 years
without a championship. Um,

659
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,500
they've corrected their financial
situation after the guy and magic new,

660
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,060
you know what,
I forget the guy's name at random.

661
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,300
Under the ground spending $230 million
is the waiting, well, you know,

662
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:07,680
they didn't set the trend.

663
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:11,500
I I to believe that if they believe
that they're going to do something, uh,

664
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,420
that the Yankees or Boston have done,
which they haven't done yet in this,

665
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,350
in this economics of baseball. Yeah, you
got to do it. I mean, the last time they,

666
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,910
they, one was in 88 when the economics,
we're shifting a little, but it wasn't,

667
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,520
it wasn't a five mega market league.

668
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,650
Being able to spend that kind of,
there,

669
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,270
there's only five teams
I can spend that kind of,

670
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,640
there's only five teams that can spend
that kind of money. So why wouldn't they,

671
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:38,100
if they're one of the five teams that
can spend it anywhere, should question,

672
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,690
why do you think that
baseball allowed it to,

673
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,520
to go the direction?
What was the,

674
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,550
what was the thinking that it was good
to let fucking the Yankees do what they

675
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:53,970
did, which caused the red sox to have
to react to it and then we became them.

676
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,690
What, I mean, we're not right now I
don't think, but, but we in oh seven.

677
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:58,890
I mean there's no fucking,
there's no,

678
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,390
there's nobody on the
planet that can't tell me,

679
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,920
oh seven we didn't buy a fucking title.

680
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,560
Well, I think it all stems back.
A lot of it stems back from,

681
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:11,090
obviously you can't change what happens
moneywise but I think a lot of it sends

682
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:15,290
back to when the um,
owners were, you know, uh,

683
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,100
found out about the collusion in,

684
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,490
in the late eighties and they
had to pay once they paid the,

685
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,170
once they played the players union,

686
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:26,171
I think $350 million settlement
for collusion and the players,

687
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:28,690
union owners getting together going down.

688
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,770
They said don't pay Jack
Morris is what it was.

689
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,620
Jack Morris was on the free agent market,
I think in [inaudible] 86 or 87.

690
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,250
And The tigers owner told all
the other owners, don't pay him.

691
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,720
Keep him at the market value that we
have in Italy in the long run. Yeah,

692
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:42,950
we get to keep Jack Morris,

693
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,940
but in the long run all you guys will get
be able to keep your Kirby buckets and

694
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:48,650
your Roger Clemens is at a
price that won't gorgeous.

695
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,270
That was vida blah blah blah.

696
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,320
The end of the day is it strength in
the player's Union to a point where the

697
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:59,321
salaries have gotten to the point that
the player's union really runs the market

698
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,510
and they run the market.

699
00:38:02,511 --> 00:38:06,320
So now the big market teams that
have the money they've opened,

700
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,370
the player's union is have made,

701
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,570
has made it able to be able to speak for
those teams to spend that money and the

702
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:14,320
rich teams can, well that's, that's
the bottom line. The bottom line,

703
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,320
as long as there's no cap in baseball,

704
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,680
80% of the teams will
never win a world series.

705
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,470
No, it says as long as there's
no cap, the Kansas city royals,

706
00:38:23,471 --> 00:38:24,730
I'm never going to one off.
It's that high.

707
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:28,330
But I mean it's good to at least 60 close
to one thing is is what baseball has

708
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:31,480
tried to do is obviously with the
wildcard and now the extra wild card,

709
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,860
if you tried to make it
somewhat competable where as
a team like Cleveland or if

710
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,300
by the all star break,

711
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:40,030
if we look like we're playing really
well with the guys we've groomed in,

712
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,580
we can go out and you know,
get a,

713
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,340
if the Philadelphia Phillies
are fallen flat on her face,

714
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:47,220
we can go out and get a
Jimmy Rollins if he doesn't,

715
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,180
if he wants to waive his
trade clause and be like,

716
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:51,190
you know what I want to go play
for these guys are pretty good.

717
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:54,580
I'm at a certain point in my career, I'd
go hit, you know, when a title, whatever.

718
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,300
That's the only thing baseball's
done. The kind of recoup that. But

719
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,470
why they just don't look at the NFL and
be like, okay, the way they're doing it.

720
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:07,150
Greenbay can compete with New York City.
Can you walkie compete with Boston? No.

721
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,910
Like brewers compete with the red sox.
They can't. So what the F why don't we do,

722
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,240
why should I assume you're so strong?
Because they can get big players.

723
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:16,260
You need to get the guys pay.

724
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,070
I think there's another walkout coming.

725
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,690
We'll talk and lock out here on the
podcast. Uh, I like talking and stuff.

726
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,540
I don't,
I don't see it looming anytime soon.

727
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,440
I think baseball's in probably
a pretty pretty good labor,

728
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:34,180
a labor situation because now the bay,
the players haven't had to kind of weigh,

729
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,360
crawl with their tails between their
legs a little bit in the last few years

730
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:39,160
with the,
with the PE deals and everything else.

731
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,830
So they've kind of had to kind of
come off their high horse a bit.

732
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,330
So now there's a little bit of love.

733
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,360
There's a little bit of balance between
players and owners because the players

734
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,000
ever kind of had to go, hey,
yeah, we were doing all of this.

735
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,950
That's so fucked up that those guys
actually went in front of the Senate or

736
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:55,230
whatever the fuck was going on.
I don't understand.

737
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,040
I just don't get why
politics had to get involved.

738
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,300
Why am I watching curt Schilling?
Yeah.

739
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,300
Talking to some representative
from Minnesota. Yeah,

740
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,220
because it's just fucking all stupid and
you should be talking to is accountable

741
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,040
shit. Hey, speaking of
a lot, this sexual time,

742
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:13,710
this ties in with a question here that
uh, somebody said, I said Bill, what team,

743
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,120
dear Billy batts if you could coach
one team in history without knowing the

744
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:21,540
outcome of the season, which team
would you pick? Keep in mind,

745
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,640
stack teams don't always
win championships in,

746
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:26,820
there were other teams that you that
could have one perhaps with some better

747
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:30,930
coaching. What the fuck? That
was like a brain twister.

748
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,190
Like a train's going this way.

749
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:35,640
If I could coach one team in history
without knowing the outcome of the season,

750
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,330
which would I pick? Keep in
mind, stack teams don't always
win championships. Yeah,

751
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:40,920
but the teams won the championship.

752
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,080
I know if I coached the
cowboys in 78 they won.

753
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,300
They beat the Broncos.
I don't get your question.

754
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,000
All right,
drop that part of it.

755
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:52,520
But what team would you coach
because that is an interest in quit.

756
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:54,200
Like if you could coach one team.

757
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,230
No, I think the question
is saying now, like,

758
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:59,870
I think the question is
basically like what you see now.

759
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:02,000
If you could coach one of these
teams that's out there now,

760
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,350
don't go out and try to win a championship
to stack. Don't look who stack,

761
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:10,010
but just say, well, who would you want it?
Debbie says one team in history. Ah, okay.

762
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,510
All right.

763
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,390
Then look at this guy is either really
smart and we're dumb or this is a fucking

764
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:19,190
confusion question. Uh, I don't
fucking know if I could coach one team.

765
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,030
How about, can I play on the team
and said, look, I'd like to cook. Go.

766
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:27,900
I'll go every error in hockey. If I can
play on any team, I would play for the,

767
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:32,630
the, the eighties Edmonton
Oilers. Um, if I could play,

768
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:36,230
if I could, I guess, coach, Dude,
you're the, you're a coach's son.

769
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:40,940
Who would you coach? If I could
coach one team one time, uh,

770
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,350
I would probably,

771
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:48,450
I would probably coach Larry Bird's
79 Indiana state team against magic.

772
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:51,570
I'd like to, I'd like to coach that
game. I like to see if we could,

773
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,570
if I could help,
I'd like to see if I can beat magic.

774
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,490
Maybe there's this question.
You know what I'd like to do?

775
00:41:56,491 --> 00:41:59,000
I'd like to coach the fucking,
uh,

776
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,130
79 Dallas cowboys and the 76 Dallas
cowboys to against the Steelers in both.

777
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:07,980
And I, and I would win the fucking
game. Yeah. That's how confident I am.

778
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:11,780
Because they had their number in the first
half. Uh, this is what we need Barton,

779
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,090
dude, if you, I want somebody,
somebody put up the 70 Superbowl 10,

780
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,931
they put that up on,

781
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:19,530
on the Internet to the cowboys
called a reverse on the first play,

782
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:20,790
reverse to Hollywood Henderson.

783
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:24,120
He ran down the field that they're kicker
tackled and we took a need of the ribs,

784
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,420
fucked up three of his field goals and
they will play in loose and all that.

785
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:31,290
And they were up and then they played
Marty ball in the second half and they got

786
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:35,460
all fucking tight and they just stay,
basically conserved the game away.

787
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:40,540
Um, as far as the, uh, the 79, oh,

788
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:41,400
I guess I would know this.

789
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:44,460
I wouldn't throw it to fucking Jackie
Slater or whatever the hell his name was.

790
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:49,440
Jess Smith, bless his heart. He's a
sec. As man in America, I would coach.

791
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,800
Did you see they outlawed the dunk.
You know they made that a penalty.

792
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:56,260
Now the dunk of over the goalpost and
you were saying Hollywood Henderson,

793
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:59,340
Hollywood Henderson invented
the dunk of the goalposts.

794
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:01,390
They would just had a base mesh
first one or did they set up,

795
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,740
they had a big thing on ESPN. Yeah, it was
a, the owner's meeting over the winter.

796
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,100
It's a 15 yard penalty now if you dunked
the ball cause Joey Graham and all

797
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:12,060
these guys. Oh it's a, you
know, they dated it back to
history. They like the WHO,

798
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:15,240
the first man and it was Hollywood
Henderson after a reverse.

799
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,980
Landry used to call it reverse all the
time to Hollywood Hendrickson and it was

800
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:22,950
a, in 75 they called a reverse
the Hollywood Henderson
and a regular season game

801
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,130
and he busted one loose for a touchdown
and he was the first guy and they show

802
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:29,490
it. He's the first guy that glove and
dunk it over the goalposts and outlawed

803
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,910
because these tear there, they're
tearing down low. They're tearing down.

804
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:37,650
Some goalposts guys have gotten to
heard, I guess. I don't know. Wow Mill.

805
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,370
One Time Joey Graham from the saints was
so strongly pulled one down where they

806
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:44,880
had to come out and re level the
goalpost cause it wasn't, you know,

807
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:47,900
so he pulled it and then the next guy
to kicks in and is kicking in and out.

808
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:50,940
A lot of white guys upset about that rule.

809
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:54,300
Wes Welker now the West woken
up bitching about that at all.

810
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,990
As long as it needs to. It needs to
be on Joey, Jimmy Graham shoulders.

811
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,680
Why this is the deal. I would,
I would, I would actually,

812
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:02,210
if I could coach any team in history,

813
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:06,910
what I would probably do is I
would maybe the 86 red sox. Yeah.

814
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,410
But no, but then I put Dave
Stapleton in at first. Yeah. But,

815
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:14,840
but that's only because I know what was
going to happen. So like I could know.

816
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:19,120
So like, uh, I would, I would
try to pick a team that,

817
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:20,330
that hasn't won a championship,

818
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:23,090
but I live in Boston and they
won't run the table. So I know,

819
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,830
I don't know what to tell for me.
It's a no brainer.

820
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:29,890
I would 100% coach to nicks and I would,
I would make them run, listen to that.

821
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,620
I would make that run.

822
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,080
I would make them run until they puked.
I would I,

823
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:38,280
if they didn't play defense,

824
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:42,850
they're out there find I would fucking
goes up fast with this team. Quit on

825
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,090
his second. You'd be a second nick
coach in history to get choked. I would,

826
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,630
I would fucking, I'd lay into those
lazy cock suckers like I like,

827
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,570
I swear to God, Dude. I
want to be fun. Actually.

828
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:00,630
I would like to just take a
horrible team and just terrible.

829
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,420
Yeah, you show me. You don't
get back. Just get all my shit.

830
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,710
I would do with Gene Hackman.
Didn't Hoosiers minimum of three passes.

831
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,370
Minimum of three passes. Okay. You fuckers
are going to run all day. We're not,

832
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:17,610
we're practicing the first month without
a ball. Who are running up and down.

833
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:19,410
Carmelo Anthony's.
If you didn't go,

834
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:22,320
you can do this with rows
or they're all Carmello.

835
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:26,690
Anthony's lazy we'd face would
fuck it. Get everything shut. No,

836
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,270
you want to wear that headband? Go
take it off the top of the back. Yeah,

837
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,810
I would fucking turn into,
oh, that's what I would do.

838
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,070
[inaudible]

839
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:41,810
Nick Joey to do my puck off podcast and
I thought I said I couldn't be heard and

840
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:48,441
until to hey between you guys like
you would need another 10 mikes.

841
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,820
I don't think anyone's
missing my, my uh, hey.

842
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,190
Well we're currently answering a
question right now. If you, if you,

843
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,120
this would be perfect for you.
Worked in coach, any team in history,

844
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:02,550
not knowing the outcome.
If you could just be the head coach who,

845
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:07,410
who would you want to be? Head coach
of? Oh, the Steelers 78 Steelers 78. Oh,

846
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:10,740
I want to do the 78 cowboys or 76 cowboys.

847
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,870
76 roll the market.
The whole ready for that shit.

848
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:16,970
You would've thought you'd
text Bart. Nick, the question

849
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,980
three sixers.
I was thinking to them too.

850
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:26,320
I said six or I said, did they played
four on five these play diver voting,

851
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,480
I mean they played four on five. They'd
be that. It'd be genuine anyway. Yeah,

852
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,960
I put them up against, I'd put
them up against the 96 bolts. Yeah,

853
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,090
we talked about that on mine. I never, he
goes, who's gonna Stop Jordan? I'm like,

854
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:39,280
why? I think doctor Janka kind of
offset a lot of the shit he was doing.

855
00:46:39,281 --> 00:46:42,460
And then I got Moses against the
fucking Luke long week. Yeah.

856
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,310
I don't think anybody's
been in the 96 bulls.

857
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,490
That's because you're a child
of the nineties dude, that team,

858
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,330
they said they 79 Indiana state
defensively as they were all,

859
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,340
oh, that's a good one.
But I'm telling you.

860
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,750
But Luc Longley would have four files by,

861
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,700
by the end of the first quarter trying to
stop Moses Malone. And in all fairness,

862
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:06,210
I didn't see enough of that 76 15
but how good was Pippin on Dif?

863
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,940
I mean the defense xe offensively,
they were phenomenal.

864
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,680
There's a reason I picked the
96 bolts. Great. Well, Andrew,

865
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,600
Tony had bad feet or Andrew. Tony would
be in the hall of fame. Yeah, absolutely.

866
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,850
Tony could, they didn't have six
quarters back to your career.

867
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,793
Broke him,

868
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,000
strangling stroke them that they,

869
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,160
that that was the ultimate two man

870
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,030
game.
If you had to double team m and M,

871
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,790
most of them bouts of nearby.
He went from,

872
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:41,440
from high school to
dominating the dominate Aba.

873
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,340
Aba Aba was like a
fucking prison rec league.

874
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:49,470
It was that mean the bet he was. Dot.
People were afraid of Moses Malone.

875
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,160
He like,
he was 17 he was a beast.

876
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:57,410
He was remember the mere expression
of a man child and it was like him,

877
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:00,770
Daryl Dawkins. He never
lived up to those guys. Joe,

878
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:03,600
was he the first guy to come out?
Yeah, early. Yeah. Bose as well.

879
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,070
Darryl Dawkins a second.
Yeah.

880
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:10,210
You know the funny thing is is Moses
Malone and Lebron James are the only two

881
00:48:10,281 --> 00:48:14,330
guys in the history of the NBA to win
consecutive MVP awards with different

882
00:48:14,331 --> 00:48:17,510
teams and they're the, and the, and
they both never played college ball.

883
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:22,010
It's pretty freaking impressive. Wow.
I mean if you take out the big three,

884
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:26,770
you know the, the, the, the,
the, the, the mount, right.
You know, we'll Kareem and uh,

885
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,570
Bill Russell the next,

886
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:34,130
I mean this was in below weight
and Moses, Moses, just like six,

887
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,810
six, 10 truck. Yeah.
Yeah. That's 17 who just,

888
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,400
he's just crazy. He just didn't
miss, what did they lose that year?

889
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:47,420
They lost one playoff high school kid.
That's a baby coming into that.

890
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,960
Firstly they lost one playoff game.
They actually, I asked Moses to predict.

891
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,210
That's his famous thing. He goes,
what do you think about the playoffs?

892
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:56,210
He just goes, fold, fold, fold. Just
me and we're going to sweep everybody.

893
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,050
And they basically would, they'd lost
one to the Lakers, three pho, pho, pho.

894
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,820
Because back then it was the first round
game was a five but three. Oh was okay.

895
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,220
But the funny thing was is
that was a huge six or fan.

896
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,380
He seems to fit back in
because I was a huge Dr Fan.

897
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,570
Huge six or fan and when he
got traded cause you could,

898
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,600
they could never win because Coldwell
Jones and Dawkins and Steve Mix whatever

899
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:19,551
agglomeration,

900
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:24,551
the shit that they put together to stop
either like parish or Jabar would never

901
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:27,940
work. So we, they get him and
he was heading to cover rock.

902
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:31,790
He was like sitting on the steps like
rocky. It was like you knew it was over.

903
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:36,850
There was never a lock in the history
of sports like Moses go into the sixers

904
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:42,740
like was over. It was, it was,
how come they only won one though?

905
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,810
Cause doctor Jay was old. Moses
wasn't, no, I mean he will,

906
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,500
he wasn't old but he was,
he was dude Moses,

907
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:52,130
bad play back in the day where that do
play 46 minutes and Knight Dragon gives

908
00:49:52,131 --> 00:49:53,530
up without it as I say like,

909
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,170
because because of black Monday is why
they definitely one one black Monday he

910
00:49:57,171 --> 00:49:58,820
trade hit black eye.
The eye.

911
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:02,570
The only time I ever cried in sports
other than like Lemieux getting cancer,

912
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,700
they were crying sports black Monday
dude, they traded bread dough. They,

913
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:07,580
they try to,

914
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:12,581
they try to hit those below and the
rights to bread Doherty for Roy Henson and

915
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:15,710
Ruland dude,
they trade.

916
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:20,350
They are or are you still a NASCAR shit
would do but they traded like they,

917
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:24,620
the front line would have been a
Barkley bread bread Doherty in Bozeman.

918
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,550
Moses said I will never lose to the 76

919
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,090
there's again the bullets when
like eight games that year,

920
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,420
like five of them were against the six
[inaudible] five he was like 30 and 25 it

921
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:44,180
give Brad Doroty has probably the
the most epic fucking hairline.

922
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:49,520
It almost touches his eyebrows. I mean
the fucking guy when he gets a shape up,

923
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:52,670
I mean they gotta like put a separate
it like at the grocery store between his

924
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:56,480
eyebrows and his, it's just something sad
about seeing Brad already talk NASCAR,

925
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,660
you know, he's just sitting there
talking. NASA was even sadder.

926
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:03,090
We see this in the bench at all star
Games. It was going to say this,

927
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,970
this and this check I drafted.
It was like,

928
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:08,760
well they're good for Nascar is
probably like fuck this. It's like,

929
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,050
well Brad already cause they'll
make plans for all star weekend.

930
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,140
How did he get

931
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,200
you fucking go from, he's like, he's
like one of the announcers for Nascar,

932
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:23,390
Black Mountain North Carolina and he
grew up in that shit and he loves it.

933
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:25,220
He's always loved that.
Oh, that's all right.

934
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:26,540
Then he ended up doing
something like that. Guys,

935
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:30,920
I've got to read a cut by the last
fucking my last three brutal reads of this

Joe Barden, nick, you excited for

All in tour is going to be epic. It's
going to be APP. It's going to be epic.

974
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,660
Look at his game plan is he's going to
try to avoid you as far as like his drink

975
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:48,510
and he's going to try to like, he's
going to try to drink it either. No,

976
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:53,460
they I'm drinking. Drinking. No,
we were talking about we were

977
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,550
drinking and drinking.

978
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:57,310
Nice.

979
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:02,310
[inaudible] afford to buy a drink too.

980
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,713
Exactly.

981
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,170
Pointed at you like he was an NFL coach
and you were a defensive player who

982
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:16,620
missed an assignment?
I I'm drinking but he said like,

983
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:19,680
we were talking about smoking
cigars and drinking and bill said,

984
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:22,920
what's your game plan to not, you know,
to not gain so much weight and go nuts.

985
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:23,760
And I go listen,
I go,

986
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:27,420
I got to really just watch Barton
it cause Barnick is you know you,

987
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:31,610
you got that thing dude, you're
unstoppable. You're fucking unstoppable.

988
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,350
The thing is like an idiot
every year at the rose bowl.

989
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:38,400
I tried to go blow for blow your shot.
I don't know why I was telling him,

990
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,650
I was telling him that though
at the wedding you were like,

991
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,100
you guys want another heater. And like
after the fifth time I was like Joe Man,

992
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,030
you know we just met. I was
looking at, I love, I need,

993
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,790
I can't right now I need a break. And the
end of the night you had those crowns,

994
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:54,090
the shots and you're smoking a
cigar and you're just intact.

995
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,140
You are just fucking intact.

996
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:00,730
It's the way we grow them in Pittsburgh.
I was back home with this weekend.

997
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,720
I told people, I said, I
know people in Hollywood,

998
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:09,030
like I think I got to go to Rehab. I'm
like, first of all, you drink wine. Yeah.

999
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:15,400
I said, check the boat. My aunt's
drink more than you before dinner.

1000
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,980
I mean, people pay it's drink. I
mean cope. I mean, but no, there's a,

1001
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:23,860
there's never peer pressure because
there's more boost for me. No,

1002
00:55:23,861 --> 00:55:28,600
don't get me [inaudible]
somebody me stop early,

1003
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:30,820
so we got to keep that in mind.
No, no, I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

1004
00:55:30,821 --> 00:55:33,550
I'm gonna definitely to have
some guys have a writer.

1005
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:38,390
What is the writer on this tour? I
don't know. I haven't even seen it.

1006
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,770
I didn't even have a rod track for openers

1007
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:47,930
is going to be an amazing tour.
If you guys,

1008
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,300
these guys are like that guy's
guys to fucking hilarious.

1009
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:55,040
They know smarts and you know, it's
not going to be a, trust me. You did.

1010
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,870
It's definitely worth the money.
As I mentioned earlier,

1011
00:55:56,871 --> 00:56:00,260
we're going to have all the dates up here.
Uh, they play in San Diego, a Bellevue,

1012
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:04,160
Washington, Portland, Oregon, San
Francisco twice in Sacramento so far,

1013
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:06,210
and then they got an east coast thing
line up. I'm really psyched for you.

1014
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,730
You guys got some Midwest shows like a
people in that and did I want to thank

1015
00:56:09,731 --> 00:56:12,940
everyone that came to the shows this week
in Pittsburgh. They were awesome. We're,

1016
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:15,440
we're, we're, we're coming
back as the tour. Nice. Nice.

1017
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,180
They're stoked for us in the DV
guys are stoked for us to comment.

1018
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,860
No, that's good. I just
meant that you got,

1019
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,040
I told him, I told him all
about you. They're going to,

1020
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,570
yeah, they're going to make fun of me.
Is that they're going to do, no, we do.

1021
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:31,780
We feel your pain. We feel
your feet. What do you feel?

1022
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:36,610
You don't feel super bowl championship
to Cleveland. Pittsburgh rivalry.

1023
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,640
There is no, there is no robberies. No
rivalry though. There is no rivalry.

1024
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,960
We don't even where we can't. You
can't be, no, there isn't. Right.

1025
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,670
There's not a rivalry.
It's your,

1026
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,600
your browns rivalry is now the ravens
that we don't even have a rivalry with you

1027
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:53,530
because we haven't put up a fight and
15 years I made it. It's not as true.

1028
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,221
It doesn't exist.

1029
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:57,730
You think that there's people that I'm
the outside looking in that remember that

1030
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:59,920
old brown Steelers that doesn't exist.

1031
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,430
You go to Cleveland for Brown
Steelers games. It's a sea of black.

1032
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,520
There's no browns fans there. They
sell their tickets of Pittsburgh fans.

1033
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,240
There is no rivalry.
You can't be rival.

1034
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,770
I wouldn't see the saddest moment and
one of the saddest moments in La heads,

1035
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:18,310
adult life. We're watching the Steeler
game in a bar in San Francisco.

1036
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,100
He was up there hanging out. We're
done doing shows. You did some sets

1037
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:26,230
walking walk in the booth.
We look over to the booth next to us.

1038
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,760
Guy Grew up right next door to him,
like four houses, four houses down.

1039
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,970
They haven't seen it is cheering for the
Steelers and he goes like, he's like,

1040
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:36,730
what are you doing? Is I just gave
up. I wanted to back a winner.

1041
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,950
We see this kid in a booth next to me.

1042
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:42,440
I think he grew up four houses down from
me. I'm like, Holy Christ, he's wearing a,

1043
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,000
he's on,

1044
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,460
it's a Sunday football that different
people are in there watching different

1045
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,300
teams.
Right.

1046
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,630
And he's like La head and I know he's
wearing like a Cordell stewardship.

1047
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,120
I got really, and he just said,
he goes, hey, you know what?

1048
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:58,330
I just gave up a long time ago.
I said, are you awareness steel?

1049
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:01,750
Are you rooting for this dealer
that this the thing I understand,

1050
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:05,020
just saying fuck it,
I am not watching it anymore.

1051
00:58:05,021 --> 00:58:07,640
And then go to go to a
different conferences.

1052
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,220
I wouldn't even root for anybody in
the AFC. Exactly. I would, I would,

1053
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,000
I mean if I could,
if I would root for any I've,

1054
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:18,490
I've contemplated it and my thoughts on
my, my contemplations are, I would go,

1055
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:20,980
and I know you hate him,
but they're central to me.

1056
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:24,970
And I liked the new young quarterback.
If I had to quit, which I've thought of,

1057
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,920
I'm thinking of quitting and
going to Indy. I don't mind
Nandy right. Well, I mean,

1058
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:34,480
am I an idiot? I liked Gluck. They're
close by. They're a small little town.

1059
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,290
They've done everything
right. I, I'm thinking what?

1060
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,120
Whatever I've talked about.
That's a plus, right?

1061
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,410
Exactly.
I'm saying their owner does drugs,

1062
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,370
sits on the rules committee changes,
rules of passing the hell.

1063
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:56,800
That's like a Knicks fan.
Becoming a fucking Brooklyn
Nets fan is despicable, man.

1064
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:59,050
It can't. It can't do it. I'm just
saying, if I thought about it,

1065
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:02,230
if I agree with bill, this guy watching
him, just stop watching it and give up,

1066
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:05,200
but you can't just automatically take
your journey, puts it, go buy it.

1067
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:06,910
Go to the store by how the fucking Jersey.

1068
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,850
Then what happens when your team
actually fucking wins it? Yeah.

1069
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,470
Then you're an idiot.
Then you deserve it.

1070
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,960
You deserve your team to win
it a couple of years ago,

1071
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:18,790
that's not going to actually happen. No.
It has to happen. Eventually. Say, Hey,

1072
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:22,190
listen, we're going to, we're
going, do I have your guarantee?

1073
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,970
We went up this year. It
opens on to Delta. Got April.
That's a guy that rats out.

1074
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,940
It's a movie called draft day.
It opens.

1075
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,080
I'm sure it's something good's going
to come out of it. That's a got it.

1076
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:33,380
Ratchet as friends, if you
do that, if you do that,

1077
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:35,630
if you switch uniforms because
they're not winning, you're a rat.

1078
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,290
You'll read sturdily. It's a
carrier. Your waffle walls,

1079
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,740
you'll rate your friends
out or you can't trust deck.

1080
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,550
Are you going to trust that guy?
No, you can't trust that. Exactly.

1081
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:46,340
That's been going to what's going with
stadium with his mother and father as a

1082
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:49,940
kid and then he just fucking throws in
the towel and throws on the enemy shirt.

1083
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,640
That cable sell you down a fucking shirt.
Is that,

1084
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,980
that's a character that is a character.
That's a character flaw.

1085
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:01,700
Something's wrong. No, you're right and
I think he and that person specifically,

1086
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:05,270
I'm not going to name names, you know?
Yeah. I need to join a puck off today.

1087
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,590
I need you a pug of, there's a lot, a lot
of Bruin stuff going on. My man crush.

1088
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,190
What was just what he did.

1089
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:16,380
Did he do dude hitting the guy in the
and the balls from behind with a stick.

1090
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:21,770
I didn't see it yesterday. No. Can
they have all the Canadian gay dude?

1091
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:26,150
I was so jet lagged and not so wiped off
my toy. I actually forgot Monday nights,

1092
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:29,180
usually dark. Not only did they have
a game, they played the Canadians.

1093
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:31,970
I missed every second of that.
I saw the capitals game.

1094
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:35,030
I saw the flyers game this weekend.
Uh, who else did they play?

1095
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:39,270
I think they each do what? Looch he
speared him from the back under his butt.

1096
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,450
Like hit him in the taint. The guy went
down like a house of cards. It was,

1097
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,353
it was not,

1098
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,870
it was not something that does Lou
chicken to put that on the highlight reel.

1099
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,020
I got to see that. What a thing.
I got to see that. Yeah, he,

1100
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:55,760
he's stick them underneath like
it was real. I'm like, Luke,

1101
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:57,140
what are you doing?

1102
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,110
Huh?

1103
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,450
Well, just so that people know we're
not going to just talk sports on the,

1104
01:01:01,451 --> 01:01:05,410
on the tour. No, I was, no,

1105
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:09,760
I didn't even all my sports jokes or I
cut them out and I say the nice thing

1106
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,120
taggers and I'm fucking around. I'm
just, the great thing about this tour,

1107
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:18,320
it's like we're all alike,
but ours comedies different,
which is great. I'm clean,

1108
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,513
Huh?

1109
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,040
All right.
Well we're gonna have,

1110
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,630
we're gonna have to wrap
this thing up here soon.

1111
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:27,720
I want to talk a little little hockey
though. Anybody's not as sports fans.

1112
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:29,640
Give me like, what the fuck
would this podcast, I don't care.

1113
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:33,870
Let me just read the last people
to see your podcasts, Huh? Yeah.

1114
01:01:33,871 --> 01:01:36,500
But people still fucking bitch.
Monae is always bitch.

1115
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:39,570
You know what it really is is just six
people bitch and then I think it's like 6

1116
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,260
million. So I mean I only have for
that is the map on the Internet, right?

1117
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,700
A producer of a show one time.
He's like, well, like six people.

1118
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,030
That's really the Internet term. That's
like 4,000 yeah. It's like really was,

1119
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,440
what does that base don, he was a moron.
I it work with you. But based on how many,

1120
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:56,440
if then people are listening to six
people, which is now 4,000 that, you know,

1121
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:01,540
I'm not good at math.
There's something in the Internet though.

1122
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:04,740
It was like one person. He goes, okay,

1146
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,960
four guys in here and all
that. So I hope we, uh,

1147
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:28,440
we didn't step on each other too
much for people listening out here,

but I'm really psyched for you guys.

To give us the,

1152
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,550
you guys didn't read the fine
print of the, uh, the tour.

1153
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:45,490
I'm going to own the rights to
all your acts and your podcast.

1154
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:49,880
You could have it
tried to sell my ass

1155
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,850
tonight.
Tonight we're going to be down in Largo,

1156
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,690
we're going to give a great show.
And then afterwards I go,

1157
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,650
I brought some Cubans back from Canada,
so over my,

1158
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,000
over my house. You know, we'll get,

1159
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:09,040
we'll get along at a Shirley temple and
the rest of us can drink a little. I mean

1160
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,220
Johnny like,
you know,

1161
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:12,920
you'd thought you'd hang around with
some adults once in a while and like,

1162
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,530
you know, it's funny, as soon
as he said that we just get,

1163
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,850
it already looks 90 days.
That's a hard time. Right?

1164
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,180
But 89 89 days might loosen your backup
a little bit. No, I don't know, man.

1165
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,230
I heard it's good for it.

1166
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,570
May of backstreet best thing if you're
not going to have like the real real

1167
01:04:28,571 --> 01:04:29,380
drugs.

1168
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,970
Best thing is like three regular
aspirin and a couple couple big pops.

1169
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,940
Yeah. On. Is that right? Yeah. Best
thing for my, I tell you what they were,

1170
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:41,770
the day I went in for it, I was so
jacked up. They shot me with morphine.

1171
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:44,500
They put needles in my back and I'm
going to tell you something. I was like,

1172
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:49,400
well listen, he's, you know [inaudible]
I can't take it. And he was like, yeah,

1173
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:51,160
it'll be a while to fill the
prescriptions. He's like,

1174
01:04:51,161 --> 01:04:53,710
how do you feel about needles?
I'm like, I don't like them,

1175
01:04:53,711 --> 01:04:58,180
but I even had a drink and like 80
days so stick me wherever. He's like,

1176
01:04:58,181 --> 01:05:01,900
it's morphine. I'm like, please, if
you ever had morphine shot India,

1177
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,940
that's the greatest party.
Greatest party I've ever had.

1178
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:11,110
Instant like oh I had the morphine
drip and only when you have surgery,

1179
01:05:11,111 --> 01:05:14,220
just a button and you get it and
it's just, it goes away like it's

1180
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:20,690
mine. No you did. That's
the truth. You rang,

1181
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,730
you rang it on jeopardy with that thing.
Drove partner.

1182
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:29,720
I need more morphine. I do jam
the fucking machine. I did. I did.

1183
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:33,090
I hit it so many times. That's the
Lariat. It only lets you like, cause it's,

1184
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,000
you're only supposed to do every
12 if got like 12 minutes here.

1185
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:38,670
It could kill you. Lighters
out of fluid. Like he just,

1186
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,340
he couldn't get a flame that went away
with that stuff. Do you get hired?

1187
01:05:42,341 --> 01:05:45,700
He just getting know you get a hi, hi. Hi.

1188
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:46,623
Not numb.

1189
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,880
That can be Jesus high
where you're just like, ah,

1190
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,420
yeah, you're too, it's, it's it. I'd
never had had it before. All my life.

1191
01:05:56,421 --> 01:06:00,650
40 years of living plus and I've never
had morphine and that was awesome. I mean,

1192
01:06:00,651 --> 01:06:03,430
I was like three hours just like,
ah,

1193
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:08,170
man that was in the car.
West is a three of a month ago.

1194
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:11,020
So my doctor was worried about me going
to New York and walked around and so he

1195
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:15,370
shot me up and I was in the hospital
with like four guys were all lined up.

1196
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:19,960
These old guys like war veterans were
like, came back to cry and I'm like, good.

1197
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:22,870
Or their families are making fun of them.
I went in there,

1198
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:26,050
my back's been so jacked up, it's
so much shit done to me. He's like,

1199
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:30,100
you don't feel that, you don't
feel that. I'm like, Nah, Nah, Nah.

1200
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,700
I don't feel well. That's amazing.
I came back and they were like,

1201
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:34,301
you didn't feel nothing.

1202
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:38,920
Like no cause like that's
amazing to have a machine.

1203
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,490
Yeah. Don't destructible you are Joe.
You are, you are, you're one of a kind.

1204
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:46,930
Well the uh, the show is tonight at
eight 30. Um, I think they're actually,

1205
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:49,600
we've got about 10 tickets left that we're
probably going to release around four

1206
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:52,290
o'clock if nobody else hits
us up a ticket. So, uh,

1207
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,420
maybe you can grab some last second ones,
but I'm psyched to be working.

1208
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:57,590
I don't think I've ever worked
with all you guys at the same time.

1209
01:06:57,591 --> 01:07:01,740
I know new years we came close.
