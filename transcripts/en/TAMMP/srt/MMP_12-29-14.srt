1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,210
Hey, what's going on as bill burn? It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,090
December 29th, 2014 this is about
as loud as I'm going to get.

3
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:16,260
By the way. I might even bring it down
here. You know what I'm saying? Oh, today,

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,840
last week it was a rough one.
It, oh. Um, I actually, uh,

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,970
have a bunch of relatives over at my
house and they're still sleeping because,

6
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:30,030
uh, you know, they went out
last night and I'm an old man.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,011
I'm an old man.

8
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:37,011
I was in bed my fucking 10 30 fucking
Versie called me driving back from the

9
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:42,120
clubs. I think I fell asleep twice
during his conversation and it was funny.

10
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:46,080
He was like, I would wake back up to
him going like, oh, did I lose you?

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,800
And I would wake up and I
would immediately lie and
just be like, no, no, no.

12
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:53,790
I'm listening. I'm listening. And I woke
up this morning mad at myself. Like,

13
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:58,500
why did I feel the need to lie there?
What am I practicing for when like,

14
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,580
I really need to lie.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,350
What's wrong with saying,
yeah, I fell asleep.

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,250
Was I concerned about Paul
versus failings like Paul,

17
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,890
I find you so boring that I was wide awake
at the beginning of that sentence and

18
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:18,070
by the end of it I was asleep. That
wasn't the case. It was late at night.

19
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,930
I was an old man. I had a big
steak dinner. Oh my God. Oh,

20
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:26,980
belly fat face is fucking back.
All right.

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,970
I have been eating like a fucking maniac.

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,510
I've been cooking bacon like a little
twinkle toes there and I've just been

23
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:41,440
shoving everything down my pie hole.
Oh fat face.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,500
Billy is back. Like you remember when they
did back to the future of the sequels,

25
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,900
they shot part two and part
three at the same time.

26
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:49,600
That's how my fat face is coming back.
It's like I'm,

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,310
I'm making part two and part three
once you make bill none of your fucking

28
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,580
business, but I'll tell you
anyways, and I'm actually,

29
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm actually gonna make a
a a Turkey pot pie today.

30
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,190
I'm like, you know, it's fucking, you
know, it's cold out. I'm a pussy now.

31
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:09,410
At this point, it's like 58 degrees.
I'm like, oh my God, this little Cho,

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,400
I love some Turkey pot pie
and I'm going to go out in the kitchen.

33
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,051
I'm going to put on it.
This is,

34
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,990
this is how far I've changed since
you guys are listen to this podcast,

35
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm going to unapologetically walk out
into my kitchen, put on a fucking apron.

36
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,020
All right, and I'm gonna,
I'm gonna try this.

37
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:31,810
I'm trying to make a flaky crust.
We think about that.

38
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,980
You know what I love how uncomfortable
it's making you right now, not you,

39
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,590
the other people. You're not
uncomfortable. I don't give a fuck.

40
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,400
But the rest of you, the rest of you,
people are so fucking homophobic.

41
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:47,320
You can't listen to another man say
flaky crust. I'm going to say it again.

42
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,370
I'm going to go out in the kitchen.

43
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,690
I'm going to put on an apron
and I'm gonna make a flaky

44
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,523
the crust.

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,100
And I

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,030
have, I'm actually sort of embarrassed
at the level of excitement that I have to

47
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:07,620
fucking try this, this thing out,
because I usually just use shortening.

48
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,130
I never use bottom. So we'll see
how it works out. Other than that,

49
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:15,830
the fucking, the inside is the fucking
easiest, right? What do you got to, yeah,

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,790
you got the trinity of Fucking Shit,
right? The evil fucking what do you got?

51
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,410
Your carrots, your salary.
You fucking Alec Onions,

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,990
right? You stick them in
some butter, right? Make sure
they're clear fucking store.

53
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:30,910
I'm a little bit, then you had some other
bullshit of the other bullshit, right?

54
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,570
And then you throw it in the fucking
the crust there. You got many,

55
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,770
put it in there and you tell everybody,

56
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:39,460
get out in the kitchen and
fucking eat something. All
right. And then as they say,

57
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:44,440
oh my God, this is delicious.
You feign a humility. Well,

58
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:48,580
you know, just something, I just flipped
it up. Yours. Oh, did you like it all?

59
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,414
That's great.
That's great.

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,130
Let me leave the room so you can guys
can all talk about how awesome I am.

61
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,270
All right, I'm being too loud here,
being too loud, my own fucking house. Um,

62
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,830
but this is what I've
actually done a cave.

63
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,860
If you're like me right now and
you are in the depths of a sugar,

64
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:12,160
salt downward spiral.
Okay.

65
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:16,390
And you're waking up in the morning like
that classic Stevie Ray Vaughan Story.

66
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,180
Ever hear that story when he was so
like addicted to alcohol and drugs.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,470
It was like four in the morning and
he's standing in an alley somewhere in

68
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:30,250
Europe and he's puking up blood.
And when he's done,

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
he looks at his buddy and he said,
I needed it

70
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,743
drink.

71
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,300
That's how I feel right now with this
fucking the shit that I've been eating,

72
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,130
you know? And I've actually traced it back
and went back to that pork chop I had.

73
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,410
That's what threw me off the rails.
I was doing well.

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,830
And then I had a fucking pork chop with
and I gave it a little butter Beth.

75
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,130
And that was it. It sounded
so fucking gay. I know.

76
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,740
I gave a butter Beth
to a pork chop and um,

77
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,570
put it in a little in his little fucking
towels with the Hoodie on it that you

78
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,850
do for a baby.
I did that to my little pork chop.

79
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,360
I don't know why. I'm doing this to
you guys. It's like I hate myself.

80
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,690
So I want to make you guys uncomfortable
with all these horrible fucking images.

81
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm sorry. All right, Jesus, that's
gotta be a record five minutes in.

82
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm already apologizing to you. So, um,

83
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,410
so I've done been doing this weird thing
where I've been eating like shit yet

84
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:36,940
forcing myself to go work out and uh,

85
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,400
you know, when you're eating like
shit and you're trying to work out,

86
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:43,120
your body's just like, dude, I don't
want to fucking do this. You know,

87
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,690
if you're eating the right, your body's
like fucking dragging you down there. So,

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,400
um, I'm doing that awful middle aged
guy thing where I'm eating like,

89
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:56,230
Shit, dude, I did one day, I
think it was two nights ago.

90
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,210
I'm sitting around, you know,
it's the usual thing, right?
The trees look, you know,

91
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,860
looking sad because everyone
stopped watering it, right?

92
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,280
The Christmas tree really lives
the life of a fucking boy band.

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,910
You know what I mean?
It's discovered and it's a fucking star.

94
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,910
And then it's over and it all
goes down in like a month.

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,570
So now my tree sitting and
starting to wilt, right.

96
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,720
There's a bunch of
leftovers in the fridge.

97
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,280
Everybody's just fucking passed out in
a food coma in every different room.

98
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,430
You mean everybody's just so fucking,

99
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,380
it's literally like
you're in a crack house,

100
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:34,420
but it's food and everybody's just
fucking passed out all over. You didn't,

101
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,420
you don't even know half the people's
names and your house in any sense of a

102
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:41,900
schedule. It's just,
it's just, there's no,

103
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,810
everybody's sitting down
to eat dinner. That was too
long, days ago. Now it's just,

104
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:51,811
just eat whenever and I fucking
for dinner one night I had,

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,200
I had two Boddington's to Guinness.

106
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,810
Um, and then on an assortment of
dumplings from leftover Chinese food,

107
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,150
one chicken, one Veggie, one pork.

108
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,180
We had three orders and I had to one
or two of each of those with those four

109
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:16,570
fucking stout beers.

110
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,940
And then with the Chinese food,
I was so full of salt.

111
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,830
I grabbed a slice of Pecan Pie,

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,310
put whipped cream on the top of it
and shove that down my pie hole.

113
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,800
And then for the rest of the night for
no reason that I could explain medically

114
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:32,940
my face was hot.

115
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,390
I was like,
I was walking around,

116
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,460
nothing embarrassing was happening,
but I felt like I was embarrassed.

117
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:47,240
Maybe it was, I was embarrassed about
what the fuck I was eating. And then,

118
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,310
then the fucking kicker is I then went
out and did stand up and I'm on stage

119
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:58,041
with a hot face feeling doing my standup
and basically a walking sugar coma.

120
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,510
And um, so yesterday I decided, I'm like,

121
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,390
you know, I got to get out in front of
this fucking thing. All right, around,

122
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,290
I'm going to have to roll myself down
the walk to get the mail soon. So I,

123
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,590
uh,
I forced myself,

124
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,860
I forced myself to go,
uh,

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,940
to go to this fucking place that
serves salads and that type of shit.

126
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:30,480
And I swear to God, man, that just
fucking, it breaks you like cold Turkey.

127
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
You get that stuff in you and you're
just like, oh yeah, that's right.

128
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,190
That's right.
So this morning I woke up,

129
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,510
did a quick walk around the block,

130
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:43,340
banged out a hundred pushups and 60 dips
and I'm back in the fucking game back

131
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:46,280
in the fucking game. Am I? No, not really.

132
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,160
I just slice a pint of whiskey
before you went to bed last night.

133
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,070
Fucking late doing anyways,
this is the Monday podcast.

134
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,383
And um,

135
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,380
I find it hilarious how many people get
annoyed when I sit here and talk about

136
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:02,790
food and Diet and that type of thing.

137
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,330
But I think it's actually
funny and it's also,

138
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:08,550
I know a lot of you guys are
going through the same shit.

139
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:13,080
And the thing that I've learned is you
have to mentally push through the shit.

140
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,920
You know, you have to go downstairs and
work out, you know, you've got to stop B,

141
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,570
you got to listen to your fucking brain,

142
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:22,760
not your body that's doing the John
Travolta sweat hogs. Give me drugs,

143
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:26,610
give me drugs. Um, anyways,

144
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:30,470
but now the construction is finally done
on my house. And last night, um, uh,

145
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,880
not last night.
A couple of days ago,

146
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:37,881
I was able to clean out my garage for
the first time in fucking forever.

147
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,990
So listen to this ship.
This is how it cleaned out the garage.

148
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,710
I didn't sweep around shit. I took
everything out of the fucking garage.

149
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,870
Everything all right. And then I went
in and I swept that thing up like um,

150
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,280
like you know, as much as I could
get up. Cause it's, it's just,

151
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:59,160
it's a garage,
you know,

152
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,200
and I had like fucking three giant
piles of like sod does, cause you know,

153
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,830
you have construction on your
home after like two, three days.

154
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,850
The construction workers, they don't
even see it as your home anymore.

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,470
It's just their place now.

156
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,740
They've just staked their claim and
they'll leave and fucking, you know,

157
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,910
coffee cups in the old ratty
sweatshirts all over the fucking place.

158
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,150
So they started using my garage to cut
shit up and I'm just sitting there like,

159
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,090
I don't give a fuck where you cut it up.
Just get the God damn job done. Right.

160
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,370
So I had like six months of saw dust
and shit in there. Got All of that out.

161
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,250
Then I brought the garden hose and
spray down the whole fucking floor.

162
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,880
I had gone to home depot and bought one
of those fucking squeegees that has a

163
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,040
giant mop handle,
right?

164
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,080
And then after that brought in a bucket
with soap and water and fucking mop the

165
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,710
whole place up and then host it
back down and squeegee it out again.

166
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,540
Right. Cleaned it out like
a fucking marine could eat.

167
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,990
You could eat off the fucking floors.
All right.

168
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,990
Then I brought everything back.

169
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,220
I had one pallet left from my fucking
DVDs and I kept that thing in case any

170
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:11,970
water gets in there and I
got rid of a bunch of Shit,

171
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,350
put the rest of Shit and containers.
Got It all neatly over in the corner.

172
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,420
Now I got to hope place
where I can work out.

173
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:22,890
The whole fucking thing is great and I'm
sitting there in the end all excited,

174
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,180
right? Like at the end of a fucking
beer commercial and I'm looking around,

175
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:31,950
I'm like clean fucking garage and all of
a sudden I see all the way over in the

176
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:35,820
other corner.
I see all this black shit on the wall.

177
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,410
I've got a white wall and I see this fuck.

178
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:41,000
It looks like a streak of Greece
in a really weird for him.

179
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,950
Like what the fuck is that?
How did I miss that?

180
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,970
So I walk over there to see what it is
and I walk up to the wall and I find out

181
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,040
it's like fucking 10,000 little

182
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,890
okay.

183
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,380
That came up from the foundation
when I sprayed the water.

184
00:11:57,381 --> 00:12:02,210
These are the ones that
survived, you know, the great
flood or some shit. You know,

185
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:05,060
there's probably some reporter aunt
down there staying in the water with the

186
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,860
fucking trenchcoat reporting live,

187
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,560
but the rest of 'em all fucking
screwed and went up the wall.

188
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,250
And I just sat there looking at
him, go, what do I do now? Huh?

189
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,060
Okay.

190
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,910
Do I get raid and just complete the
fucking holocaust of this ant hill

191
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,840
or should I fucking,
you know,

192
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,190
they just fucking ants,
right? I'll just let him go.

193
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,230
Oh, you know what? I just
got a fucking text message.

194
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,410
I could have fucking predicted this.

195
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,140
I could have fucking predicted
this. I just let me get
this, this guy to be sorry,

196
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:44,560
we beat your patriots. I swear to God. I,

197
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:49,561
if this comes from shred and Reagan who
lives out in buffalo shred and Reagan,

198
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,030
those two fucking pussies,

199
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,720
they are the absolute worst and that
probably playing this audio right now,

200
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:02,980
giggling like a couple of school girls,
they are the absolute worst.

201
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,640
You're going to brag about
beating the Patriots.

202
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,120
Tom Brady didn't even play in
the second half. You assholes.

203
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,920
We had to put in our fucking
second stringer. Who Was it?

204
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:17,440
Jimmy Garafalo.
We had Janine Gruffalos,

205
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,080
younger brother playing quarterback
and you finally beat us.

206
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:23,980
You fucking assholes. Yeah, they're
the worst. You know what's funny?

207
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:26,680
I was actually going to compliment the
buffalo bills because they were kicking

208
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,950
our ass when Tom Brady was in there.
So there's a lot of ways,

209
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:33,730
if I was a buffalo bills fan, I could say
that, uh, if I was you, I'd be like, no.

210
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,250
You guys knew you were going to lose.
So then you did like that.

211
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,160
That pussy video game thing with a
person just quits and says, well,

212
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:42,920
I wasn't even trying, you
know, that fucking move. Um,

213
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,260
I had no idea that the, uh, the bills
had that kind of a defense. So man,

214
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,400
they got like two guys of course,
I don't know the fucking names. Um,

215
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,110
two guys that have like,
you know,

216
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,720
double digit stack sacks and they
had another guy had like five or six,

217
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,920
probably had but like nine by the end
of the game with the Patriots. But um,

218
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,850
you know, if they could just get
a Goddamn quarterback out there,

219
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,980
who's kidding, who if they, if they
weren't the buffalo bills, you know,

220
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:14,090
and I'm not saying that in a
disrespectful way, I'm just being honest.

221
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,880
Okay. Having been there as a fan,
I lived through all the years of,

222
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:23,570
if we weren't the New England patriots,
we would have picked the right guy.

223
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,550
And uh, thank God Robert Kraft came
along, who I would say is going to be,

224
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,240
that guy is going to be in the hall
of fame as an owner, without a doubt.

225
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:35,450
Do you realize that guys, the guy
has been there for 20 fucking years.

226
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,470
He's gone to the Super Bowl six times.

227
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,990
He's got three victories.

228
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,300
Yeah.

229
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,980
He's three coaching hires.

230
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,700
Our Bill Parcells Pete
Carroll and bill Belicheck.

231
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,700
It's getting to the point if Pete
Carroll Ha, I mean Pete Carroll,

232
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,260
if Robert Kraft hires you as a head coach,

233
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,970
that's like a automatically
a plus on your resume.

234
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,140
So I believe the bills
have new ownership and uh,

235
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,410
you know, hopefully that'll work out
for it. Cause he, I I really don't,

236
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,450
I don't wish ill will on any fans
unless they're just ridiculous cons.

237
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,180
Um, like New York Yankee fans were for
all those years where they chanted 19,

238
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:25,540
18, 1918 and all that, which I
get curse of the bay, which I get,

239
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,850
but then when we beat him in 2004,

240
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:31,230
they all ran and hid and none of
them would answer their fleets,

241
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,270
all the Yankee fans, I know none of
them would answer their fucking phones.

242
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,730
And then they did that. Yeah.
Bullshit. What were you go 26? You

243
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,240
actually made a t shirt?
26 to six.

244
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,510
I mean that was some Colby Bryan Shit
check does it to what is wrong with you?

245
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,270
Just take the loss,
you know.

246
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,420
Anyways. Um, so I'm
actually, uh, you know,

247
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,020
I was actually, that was happy for bills
fans. There's certain fans, you know,

248
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,380
they,
they've suffered enough.

249
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,960
Like what did San Diego charger
fans due to the football gods.

250
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,010
I hated charge your fans after the one
game I went to and was basically cause

251
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:20,790
one douche bag behind me and I realized
that was wrong because I know some other

252
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,620
people gone down there and
they said they had a good time.

253
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,591
But generally speaking,

254
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,520
I got to tell your fans on the west coast
and California that fucking animals,

255
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,420
fucking animals take it way too seriously.
You know what I mean?

256
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,790
Look at the shift that's happened that
people get stabbed, they get shot.

257
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,370
You beat up a fucking dad who's sitting
there with his two kids and now he's

258
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:39,210
brain dead.
That's the fucking west coast man animals.

259
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,060
Um, but I still, I don't wish any, uh,

260
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,190
I don't wish ill will on charge of fans.
I actually was a huge fan of that.

261
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:51,810
Back when Dan Fouts, Charlie
joiner, a west Jan left,

262
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,260
Caitlin and Winslow Jesus Christ, racking
my brain, chuck Muncie Louis Culture.

263
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,440
All right, dude. He's got
shy 16 quadrapalegic clique.

264
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,400
He's a poor man's John Matousek. Um, oh,

265
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,790
by the way, I'm all over the fucking
place today. Uh, New Year's Day,

266
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,890
New Year's Day, the NFL network
is running a series of, uh,

267
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,720
what is it? Football life, you
know, behind the jock strap,

268
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:26,460
whatever the fuck they call it. I don't
know what the fuck it's called, but,

269
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,050
uh, they're doing one on [inaudible]
and a, and a bunch of other people.

270
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,600
Warren Moon's going to be a good
one. That's, that'll be a good one.

271
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:37,050
Cause that'll deal with like racism in
the NFL and why he wasn't fucking drafted.

272
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:40,440
And he had to go to the CFL and basically
break every record 9 million times,

273
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,740
and then they finally let him into the
NFL and he's got to play with the fucking

274
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:47,370
Houston Oilers. One of my favorite things
Warren moon ever said was when they,

275
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,950
when, um, when the

276
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,190
Houston Oilers defense was calling the
astrodome the house of pain and they kept

277
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,980
saying that say in the house of Payne and
he finally said to the defense because

278
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:01,770
he was older than all of those punk
kids at that point, he goes, look,

279
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,930
stop fucking saying that.

280
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,550
Okay cause I'm the one that has to
pay the price for your shit talking.

281
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:10,660
Cause basically the other difference
would come in and be like,

282
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:14,160
oh well we'll show you what the house of
pain is and then they'd be taken extra

283
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,130
fucking shots at Warren Moon.
And you know, the defense,

284
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:21,020
they don't have to take any shots.
They dish out the punishment. Um,

285
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,420
which is why I've told you for a zillion
times, I've always hated when a, when a,

286
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,910
when a cornerback lights up a fucking
receiver and then stands over them like

287
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:34,260
ray rice over his fiance.
You know, it's like

288
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,723
the,

289
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,140
the fucking guy,
the wide receiver is running full speed,

290
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,050
jumps in the air and is looking
back in the other direction,

291
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:46,410
trying to catch a flying object.
Gee, did you lay 'em out?

292
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,350
You know, I dunno. I mean I like a
big hit like anybody else, but uh,

293
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,420
that whole standing over him like you
guys squared off touch gloves and then you

294
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:58,290
fucking knock them off.
You know,

295
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,270
I don't know if you want to see a great
fucking flight. Oh flight, great fun.

296
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,370
I should say. Sorry, I'm
all fucking full of sugar,

297
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:09,400
so I'm extra add in whatever the
fuck else I got going on here. Um,

298
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,940
anybody watched the a Bruins,

299
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:17,200
Columbus blue jackets game
and we lost six to two hold.

300
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,840
Let me tell it was a Ralph
Lauren, you know, um,

301
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,280
fucking Lucita fought this Guy Dalton
proud. I guess it was his third bout.

302
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:27,660
I don't know how I missed the first two,

303
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,910
but if you just want to
see two fucking guys,

304
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:34,710
just two warriors going at it.
I mean,

305
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:38,400
it is, it's just a fucking great fight.
And I'm not one of these guys in the end.

306
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:41,190
Cause Lou Cheech got in the last punch in,
landed on top of them.

307
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:43,890
I hate when hockey fans think
that that means it's a victory.

308
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,380
When Lou Cheech took a
bunch of big shots too.

309
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:49,110
It was just a fucking heavyweight bout.

310
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,750
Okay.

311
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,290
They fought during the right time of
the game. They didn't hurt either team.

312
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,200
It was just a fucking old school.

313
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,270
Two heavyweights just beaten the shit.
I mean it was, it was fucking amazing.

314
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
I felt like less of a man watching it,
you know,

315
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,280
it's curl on my knees up into my chest,
Jesus of hitting each other so hard. Um,

316
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,280
that was fucking awesome.
So I'm going to uh,

317
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,920
definitely post the link to the one
from that I just watched last night.

318
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,180
Um, I tape all the Bruins
games and sometimes, uh,
there's something else on it.

319
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,980
I can only take so much shit
cause I have the old school.

320
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:33,170
You can only take two things at once.
So it was a little bit behind, but I'll,

321
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:36,170
I'll have all three of those
back to the future. One,

322
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:39,450
two and three with the [inaudible].
Man, it's, I'm not album.

323
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,690
I'm saying that guy's name,
right?

324
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,900
I'll say Dalton because I don't want to
disrespect the man. Uh, water. Fuck it.

325
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,690
I'm just a fucking great
fight. Awesome. Um,

326
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,180
why wasn't I watching the
Bruins verse the Blue Jackets?

327
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:56,181
Because I started watching Boston
college versus Penn state in the,

328
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,750
uh, looking up your skirt bowl,
whatever the fuck they were playing in.

329
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,890
It was something really weird. The
pen and pencil set bull. I mean,

330
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,110
it's one of the fucking, you
know, one of those fucking bowls.

331
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:15,390
So we're in this guy damn thing.
We got these fuckers beat.

332
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,670
They can't move the
ball. 21 seven. We're up.

333
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,090
It's fucking over their quarterback.
You know,

334
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,050
he rolls it back. You know,
looking like a fuck it,

335
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,380
it's got that good looking
Gerber baby face going on, right.

336
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:33,030
He throws the ball right at our defensive
back. The guy goes to slap it down.

337
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,930
He tips it up in the fucking
Penn state guy catches a 2114.

338
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,560
Oh,
this was the night I had the four beers.

339
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:43,760
That fucking dumplings in the piece
of Pie. So I kind of blacked out.

340
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,860
I want the fuck happened.
The sugar, salt coma.

341
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:51,861
Next thing I know it's 2121 goes into
overtime and my good friend Paul Versey

342
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,140
hates the extra point.

343
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:59,070
He wants to get rid of the extra point
or cause he think he's like, dude,

344
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:02,460
it's so fucking stupid.
They make it 99.9% of the time.

345
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,890
And I'm sitting there going, yeah,
but it's the times that they miss it.

346
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,540
That makes it worth it because
it's so fucking dramatic. And uh,

347
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,330
that's what happened in fucking bit
me in the ass this time as a fan.

348
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,590
Fucking BC goes down over time,

349
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:19,620
gets the ball in,
poses their wealth.

350
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,190
Let's their presence be known or whatever
fucking sports cliche you want to

351
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,780
fucking hear about.
They go down,

352
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:30,060
score a touchdown and their kicker goes
out and basically he fucking hook this

353
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:33,390
thing so bad. I can't believe he didn't
hit himself in the face with the ball.

354
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,960
Was he a lefty?
Maybe.

355
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,450
I don't know what the fuck if he shanked
it or whatever the fuck you want to

356
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:43,010
call it. He misses the thing.
So we only get six points.

357
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,653
All right.

358
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,540
The fucking Penn state gets the ball
and then they just drive right down the

359
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:50,871
field.

360
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,040
They score a touchdown and then kick the
fucking next to point and then they're

361
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:59,780
fucking kicker starts running down the
field. Like he just kicked a 70 yard,

362
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,170
which made it even more painful to watch.
Here's my question.

363
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:06,890
I just realized as I was telling
that story, I thought it,

364
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,020
if you scored a touchdown
and overtime it was over,

365
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,460
but if you kicked a field goal,

366
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,440
the other team got to have like
equal amount of possessions.

367
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,910
Wasn't that how it was or is it always
you, you know you get equal possessions

368
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,190
or is it you at least
get one possession each?

369
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,430
I can't fucking remember cause I was
just trying to think. There was a,

370
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,430
because we missed the extra point
that they got the blood pressure,

371
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,370
you get equal possessions. I
don't fucking know. So whatever.

372
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,030
So I made fun of that Penn state guy
running, or they're just, you know, just,

373
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,060
I didn't make fun of the guy. And
somebody writes, writes to me on Twitter,

374
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:44,830
I'm man wrote this to me.
He wrote, um, dot. Dot.

375
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,190
He's only like

376
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,000
the best field goal kicker
in college football.

377
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,370
Dude, a grown man wrote,
um, dot. Dot. Dot.

378
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,550
I can't stand these fucking guys on
Twitter that tweet like fucking preteen

379
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:06,350
girls.
Jesus fucking Christ I and,

380
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:07,550
and what,
what's wrong with me that,

381
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:10,340
that fucking annoys me that much and
I have to make that point to him. I,

382
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,900
you know what? I'm the
asshole. Fuck that guy.

383
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:16,490
If you want to go on like maybe next
time. Wait, what? If you want to do that?

384
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:19,310
Go ahead and fucking, I'm, you know, I'm
gonna try to be less of a cut in 2015.

385
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,450
All right, but it's only December 29th.
So I got another two days of this shit,

386
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,690
so fucking get used to it. All
right, let's do a little, uh,

387
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,010
a little advertise in here.
Uh, live reads old Geez issue.

388
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,460
Um, oh look who's back here.

389
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,490
Can someone tell me when razors got so
God damn expensive and if I been asleep

for nearly 20 years,

391
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,250
I was in a store the other day and one
pack of razors is now 20 bucks one pack.

392
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,190
That's crazy. But Hey, sometimes
they give you a free gift. A,

393
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,480
when you buy their overpay,
a overpriced rages,

394
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,660
which is actually just
a punch in the Dick.

395
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,860
I like a dollar shave club doesn't
even wait for you to start cursing.

396
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,630
They just start doing it. Well, I guess
I could drop f bombs at this point.

So what else I want to talk about here?

472
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,180
I cleaned out the garage. Oh, here's,
here's a weird thing I had this morning,

473
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:49,130
right?
I fucking um,

474
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,893
okay.

475
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,320
I uh, somebody delivered, they,
somebody delivered a package,

476
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,530
ever get a package and it's not for you,
it's for somebody else,

477
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:02,520
but they live on the same number.
Like you live on one, two,

478
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:05,550
three Smith Street and they live
on one, two, three Allen Street.

479
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:10,470
And it's like fucking, uh, you know,
it's like a mile away or something.

480
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,070
And I'm thinking I could, you know
what, what am I going to do here?

481
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,340
I could fucking,
you know,

482
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,700
I could fucking just give this to the
post office person, right. And be like,

483
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:24,700
this doesn't belong to us.
You take it, but then what?

484
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:27,190
It's December 29th when you think
this person's going to get it.

485
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:31,180
Once it goes back into the systems system,
all those fucking maniacs down there,

486
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,330
this guy's going to get this thing or
this lady is going to get this thing after

487
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:37,960
New Year's Day. Alright, I
Google search the person's house.

488
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,100
I've done this like three fucking times.
Um,

489
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,610
I've actually gotten in my car and just
driven it over to the person's house.

490
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,530
And then there's always that weird
point is you're walking up there,

491
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:51,940
walk thinking like, am I
going to get shot? And they're
always psyched. You know,

492
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,990
the first time I did it,

493
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:55,570
I walked up and the lady came walking
out of the house and I got freaked out.

494
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:59,890
I was just like, Hey, they
accidentally delivered this
to my house. She was like, oh

495
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,930
right.
That's what she did.

496
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,040
Then she just froze just like that.

497
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,480
And I kinda like moved my hand in front
of him and she just was like catatonic.

498
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:17,980
She was so fucking happy. Then I skipped
back to my Prius and I drove away.

499
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,070
And that's the end of that story. So
anyways, I, uh, so I'm like, all right,

500
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm going on a fucking walk this morning.

501
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,140
Good to try to walk off some
of the whiskey and pie I
ate right before I went to

502
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:33,430
sleep. Fucking pig and a, I'll bring
it over to this person's house.

503
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,080
I see. It's like two fucking miles away.
Am I going two miles over, two miles back?

504
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,610
There's a four or five mile walk, if
you know, whatever, that's good thing.

505
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,750
Burn off some calories.
So I fucking walk over to this place

506
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,220
and uh,

507
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
it's a little ways up
into the hills and shit.

508
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:54,361
And I get there and it turns out it's
like a gated community and I got this

509
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,660
stupid fucking box and I'm like,

510
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:00,730
what am I going to do
in the fucking house?

511
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,380
Was like one house into the gated
community. So I'm like, well,

512
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,740
what do I do? I can't leave
it at the gate. I don't want,

513
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,960
I'll fucking walk this
thing all the way back.

514
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,440
Do I throw it over the fence and
try to get it to the driveway?

515
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:19,150
What if this is broken it?
Then I just looked and they had like

516
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,360
they had the defense went like across the
street and then there was a brick wall

517
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,090
with a ledge on it and
the fence went up on that

518
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:36,460
and I was just like, you know what?
I could be up and over this thing,

519
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,520
drop off the package and backup and
over before even has a chance to call

520
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:45,470
anybody. I don't want to lug this
fucking thing back. So then by myself,

521
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,790
I start laughing like a schoolgirl.
I'm looking for cameras.

522
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,840
I don't see any, and I'm
like, this is fucking so

523
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,080
fucking climbed up over it and my
heart's racing. I'm already rehearsing.

524
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,280
What I'm going to say to the cop?

525
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,070
Well what two three [inaudible] street?
This was for a kid

526
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,840
like, you know, am I going to
get arrested for this shit?

527
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,920
I got this fucking like ridiculous
stupid Bruins sweatshirt on.

528
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,530
That's like black. It's not even gold.
Like I think it's like a knock off.

529
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:22,940
It's like yellow almost.

530
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,750
You could spot me a million miles away
and I'm on foot if anybody calls the cops.

531
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:30,020
But I did it,
dropped it off right back up and over.

532
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:35,021
The whole thing took like maybe fucking
20 seconds and I walked away laughing

533
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:39,380
and rehearsing what I was going to
say to the cop and nothing happens.

534
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:41,750
And so they go and you know what,
that's my good deed for the day.

535
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,660
My good deed for the day.
So they got,

536
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:48,380
don't ever let gay communities
a fucking hilarious and the most

537
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,200
okay,

538
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,970
they look, there's nobody guarding it.
That's what I realized is just a fence.

539
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,380
And then you got these people who are
too dumb to become a police officer,

540
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,330
you know, you know, too
lazy to walk around a mall.

541
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,690
They just want to sit in a truck.
What are they doing?

542
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,700
They were rubbing their
balls and they're on Twitter.

543
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,230
They're not paying attention.

544
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,580
I literally could have taken
that fence down, you know,

545
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,800
and just dragged it over to home
depot and sold it from metal scrap.

546
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,270
I think it would still take two
hours before anybody even showed up.

547
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,860
I lost all respect for gated communities,
gated community.

548
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,320
The fuck are you doing in there? How
you're sacrificing virgins. You know

549
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,210
how fucking crook I could see like look,

550
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,943
okay,

551
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,600
I shouldn't say this, but I think only
women should live in gated communities.

552
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,900
Like if you're like a pop star and you
have like a fucking stalker and shit,

553
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,300
you know, you should be behind
them. But I think if you're a man,

554
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,150
you should fight your stalker right
in your front yard. Kick his ass,

555
00:34:57,151 --> 00:34:59,400
running your front lawn.
You know,

556
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,950
fun kid. That's actually a
dangerous subject to talk
about. I'm fucking with you.

557
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,210
Um, AH, Jesus. Blame it on the pie bill.

558
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,560
Oh, I want to thank all the cons.
Who sent me shit because another,

559
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:18,390
a Singapore airline a is now missing. You
know, putting that in my fucking head.

560
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:21,870
Like, are you, aren't you
afraid to go over there? Now?
Actually know what the odds,

561
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,910
the odds are pretty fucking good.
You know,

562
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,700
odds are pretty good
that they just lost one.

563
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,550
I don't even hit me with that fucking,
uh,

564
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,730
rules of three's a.

565
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,330
So my fucking buddy to a
Michigan Fan texting me here.

566
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:42,030
I think the news is milking it while
Michigan and harbor is being considered to

567
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:46,300
the niners players. I'll lean
into, okay, Jim Harbaugh,

568
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,770
ball ball, ball, ball, ball, ball ball.

569
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,920
Oh is the only way to
play drums to that shit.

570
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,980
Door. Door. Door. The door.

571
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,950
All right. Classic White fucking beat.
You fucking clap on all four beats.

572
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,600
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap,
clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap,

573
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:09,290
clap,
clap.

574
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:14,120
Where? Fuck and white. And
we bought some to buzz today.

575
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,300
Um, you might be going to
the University of Michigan,

576
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,390
which should be great for the big 10,
whatever.

577
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:22,010
And they know they got
like 15 fucking teeth now.

578
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:24,710
That would be great for the big 10.
It is not good for the big 10.

579
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,270
When Michigan's not good. You Need
Ohio state and Michigan to be good.

580
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,180
You need them to beat the fuck out
of each other. And then you know,

581
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,310
everybody else falls in the
line. I'm sorry, Michigan State.

582
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm sorry. Wisconsin. Alright.
Wisconsin. You had your day,

583
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:47,000
you went to three fucking rose bowls in
a row and you did a great impression of

584
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:51,410
the early nineties buffalo bills.
Okay. I want it to you guys to win.

585
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,550
I was rooting for you.

586
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:57,380
When you play tacy you come on frogs and
you know what you did? You fucked me.

587
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,120
You fucked me three years in a row.

588
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,480
Yeah.

589
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,320
All right, so it's going to be a long
while before I, I root for that fucker.

590
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,450
Giant red w again.

591
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,383
Okay.

592
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,710
Even though we've got a good now the
badgers, that's a great fucking name.

593
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,670
I don't hate Wisconsin. I was just
fucking sick of watching them coming in.

594
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:17,810
They're all fucking cheesy and pasty and
all that cheesy pasty fucking fans and

595
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:20,150
they just walking out with their
heads hanging down low, you know.

596
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,233
Okay.

597
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,250
Sitting there with a handful of fucking
blue cheese in one hand and some fucking

598
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:27,810
Cheddar and the other,
you know,

599
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,840
dabbin their cheers with some
tears with some Kraft slices.

600
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,360
Oh Geez. Um, all right. So, you know
what a lot of people told me that, uh,

601
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:43,170
they'd rather listen to me
talk about music then sports.

602
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:45,900
So I figured I'd talk about
sports for 35 fucking minutes.

603
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:50,610
I also talked about food. I go, fuck
yourself. Start Your own podcast. Um,

604
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,580
I finally had some downtime and old law.

605
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,290
Okay.

606
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,920
Oh, Billy boy here is uh,
got back into playing drums.

607
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,890
I want to do another one of those
goddamn comedy jams coming up.

608
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:04,020
So I'm working on a song,
can't say which song it is,

609
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:07,800
but it has double bass in it.
And old Billy is not a double bass player.

610
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,510
So, um, I've actually been, uh,

611
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,890
I've been woodshedding as they say,
I'm playing drums trying to get it down.

612
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:19,890
And I mean, I don't know. I was
one of those fucking assholes.

613
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:24,660
I just totally got way into John Bonham
when I was playing and my brothers both

614
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:27,270
played guitar and they weren't into
Metallica and that type of shit.

615
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,060
And they were like, get a double pedal,
get a double bass, get another bass drum.

616
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:34,260
Let's fucking do that. And I, I kind
of look back, wished I did, but, um,

617
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,990
I didn't play it because, uh, I dunno,

618
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,870
I had this competitive fucking thing and
Bonham's bass drum foot was faster than

619
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:42,800
mine and I was like,

620
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:45,770
I'm not getting a double bass
pedal until I can play good times,

621
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:50,771
bad times with a single
base drum pedal and

622
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,460
okay.

623
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,610
And this is like back,
you know, this is the 80s,

624
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,530
so I have no help.

625
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,530
I have to just basically listened to
the record of the tape and try to figure

626
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:02,270
out what he's doing as
opposed to all the kids today.

627
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:07,271
You can just fucking go on youtube and
there'll be some 20 year pro show you

628
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:10,730
that slide step fucking
thing. I had no idea, man.

629
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,280
I was fucking my foot up trying to
figure out how the hell he was doing it.

630
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:16,730
Right. So anyways, I started,

631
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:20,240
I know I didn't play drums for like 10
years when I started doing comedy and I

632
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,700
moved to New York City's,
you know,

633
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,660
drums that you can't like strum a fucking
set of drums in your apartment in New

634
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,640
York. Trust me. So, um,
I didn't play until, uh,

635
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,040
I got more established as a comedian.

636
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,380
I was able to afford one of those
electronic drum kits, the, uh,

637
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,670
the Roland ones, which were fucking
amazing then forget about now.

638
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,300
And I'm thinking about getting
another one just for in the house,

639
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:47,500
so I won't drive me nuts.
But, uh, was I gonna say,

640
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:52,501
so I remembered how I just got so
obsessed with John Bonham that it really

641
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:54,310
affected my plank.

642
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,800
Cause I just sounded like another
guy who just listened to bond them.

643
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,660
And then all the players that were
into were derivative of John Bonham.

644
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:02,820
So then I would have just go
back to his playing again.

645
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,010
I just couldn't get out
of this fucking vortex.

646
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:07,940
It just listening to the same fucking guy.

647
00:40:07,941 --> 00:40:11,980
So I went out and I bought a
double pedal like 10, 12 years ago,

648
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:16,860
that DW 5,000, you know what the
red plate on the bottom. And, um,

649
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,730
I go, you know, I was listening
to the Primus and I got, you know,

650
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,800
listen to old Metallica and I tried to
get into it and I gave it a shot and I

651
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,040
went right back to the bottom thing.
And um,

652
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,930
but made sure that I expanded what
I listened to, uh, since then.

653
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,510
But uh, so I've dusted this
fucking thing off. I mean,

654
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,410
I still have it in the case. I
got all this, all the attachments,

655
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:45,370
all of that Shit I've made sure like,
like hate when people sell stuff,

656
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,620
all musical equipment and they fucking,

657
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,740
they don't have all the
original shit to it. You know,

658
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,680
like even my truck, I got this
old truck and you know, they,

659
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,410
the radiators back then ran a little hot.
So, uh, then aluminum runs run better.

660
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:02,860
So put a new aluminum one
in and I kept the old one.

661
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,370
And when we switched out the front brakes,
I went from drum to disc.

662
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:07,630
I still kept the drum brakes,

663
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,030
actually learned how to put
those fucking things together.

664
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:13,150
I bought all the tools in that shit
and I kept all of it. You know,

665
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,040
had somebody put a new rear
end in it and uh, I fucking,

666
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,010
I have all of the, I have all those
parts. I kept all of that shit.

667
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:25,750
I have the old masters cylinder.
So anyways, I've been, um,

668
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,760
I've been playing a lot
of double bass right now

669
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,900
and this song is actually,

670
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:33,140
if you're double bass player is
actually a simple song to play,

671
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:35,900
but if he'd never played it,
it's just so fucking weird.

672
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:39,470
So I've been literally just
sitting there, uh, you know,

673
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:42,800
60 bpms ticket ticket ticket,
ticket back and ticket ticket,

674
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,890
ticket ticket to get the
good, take a packet, they get
thicker, thicker, 70 digging,

675
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,080
digging, digging, digging, development.
I can't play it that fast, but whatever,

676
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:49,430
just trying to work my way up.

677
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,060
So the songs at about 115 bpms and I'm
about up to like 95 and I got two weeks

678
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:02,510
to go. So, uh, I went
to a Mike's lessons.com.

679
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,970
Um, he doesn't play double based too much
shit on that, but you know, he's got,

680
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,990
it's just the best site.
It's just as far as his practice,

681
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:16,130
like that technique where it's a,
see,

682
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:18,530
this is why I don't talk fucking drums
in that type of shit cause I know it

683
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:18,770
right now.

684
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,470
Everybody's just fucking so I feel like
I'm teaching like geography right now.

685
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:26,450
I don't know where. Um, but if you're a
drummer out there, Mike's lessons.com,

686
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:30,620
I cannot recommend it highly enough.
Um,

687
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,190
and you want to talk about God
with a sick fucking bass drum foot.

688
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:39,020
He's fucking unbelievable. Um,
so anyways, and you know what?

689
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:43,060
This actually gets me, somebody asked me
about what I, what I thought about, um,

690
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:49,190
what I thought about whatever that
fucking movie was, where the uh,

691
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,830
whiplash, here we go. Let's do
some questions here. Uh, dear bill,

692
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,980
hope he had a great holiday and I loved
the show. Thank you. My question is,

693
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,630
have you seen the film whiplash?

694
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,020
It's about a student and a
music conservatory trying
to become the next great

695
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:03,854
jazz drummer.

696
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,410
A Jk Simmons plays his
music teacher slash.

697
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:13,790
Mentor, but the movie flips around
all the usual music, movie tropes.

698
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,350
Simmons acts more like a drill sergeant
and screams and intimidates the students

699
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:19,520
to push them further.

700
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,060
I don't want to say much more
because the movie speaks for itself,

701
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,570
but I know you'll love it.
Especially given your affinity for drums.

702
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,260
The movie also raises a
more general question.

703
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:36,250
Are the all time greats in any field
born or can they be made thoughts?

704
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,650
Um, Eh, great fucking question. Um,

705
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,470
I thought what's his face?
Jk Simmons was unbelievable in that movie.

706
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,490
Uh,
but I love drums.

707
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:55,150
So watching him scream and yell at
somebody who also loved drums was like,

708
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,910
I kinda had a hard time watching it.

709
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,570
It'd be like if I was watching a movie
about standup and there was somebody

710
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:05,000
screaming at some open Miker, I'd
be like, he didn't do it, you know,

711
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:09,920
fucking do that. You
encourage, you know? Um,

712
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,220
but I mean, I still think, I still thought
it was, it was a really good movie,

713
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:16,240
but I would actually say the best drums,
uh,

714
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,030
the best drums in any movie
this year is not in whiplash.

715
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:23,080
The best rooms in any movie by far that I,
I,

716
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:25,730
that I saw was in a birdman.

717
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,920
Birdman has sick drums in it and it then,

718
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:35,921
they're not even as difficult technically
as the drawing that was in whiplash,

719
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:38,560
but it's dynamics.

720
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,310
Dynamics will take your playing over the
fucking top if you know how to utilize

721
00:44:42,311 --> 00:44:46,660
them, which I do not put whoever the
fuck played the drums on the, uh,

722
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,450
Birdman soundtrack was
fucking unbelievable,

723
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,730
was that he's just one of those guys sits
down at a four piece kit and just gets

724
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:57,160
more music out of that than I could have
fucking Terry Bozzio that's inspiring

725
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,170
and frustrating and it's just like,
Eh,

726
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:03,160
that's why I became a comedian because
I can't fucking do that. All right,

727
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,130
so you asked me,
um,

728
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,550
are the all time greats in any field
born or can they be made thoughts?

729
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,550
I think both.
Um,

730
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,840
I think everybody is born with a talent
and then it's up to you to try to see

731
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,310
how far it's all up to you,
how far you want to take it.

732
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:26,070
And I think that a lot of,

733
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,333
yeah,

734
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,000
a lot of the greats,

735
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,740
a lot of the times are
not necessarily the best,

736
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,800
uh,
weren't blessed with the most talent.

737
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,800
It's just that they had

738
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:47,130
that brutal combination of blessed with
enough of the gift and they had drive to

739
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:51,790
try to get themselves as
great as they could get in.

740
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:56,791
A lot of times when people are born
with a fucking ridiculous gift,

741
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,110
it comes easy to them and
they'll, they'll coast. Um,

742
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,370
and that's what made Jordan so great
because Jordan was like born with like the

743
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:10,780
greatest talent of all,

744
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:16,140
but worked like he was born with my gift
for playing basketball and that's why

745
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,560
he became the greatest who ever fucking
plate or like a Jerry Rice or something

746
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:25,510
like that. And um, so I would say
it's a combination of both. So,

747
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,500
you know, I dunno, whatever
your fucking talent is,

748
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:34,030
you should be always trying to just
compete against yourself and then then you

749
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:35,810
won't become like this bitter asshole.

750
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,990
Cause you don't wanna compete against
somebody else cause they were born with a

751
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:41,810
different gift than you. You know what I
mean? And then you'll, you'll try to like,

752
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,221
uh,
you know,

753
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:45,310
that happens in my fucking business where
like you get an acting gig and you'll

754
00:46:45,311 --> 00:46:47,650
do a scene and somebody is
trying to out like act you.

755
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:50,560
I was just talking about somebody talking
to somebody about this like last night,

756
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,400
the train like out at you being like, it's
like, no, dude, we're in this together.

757
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,290
You don't, let's fucking do
this thing together. So, um,

758
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,500
yeah.
Does that make any sense?

759
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:05,890
I feel like just went from a fucking
funny podcast to a Goddamn lecture for the

760
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:09,680
last 10 minutes.
Let's talk about talents every bloody.

761
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,620
Are you born with it or is it,

762
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,410
is it made from your hard work?

763
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,990
Today we're going to talk to two people.

764
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:23,210
Both who chronically jerk off one
person since the day he was born,

765
00:47:23,211 --> 00:47:27,620
the crib, the other person who did not
discover masturbating until he was 23.

766
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:29,890
Mark and Chris,
welcome to the program.

767
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,670
Um, all right, let's get on to the
next one here. Uh, oh, Rex Ryan.

768
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:40,540
Happy trails to you.
Bunch of people got fired today.

769
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,040
Uh, wait a minute. That's PTI. I just
ripped off to PTI show. Sorry man.

770
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,390
See that's why I don't watch other
comedians cause it fucking just sticks in

771
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:51,670
your head. And next thing you know, you
say some shit that they were saying.

772
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,460
All right. Uh, Rex Ryan, he got fired. Uh,

773
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:00,010
I don't know how I feel about that.
I guess they just,

774
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:04,510
they just been together long enough
so they had to make the move. I mean,

775
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,600
I think that guy is,

776
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,410
he's a bit of a knucklehead.

777
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:12,870
Okay.

778
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,970
You know,
very crass.

779
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,730
He's not a dumb guy,
but he just,

780
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,110
he's got that low self esteem thing that
he just walks around and just has to

781
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,070
act like a dope.

782
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,100
I don't know why he does that
because I think he's a great coach.

783
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,230
And um,

784
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,870
I think he was a victim of a
bad GM that John, what was it?

785
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:39,190
His Dick [inaudible] fuck you
goddamn name. I mean that guy just,

786
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,790
he made some moves and they
didn't fucking pan out. Right.

787
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,330
You got rid of fucking Reavis,

788
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,810
although you've got a number one draft
pick in that panned out. But then like,

789
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:53,080
I dunno, they had all these draft picks
and they used all of them. I was, I mean,

790
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,840
I'm just fucking
regurgitate and what I read,

791
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,710
I mean it seemed to be
when rex had the players,

792
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,650
he got him to the fucking
AFC championship game.

793
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,050
Then all of a sudden all
the players were taken away.

794
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:07,470
What the fuck are you going to do?
Right?

795
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,650
Every fucking great coach.
He got to have the players.

796
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:15,740
So I think that that guy would be a
great pickup and now I'm actually hoping

797
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,840
that he goes to the NFC.
I don't because I have,

798
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:24,650
I'm just like, I'm sick of it. I
just don't, I don't, I don't know.

799
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:29,480
There's something about that guy. I Dunno.
She's been wanting, I watched that jets,

800
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:34,520
one of the fucking inside the locker room
whenever the fuck it was and he's like,

801
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,100
hey, we can beat any fucking team in
this league. It was just like this.

802
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,770
That's how you talk to your team.

803
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,820
Look far be it from me
to talk about the f bomb.

804
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:45,740
But there's a time and a place for it,
right.

805
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,360
You just going to casually
use that word and then what,

806
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:52,940
what are you going to do when you
blow a gasket? What the fuck was that?

807
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:57,620
It's just you. You've already done that.
But a fuck. It was like Mike Smith.

808
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,500
Mike Smith never looked
like a head coach to me.

809
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:04,610
He always looked like somebody
who like infiltrated the mob.

810
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,043
How's he know what I mean?

811
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:10,130
He sort of looks like he's in the mob
and he also kind of looks like a cop.

812
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:15,770
He just be the perfect guy for the cops
to try to get in the infiltrate and try

813
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:19,350
to break it up. Hey,
break it up. Okay. Um,

814
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,090
yeah.

815
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:25,280
Who else? That guy, Marc
Trestman, Jim Harbaugh,

816
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:30,140
a bunch of guys lost their
fucking jobs. Um, so anyways,

817
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,060
whatever, who gives a fuck my
bill? ESPN here, by the way,

818
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:38,060
people, it is three days away from the
granddaddy of them all in this year.

819
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:42,410
It's a fucking playoff game. FSU
versus fucking Oregon. And this year,

820
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,380
last year, if you guys, if
you've been listening for the,
for a while last year, uh,

821
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,230
old freckles here passed out at the
tailgate. That's how hard I went.

822
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:53,990
So this year I'm actually,
I'm going to try to enjoy it.

823
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm going to try to live in the moment,
but I, I say that every fucking year.

824
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:00,810
Yeah.

825
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:04,020
Oh man, I can't fucking wait.
We're doing ribs this year.

826
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,910
We got some burgers.

827
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:11,660
We're actually bringing a power strip
with a generator because the second that

828
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:15,750
game's over,
we're coming back out.

829
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:18,960
We're firing back up the grill and we're
going to sit there freezing our asses

830
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:23,250
off watching the fucking
Alabama game, uh, bleary eyed.

831
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:28,310
Um,
I can't fucking wait and

832
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,600
I'm going to try to go easier.
Yeah.

833
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:33,040
Last year I got a little
drunk and belligerent.

834
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:37,200
Remember yelling at some fucking idiot.
That was a fucking idiot last year.

835
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:40,830
So I really got to, I got to tone it down.
Oh, I never finished talking about it.

836
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,080
Some of you talked about me going
to Singapore and all that, like,

837
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,830
can you give me a favorite,

838
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,430
a fucking send me tweets about
me dying in a plane crash.

839
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,880
Yukons and how do I
fucking do that to you?

840
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,300
Do I fucking write to you and ask
you if you fucking dreams died?

841
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:56,610
I don't do that to you.
Um,

842
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,630
and fuck all you douchebags and think
you're now clever that you're going to do

843
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:05,280
it. It's like, that's some amazing,
God damn joke it out. I don't know.

844
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:08,790
I fucking,
who did I see doing something like that.

845
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,790
Okay.

846
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:15,720
Oh, did you guys see that Twitter fight
with a dude? Actually, those guys, they,

847
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,030
they could greed to fight.

848
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,850
They were arguing over Koby
Bryant and they agreed to fight.

849
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,530
So one of the guys shows up to the fight
and the other guy wasn't even in the

850
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:25,364
state.

851
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,030
And then he does like
this interview about it.

852
00:52:30,031 --> 00:52:33,660
Like what he did was amazing
that he agreed to fight this guy.

853
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:36,830
And then he didn't show up like
this was some massive fucking,

854
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:38,570
okay.

855
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:38,850
You know,

856
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:42,200
he's like this genius burglar that
figured out how to break into the fucking

857
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,200
Federal Reserve. It's like,
dude, all you did was lie.

858
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,150
You're a pussy.
I,

859
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:53,650
that's one thing about fucking the
Internet that drives me up the wall is how

860
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:56,620
trolls feel like they're
fucking like these. Uh,

861
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,330
okay.

862
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:01,030
I Dunno like the, these geniuses
and it's just like, dude,

863
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:06,031
you're doing the lowest
common denominator of a,

864
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,390
okay.

865
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,690
I Dunno. I don't know what the
fuck to call the art. I don't know.

866
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:15,830
It's like a shit joke. Not
that I'm against shit jokes,
but I just didn't know.

867
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:18,650
Why is this guy like you,
this guy challenge you to fight.

868
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:22,400
You said you're going to go there and
you didn't go and then you talking about

869
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:25,610
yourself like you some sort of bad ass.
Like, yeah, I pissed off a of people.

870
00:53:25,611 --> 00:53:26,210
This is the first

871
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,700
time ever got anybody show up to five.

872
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,000
All right. Well he showed up
and he was ready to fight.

873
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,330
I think I'd rather hang out
with that other guy. Then you,

874
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:40,560
you fucking passive aggressive
little pansy. All right. Anyways,

875
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:45,000
response to your advice last week
about guy into girl with the laugh.

876
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:45,721
Like his friend.
All right,

877
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:50,100
so those of you didn't listen last week
there was this dude who met this uh,

878
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,690
woman. She's beautiful. She had a
great rack, great rack as he said,

879
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,300
and uh, they hit it off. She was
awesome. And everything was great.

880
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,790
She was great in the rain, the bed,
everything was fucking awesome.

881
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:03,810
Everything is coming up roses and then
the only thing was that she laughed

882
00:54:03,811 --> 00:54:07,830
exactly like his friend and
that was weird and I'm out,

883
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,690
so here we go. Okay. In response
to a, my advice to that person,

884
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:17,570
he said last week you talked,
you talked, read an email.

885
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:20,240
Can you guys please fucking,
you know I suck at reading.

886
00:54:20,241 --> 00:54:23,750
Can you just please proof read
what you wrote. All right.

887
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:28,751
Last week you read an email about a guy
who was worried about dating a girl with

888
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:30,890
a laugh like her brother.

889
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,810
You acknowledged that the advice you
were giving was probably not the greatest

890
00:54:35,811 --> 00:54:38,510
when you said that it would be
brutal to have to live with that.

891
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,710
I'm writing to tell you that you are
correct. Correct in saying you're wrong.

892
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:47,600
In my opinion, in my opinion, that is
no matter what girl you meet and date,

893
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,430
she'll have characteristics of a male
family member he described. Yeah,

894
00:54:52,431 --> 00:54:54,410
but dude, this is the
thing. It was his friend

895
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,560
and he knew his friend

896
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,930
for whatever years and years and years
hanging out with them as this Sharon

897
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:07,910
laughs. You know what I mean? I'm
not saying like, you know, oh,

898
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:12,610
you meet a girl and she has her dad's
eyes or something. Yeah, they're a family.

899
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,380
They can,
she's also going to look like our mom.

900
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:19,090
This is all getting weird Friday in
here anyways. No matter what a girl,

901
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,200
what girl you meet and date,

902
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,900
she'll have the characteristics
of male family members.

903
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:27,280
He described the girl to be hot,
quirky and fun and she was into him.

904
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,580
She didn't make it awkward when
hooking up. She sounded awesome.

905
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,720
If anything he should bring it out in
the open and teller. How weird it is. Oh,

906
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,460
toad.
I don't know about that one.

907
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,480
Then when they laugh about
it and she does the laugh,

908
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:45,310
they're laughing about the laughter.
Laughing about that laugh even more.

909
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,003
Huh?

910
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,190
Takes his dick out.
I don't see how that works.

911
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm really trying to see your point here,
sir. Hey, I could be wrong. Um, anyways.

912
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:01,680
Then when they laugh about it.
Oh yeah. I already said that. Uh,

913
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,950
it'll go beyond the awkward situation,
become its own inside joke.

914
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,390
Plus if she likes him,

915
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:11,560
that's a terrible way for her to be
rejected just for laughing naturally.

916
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,890
I know you weren't being a Dick and
have to make America laugh, have a week,

917
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:19,030
but I just want this guy, I just don't
want this guy to blow it. All right.

918
00:56:19,031 --> 00:56:20,740
See you coming from a good place.
Um,

919
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:22,723
okay.

920
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,110
Don't you think what you're going

921
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,390
to say?
Okay.

922
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,670
Is going to make her self conscious.
Like I,

923
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,390
I want you write me back again and you
tell me how you're going to tell her. Hey,

924
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,380
by the way,

925
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:41,990
when you laugh you laugh just like your
brother and that weirds me out in the

926
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:43,280
Dick area.
Like

927
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,720
that's kind of what you saying even
though you're not going to be that blunt

928
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:49,670
about it.
Um,

929
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:52,170
yeah.

930
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,370
I don't know how the eff or somebody else,

931
00:56:53,371 --> 00:56:56,040
somebody else right in and tell me
exactly how you pull that off because

932
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,520
everything else you said about the woman.
I agree with that shit.

933
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:03,380
That's just a rough one. That one. I,

934
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:06,810
you just could picture myself
just out in the kitchen,

935
00:57:06,811 --> 00:57:08,970
cutting up some shit for
a sandwich or something.

936
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:11,820
And then she laughs in the other room
and then you just sort of fucking wince.

937
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,630
You know,
she's in there talking to a friends,

938
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:18,230
laughing it up and you just sat in the
kitchen. You talk and he saw how I got it.

939
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,480
It sounds, it sounds just
like Scott. It's fucking,

940
00:57:20,481 --> 00:57:24,720
I believe a block it up,
blah blah. Hey ladies,

941
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:29,550
would you like some cheese nips,
cheese nips. Greetings from Mexico.

942
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:30,601
Um,

943
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:34,380
I discovered you the other night while
browsing Netflix all by myself and I just

944
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:39,381
thought my two team and husband boys
15 and 16 have got to watch this.

945
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:43,410
So we did. I totally fell in
love with you. Smart comedy,

946
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:47,550
great points of view and I really find
you totally educational for teens.

947
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:49,530
Um,

948
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:54,530
did you watch my special or did
you watch a Ted talk anyways?

949
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,560
So if you did decide to either
adopt or have your kids of your own,

950
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:02,700
you're going to do great. Ps. I've
already started to hug my kids less.

951
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:07,650
Let's hope it's not too late. No Homo,
no homophobia here. Lol. All right,

952
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:11,280
look at that.
I got a fan down in Mexico.

953
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,093
MMM.

954
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,570
Yeah. A lot of people telling me
I should adopt. You should do it.

955
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:21,640
You should go out there and fucking do
it. Uh, we'll see. We'll see what I do.

956
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:23,720
I have to say, as I often feel, I'm too,

957
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:28,240
too out of my mind too fucking scatter
brain in two fucking selfish to do

958
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:29,680
something like that.
To have kids.

959
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:30,380
Okay.

960
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,990
Yeah. There's fucking 7 billion
people on the planet, you know,

961
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,600
running out of deer and fresh water.
What the fuck are we doing?

962
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:38,563
You know,

963
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,440
I don't know. Anyways, uh, from
Russia with go fuck yourself.

964
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,350
I ah,
Shit.

965
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:52,560
I almost didn't get that
from Russia with love. No.

966
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:55,860
From Russia with go fuck
yourself. All right, here we go.

967
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,690
Hello Bill.

968
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:58,630
Okay.

969
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:02,320
It will be a strange message.
First of all, I want to thank you.

970
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:06,250
It will be a strange message.
I love Russian. So just
fucking, I must break you.

971
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,890
It will be a message that is strange.
First of all,

972
00:59:08,891 --> 00:59:11,590
I want to thank you for
your incredible craft.

973
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,800
Can I call comedy a craft
and for your podcast? Dude,

974
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,970
I want to compliment you on your
incredible English. Are you a spy?

975
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,240
This is unbelievable.
Anyway, I am from Russia.

976
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,990
Then I have to say that we love you here.
Get the fuck Outta here.

977
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,450
I'll do a show in Moscow.

978
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,030
I'm going to show up with no
money in my fucking passport.

979
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:35,700
Laugh locked in a fucking
safe back in the hotel room.

980
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:37,350
Okay?

981
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:40,720
I'm not going to get rolled in. Moscow.
Moscow was a shady fucking place.

982
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,440
That's the word. It's
beautiful. It's gorgeous,

983
00:59:44,441 --> 00:59:47,470
but you will get knocked
the fuck out in Russia.

984
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,050
Wake up in a vodka plant.

985
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,170
Your job's to put the cork in them for
the rest of your fucking life and they

986
00:59:53,171 --> 00:59:56,140
don't give you,
they don't give you any mittens anyways,

987
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:59,200
even with the crazy things.
Maybe a, wait a minute. Wait.

988
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:02,440
Where the fuck at me second.
I'm from Russia and we have
to say, we love you here.

989
01:00:02,441 --> 01:00:03,610
Really?
It's even,

990
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,990
it even freaks me out when I realized
that I agree on 100% with what you're

991
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:11,380
saying. Even with the crazy
things. Maybe not with all of them,

992
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:16,410
but it's amazing because even we have
different cultures as some may say,

993
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:21,580
I can relate myself to all your topics,
women, marriage, dogs, politics, idiots,

994
01:00:21,581 --> 01:00:24,610
et cetera. Yeah. You know, why
do cause work gear, human being,

995
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,470
all that other stuff is just a,

996
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,820
okay,

997
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,740
that's just all of the bullshit.
So every country is full of shit

998
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,400
except maybe New Zealand,
our country like that.

999
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,140
That doesn't really fuck with anybody.

1000
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,140
He just kind of stay down
there and live their life,

1001
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,083
you know?

1002
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,940
But other than that,
everybody else did just spin it.

1003
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,320
And there

1004
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,770
the leaders just say that everything
that your country is doing is fucking

1005
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:58,260
heroic and you're in the right.
But at the end of the day,

1006
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,520
both countries got a bunch of broads and
the drive and the guys up the fucking

1007
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:06,930
wall there. Um, and whatever the guys
who are driving the women, that's,

1008
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:08,460
that's what I learned.
Traveling the world.

1009
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:09,883
All right.

1010
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:14,220
There's a through line with human beings
and it's basically watching your friend

1011
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:17,670
fall down a flight of stairs
is the funniest fucking
thing you're ever going to

1012
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:19,860
see. I don't give a fuck
what country you're from.

1013
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,150
I don't give a fuck if you're in such a
poor country that they don't even have

1014
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:27,090
stairs.
If he just ran out of his hut,

1015
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,110
stop quickly and it rained and he slipped
and banged the back of his head and

1016
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:33,420
then he curls up in the fetal
position with both hands.

1017
01:01:33,421 --> 01:01:34,770
Clasping the back of his head.

1018
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,480
You're going to fucking
laugh for the whole morning.

1019
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:38,913
Okay.

1020
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,300
Anyways, he says, uh,

1021
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:47,040
I hope politicians were turned off
the heat between our countries.

1022
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,480
It will be great for everyone.
Yeah. Except for big business. Um,

1023
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:55,890
don't believe in all this
bullshit about hatred. Personally,

1024
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,160
I don't have nothing against the
United States. It's a great country.

1025
01:01:59,161 --> 01:02:02,480
What a country quoting
Yakov, Smirnoff, uh,

1026
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,060
beautiful nature and kindhearted people,
fast cars and blues music.

1027
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,640
Lots of problems of course,
but we have them to, uh,

1028
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,440
everyone has nice to see this
fucking guy's enlightened. Exactly.

1029
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,930
Hope you'll come to Russia someday.
You know what's funny is this.

1030
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:20,080
If he actually fucking hates
me and now just buttering me up

1031
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,110
and I go over there and he puts a fucking
potato sack over my head and beats me

1032
01:02:23,111 --> 01:02:26,650
with a mic stand, I'd actually
find the humor in that beat down.

1033
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:30,340
Good day to you and
best wishes. Ps. Sorry,

1034
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:33,070
I've made some mistakes
and text in the text.

1035
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:37,690
I'm still in the process of
learning. I'll fuck you. Fuck you.

1036
01:02:37,691 --> 01:02:40,030
You asshole. I know what you're
doing. You know what's your, your,

1037
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,530
your English is great and you know we
can't speak any other languages over here

1038
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:46,840
that was passive aggressive.
You know what, sir,

1039
01:02:46,841 --> 01:02:49,630
I fucking loved you to that last sentence.
You know what?

1040
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:52,270
Now I think you aren't going to jump
me when I go over there, but really,

1041
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:55,120
you know what? Let me hear it from more,
more people in Russia. If I can get,

1042
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,290
what do I need?
What do I need to go over there?

1043
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,720
Just get me like 400 fucking
people. If you can, you can.

1044
01:03:01,721 --> 01:03:03,820
If you can guarantee
me 400 fucking people,

1045
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:10,510
400 people will fucking show
up to my show in Moscow.

1046
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:12,351
All right.

1047
01:03:12,351 --> 01:03:16,850
And I won't get a pinky sliced off or
any sort of fucking black mart market.

1048
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,990
Mafioso shit going on down there.
I will come over there.

1049
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,810
All right. And like I said, I am showing
up there with the shirt on my back,

1050
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,713
nothing else.

1051
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,210
This is all based on a cab ride
I took when I was in Helsinki,

1052
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:38,470
Finland and I was asking him about
Lithuania and Estonia and all these other

1053
01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:41,290
things and I was like, yeah man, it's
crazy fucking Russia's like right there,

1054
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:44,950
you know, talking about
growing up with the, you know,

1055
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:49,270
all that Cold War shit. And,
and he was saying, you know,

1056
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:54,240
he was saying Moscow is a beautiful
place, but it's fucking shady. He said,

1057
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:57,150
after 5:00 PM it goes, it
gets fucking shady. He goes,

1058
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:58,440
I'm not saying it's a bad place,

1059
01:03:58,441 --> 01:04:02,690
but you really have to watch
yourself after five o'clock.
And it's just like, oh,

1060
01:04:02,691 --> 01:04:06,300
all right. So it's a,
it's like Detroit. Um,

1061
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,750
but there's something about getting
your ass kicked in another country.

1062
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:12,000
It's way scarier because
you have no fucking idea.

1063
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,630
I would think as you're fighting going,
like what if I end up in a Goddamn jail,

1064
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:17,423
you know?

1065
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,310
Yeah.

1066
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,860
And everybody is speaking a different
fucking language. I mean, that's just,

1067
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:25,420
that's just spells ass rate to me.
Um, all right. Cubans in America,

1068
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:28,930
this is the last thing and then I got to
get rolling here. Uh, Cubans in America.

1069
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:29,171
Bill,

1070
01:04:29,171 --> 01:04:34,171
what are your thoughts on normalizing
relations with Cuba in the United States?

1071
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:39,330
Um,
well I think

1072
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,940
honestly, I think, uh, we've been
bullying him for fucking 50 years.

1073
01:04:44,941 --> 01:04:49,230
They have a right to fucking run
their country they way they want to.

1074
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,800
I'm not saying Castro is a
great fucking guy, but, uh,

1075
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:59,090
I don't think what we did to them.
Look,

1076
01:04:59,091 --> 01:05:00,950
obviously they couldn't have
those fucking missiles there.

1077
01:05:00,951 --> 01:05:04,010
We had to get rid of that
shit that I agreed with. But
other than that, you know,

1078
01:05:04,011 --> 01:05:06,950
if they want to be communists than you.
Now, if you want to fucking do that,

1079
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,270
go ahead and do it. I mean,
what's funny, you can go ahead.

1080
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,760
We have nuclear weapons. What are you
going to do to us? Shoot one at us.

1081
01:05:16,761 --> 01:05:19,520
We'll shoot of you when it's over. It's
done. What are you a fucking idiot?

1082
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:23,480
Go ahead. Be a Russian, not Russia. Sorry
to be a communist. I don't give a shit,

1083
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,160
but I mean, you know, to be honest,

1084
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,310
we were trying to turn that
fucking country into a,

1085
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:35,311
a place for us to go there and relax
and go vacation and casinos and take all

1086
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:38,300
their natural resources doing
what the fuck we always do.

1087
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:41,470
And then we deal with
the whole, uh, the, they,

1088
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,720
they don't want their people to be free,
you know,

1089
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:49,850
and I'm not saying Cuba's fucking it,
uh, innocent, but come on anyways.

1090
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:52,190
He says cigars could be in the future,
in the future,

1091
01:05:52,191 --> 01:05:55,880
could become legal in the u s as of
right now, $100 worth of tobacco.

1092
01:05:55,881 --> 01:05:58,040
You can bring in Cuban cigars,
which is hilarious.

1093
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:02,420
It's like fucking three cigars for cigars
or whatever. He said, ah, what would you,

1094
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,420
what would this do to the
size of your human door? Um,

1095
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:09,440
I've actually shut down my humidor
because I was smoking too many of them.

1096
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:13,070
Um, and he said, I know you enjoy Cubans,

1097
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:17,030
but do you smoke cigars
from other regions as well?

1098
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,680
Next time you're in Calgary,

1099
01:06:18,681 --> 01:06:21,860
come in the summer and rent a motorcycle
and ride through the mountains.

1100
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:25,300
If you have time and find a nice
place to pull over for a [inaudible],

1101
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,470
you won't regret it. Oh
Jesus. That sounds great.

1102
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:32,350
Thanks for the laughs and go fuck
yourself. Um, I've actually heard that,

1103
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,680
uh, once they make Cuban
cigars legal in America,

1104
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,330
like I think initially the quality of
them will go down because the demand will

1105
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:44,830
be through the fucking
roof. And, um, you know,

1106
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:49,060
it's a little ass country over here and
we are a big country that devours shit.

1107
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:54,100
So, um, I was actually talking to a cigar
head the other day and he was saying,

1108
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:57,880
if you going to buy Cuban stock
up on them now, because his fear,

1109
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,040
and granted this was just based,

1110
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,070
this was just fear talk from
some guy in a fucking cigar bar,

1111
01:07:03,071 --> 01:07:06,460
but he was saying that the
quality might drop down. Um,

1112
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:11,050
I liked the fact that we're going to take
our foot off the back of their fucking

1113
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:11,470
neck.

1114
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:15,490
I still think we're going to do the
wrong thing down there and try to get our

1115
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:19,180
cheesecake factories and all that type
of shit and just sort of appropriate them

1116
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:22,450
for our own fucking needs.
Um,

1117
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,980
but, uh, I dunno,

1118
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:32,010
there's something fun about the fact
that Cuban cigars are illegal and to

1119
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,170
actually have them and no
way to get him and shit.

1120
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,220
It's not that fucking hard to get
them, but it's still fun. And, um,

1121
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:40,361
you know,

1122
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:43,420
I was at a party the other day and this
guy showed up and with a box of Cuban

1123
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:47,470
cigars and it was, you know,
we was standing outside
and we smoked in a second.

1124
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:51,820
I took a fucking pull off of it. I
was like, Eh, this is not a Cohiba.

1125
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:56,680
And then he'd given me a,
a party gets however the fuck you say it.

1126
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,110
Everybody says it different partake
as part of this is what he gives me.

1127
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:02,410
That series two, which was one of
my favorites. And when I got home,

1128
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,980
I looked at it and it was fucking hell.
The band was the same color,

1129
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:10,840
but the font was completely off.
It was a really bad, bad, bad fake.

1130
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,640
And through that right in
the fucking trash. So, um,

1131
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,260
that's also the fun of it. The Fun. Did
I get a real one? Did I get a fake one?

1132
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:21,441
You know,

1133
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:25,540
there's a lot of cigar people
that go [inaudible] the
Cubans goes virtually full,

1134
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:28,490
can fake well I don't give a fuck
because they taste better than 90% of the

1135
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:32,510
other shit. Um, as far as other, um,

1136
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:38,030
other cigars, yeah, there's a
couple of others that I smoke. Um,

1137
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,440
couple of Nicaraguan ones that are right.
Um,

1138
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,920
but I'm sick of people always
going through these are
better than the Cubans and

1139
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:50,840
then not, they never are. They, they
just don't taste as good as them. And,

1140
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:54,050
um, it's Kinda like, you know,

1141
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:58,880
when you look at cars and they're always
trying to like compare the car to like

1142
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:03,140
a, like a whatever, a BMW or a, this is
like a Porsche. This is like at this,

1143
01:09:03,141 --> 01:09:06,140
it's like, yeah, but it isn't, but
at the end of the day, it isn't.

1144
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,970
Even though I heard BMW's quality's been
going down through the fucking, I dunno,

1145
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,590
whatever at what happened. Let me just
shut the fuck up. I gotta get Outta here.

1146
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:15,710
I got shit to do. All right. A
happy new year to everybody. Uh,

1147
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,730
thanks to everybody who came
out to my shows this year. Uh,

1148
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,710
thanks to everybody who's been not
only watching my standup special,

1149
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:24,440
but spreading the word
about it. It's been, um,

1150
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,620
it's gotten the best response of
any special I've ever done. And, uh,

1151
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,350
getting back to that talent you were born
with and then pushing yourself to get

1152
01:09:33,351 --> 01:09:38,030
better. I've been trying to do that with
every special, um, work on a new skill.

1153
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:42,130
Just I can drumming a new drum, lick a
new comedy technique or whatever, um,

1154
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:46,280
to enhance my fucking
bullshit ideas. So, uh,

1155
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,710
you know, um, I'm really, yeah, I
couldn't be any happier, so thank you.

1156
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:55,550
And thank you for everybody letting
everybody know about it and, um,

1157
01:09:56,510 --> 01:10:00,260
that's it. Happy new year to everybody.
And, uh, thanks to everybody,

1158
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:03,620
anybody who comes out to my shows in
2015. All right, that's the podcast.

1159
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,480
Go fuck yourselves.

1160
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:10,340
I'm sticking with the Seattle
Seahawks is my pick for the, um,

1161
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,930
for winning the super bowl.
And um,

1162
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,340
I'm rooting for Tony Romo.

1163
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:21,170
I want to see him do well and I want
to see him shut all those Dallas Cowboy

1164
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:25,670
fans the fuck up.
That's what I would like the Patriots.

1165
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:27,560
I don't know.
I don't know man.

1166
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:31,610
I think the afcs is once again not as
strong as the NFC. And uh, last week,

1167
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:32,990
this week against the bills,

1168
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:36,470
we had two starting offensive lineman out
and Gronk I think they would just rest

1169
01:10:36,471 --> 01:10:40,480
and Gronk. Um, I dunno,

1170
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:44,600
we got to play the Broncos again.
I might have to play the colts again.

1171
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:48,350
We already played them and we won.
Those are always tough. I don't know.

1172
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,940
I don't have any foregone conclusions
about what the Patriots are going to do.

1173
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:56,390
Of course, I'm going to be rooting
for them. Uh, that is it. That is all.

1174
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,980
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
