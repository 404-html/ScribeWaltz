00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,300
You were with thin for Kate.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,430
Um,

I think it's going to be,

15
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:55,720
I think you're going to enjoy it. You
know, the, you're listening to this.

16
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,810
I think you'd enjoy it.
Um,

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,510
you know what I would enjoy if somebody
could tell me how I can buy a quality

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,780
quality. You know what? Maybe it's
just these fucking headphones.

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,020
Maybe it's just as Jack, whatever.
Let's continue promoting.

20
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:10,810
Knowing that people can hear me,
but I can't hear myself.

21
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,150
And when you can't hear yourself,

22
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,940
how are you going to be
able to open up to others?

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,590
That's the question that we want
to talk about here today. Um,

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,980
it's going to be on November 29th.

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,510
It's fucking going to be on
Netflix. All right, that's the deal.

26
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,350
Let's see what we got here.

27
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:32,830
Let's try to put this in here and
let's see if this fixes the problem.

28
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:37,000
How about this new headphones?
You know, most people,

29
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:40,840
if they were a professional, they
woulda hit pause by now. That's not me,

30
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:44,050
is it not? That's not how bill does it.
Bill just keeps going. And why would you,

31
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:47,980
what do you know? It's still doesn't
fucking work. Does anybody know

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,870
the fuck makes a god Damn fucking
headphone Jack that's of quality?

33
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,380
You know,

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,320
you go down to guitar center
and get fucking by the
Goddamn fucking make sure it

35
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,220
works and then everything
else fucking sucks.

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,640
It doesn't make any sense.
You go to a Lexus dealership,

37
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:09,580
everything's at the fucking Lexus level.
Unfucking believable.

38
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:10,760
It is fucking bullshit.

39
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:14,360
I've been bitching about this for
fucking two Goddamn fucking months.

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,950
You know all the dumb shit that I do with
my life. Oh, the fucking bars I go into.

41
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:22,940
You take one night, you take a fucking
night off and go buy a fucking headphone.

42
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:27,230
Jack did this effort as a family
is going to be a lot of that.

43
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,700
If that's what you're into.
Hey,

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,710
does anybody know where the fuck I can
fucking go and buy some shit that wasn't

45
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:38,540
made in fucking shiner is they're passive
aggressive fucking way to say fuck you

46
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:43,370
to my country. Is anything made in his
fucking Goddamn fucking country anymore?

47
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,830
The fact that this fucking thing,

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,000
I just bought this and then you can
sell this and who the fuck am I going to

49
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:50,834
call?

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,820
Awesome fucking guy in India
who's pretending like he's
here and then he can do

51
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,020
this fucking bullshit. I'm sorry
sir. I'm you feel that way. I

52
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,880
understand. Get the fuck Outta here.
By the way, I know your name is a Todd.

53
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,500
Ah, it feels good to blow out
the lines every once in a while.

54
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:12,530
Everybody over over something
that you totally have power over.

55
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,940
Um, anyways, this is what I
do now. I just yell at things.

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,990
I don't yell at people anymore. I
just, I do. You know, you know what I,

57
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,490
you know what I like when you
yell at an inanimate objects,

58
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:25,980
you feel like it's listening, you
know, cause it never interrupts.

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,680
That would tell you you're
wrong. All right. Anyways,

60
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,810
afis or family is going to be
up November 29th on Netflix.

61
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,440
Please watch it. Also, uh,

62
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,220

benefit tickets going fast. Loving it.

63
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,450

64
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,040

67
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,520
I'm not the headphones. It's the God
damn check. Just a fucking Jack. Bomp.

68
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,250
BOMP bomp bone. I'm sorry. Anyways,

69
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,430
so this week I got to do this, this inner,

70
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:20,040
the Skype interview with this
coffee company. All right.
And uh, I fucking hate,

71
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,090
I hate Skype.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,690
Okay.

73
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,860
I fucking hate it. You know what, Eh,

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
Skypes in and all those fucking things
on your computer that once you download

75
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,650
it,
every time you turn your computer on,

76
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,460
it fucking sticks his fucking Goddamn
face out there. It's like, Hey,

77
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,480
did I click on you?

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,750
Okay.

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,600
Did I click on you?
They sit down and shut up.

80
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,360
I've got this other thing. Right? I got
you. I got this external hard drive thing.

81
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,250
I used it one time.

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,060
Every time I shut down my computer
and turn it back on again.

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,950
It's like that fucking,
you know,

84
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,260
you know that person at the party
when you just sit in there like,

85
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,830
who invited this guy that?
That's what all of those apps are like.

86
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,470
You know,

87
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,000
we need to make sure every time they
turn on your computer that this comes on

88
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,550
and we remind them that
it's on your computer.

89
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,370
Okay,

90
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,551
I'll,

91
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,880
it makes me want to do is eventually
grab that icon or whatever the fuck you

92
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,070
call it and drag it over to the trashcan.

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,860
And my favorite thing ever
is when you hit delete trash,

94
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:22,360
that little poof poof of dust, you
know? Would you like? I'm going to be,

95
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,600
wouldn't it be great if he could do
that to the guy at the party? You know,

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,420
just fucking big paper,
machete Arrow.

97
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:33,140
You put it on him and you poke them in
his belly. He giggles and then he just,

98
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,590
he just disappears and he can get
back to the core conversation.

99
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:37,424
You what happened?

100
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,900
Or maybe you were just sitting there
enjoying yourself in the corner and he

101
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,510
decided that he was going to
be, you know, I'm a social guy.

102
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,860
I'm just going to come up and say hello.

103
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,870
Rather than seeing that somebody clearly
is over in the corner not wanting to

104
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:53,210
talk to anybody. I'm going to go over
there and go fucking talk to him.

105
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,583
You know what I mean?

106
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,040
Okay.

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,240
I Dunno.
I mean maybe that's just a fucking

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,140
white thing. The way we fucking walk up
to wild animals and shit. Maybe we, it's,

109
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,300
it starts at the party by going over to
the person in the corner who clearly has

110
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,780
some sort of fucking issues. Clearly not
a PR person you want to steer clear of.

111
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,970
You got to walk up,
you walk up,

112
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:16,360
you say a low and because of
the rules of society over there,

113
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:19,990
this guy doesn't rip your fucking
head off and then you just, Oh,

114
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:24,160
I think maybe I'll apply
the same annoying behavior.

115
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:28,900
I use it a party into the wild.
Maybe I'll do that. Hey polar bear.

116
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,750
I'm going to come out and
be an open fucking spirit.

117
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,080
Yeah.

118
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,340
He might have, you know, I followed
that uh, discover sharks on Instagram.

119
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,510
The amount of fucking morons
that are so into sharks.

120
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,310
They're trying to prove how not dangerous
they are and they're fucking jumping

121
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:48,990
in the water with them.
It's like he didn't,

122
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,080
you didn't watch the crocodile hunter.
That's what the fuck he did.

123
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,690
Do you think you know
nature better than that guy

124
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,120
do? The way that guy got killed, that
was like a great episode of the wire.

125
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,730
You just didn't see it coming.
You know what I mean?

126
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,880
All those years fucking
with those ridiculously
ridiculously poisoned snakes and

127
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,200
they get snakes and fucking Australia.

128
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,830
That could be take out a
small country with one bite,

129
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,570
the entire fucking population.

130
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,740
And this guy is going over there with
his fucking booty shorts on with aerobics

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,710
socks.
Fucking with these things.

132
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:27,520
Do you think in one of these days this
guy is going to get bit and his shapely

133
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:32,050
Tan calves, right?
Didn't happen. All right.

134
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,580
Maybe it's going to be, I don't know. The,

135
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:37,510
what else did he fuck with
some sort of fucking wild boar?

136
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,100
That's what you thought was going to
get them. Certainly a fucking crocodile,

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,393
you know,

138
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,780
you thought that would get them and
one ended up fucking getting them a

139
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:52,460
goddamned sting. Ray never saw that calm
and that was just like the wire. Well,

140
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:53,480
what's his face?

141
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,690
Okay.

142
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,200
Oh my God, I forgot the iconic fucking
Dick Guy used to rob the drug dealers.

143
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,950
I'm not going to ruin and much
spoiler alert, a spoiler alert.

144
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,640
It's been out for fucking 15
years or whatever. I'm not
going to ruin the ending.

145
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:08,850
But the way that guy,
you know what happens to him,

146
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
you just don't fucking see it coming.

147
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,303
MMM.

148
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,590
I don't even know what I'm talking
about anymore. But anyways, I'm doing a,

149
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,240
one of my favorite people,
one of my favorite podcasts of all time.

150
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,850
This Wednesday I'm going to be
on the Joe Rogan experience.

151
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,780
I'm also doing dice Clay's podcasts,
uh,

152
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,160
later on that day and I'm finally
calling in to spit and check what's on

153
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,920
Barstool. All right.
I'm running the gamut,

154
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,960
the gamut of podcasts that day.
I'm doing Kevin and been on Friday

155
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,540
and that's local out here.
If you live in La local radio,

156
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,680
I'm sure they have an app that you can
download and listen to it wherever the

157
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:51,430
fuck you want to. And then what else?
I got a couple of foreigners tomorrow,

158
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,410
but again,

159
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,140
and now you have to download fucking
Skype so I can do this phone or today at

160
00:08:57,141 --> 00:09:00,170
noon so then I could then
immediately fucking delete it again.

161
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,100
Don't forget about me. I'm on
your computer. We know Skype.

162
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,150
Everybody knows you here.
Everybody knows you're fucking here.

163
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,733
Okay.

164
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,441
Well the one,

165
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:16,441
one positive thing I will say about
Skype as I love the phone ring that Bompy

166
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,300
boom. I don't know what it is about it.
I like it. I like it. Other than that,

167
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:27,070
everything about it is,
it's fucking annoying,

168
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,500
you know what I mean? Um, anyways,

169
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:34,420
how was your Thanksgiving [inaudible]
I already talked about thanksgiving.

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,630
I forgot I did it on Friday.
I talked Friday. What, what
are you gonna talk about?

171
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:42,580
Let's talk about the debacle. If you
are a wolverines fan that was Michigan,

172
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,850
Ohio state,
Jesus fucking Christ.

173
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,220
I was just, that was just a,
sorry fucking, they should
have beat them this year.

174
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,630
They really should have,
you know something.

175
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,780
As much as the buckeyes are walking
around with their chest puffs out is like

176
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,520
you let up 40 fucking points.

177
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,270
I don't know what you're so excited
about. Fucking unbelievable, man.

178
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,220
I swear to God,

179
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,000
if those kinds didn't get that
fucking ridiculous spot two years ago,

180
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,780
it would have been a rivalry
again. Nowaday, they just,

181
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:17,710
they just got the psychological advantage
that fucking gave two years ago when

182
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,340
everybody, I'll let you tie.
Officiating Squad was from fucking Ohio.

183
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,560
I think he got the first down,
whatever the fuck it was. Anyways,

184
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,720
I just wanted a game,
is what I wanted,

185
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,780
and I wanted Harbaugh to win one,

186
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,530
so then he could have the fucking
urban Maya Harbach 10 years war,

187
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,810
but now you know, I dunno. Urban Meyers
got some sort of assist in his head.

188
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,440
Ain't no fucking idea. I don't know that.
So it's just like, yeah, dude, you got to,

189
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:47,410
you got a wife and kids. What
are you doing here? You know,

190
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,100
every time they run the ball for a lost,

191
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,930
the guy literally has to
fucking bend over to his ankles.

192
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,380
He gets headaches when he flips
out and it's just like, it's like,

193
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,980
it's literally a ticking time buds.
It's Mos,

194
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,670
I'm going to say it's unsettling to watch.

195
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,020
You know what I mean? Jesus Christ. But
then it's like, what is he going to do?

196
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,350
Just sit at home with his
sister being pleasant. I mean,

197
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:12,330
the man has to live his fucking life,
right?

198
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,223
MMM.

199
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,270
Anyways, what else? What did we talked
about? We talked about headphone jacks.

200
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:24,290
He's talked about sis in people's heads.
Um,

201
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,040
okay.

202
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,200
Patriots jets.
That was the one football game.

203
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:32,100
I watched that one and I watched the,
uh, watch the end of the Steelers game.

204
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,360
That was tough to watch. Big
Ben. Uh, lose that one. Man.

205
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,250
I saw two fucking amazing
quarterbacks have tough games.

206
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,390
Aaron Rogers had that guy open and then
a big band, you know, I don't know.

207
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm talking like I would have
fucking made the past, but um, um,

208
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,890
so out of it right now,
like I was actually rooting
for the Steelers cause the,

209
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,790
just,

210
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,160
I fucking hate the Broncos just because
they kicked our ass from Craig Morton,

211
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:01,010
right through John Elway.
And I'm still not over it

212
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,900
every fucking time in any to
every fucking time we play him,

213
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:09,870
it's always an away game. Okay. Who's
always back in their horse shoe.

214
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:12,600
Back in the day it'd be
freezing fucking cold out.

215
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,530
It would start snowing and then we would
just get the shit kicked out and we all

216
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:19,110
in every time we played them,
it was just be like, you know,

217
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:23,160
we had hope and it had some
sort of playoff implications
and then that would be

218
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,220
it. That's the old, you know,

219
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,680
that's the old Boston sports fan as
opposed to now where everybody's mean.

220
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:34,670
Anybody born from the ninth,
1990 on is just absolutely spoiled.

221
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,400
Um, as far as being the Paiche
us, uh, a Boston sports fan,

222
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:44,240
which I'm totally fine with. Um,
I watched a little bit of Celtics,

223
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:48,920
caught a little bit of the Bruins verse
the Canadians and um, I don't know.

224
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:52,250
I just had it. I had a great weekend, man.
I really had a great weekend. I tell you,

225
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,830
I think I told you that guys,
this did I tell you I took my, uh,

226
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,610
I told you that last, last week. I
took my kid to guitar center, man,

227
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,444
it was fucking awesome.

228
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,660
God knows we didn't buy any fucking
headphone Jacks and those fucking idiots.

229
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,153
They're not idiots.

230
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,270
Okay.

231
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,320
But you don't need to know why.

232
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,690
Why are you selling shit that
doesn't fucking work. Hey Bill,

233
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,400
why didn't you keep the
receipt and bring it back?

234
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,530
Because I don't want to fucking
make another trip over there.

235
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,970
Okay.

236
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,210
All right. I never take the
receipt. I'm not coming back.

237
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,000
It doesn't fucking work.
I'll just yell about it

238
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,450
rather than just getting in my
car and solving the problem.

239
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,453
Yeah.

240
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,940
MMM. You know, every time I think
I turned the corner as a person,

241
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:35,070
I just realized, oh Jesus,
it's just like this.

242
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,690
There's another fucking storage shed
of emotional shit I have to fucking go

243
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:40,524
through.

244
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,493
You know,

245
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,300
if, imagine if they could do
that with your personality.

246
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:48,760
They had this storage wars with you.
Right.

247
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,540
And they just make you stand in there
as a middle aged person and they got a

248
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,170
bunch of fucking women out there looking
for a partner and they're just bid

249
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,400
nodded, you know? And then they just,

250
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,430
they opened the door and
your fucking standing there

251
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,420
with your fucking dad jeans and you
little cunt belly trying to suck it in and

252
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,770
they're just looking in your eyes and
you're trying not to look away like some

253
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:17,100
wild animals, shit, you know? Then
they start bidding on you. What,

254
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:21,230
what do you think they'd been on
you? Let's just say, you know,

255
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:24,590
we'll make it easy.
A hundred bucks is like,

256
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:27,560
this guy looks like the
winner top shelf Johnny blue.

257
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,250
I want to be with this guy in
zero is this guy's a fucking zero.

258
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,380
This guy's a loser. Everything he
touches turns to shit. You know?

259
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,180
What do you think you'd be on that?

260
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,580
I think the only thing that
saves me is a earn a good living.

261
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,560
If you take that out of the equation.
All right.

262
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,140
I think I have,
I'm in the 30s,

263
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,720
depending on how fucking
crazy your dad was.

264
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,970
I would say I might even drop
down into the 20s. You know,

265
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,830
I'm looking at an emotional lottery pick
the next season. Uh, oh, by the way,

266
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,270
um, you know, I was talking to
[inaudible] and he would say, I was,

267
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:14,320
fuck this guy's name's sake. Saquon
Barkley was just having like a career day,

268
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,010
almost a hundred yards in the first half
or some fucking shit against the eagles.

269
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,780
And then they ran them four times in the
second half and he just couldn't wrap

270
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:27,340
his head around the fact. It's like,
dude, the giants are tanking. Okay.

271
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:31,240
They're not going to make the fucking fit
tanking. You know, the Patriots did it.

272
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:34,780
We'd be in trouble, but they, they're
going to tank people tank. All right.

273
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,740
Indianapolis. They tank to get Andrew
Luck. Peyton manning came back,

274
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:42,760
gay doctor said, I'm good. Oh No,
Peyton, we're worried about you.

275
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,540
Uh, we'll fucking worried about you
than paint goes on to fucking, you know,

276
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,520
when a Superbowl over
there and fucking Denver,

277
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:52,090
I love that you have an
artist said whatever.

278
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:57,091
Anybody treats this superstar
with absolute disrespect.

279
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,090
That guy ends up in Colorado
and wins championships.

280
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:05,770
If he noticed that the fucking Canadians.
All right,

281
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:08,800
this scarf wearing fucking snooty guide.

282
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,310
Damn fans booed Patrick Wall.
I'm going to say this again.

283
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,150
They booed Patrick wa a man,
not only a hall of Famer,

284
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,650
not only winter of two Stanley cups at
that point that Ddi change the position.

285
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,900
You're talking about this a handful of
fucking people in the history of the NHL.

286
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,920
They can say that I changed the position
of Patrick was one of them and what did

287
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:33,250
he do? He went to the Colorado
avalanche at one, not one,

288
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,470
but two fucking Stanley cups

289
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,430
and all of those fucking
pocket square blue blog,

290
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:46,431
a rouge con sport coat where in concept
there has still sitting there with the

291
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,740
course, sign up their
ass, wait for another cup.

292
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,200
25 fucking years later,

293
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,580
Indianapolis Colts tank a fucking season
so they can get Andrew luck with his

294
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:00,450
pate manning go.

295
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,260
Does he try to pile on in San Francisco
and Jim Harbaugh was there and they were

296
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:07,830
one fucking piece away. No, he
does not. Pate Manning says,

297
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:10,800
I'm going to be a fucking man about this.
I'm going to the Goddamn Broncos.

298
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:15,300
Not saying they were bad, but that would
have been a layup and San Francisco.

299
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,141
It's tough to say.

300
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:18,630
It would have been a lamp with Jim
Harbaugh after that fucking loss the other

301
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:22,740
day. But I'll, and I'll put up the
unimaginative fucking play, calling run,

302
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,750
play action. Fake third and
long. Let's throw it. Um,

303
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,000
wait, if fucked his way to
fuck his pate man and go,

304
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:34,990
he goes to Denver and it goes to not one,

305
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:38,220
but two Superbowls gets his ass kicked in
the first one by other playing Seattle.

306
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:38,860
You know,

307
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,680
they were all fucking roided up and nobody
gave a shit cause they're in Seattle.

308
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,560
That's not cheating. You know,
that's a competitive edge. Right.

309
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,560
But he comes back and wins it like the
next year of the year. A year later,

310
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:50,900
I forget which, right.
Another Superbowl trophy.

311
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,750
Okay. So I'm thinking that the
giants are going to tank this year.

312
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,320
Okay.

313
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,840
Then they're going to go out, they're
going to draft the fucking quarterback.

314
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,590
They're going to tell Eli when or
if not one, but two super bowls.

315
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:05,920
Yeah.

316
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,560
Against Bill Bellacheck,
the greatest fucking coach of all time.

317
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,050
They're going to tell him to hit the
fucking bricks of where do you think that

318
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:11,884
man's going?

319
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,250
Okay.

320
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,750
Not The Broncos.

321
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,650
He's going to shock everybody's going to
play point guard for the Denver Nuggets

322
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,570
and they win an NBA championship.
Right?

323
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,903
Yeah.

324
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,130
Um, sorry. Um,

325
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,080
what you're listening to right now is
a man who has a lot of Shitty as to do

326
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:37,880
this week and he doesn't want to get out
of bed. Oh, was I enjoy in my time off.

327
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,963
Okay.

328
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,930
Oh, did I enjoy it? You know,

329
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,910
but I realized I was enjoying it too much
because I was continuing to, you know,

330
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,260
have some drinks, have some cigars, and
what I really realized it was, Bill,

331
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,910
when you have time off,

332
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:57,080
what you need to be doing is drinking
water and getting eight hours sleep,

333
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,270
then you'll actually feel rested.

334
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,630
Okay.

335
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,960
Then the vacation won't seem
like it went by too quickly.

336
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,810
I realized this last night,
the last day of my vacation.

337
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:10,920
All right,

338
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,120
but what I'm going to do is I'm going
to apply the wisdom that I've learned.

339
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,310
I can't even say wisdom because
I have learned this lesson.

340
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,730
I've learned this lesson
more fucking times.

341
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,633
Okay.

342
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,360
Then Ohio state has kicked the
fucking shit out of the wolverines.

343
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,730
Okay.

344
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,330
In the last decade and a half.
Um,

345
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,513
okay.

346
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,550
Anyways, what's going to
happen? Ohio State Urban Meyer.

347
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,120
Everybody's saying he's going
to leave this year. I mean that,

348
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,940
that's not good for football.
You got to me that did,

349
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,980
it was just building
up you now Harpo Harpo,

350
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,490
I has to hardwire has,

351
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:48,590
whenever those smokers had got
my voice cracks the next day,

352
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,370
Harbo has to fuck it. He's got a, he's
got to get these, got a big debt guy.

353
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,960
He can't take his ball and go home off
for health reasons. He Kit, you know,

354
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:02,200
how about give him shit.
Oh, is that it buddy? Huh?

355
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,030
One little fucking cyst and
you're going to go home.

356
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,130
The urban could just walk away going
62, 63, whatever they fucking scored.

357
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,220
Um, anyways, uh,

358
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,910
Jesus Christ. Now what do I do? I
do some reads. Let's do some reads.

359
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,370
That's why I'm reading.

360
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,120
Ah,

361
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,610
read notes on the moon home
a wall. Then. All right,

362
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:35,510
five reads everybody, not one, not two,

363
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,140
like the Stanley Cups at Patrick Wall one.

364
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,750
Actually the Canadians are
playing good this year. You know,

365
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,970
you know not good enough for their fan
base because they expect things I love.

366
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,790
I love when a fan base expects things out
of their professional sports franchise,

367
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,760
but nothing out of their own
personal lives. That right there,

368
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:58,490
that is a true sports fan.
All right,

369
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,940
fine butchers box everybody.
Oh Jesus do I love these guys.

370
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

371
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:13,640
organic chicken and the one
the only never to be replaced.

372
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,870
The the, the, the fucking pork
that changed the position.

373
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,490
The Patrick Wa

374
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,400
okay.

375
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,520
Of pork heritage. Bread. Pork.

376
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,510
Now a lot of you are like me.
Probably Saint Boob.

377
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,510
Well what exactly is heritage breed pork.
And I know I've explained this well.

378
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,940
Guess what? It's so fucking
good. I'm gonna explain it again.

379
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,010
Heritage budge pork is,
is,

380
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:39,011
is murdered pigs that are pure bred picks
that you can trace their family tree

381
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,500
all the way back to Europe.
They weren't over here.

382
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,880
Fucking these low rent pigs here
in the United States of America.

383
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,800
You know that sit around watching reality
TV while eat, eating cotton candy,

384
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:55,910
Thies ds. These are
European pigs. They read,

385
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,120
they smoked cigarettes,
holding the cigarette from underneath.

386
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,480
These pigs can ride scooters.
Everybody not do this,

387
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,020
so it's incredible. It's the best takes
and pork chop I've ever fucking had.

388
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,290
My mouth literally waters when
I read this shit. Incredible.

389
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,910
Incredible quality of butcher box meat
starts with the commitment to raising

390
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:21,911
animals humanely and free of
antibiotics and hormones before they are

391
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:25,370
slaughtered.
Yeah,

392
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,330
they listen to fucking feel good music
and then one day you just walk up.

393
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:32,300
Hey Peggy, look at that over there.
Then he gave me all right there.

394
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:35,870
Fred over cook with a piece of,

395
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,160
with the peace of mind knowing you
are eating healthy, high quality meat.

396
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,070
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

397
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,100
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

398
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,910
Unless you're a tub of shit and you're
fucking gluttonous and you go through it

399
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:50,744
in three days.

400
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,760
Yeah,

401
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,110
it's your choice.
You know you want to have the meat sweats.

402
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:58,000
So you want to have abs.
It's all up to you.

403
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,690
You can choose from five
different box types. All beef,

404
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,620
beef and chicken,
beef and pork mixed box.

405
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,040
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.

406
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,900
Like my new favorite cook did Johnny,
Johnny,

407
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,540
I live on the hill every morning.

408
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,450
I walked down to buy what
I'm going to cook that day.

409
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,210
My name is Johnny and this is what's left
of the Italian American section at San

410
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,730
Francisco. I fucking love that guy.
Next time I go to San Francisco,

411
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:28,900
I want that guy to come to a show.

412
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,473
MMM.

413
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,240
All right, customer. All right.

414
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:38,241

You know what?

419
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,380
I need to learn how to cook cause I tried
to cook it like the pig shit, you know,

420
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,580
or did he just bathes in its own grease?

excuse for wearing ill fitting suits.

427
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,370
Everybody, you know something I just
would just love to mention something.

428
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,500
There is no longer any excuse for
wearing an ill fitting suit. Okay.

429
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:38,180
It's 2018.
I think it's time you fucking gras.

430
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,820
Okay.

431
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,900
Especially when they're available at
such great prices. Highest quality,

432
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,330
lowest price.
Here's how it works.

433
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,020
Visit a stylist at our
showroom and have them.

434
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,030

boys and then one time they go, we're
not, the Beastie boys were Beastie boys.

And then you go back and listen to their
first fucking song. It's like, ah, pocket.

496
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:02,740

00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:44,260
did the person bring the knife there
just in case they didn't quite get to the

577
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:46,240
fucking nerf football fast enough.

578
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,390
Okay.

579
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:48,710
Um,

580
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,070
I don't like making fun of people with
not a lot of money who have to go and do

581
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:52,701
shit like this,

582
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:55,610
but that there's no reason to stab
somebody over a fucking microwave. Is that

583
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,290
okay?

584
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,480
Um, I mean, you can shoot
somebody over refrigerator,

585
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,180
but we're talking to microwave
here. I mean this, he can,

586
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,250
he can get one of those like 30
bucks. All right. Syracuse, New York.

587
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,500
Two men have been stabbed at a
confrontation at a central New York Mall,

588
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:13,190
a mid black Friday shopping.
This couldn't have been about this.

589
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,030
I feel like the violence only
happens at Walmart. Am I crazy?

590
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,860
Allegedly? All right. Syracuse
police tell local media outlets.

591
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:26,861
It happened around 4:15 PM at destiny USA
police and the mall manager management

592
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,270
say the dispute began at May,
at a Macy's store.

593
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,690
It's not immediately clear what
sparked the confrontation. Well,

594
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:36,590
if you're in Macy's,

595
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:39,800
I imagine it's the men department and
they were looking at a couple of button

596
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:40,634
downs there.

597
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,740
A officers found one man wounded in
the abdomen and another man wounded

598
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:48,470
elsewhere on his body.
That means you get stabbed in the groin.

599
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,430
Both are in their twenties and were
taken to a hospital managers just laying

600
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:54,650
under a clothes,
clothes rack.

601
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:57,950
Just looking up at the shirt that was
so fucking important eight seconds ago.

602
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,820
Please say the injuries don't
appear. Life threatening, uh,

603
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:05,810
photos by syracuse.com
and w s why our TV show,

604
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:09,680
a portion of Macy's and another store's
entrance were taped off for a time.

605
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,870
Uh,
destiny USA managers say the statement,

606
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:19,871
the bloodshed was an isolated incident
that that's absolutely unacceptable.

607
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:22,030
There you go, buddy. Make, make, make,

608
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,020
make a strong stand and strengthens
our resolve to remain vigilant.

609
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,890
What does that mean?
That's the statement.

610
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,260
Let's say those were the, all this
is, this is the, of all that. Listen,

611
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,940
those were the only two people
that got stabbed at Destiny USA,

612
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,200
uh,

613
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,200
which it's absolutely not acceptable
to stab someone at this mall.

614
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,750
Okay.

615
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,720
And,
uh,

616
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:58,070
we're now going to try
to really look at people,

617
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,430
okay?

618
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,960
Do make sure there's no stabbing
motions towards another customer.

619
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,190
Okay.

620
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,350
Are we really going to get to the point
in this country where going to have to

621
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:13,580
have a metal detector at a fucking
clothing store? All right, man.

622
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:17,180
Shopping on black Friday at
Walmart has a heart attack.

623
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,700
He must've got to the Billy Best first
and he couldn't fucking imagine his luck.

624
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,510
Oh, Bill. Really? I'm sorry. What am
I, this is a fucking comedy podcasts.

625
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:29,870
They have to make fun of things.
We ain't got a alright,

626
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,540
wham, wham, wham, wham. Bonk, Bonk, bonk.

627
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,800
All right.

628
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,030
A man died Friday after having an apparent
heart attack while shopping at the

629
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:44,350
Walmart. Wayne, sorry. This
is the Walmart right now.

630
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:49,220
It'll take this job and shove
who I worked in here no more.

631
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:53,360
That's my belly back.
She put that damn mother fucker all right.

632
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,940
At the Walmart on the u s to 80.

633
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,300
Okay.

634
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,200
In Phenix city authority. Say where
the fuck is Fenix looks like Phoenix,

635
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:05,130
but it's not. It's Phenix city. All
right. Little geography lesson. Everybody.

636
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,550
All right, here we go. F, p.

637
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:13,551
H.

638
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,110
F. P. H. E. N. I. X. Okay. Phoenix City,

639
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,610
Alabama. Oh, Jim, give me a break.

640
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:27,620
This is probably against
fucking a Bam. A fucking, uh,

641
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:33,150
War Eagle Fan. It's a city and Lee and
Russell counties in the state of Alabama.

642
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,870
Oh, it's almost a Georgia.
It's almost in Georgia.

643
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,260
That's the funniest thing about
Georgia is they look down on Alabama.

644
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,130
Fucking hilarious.

645
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,440
Yeah.

646
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,430
Wait Lot Graham. Shit. We
Polish our boots. All right.

647
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:52,120
A man died Friday after having an apparent
heart attack while shopping at the

648
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:53,620
Walmart on us to 80.

649
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:58,060
And Phenix city authority said the death
during Black Friday shopping was a sad

650
00:37:58,061 --> 00:38:02,620
note to the holiday season. Oh,
here's, here's a, a little side note.

651
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:05,770
As a toddler drowned in his big
Gulf that he dropped, they dropped

652
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:12,190
and whatever, it's black Friday.
This is a black humor. Um,

653
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,430
witnesses on Facebook
expressing their condolences.

654
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:20,020
Russell County Coroner said
Teddy Venable 71. Ah, I feel bad.

655
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,540
It's just somebody's grandfather had
a heart, a history of heart problems.

656
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:25,660
He was pronounced. All right.
So that doesn't have anything
to do with, uh, Walmart.

657
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,770
Yeah, the history of let's lets the
guy had a history of heart problems.

658
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,640
He made it to 71.
God bless him.

659
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay.

660
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,690
I hope for is peace of mind was a
fucking Bama fan rather than Auburn,

661
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,080
you know, just so we had more joy in
his life. He probably was. I bet he was.

662
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,040
That's what kept him going. All
right, man. Injured in shooting.

663
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,610
Okay.

664
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,970
See where we go from here.
Jesus Christ.

665
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,550
All this shows a glock when
you get here. All right, man.

666
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:57,840
Injured and shooting at New Jersey
Mall. Elizabeth, New Jersey.

667
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,490
The waning hours of black Friday were
disrupted and New Jersey Mall on Friday as

668
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:06,810
a man was wounded by gunfire
shortly after 8:00 PM.

669
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,930
That is way too early in
the evening to get shot.

670
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,650
Okay.

671
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,260
What did the guy who got shot
say, I'm actually, I'm actually,

672
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:17,050
I'm going to side with the shooter
on this one. You know what I mean?

673
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,930
You should somebody around midnight
then see now here you're fucking drunk,

674
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:23,340
asshole. But you shoot somebody at
8:00 AM and 8:00 PM they deserved it.

675
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,650
All right?
The man was shot in the wrist,

676
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:32,910
in a hallway between the marshals and
Tommy Hilfiger stores at the Mills,

677
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,310
at Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth.

678
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,553
All right.

679
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,150
The shooter was,
has not been caught in.

680
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:43,850
The victim is not cooperating
with the authorities are right.

681
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:47,090
This is gang related. This has nothing
to do. Okay. There you go. See,

682
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:49,880
you know what's in. Those are really
only just one stabbing at Macy's.

683
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,640
Now the guy had a history
of heart problems. You know,

684
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:55,180
we went there that the fucking,
I dunno.

685
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,610
What did the hedge clippers were
still there? He couldn't believe it.

686
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,810
He fucking had a heart attack. Yeah.
That guy. Yeah. That shit, you know,

687
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,050
get shot in the wrist. Yeah, I'm not what
happened? Yeah, I know. I don't know.

688
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,930
You sit in that booth, a bullet in your
fucking arrested. You not cooperate.

689
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,130
That is gang related. I'm going to go
out on a limb there. All right, Bill,

690
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:17,150
can we get back to the podcast? Wait, I'm
going to make you guys hate that song.

691
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,073
Sorry.

692
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:18,920
Okay.

693
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,430
All right. Let's get to a little, so
let's get to some of the questions here.

694
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,800
All right. Gaslighting.
Hey, Billy. Truck, nuts. Um,

695
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:30,040
I didn't know what that means. I heard
you and Nia talking about gaslighting.

696
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,430
I thought you might find it interesting
that the origin of that word comes from

697
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,790
in 1944 movie called gaslight.
Yeah. Somebody sent this to me.

698
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:37,630
This is really interesting.

699
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,190
It's about a husband that's systematically
manipulates little things in her

700
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:45,130
environment to get her
to think she's crazy.

701
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,760
One example is when he dimmed
the gas lights in the house,

702
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,600
she mentioned to her husband about the
dim lights and he would pretend that they

703
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:57,010
were fine. The wiki
page explains it. Well,

704
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:01,420
longtime way listener and love the show.
I'm going to have to watch that.

705
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,760
All right. Go to the page. Here
we go. Let's read. All right.

706
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,370
Gaslighting. I thought gaslighting was
you. You, you're like blowing somebody up,

707
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,530
you know, saying that they
were better than they were.

708
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:14,060
It turns out it was the exact opposite.

709
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,010
It's a form of psychological manipulation
that seeks to sow the seeds of doubt

710
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,090
in a targeted individual or in
a member of a targeted group,

711
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,430
making them question their own memory,
perception and sanity.

712
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,650
Using persistent denial, misdirection,
counter diction, and lying.

713
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:35,940
I feel like persistent denial,
misdirection and counter contradiction.

714
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:39,330
That's more like, that's more
finessed. The lying is just, yeah,

715
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,870
that's just gorilla pimp,
right?

716
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,760
You just fucking punching him in the face
and attempts to Dee Dee stabilize the

717
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:49,320
victim in de legitimize
the victim's belief, uh,

718
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:53,370
instances may range from the denial
by an abuser that the previous abusive

719
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:56,610
incidents ever occurred. Oh, this
is what your parents always saw.

720
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:59,430
That never happened.
Um,

721
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,540
up to staging of bizarre events by the
abuser with the intention of disorienting

722
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:05,424
the victim.

723
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,220
Okay.

724
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,970
All right.
Guess what I'm going to watch tonight.

725
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:13,140
I'm going to watch that movie cast lady,
uh, guys, a gaslight or gas lighting.

726
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:18,620
Um, well, we called gaslight.

727
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,940
I got to watch that. Anything
in black and white. I fucking,

728
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,970
I really enjoy cleaning
one of my specials. Sorry.

729
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,660
Advice for the fellow cubicle warriors.
Hey Billy Wonka.

730
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,020
Now how did nobody ever come
up with that one? Billy Walker.

731
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:38,010
I recently changed my life by
setting all my devices to night mode,

732
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:40,980
permanently phone, laptop, iPad.

733
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,450
I had the standard headache and I pains
from all these screens in my face all

734
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:50,100
day long. We got to buy those glasses
that they gave me the blue tint on him.

735
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,460
Okay.

736
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,810
Yeah. What do, what do wherever you,

737
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:56,080
it's to the point now when
someone shows me their iPhone,

738
00:42:56,081 --> 00:43:00,040
I kind of pull back cause I can feel
those blue lights wrapping my brain.

739
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,770
I think it's something you and
your listeners should know.

740
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,620
Oh, you said everything
tonight. Oh, night mode. Oh,

741
00:43:07,621 --> 00:43:09,900
so it's not as bright in
your face. Well, you know,

742
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:13,170
it'd be great if you show me how to do
that. I could probably look that up.

743
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,400
I liked the direction you're going.

744
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:18,390
Answer any sort of paranoia is
right in my fucking wheel off. Uh,

745
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:23,040
my first comedy show. What's the etiquette
of sit there and shut the fuck up.

746
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,210
Laugh if it's funny.

747
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,060
If you want to heckle Haeckel but don't
be a obeyed anyways. Hi Bill. Big Fan.

748
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,400
So glad that you're coming to Germany out.
Jesus.

749
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,690
This is somebody from another country.

750
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:39,030
There's no comedy in
Germany on say laughing.

751
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,290
Um, I have just bought a ticket
to your first show of the tour,

752
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:44,520
the one in Cologne.

753
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,280
Okay.

754
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,240
Uh, on June 4th of January. By the
way, I learned the last time Cologne,

755
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:54,520
Germany was one of the number one bombed
cities in World War II and there's

756
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,290
still a few buildings
that survived a big fan.

757
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:58,670
So glad that you were coming to Germany.

758
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:02,780
I have just bought a ticket for
your first show in that tour. Uh,

759
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,830
the one in Cologne. I ended the best
time when I was there last time. Uh,

760
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:09,410
so I'm anticipating it's going to be
another way to show this will be the first

761
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:12,560
comedy show I go to in my whole life.
I moved to Germany two years ago.

762
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:17,420
Before that I lived in Moldova,
a small,

763
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,950
insignificant country that
bright stars don't go to anyways.

764
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,040
Do you think that on one
of your podcast episodes,

765
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:29,030
you could take a minute or two to explain
how these comedy shows go for you?

766
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,830
What does the ideal spectator behave like?

767
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,490
Should I bring flowers and give them
to you on stage? Uh, I, this guy,

768
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:37,170
this guy's going to
heckle the shit out of me.

769
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,980
And how do you get the chance
to meet you after the show?

770
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,080
It would be a real honor
to be able to do so.

771
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:46,980
Thank you all the best to you and your
family and I wish you a great European

772
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:51,210
trucks, a tour. Um, that's it.

773
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,250
You go there, you sit down,
you get yourself a drink,

774
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,040
and then you listen to the comedians.
If what they say is funny,

775
00:44:57,041 --> 00:45:01,380
you laugh at what if it isn't
right? Don't laugh. And uh,

776
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,230
if you go too long without laughing,
then you heckle. I mean that,

777
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:06,670
that's a part of it. I hate to tell
that to, to, to an audience member.

778
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:07,330
But that's true.

779
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,930
And I think that that's one of the
great things about standup comedy is the

780
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:15,220
heckling. It's a great thing about
politics too. You know, it's fun,

781
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:19,090
but it sucks as a politician cause you
can't tell him to go fuck themselves,

782
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,440
you know?
Well,

783
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,240
why don't you raise the taxes in our
county because you're fucking your sister

784
00:45:28,241 --> 00:45:30,070
in that fucking pig trough.
Yup.

785
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:34,750
Hayseed content that gets an
applause break in my business.

786
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,520
That ends your career as a politician.
Although Donald Trump,

787
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:43,550
president Trump has shown that
maybe that isn't the case. Um,

788
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,440
I am so excited for this European tour.
I am,

789
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:51,760
I am clean living Billy until I get
out there. You know what I mean?

790
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:54,910
And I'm not going to fuck it up either
because I'm taping a special in March,

791
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:59,290
I believe of next year. So,
um, I had my last bit of fun.

792
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:04,690
Um, this weekend I am done.
No cigars, no fucking booze,

793
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:09,310
no bread, no cookies, no
chips, no, no nothing. And uh,

794
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:13,270
I'm shutting it down during the, during
the toughest time of the year. And uh,

795
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,050
I feel fucking good about an eight hours
sleep and I'm drinking fucking waters.

796
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:22,410
And this includes right through the
rose bowl because I'm sad to announce

797
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,150
that the,

798
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,320
literally the cornerstone of the tailgate
can't make it this year because he's

799
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,850
got a Gig. Uh, the, the,

800
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:37,050
the five star Chef Jason Law head,

801
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,960
unfortunately due to circumstances beyond
his control cannot be there this year.

802
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,180
And, um, it, it's, yeah,
it's, it's like, you know,

803
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:52,940
he's going to be there next
year, hopefully. You know,

804
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:57,770
who knows if he keeps fucking getting
gigs, I don't know. But this is like,

805
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:59,940
you know,
I don't know.

806
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:03,450
I'm hoping it's just this year,

807
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,590
the fact that he's not going
to be there. I mean, you know,

808
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:08,600
he does his Reggie Jackson impression,

809
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:13,100
he fucking just crushes it
with the breakfast sandwiches
he just made. It's just,

810
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:17,660
it's like a massive, you know,
this is like Derek Jeter retired.

811
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,570
Well, I was, I'm just going to
say he's out with an injury,

812
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,690
so we're going to go easier. I think
we're going to go easier this year,

813
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,060
do it a little bit differently, but I'm
not going to be boozing, um, at all.

814
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,010
I'm done with this shit.

815
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,040
I gotta get myself a tip top condition
because I am not a young man anymore.

816
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,221
And that,

817
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,810
that European tour is a
10 cities in 10 nights.

818
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,603
MMM.

819
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,050
And it's just, yeah. So I'm,

820
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,340
and a lot of those places
I haven't been to ever,

821
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,860
so I cannot go there and fuck up. I
have to go there and be, you know,

822
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,110
I gotta be in my best on my best behavior.

823
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,070
Got To help him not on
planes every fucking day.

824
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,183
MMM.

825
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,261
But if I am going to be,

826
00:48:03,261 --> 00:48:06,440
the last thing I need to be doing is
fucking going out there acting like a

827
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:10,220
fucking idiot. All right. Here we go.
Uh, drinking as a college freshman.

828
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,500
Speaking of boozing, dear
bill, I'm a college freshmen,

829
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,640
freshmen and just recently went to my
first dorm party that wasn't held in my

830
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:21,230
room to hilarious. You sound like me
back in the day. I'm an introvert.

831
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,860
So luckily for me, I got a roommate
who is social and likes to party.

832
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,250
Otherwise I would probably be spending
all my time in my room and not

833
00:48:28,251 --> 00:48:30,890
interacting with anybody. Well, that's
good. Give get yourself out there.

834
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,020
It doesn't mean he gotta be
an idiot though. All right.

835
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,530
You got to drink responsibly.
Actually.

836
00:48:36,531 --> 00:48:39,680
You're not supposed to be drinking
because you're under age. Look at me.

837
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,090
I'm a dad now.
Uh,

838
00:48:41,091 --> 00:48:44,480
I mostly kept to myself throughout high
school and had a few friends but never

839
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,350
really did much with them outside
of school. Uh, because of that,

840
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,470
I never had any alcohol.
I'm not much of a party guy,

841
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:55,460
but I wanted to step out of my comfort
zone. So I decided, decided to go.

842
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:57,870
It sounds like the beginning of the,

843
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:02,700
a really interesting movie. Oh God.
Okay. So you go in there. All right. Um,

844
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,840
yeah.

845
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,670
Hey, this is the thing for all
you young people out there.

846
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:08,470
If you've never really
done something before,

847
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:12,520
the best thing you could do is tell people
that you haven't just fucking own it.

848
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,310
Yeah. I never, I never drank any
more. I'm a little nervous about it.

849
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,600
I just want to go easy. Just give me one
here and there, all lap. But they'll,

850
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:19,031
they'll like,

851
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:23,110
it is when you act like you been there
before and that's when you get in trouble.

852
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,160
I'm not much of a party guy, but I
wanted to step out of my comfort zone.

853
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:31,030
So I decided to go, uh, that
includes even being a virgin.

854
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:32,420
Yeah.

855
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,090
Do you know where's the fucking
shy? Never, never bagged anybody.

856
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,980
It has an APP right

857
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,070
for me.
Help me out guys.

858
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:40,430
Yeah.

859
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,460
Then it began to date.
Have you get, brings people
together. Lets get them laid.

860
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:45,630
Okay.

861
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,140
Just don't go to a hookah. Uh,
I'm not much of a party guy,

862
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:50,850
but I wanted to step
out of my comfort zone.

863
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:54,660
So I decided to go for my lack of
experience. It seemed pretty wild.

864
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:55,880
Okay.

865
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,280
There was lots of alcohol,
mostly hard liquor,

866
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,320
vaping making out and loud rap music
that I didn't know the lyrics to. Dude,

867
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:05,750
you are hilarious man.
This guy's a writer.

868
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,753
MMM.

869
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,330
Really? Paint the picture here.
Being the sheltered person that I am,

870
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,000
I stayed in the corner and
just observed everyone else.

871
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:17,720
I was approached by a few people that
offered alcohol, but I kindly refuse.

872
00:50:17,721 --> 00:50:21,770
That's good. You're a strong person
saying that I would drink something else.

873
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,180
I realized that the alcohol would help
me loosen up. So it was pretty tempting,

874
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:28,310
but not having any experience with it.

875
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:31,640
I decided not to smart
man using your head,

876
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,920
even though I kept to
myself for the most part,

877
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,160
I had some fun and I'm looking
forward to the next party. I am,

878
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,930
I am a pretty small person, 105 pounds
soaking wet and about five feet,

879
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:46,370
seven inches tall. So it wouldn't
take much for me to feel the effects.

880
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,360
Um,
I'm mostly afraid of how I would act.

881
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,240
And what I would say through
your very smart person,

882
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,660
a college is all about new experiences.
Right? So what do you think?

883
00:50:56,661 --> 00:51:01,520
Should I drink the next time a party
at a party or gathering comes up?

884
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:04,970
If so, what advice do you have?
Thanks and go fuck yourself. Um,

885
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,390
I dunno, you're underage so I can't
tell you to go drink. He shouldn't do.

886
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:15,200
If if I how I w I wish I would
have handled situations like that.

887
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,150
I just tell your roommate
that that's the deal.

888
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:18,830
I never really drank
or anything like that.

889
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,670
And I would stay in your dorm
room and just drink a beer.

890
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,110
I would do that. And then
tell your roommate to say,
Hey, can you do me a favor?

891
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:29,930
Just look out for me at this party. I
don't want to do with say anything stupid.

892
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,130
Right. And then on top of that, when
you go to the party, don't fucking,

893
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,130
don't get crazy as long as you got it,

894
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:38,900
as long as you sitting there
with a beer in your hand,

895
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:40,130
you can literally have water in the,

896
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:43,590
in the can for all they know and just
be sipping a, you know, but it's,

897
00:51:43,591 --> 00:51:47,660
it's a very mature thing that you're
already considering not being out of

898
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:52,520
control. So I wouldn't do that. Okay.
You shouldn't drink if you're underage.

899
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,400
You shouldn't. I did. It was stupid.

900
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,700
I got in a lot of trouble and it ended
with me getting fucking arrested and me

901
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:02,390
finally fucking smart enough. Really,
the reality is, is you, you know,

902
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,360
nothing good comes from it.
It's not good for you.

903
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:09,230
It's not good for you health
wise. Um, it's not, it's not good.

904
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,080
It's just not good for
you. Um, you put on,

905
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,440
you're going to put on the wrong kind
of weight if, if you do. However,

906
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:19,310
when you're of age, occasionally
having a beer is the way you do it.

907
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:20,360
If you are mature person,

908
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:24,140
here I am 50 years of fucking age and
I still have to shut it down because I

909
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,940
don't even know how to do it.
Um,

910
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:28,310
so that know that that is the
world that you're going into.

911
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,610
So I think it's good that
you're very cautious. Um,

912
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,090
having said that, there's other
ways to have fun, but you know,

913
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:37,520
you want to meet some women or
whatever, so just fucking go, you know,

914
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,740
it's a strong move. These would
go there and you're not drinking.

915
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:41,750
You know what I mean?

916
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,840
But then it gets weird if you start
talking to a woman and she's been drinking

917
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,050
and then you haven't,
and then she wants to fucking hookup,

918
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,100
then it's this weird
fucking, yeah, it gets,

919
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,590
it gets fucking weird man. Um, I
would, you know what I would do,

920
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:58,640
I would explore the place to other ways
to be social. Go to the fucking party,

921
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,690
don't fucking drink. You know,
you'll be ahead of the game.

922
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,610
Um, and then I would find out the
other social activities. I mean,

923
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:10,610
you're not the only person at
school that doesn't drink. You know,

924
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,670
maybe you can meet some
fucking responsible, you know,

925
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,200
woman have a good time that way.
There's a lot of ways to skin the cat.

926
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,890
And I'm really outside my element
because I was the idiot that went to the

927
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:26,130
fucking party and did shitty in school.
So do

928
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,700
you go up?
You don't have to drink.

929
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:34,170
You don't have to fucking have a beer.
All right?

930
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,860
Depress girlfriend. Just no, dude,

931
00:53:35,861 --> 00:53:39,540
you're totally in control and there's
nothing wrong with anything about you,

932
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,630
anything that you're doing.
And uh,

933
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,430
in a lot of ways you're stronger than
most other people because they're just

934
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,850
doing what everybody else is doing,
which is the easiest thing, right?

935
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,760
And you'll see it in your lifetime when
every douche bag goes out and get some

936
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,730
sells a fucking robot because
their neighbor has one. All right.

937
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:59,260
Depress girlfriend. Hello Billy
blue blobs. Billy blue balls.

938
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,190
Um, so recently I've started
a relationship with a girl.

939
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:04,520
Okay.

940
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,800
And uh,

941
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:10,340
she told me that she needed to tell me
something very important that I might not

942
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:12,950
like about her.
Uh,

943
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:17,150
she told me that she had been diagnosed
as depressed for several years.

944
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:18,051
Mind you,

945
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:22,520
I've only known this girl for several
months and I don't know her circumstances.

946
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:26,360
Is this a deal breaker? Do I break
up with their, should I ignore it?

947
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,080
If I break up with her,
is she going to harm herself?

948
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,160
The situation puts me in a bad
position and I am not sure what to do.

949
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:38,240
I think she regrets telling me because
she doesn't want me to judge her. Also,

950
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:42,020
I am a younger male still in high school
and I feel like I am not mature enough

951
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:44,900
to deal with this situation.
Help us appreciate it.

952
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,823
All right.

953
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:51,500
Okay. Number one, anytime you have a
problem you should never ignore it.

954
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,930
Cause all it does is just get bigger.

955
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:54,563
MMM.

956
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,600
Is this a deal breaker?
Do I break up with her?

957
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:02,980
These are all decisions you have to
make. Um, as far as you breaking,

958
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:06,580
if you do break up with it, is it
going to harm her? He, it's not your,

959
00:55:06,581 --> 00:55:11,581
your responsibility in life is your
happiness when it comes to relationships.

960
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,070
Okay. And if you're in something
you don't want to be in, in a nice,

961
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,260
respectful way,
you sit down with the person,

962
00:55:17,261 --> 00:55:19,870
you tell them you're not
happy that you liked them.

963
00:55:19,871 --> 00:55:22,240
You just don't like him in a
way where you want to continue.

964
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,640
And then you don't just not talk to them.

965
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,760
You can still be friends with them
and stuff like that. You just,

966
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,050
you don't have to be a fucking
asshole about it. However,
though, if, if, you know,

967
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,580
if at the end,
all of this shit,

968
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:37,950
what this person is bringing to
the table is not what you're into,

969
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:40,830
then there's nothing wrong
with breaking up with them. Um,

970
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,750
there's plenty of ways
for her to get help.

971
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:47,790
It's not your responsibility that
she has been diagnosed as depressed.

972
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,283
Um,

973
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,490
okay.

974
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:55,690
But you know, I, I would talk to
her about it. They just say like,

975
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:57,340
you know what? It's what? It's

976
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:58,870
okay.

977
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:02,260
How it makes you feel just yet. I don't
want to just say, listen, I'm not judging.

978
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:07,180
We all got our issues or
whatever. Um, you know,

979
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,770
I would just talk to her and learn more
about it. Learn how is it, how deep is it?

980
00:56:11,771 --> 00:56:14,590
You know, she laid on the floor for weeks
and can't get out of the fucking house.

981
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,790
I mean, you know, I mean, that's, that's,

982
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:19,440
that's a lot to take on as summer
is out there with butterflies.

983
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,340
Fly Swirling around your head. If you're
not having a fucking problem, you know,

984
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,890
it's, it's all gonna be up to
you. But I would not ignore it.

985
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,670
I would just sit down and talk to her
about it and then digest it and then see

986
00:56:29,671 --> 00:56:33,030
how you're feeling about it and
whatever your gut is telling you to do,

987
00:56:33,031 --> 00:56:36,350
I would do, and if it's stay with
her, I would stay with during,

988
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,280
if it's says to leave, leave, but do
what, you know, you don't have to be me.

989
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:42,360
And when you break up with somebody,

990
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,920
and one of the worst things ever is they
don't teach people how to break up with

991
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:50,430
people. Uh, there should just
be a fucking class on that.

992
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,950
And like the,

993
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,470
the masters of it are the ones who can
break up with somebody and they can still

994
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:59,940
be friends with them is an incredible
thing. But, and, but I, and you know,

995
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:04,380
and I think the only way to
do that is if from day one,

996
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:08,340
you're just honest and you're constantly
checking in emotionally about where

997
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,670
you're at. Because if you don't, and
it's going off the rails and you know,

998
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:13,590
it's off the rails and
the other person doesn't,

999
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,860
that's when somebody feels
like they got dumped.

1000
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,720
But if you're talking the whole way along,

1001
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:20,910
the other person kind of knows
what's good, still sucks.

1002
00:57:20,911 --> 00:57:23,970
It's still going to be painful,
but it's not that fucking like,

1003
