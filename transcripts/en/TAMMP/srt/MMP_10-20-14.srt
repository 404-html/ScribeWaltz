1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,140
Hey, what's going on? It's Phil Burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,670
October 20th,
2000 and [inaudible]

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,550
14. How you doing? How's it going and how,

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,240
um, I'm actually in a hotel right now or
a Sunday afternoon recording this on a

5
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:22,830
Sunday after dude,
um,

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,440
out in Santa Monica here.
I know what you think of bill.

7
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:31,100
What the hell are you have fucking staying
in a hotel room out in Santa Monica?

8
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:35,720
I thought you lived in Los Angeles.
I do. I do. You know what I'm doing?

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,180
I'm taking a little stay vacation.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,260
[inaudible] one of the
most annoying things that a
phrases that's come up in the

11
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:46,530
like the last seven or eight
years, stay vacations, you know,

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,910
after the bankers completely
fucking robbed the American people,

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,400
all the God damn money
and then said fuck you.

14
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:55,720
You pay for it cause we're not going to
pay for it. What is how he long Evan?

15
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:59,030
His hair. Sorry, I got the TV on.

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,310
Is that as gray hair?

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,780
Fucking glistening there is as
Grecian formula not working.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,230
Um, yeah. So anyways,
after they fucking robbed,

19
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:14,231
everybody ripped off fucking
everybody and didn't go to jail.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,670
Nobody could afford to take a vacation
anymore. So then they came up with Stevie

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,543
occasions.

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,630
We're finding that more and more people
are doing what's known is this stay

23
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:24,590
vacation.

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,030
Rather than going away and
spending all that money,

25
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:33,080
they don't have that money anymore
because it was stolen from them,

26
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:37,040
from their banker cunts.
But they're too big to fail.

27
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,280
So now when people go on vacation,

28
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:44,920
they stay where they
live. Isn't that cute? No,

29
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,700
it isn't.
It's not cute.

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,610
I'm on the same. That's
why I did it. Um, you know,

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,700
I just don't have a lot of time right
now and I wanted to fucking do something

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,110
and a anyways,
whatever.

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,950
So I'm out here having a stay vacation.

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,940
Um,
I love how they fucking do that shit.

35
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,520
Anytime they fucking rob
everybody have everything.

36
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,890
They always come up with some
cute little fucking phrase.

37
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:13,660
It's supposed to appease
you. Stay vacation. Well,

38
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,700
we earned the money. We went out
and worked our fucking asses off.

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,180
We had the money to go on a real vacation.
And then these cunts stolen.

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,710
I'm really pissed off.
When did she have a stay vacation?

41
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,560
Oh,
that sounds like a good idea.

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,450
All your anger goes away and
then they keep your money right.

43
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,910
And then they'd go out and they fucking
blow it on hookers that you can't even

44
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,890
imagine what they look like.

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,110
A level of beauty that does not exist
for the person on this side of the teller

46
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:48,200
window. Right. Sorry,

47
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:53,070
I'm combining like 12 conspiracy
theories. Um, anyways,

48
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,580
you can tell them getting over
stuff or whatever. Everybody had.

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,680
I got all right.
And um,

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,380
I want just for the record,
I at no point that I think I had a bola.

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
Alright.
Unfucking believable.

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,020
I'm so fucking ashamed of my fellow
man and the absolute fucking panic

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,080
that six people with their head cold
can cause the entire herd to start

54
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:31,670
stampeding towards a fucking cliff.
Got Airplanes.

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,080
Just freaking the fuck out.
You know,

56
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,510
Jesus Christ. People age. All right.

57
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,360
Act like you been there before that,
that take us down.

58
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,930
Well, did it look at
Magic Johnson, that guy,

59
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:56,230
he's in better shape than 99% of people.

60
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,110
Okay,
please.

61
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,150
Some professional athletes going to get
a bulla is going to have to retire and

62
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,890
everybody thinks he's
going to fucking die,

63
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,070
but he's going to have the fucking money.
All right.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,760
I was thinking of the best South Park's
ever when they showed Magic Johnson's

65
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:17,160
cure for aids and he had a blender and
he was just shoving golden cash into it,

66
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,340
blending it up and then
drinking it. Um, anyways,

67
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,010
I'm all over the fucking map here.
All right.

68
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:28,930
Act like you fucking been there before.
All right. It's not going to take us down.

69
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,230
Shit. Hang on a second. Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on. I gotta answer this. Hey Georgia.

70
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,930
Sorry about that. I had to answer
that for two seconds. Um, anyways,

71
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,170
um, that was I talking about. Yeah.

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,860
Okay.

73
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,860
We survived that one. We're going
to survive the way it'll be fine.

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,370
We're going to be fucking fine.

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,610
The great thing about a bola is it kills
you so fucking quickly, Bang, Bang,

76
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:07,500
boom, get gone. You're done.
All right. Over and Africa,

77
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:11,340
when it would start to spread
like wildfire, everybody
just ran into the woods.

78
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,030
You stayed out. There is shit in
the woods for a couple of weeks.

79
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,580
He came back and everybody was dead.
Then you throw them in a pile,

80
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,790
you lit them on fire and he's just
fucking get on with your life.

81
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,290
Everybody running around
like the sky has fallen.

82
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,210
What am I good friends? Paul
Versey. He was freaking the fuck out

83
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,340
dude. Why do they keep
bleeding? People get on planes.

84
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,200
Look, you guys have seen
my shit. You know that.

85
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:44,340
I know that the world needs a good plague.
It needs a good one.

86
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,310
All right.
We're too smart for our own good.

87
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,680
You know if there's always shit out
there wiping out animals and then they

88
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:57,060
survive. Not all of them. A
lot of them die or whatever,

89
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,090
but this day still survive and
then they go on and it's balanced.

90
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,000
Look at us.
We're all over the place.

91
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,340
What the fuck is knocking
those goddamn cabinets around?

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,720
It's probably the broad next door.
This fucking lady next door.

93
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:14,050
I swear to God her in
his stupid ass friend,

94
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,930
they were up at seven 30 in the
morning. Okay, and I'm a morning person.

95
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,930
Believe it or not, even though I
have this job. Oh my God, look,

96
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:26,350
I got the TV on in the background.
He's his fucking no more commercial.

97
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,510
Am I the only football fan
who gets fucking annoyed
with this stupid commercial?

98
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,400
I don't hit women.

99
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:37,230
I don't need to be brow beaten and get a
fucking lecture in the middle of my God

100
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,930
damn game here because one
running back on one fucking team.

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,650
Okay.

102
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,230
Knocked out his wife.
Not during a football game.

103
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,410
Yeah,

104
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,790
he did it in Atlantic city.

105
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,490
So why don't you run that
commercial down in Atlantic city?

106
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,110
Show it on the fucking boardwalk.
So God damn annoying.

107
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,280
You can't get away from it.

108
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,540
Constantly giving you a fucking
lecture on how to be a better person.

109
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,570
I love how they look at
that stupid commercial like
that's going to stop a wife

110
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:09,340
beater from hitting his wife.
Like he's about ready to do it.

111
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,610
And then fucking ice tea,
Yo no more.

112
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,080
She tell where's my money bitch? Right.
And then he's going to be like, oh, okay.

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,750
Okay.

114
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,060
Ah, in everybody's dressed in black, like
they're doing a fucking Beatles album.

115
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,960
I swear to God, I just, you
know, I've got, you know,

116
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:33,640
I thought I was in a good mood. This is
pathetic. Kate. Anybody watched the, uh,

117
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:35,950
Indiana Hoosier game yesterday?
The football game?

118
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:39,640
I can't remember who the fuck they
were playing. It was hilarious.

119
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,980
Indiana Hoosiers like the,
any,

120
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,010
the University of Indiana and I should
say they had like the widest fucking

121
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,810
school on the planet.
All right.

122
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,100
And one of the most racist
fucking states on the planet.

123
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:54,040
And that's somebody who fucking
grew up right outside of Boston.

124
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,450
And I can say that
because I'm a Republican.

125
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:03,250
I just did that with like race
relations. Um, so anyways,

126
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,190
uh,
I'm watching the game

127
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,910
and you know them, they have that classic,
you know, fucking uh, Gene Hackman,

128
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:16,440
who's your fucking uniforms?
It's just white as white can be.

129
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,760
It's as Corny as extreme whiteness is.

130
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,600
But the influence of those disco uniforms
that the fucking Oregon duck show

131
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:34,401
wearing this people literally signing
with Oregon cause they want to wear the

132
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:38,220
uniform.
There's athletes making that decision.

133
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,560
Fucking unbelievable. You know,
like it's a goddamn fashion show.

134
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,880
I like playing football, but let
me tell you something, honey,

135
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:51,990
those helmets are to die for.
There's literally people's siding.

136
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,150
Jai, they're, they're, they're,
they're, they're shining. Their football

137
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,000
lives away to go play with that program.

138
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:03,710
So now everybody's got to have some sort
of fucking disco ball football helmet

139
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,860
now. So, um, I, you
know, I put on Indiana,

140
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:11,300
which is the last fucking team you'd
think would ever change their stupid all

141
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,860
red with the dumb white.
I think they just had the eye for Indiana,

142
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,440
you know,
classic Bamfam fucking old school.

143
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:25,670
Trump owned goddamn school.
And even they had to give into it.

144
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,890
They had to address the fact that they
were losing recruits because of that

145
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:33,920
disco helmet that the
fucking Oregon ducks have.

146
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,980
So they actually got themselves
some shiny fucking lantern helmet,

147
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,390
but they kept everything else.
They kept everything else.

148
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:48,710
Totally like the Corny fucking old school
when one for the gipper like did like

149
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:48,921
the,

150
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,600
even like the texts that they had Indiana
University look like it was written

151
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:55,650
like pre war as something
in the end zones.

152
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,590
And then they've got these
fucking disco helmets on.

153
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,170
It looks like they stole them.
I don't know.

154
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,120
That was a long way to
fucking go to say like, look,

155
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:05,810
if you're going to fucking do the uniform,
you got to go the whole way.

156
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,540
You got to have the flashy fucking helmet.

157
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,590
You got to have chest hair showing between
your fucking shoulder pads with the

158
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,270
medallion.
Right.

159
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,370
Zip Up fucking pants and that no tear
away pants is what you got to have.

160
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:22,340
And then you got to have some hoary
cheerleader. So you got to go all out.

161
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,710
You can't just have the helmet.

162
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,180
Right?
I Dunno.

163
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,730
Anyways. Is it true that like
the cheerleaders on the um,

164
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,090
Indiana Hoosiers like their pompoms are
made out of like a recycled dot clan

165
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:44,370
sheets? Sorry, I'm telling you.

166
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,880
I'm saying that racist people.
Oh, this podcast sucks this week.

167
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,020
I'm just not on my game. I have good
ideas. I'm just not, I'm just, you know,

168
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,650
I've just thought it's
all in the execution.

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,880
I'll tell you right now with the x's and
o's, who all don't read on the board,

170
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,260
I mean the coaches could only do so much.
I mean the coaches coached the team,

171
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,750
but at the end of the day,
the players go out and they play the game.

172
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,340
And if you're not out there,
if they're not firing on all cylinders,

173
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,650
if they're not out there
acting as a cohesive unit,

174
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:12,060
if they haven't bought into the system,

175
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,450
then you know you're going to have
problems and you can get national football

176
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,293
week.

177
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,990
I actually have the packers panthers
game on in the background and a pack.

178
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,900
Is it kicking the shit out of him?
28 to three yeah. No, here we go.

179
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:29,900
He's a little highlight. Sates first.
The lions. Nah, there's a lone pairs.

180
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,430
Are you fuckers here? Beg, beg,
beg scores. All right. 17 to three.

181
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,410
I went to a line, so I'm game a long
time ago. Beautiful feel. Ford field,

182
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,950
great name for it. You know, and

183
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,983
damn,

184
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,540
every time they made a play, a decent
play, they had this awful son of a lion,

185
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,500
roaring sound like that, you know,

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,180
like it was getting prison
rate and it just ended

187
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,390
every time they make a play, watch a the
home game. If you've got the NFL package,

188
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:10,110
watch a lion's game and listen for
every time they do something good,

189
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,090
you just hear, oh, I guess
that's supposed to be a roaring,

190
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,980
why didn't they just buy the rights
of the 20th Century Fox line?

191
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,780
It was probably overdoing it.

192
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,180
Like you've ever watched a nature show
and you see how a lion roars when it's

193
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,190
trying to like say,
this is my territory.

194
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,030
I don't want any you young bucks coming
here trying to fuck my 30 fucking women.

195
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,710
You know Jesus Packer,
fans of fat, Jesus Christ.

196
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,270
Every time they cut to the fucking,

197
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,730
there's not one treadmill and that
God damn state, I'm sorry. Anyways,

198
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,440
anytime they cut to the fucking lion,

199
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,950
okay

200
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,620
now cut to 11 when they show up,
they just, they just go like, Ooh,

201
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,780
we're over and fuck it over again.
I'm always disappointed. I'm like,

202
00:12:55,781 --> 00:13:00,220
that's what they sound like. I thought
they sounded like that 20th century Fox.

203
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,790
Would you just, I didn't
know that they stand,

204
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,560
they're sounding like they're
going to fucking hurl, you
know, like did like they,

205
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,290
you know, those fucking things.
Eight day eating everything shit.

206
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,600
And get a couple of bones in there.
He's like,

207
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,230
I think I got a Yak every once in a while.

208
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,090
That's what I thought it was going
to do. But they were like, no,

209
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,840
it's its marketing, its territory.
Oh, is that what you think?

210
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,810
Is that what you think you're
going to have one be a pet.

211
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,800
So that youtube video the other day
and this fucking guy goes over these

212
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,960
people's House that
have like a pet lioness.

213
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,550
Okay.

214
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,120
And the thing pounces on him
playfully and, but like, you know,

215
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,590
weighs like 600 pounds as like digging
into this fucking guy's dress shirt.

216
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,480
The guy doesn't even have a
t shirt underneath it. Right.

217
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,530
He's fucking walking around like he's
uh, Gabe Kaplan or whatever. Right.

218
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,320
That's Clark Gable split meant to
say. Right. And um, he fucking,

219
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,320
it's digging into his back,
which causes him to cry out,

220
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,170
which excites the Predator in the wild
animal and it's fucking hilarious.

221
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,970
Cause like when wild animals,
yeah,

222
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,500
like they get excited causes them
to just fucking snap your neck.

223
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,190
Like you have to know like dog toys,
you know, those little squeaky dog toys.

224
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:12,250
And all that. Do you know why they
squeak? It's not cause it's cute.

225
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,560
Is it supposed to excite the Predator in
them, which gets them to play with it?

226
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,990
It's supposed to sound like
a fucking animal dying.

227
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,680
And you know when they pick it up,

228
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:25,030
when they shake it around and shit in
your laugh and thinking always play it.

229
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,060
He isn't, that's their natural
instinct. When they grab something,

230
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,090
they shake it like that and it
breaks the neck of the prey.

231
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,510
But we've pretty much
bred that out of all dogs.

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,530
So they just sit there in the corner
with that stupid look on their face.

233
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,790
But every once in a while you get, I'm
one of those squeaky toys and you see it,

234
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,860
you see it in their eyes again.
You know,

235
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,100
it's like when I was in that Italian
restaurant in San Francisco and a time,

236
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:52,460
and I look over and I saw Joe Montana
sitting there on a double date,

237
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,690
right? The fucking Joe
Montana and I got up to leave.

238
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:01,670
And as I walked out, you know, it was like
a crew of like five of us or whatever.

239
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,530
So there's motion and the restaurant.

240
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:07,340
He looked over at us and I was looking
at him and he looked at me and my fucking

241
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:11,510
stomach dropped cause he still
had that look in his eye. You know

242
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,060
that two minute offense, I'm going to cut
your fucking hard out. He can't help it.

243
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,720
He's sitting there with a fucking risotto
in front of him and he still has that

244
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:24,020
look in his face. Every once in a
while you get a little squeaky toy.

245
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,150
You put it in front of
your dog and you'll see it.

246
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:30,500
I don't care how little foofy
little prissy dog you have.

247
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,340
You give that thing a little fucking
chew toy that's squeaks. You Watch it,

248
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:38,450
fucking shaking it around and the
owner's going, oh look at that.

249
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:41,550
She thinks she's big. She thinks she
doesn't understand that smell she had.

250
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:44,820
See she takes on all the big dogs
and whatever. It's like, sweetheart,

251
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,250
she's not cute right now.

252
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,420
She's trying to kill something and
she doesn't even know she's doing it.

253
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,160
It's just in her fucking DNA.

254
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,160
She's trying to break the neck
of that fucking thing. All right.

255
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,470
Put some shoes on. Um, anyways. Yeah.

256
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:04,370
So there's broad next door, right? I mean,

257
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,670
just the stereotypical,
awful fucking female talk.

258
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,700
The kind of thing that if I
actually did it in my act,

259
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,580
I would once again be branded a sexist.
Okay.

260
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,340
Which I'm not even
saying I'm not all right.

261
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,610
The definition of the word, by the
definition of the word, I think I am,

262
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,860
I mean, basically in this, uh,

263
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,010
in this climate and this culture,

264
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,510
I think basically if you publicly call
women on for anything at this point,

265
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,980
then you're a sexist because it no,

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,590
no point could they ever be
doing something wrong. Right.

267
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,520
I mean, they're human beings.
They're just as good as us.

268
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,880
Unless they're doing something wrong.
If they do something wrong,

269
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,860
you call them out on it thing.

270
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,320
You're obviously a sexist and you don't
think that they should be allowed to

271
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:53,090
vote.
Correct.

272
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,870
I mean that seems how the math
works in comedy clubs anyways,

273
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,470
so I'm such a cunt this week,

274
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,540
so I'm fucking sitting there and this
fucking woman is talking to this other

275
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,720
woman and that literally
just talking about shit,

276
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,340
not literally shit but just like stuff,
stuff that they bought.

277
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,340
I got static newest trends. Yap. Was it
good deal till at that at bat the bat,

278
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,030
Sheila's Blablabla Blah Blah Blah
Bell-to-bell Blablablabla Blah pocketbook.

279
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,030
Like the level of fucking excitement that
they had for that was the same level I

280
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:31,550
have when I talked to Versie
when like the NFL season,

281
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,230
week one is about to begin
equally fucking stupid.

282
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,140
Equally not worth getting excited about.

283
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:44,000
But because I can't relate to it,
I have to make fun of it.

284
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,560
You know, kind of just killed my whole
point of view there. But you know,

285
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:52,430
whatever the fuck you want. So
anyways, so I'm staying at this hotel

286
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,890
and Lo and behold, oh there we go. Down
the sideline. Not that darn has 25,

287
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,690
um, green bay packers just kicking
the shit out of the panthers.

288
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,630
This cannot be Cam Newton's fault. Cam
knew it looks like a fucking superhero,

289
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,870
you know,
he looks like a war hero,

290
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:15,740
a quarterback and an astronaut all at
the same time. So it can't be his fault.

291
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,220
I'll tell you,
I got to blame that on offense of line.

292
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:21,770
I don't care how good you are
at the quarterback position,

293
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:26,670
you cannot play if you laid on your
back 60% of the place bike. Oh,

294
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,320
absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
Boy, you know what, when it
comes down to it, you know,

295
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,830
you held out for a bigger car,
tractor jar,

296
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,170
you know you're going to get
all the glory and old criticism.

297
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,030
Sherif he said high ankle sprain,

298
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,460
touchdown packers. Jesus Christ
has got to be 35 to three year.

299
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,580
Hey, you know, I don't know that this
is actually a movement in the NFL,

300
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,360
but according to Paul Versey
from the Versie effect,

301
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,840
there's discussions about
getting rid of the extra point.

302
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,933
MMM

303
00:18:59,540 --> 00:18:59,990
inverse.

304
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,990
He's claiming it's so fucking stupid
because 99.9% of them are made and it's

305
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:10,890
just a big fucking waste of
time. Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

306
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:11,730
blah. Blue. I mean,

307
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,200
I just fucking blows my mind
that a guy who loves the de,

308
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,400
the NBA,
right,

309
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,930
can watch a fucking NBA game with the
final two and a half to four minutes,

310
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:25,590
can take as much as 45
to 50 fucking minutes.

311
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,103
Okay.

312
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,230
That this fucking guy gives a fuck about
a play that takes 30 seconds and takes

313
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,360
no time off of the clock.

314
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,490
You know,
I love the extra point.

315
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,370
I love that play for the simple fact I,
this isn't even my opinion.

316
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,590
I just, somebody else said this
and I totally agree with it.

317
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,610
It's the one thing that really happens
on a football field that people in the,

318
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,960
if you fuck it up,

319
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,830
people in the crowd legitimately can
get mad because who can't make it?

320
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,570
Like most of the people in the crowd,
if you'll remotely in shape,

321
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:10,080
you can make an extra point.
So when they miss one,

322
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,260
it's like,
how the fuck did you miss that?

323
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,080
And then at what I love is
whenever you miss an extra point,

324
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,150
it always seems to be
like you lost by one.

325
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,240
I'll tell you those extra points.
Don't Miss Texta points.

326
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:27,820
He'll come back to haunt you. I
fucking love the x deploy. All right.

327
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,710
Keep it in the God damn game.
They got rid of the extra point.

328
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,950
That'd be like the American league
with the fucking Dh rule. Okay.

329
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:40,650
Have the pitcher hit well, it's
a fucking waste. It's an uh,

330
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,520
you know, this is a picture is
always strikes out. Anyways.

331
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,080
What the fence, the fun
thing of game. I like it.

332
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,850
It also keeps the pitcher fucking honest.

333
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,590
You're going to go out there and
throw it somebody who's head.

334
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,900
Then you got to go up.
You've got to come up to bat.

335
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,360
How much more fun would have been to watch
Roger Clemens pitch if he also had to

336
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,390
hit?
Do you remember when he fucking threw it?

337
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:06,690
Mike Piazza and then they finally
played the mets in Shea Stadium.

338
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:09,360
He had to come up to bat.
Do you remember how we went up to bat?

339
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,550
He went up to bat with nothing
other than a batting helmet.

340
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,210
He went up there like a man after
thrown in people's heads for 20 years.

341
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:22,740
He didn't give a fuck. He
was so roid it up. Bring it,

342
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,890
hit me in the head. It'll make me
throw harder the next day. And he,

343
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:29,580
she need to have on batting gloves.
He just walked up there.

344
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,600
His big roided up Texas ass in the
fucking pitcher threw at him and he missed

345
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:37,710
him. Amen. At his hips.

346
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,870
I don't fuck do you miss something
like that? You know what I mean?

347
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,710
There's gotta be like fucking
up cow tipping, right? You
can't hit Roger Clemens,

348
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,120
all that text message mex in his belly
and all those roids in his fucking ass.

349
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:59,790
You can't hit this guy.
It's unbelievable. Actually.

350
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,390
He was acquitted of it. So I shouldn't say
that. Right. I can't even say a legend.

351
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:07,290
Now,
can I accused steroid user,

352
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,540
Roger Clemens?
I remember when I lived in New York City,

353
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,910
every fucking two weeks it seemed
they did. Uh, they did, uh,

354
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,750
before he got busted or accused,
um,

355
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,440
they used to do a fucking local
news piece on Roger Clemens,

356
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:27,380
workout a routine. It was perfect
because then when people go,

357
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,490
going like, dude, you just
see his, uh, I, you know,

358
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:32,070
I think that guy's doing roids so that
guy's on roids and everybody would be

359
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:36,150
like, dude, you see how much guy
fuck a workshop? It was perfect.

360
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:40,590
His people put that out there first.
You know, if they're in the locker room,

361
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:43,750
they know people are going down. They
know people are going to get busted. We,

362
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,360
we got to get out in front of this thing.

363
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,160
Let's do some pieces on how much you
work out. [inaudible] all this shit up.

364
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,870
He's stolen.
He's the one squats everything,

365
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,640
whatever. Alright, hang on a
second. I apologize. This is rude.

366
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,240
Jesus Christ that was actually going to
tweet that I was fucking sick, you know,

367
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,230
and make a joke about it,

368
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:16,730
but I didn't want to listen to everybody's
fucking hacky of Bulla jokes when I

369
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:19,970
had my own anyways. You
know? So anyways, I,

370
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,530
I'm staying at this hotel and you know,
when I'd be staying in a hotel,

371
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,670
they have to have a fucking steam, a
steam room. Right? Well, you know what,

372
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:29,600

moisture away from your skin

I'll see. You know they're good
and they are completely natural.

422
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,620
How they also use a o neutral process
with a low carbon footprint. Good.

423
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,120
I was going to ask them if they did that.

424
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,560
They save water and energy due to
their spun dried fiber process.

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,030
It's going to say it's creepy. How do
they have photos of you in your undies,

429
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:51,420
your undies?
How did you get those photos?

430
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,830
Did you hack by fucking phone? All
right. Check out the photos yourself.

431
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,800
Me undies.com.

432
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,420
This quality would typically retail
for two times the me undies price.

433
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,510
No retail middlemen means
more savings to you.

434
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,820
Here I will make it easy for you.

441
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:29,850
Sorry the coffee got cut off anyways,
it's me undies. Mandy's snow,

442
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:32,790
more sweaty balls. All right. There
you go. Get yourself some underwear.

443
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,150
They'd cut your fucking balls the
way they need to be. All right,

444
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:39,500
stamps.com everybody,
uh,

445
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,830
getting your mail and shipping done
can seem like a no win situation.

446
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,260
Go to the post office.
Takes up valuable time.

447
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:49,080
Leasing a postage meter is
expensive with a multilayer,

448
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,110
multiyear commitments and hidden fees.
It's all a bunch of BS.

449
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,350
You don't want to deal with it.
Well, luckily I know a better way.

450
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,880
It's called stamps.com.

451
00:27:56,881 --> 00:28:01,881
Everybody buy and print
official US postage for any
letter or package right from

452
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:06,150
your desk using your own
computer and printer, uh,

453
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,850
even get special postage just counts.
You can't find it.

454
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,870
The post office plus stamps.com is more
powerful than a postage meter at just a

455
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,160
fraction of the cost.

456
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:18,810
You can save up to 80% compared to a
postage meter and you'll avoid those time

457
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:23,580
consuming trips to the post office. I use
stamps.com to send out my posters, my,

458
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,360
my, uh, my twizzle sticks, whatever
crap I'm selling at the end of my show,

459
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,780
I can figure out stamps.com I am a
moron. If I can do it, then God damn it.

more. Everybody hang in there. Evil voice,

466
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,400
everyone.
I love the flexibility.

467
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,510
Flexibility that owning your own
business provides. Look at me.

468
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,180
I've created an empire with Dick Jokes,

469
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,870
but when it comes to handling business
calls, you're stuck with the challenge.

470
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,220
Either hire a full time receptionist
that you bang and then ruin your marriage

471
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,110
or handle all your calls yourself.
It's a lose lose situation there.

472
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,330
That's why I love III voice.

473
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,130
They'll set your business up with a toll
free number and a local number when a

474
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,420
cost.
When customers call,

475
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:31,530
they're greeted professionally by a
virtual receptionist. She's not there.

476
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:35,400
Everybody and she will route all
your calls to wherever you are.

477
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,530
There's even a dial by name directory.

478
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:40,620
You'll sound like a fortune 500
company and more importantly,

479
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:45,320
you'll never an important call for all

481
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,220

482
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,600
Okay.

483
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,820
Draft Kings.
The final one here.

484
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,300

cash prizes every week@draftkings.com and

486
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,250
How do you do it?
Well,

487
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:10,370
I'm going to tell you a draft kings
is America's favorite one week fantasy

488
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:13,850
football site.
One week fantasy means no season.

489
00:30:13,851 --> 00:30:17,660
Long commitments play whenever you want.
Gotten an inch a pro player,

490
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,680
not a problem at draftkings where it's
like a new season every week so you're

491
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:23,240

Pick your team and minutes and you
could be on your way to instant cash.

493
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,980
Last year, one player turn
11 bucks and the four grant,

494
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,911
another one,

495

a hundred gram and his first time ever
playing and another player won a million

496
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:37,280
bucks in one day.

497
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,240
A bunch of other people lost their shirts
so they could pay these people out.

498
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:44,000
But you don't look at it that way.

505
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,623
Okay.

506
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,460
All right.
And we are back.

507
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,430
We are back. I don't have the advertising
yet, so I got to edit that in.

508
00:31:17,431 --> 00:31:21,600
I hope that came back smoothly. Um, yeah,

509
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:26,450
so I go downstairs to take
a steam, right. And uh,

510
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,910
I walk into the steam room.
There's nobody in there.

511
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,423
All right.

512
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,410
Thumbs up. Number one. It's early in the
morning. So a lot of times they don't.

513
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,170
You might be the first one down there.
So the steam is an odd,

514
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,950
which sucks because you've got to wait
like 20 minutes for it to fucking heat up.

515
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,570
I walked to the steam. It's fucking, not
only is it on, it's cranking. All right.

516
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,490
Thumbs up number two. So I
fucking, you know, I get ready,

517
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:55,670
I bring my own fucking flip flops.
Okay.

518
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,130
Cause you cannot walk around
in that slime barefoot.

519
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:00,860
God knows what the fuck's going to
be grown on your feet the next day.

520
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,060
And I'm not using people's,

521
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,780
the flip flops that they give you because
I don't know how well that they wipe

522
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:08,490
it out. Okay. Think about that.

523
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:13,491
That's somebody's job to fucking clean
off the fun Gal free slippers at a spa.

524
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,003
All right.

525
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,430
I don't want to judge anybody
who listens to this podcast,

526
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:23,520
but there's no way you dreamed about
doing that job when you were a child.

527
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,430
So I would imagine if you get that job,

528
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,570
you're not exactly exactly like enthused
about doing that fucking job. Right.

529
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:33,840
So what I'm saying is, is probably a lot
of bullshit that's left behind. Hence,

530
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,490
I bring my own fucking flip
flops. Um, and I haven't,

531
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:39,090
where the fucking,

532
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,210
you've got the thing that fucking goes
all the way across your foot. Dot.

533
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,150
That stuck between your toe. So it
goes full flip per flat, per foot,

534
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,890
flat on the bottom of your feet and
you know the shit out of somebody.

535
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:53,370
All alright, I'm courteous. All
right, so I got my flip flops on.

536
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,900
I got my towel and I got another towel
to wipe off the fucking sweat when I'm in

537
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:01,050
there, right? All the toxins and I
fucking go to the goddamn steam room.

538
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,950
I fucking the steam thing,
right? I open it up,

539
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,540
I go inside and immediately sitting
right next to the door. Is it dude?

540
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:11,640
Completely fucking naked once again.

541
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,640
Right dick out for fucking days.

542
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:18,140
Just sitting there and you know,
I'm just getting in there.

543
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,420
My eyes are getting adjusted.
Some like, okay, you know,

544
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:27,630
I can naked guy nine o'clock and now
like how big is this steam shower?

545
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,330
How many fucking people are in there?

546
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:34,020
I'm feeling my way through here and
I'm walking away from this guy in his

547
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:38,190
fucking schlong. And so I'm taking
like baby steps as I'm walking through,

548
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:39,590
kind of feeling my way in.

549
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,230
And this guy's opening fucking line to me.

550
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,380
First words out of his mouth.
You know what he says?

551
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,840
He says it's just us.

552
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,450
Oh my God. If it wasn't so creepy,
I would have burst out laughing.

553
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,400
It's just like, really that that's
you coming out of the gate with that.

554
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:08,030
That is so creepy and fucked up.
I almost have to applaud it.

555
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,020
It's just us.
Oh my God.

556
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:16,950
So then he goes, you want me to warm it
up more, right as I sit down? I'm like,

557
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:19,800
yeah, sure. You know, staring
down at my fucking sandals.

558
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,910
So we fucking stands up.
I don't know what he did.

559
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,980
I don't know what the Knob or he threw
some water on it. He just goes, he goes,

560
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:32,130
watch your feet. And I said,
I'm cool. I got sandals on.

561
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:34,200
I didn't know what the fuck he was
talking about, but the steam comes out,

562
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:38,900
you gonna burn your feets. We
fucking cranks to think all right.

563
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,690
Okay.

564
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,830
Yeah.
Now it's like hot as fuck,

565
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:45,160
but it's great because it creates like
this cloud where I can't see him anymore.

566
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,200
So now, now it's great. There's like
this divide or a steam. So you know,

567
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,660
I don't have to sit there
staring at my feet. Right.

568
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,470
And then after about like 90 seconds to
steam starts to dissipate and as it does

569
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,150
appearing out of the mist,

570
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,900
the guy is standing up in the shower.

571
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,370
Like if you took a picture of
somebody like mid jumping Jack, Jack,

572
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:11,260
except his feet were
on the fucking ground.

573
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:13,930
He was standing there like arms outside,

574
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,410
like doing this like heavy breathing
and shit. And it's just like,

575
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,360
I don't know what I don't know.

576
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,660
Okay.

577
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,640
I like to think I'm not homophobic.

578
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,030
I'm not homophobic in the
sense of I don't give a fuck.

579
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,120
Okay.

580
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,610
You know, I don't give a shit. You know,
if that's what you went to g, you know,

581
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:31,860
God bless you or whatever.
But as that homophobic take,

582
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,870
when I'm sitting there like when
there's a fucking guy like that clinic,

583
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,750
what are you doing?
Why don't you just fucking bend over,

584
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:44,320
grab your fucking ankles while you're
at it. What's wrong with you? Sit Down,

585
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,330
you sitting in steam,
the steam is going to get you.

586
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,880
You don't got to stand up.
And what are you doing?

587
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,080
What the fuck are you doing?
Set Out.

588
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,180
How about some fucking etiquette, you
know? Oh, maybe I'll, you know what, Hey,

589
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,030
whatever, I'm open to
change. Maybe I'm wrong,

590
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,070
maybe I should have stood up
and just face the guy in it.

591
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:12,220
Started mimicking his fucking
actions, right? And then, and then,

592
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,380
then do I pass the test?

593
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,980
Jesus fucking Christ so that he leaves.

594
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,640
Thank God he fucking leaves. You
know, and I just start, you know,

595
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,340
laughing and then I have to fake like
I was coughing just in case you get to

596
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:31,500
hear me,
cause it was echo in there and uh,

597
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,100
he fucking goes, uh, and then
I look and I see his hotel key.

598
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,080
There's locker key is still there as,
oh my God,

599
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:42,610
fuck this guy's coming back or whatever.
So whatever. So he comes back in, um,

600
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,470
you know, sits down, like
to get wet leaves. Fucking
doesn't even take his towel.

601
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,920
Just walks out naked as a fucking
Jaber just walking around,

602
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,780
right?
So he comes back in.

603
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:01,610
Now I'm done. So I was like, all right
man, have a good day. And he's like,

604
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:06,350
all right, thanks. So I leave right
immediately. Go into the shower,

605
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:10,670
ice cold fucking shower,
close up the pores, you know,

606
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,530
wash away all this shit. You sweat
it out. You know, Big Bang Boob.

607
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,610
And I'm thinking, all right,
no more naked guy. I'm good.

608
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,820
I get out of the shower.
Who's staying?

609
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:25,670
And they over by the lockers
fucking naked as hell. Dick out.

610
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:30,620
Save fucking guy.
Okay,

611
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,540
now once again, baby, I'm
homophobic. What is this guy doing?

612
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:41,830
What is his fucking obsession with
just being in my line of sight with his

613
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:46,930
fucking junk? Look, you were there first.

614
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:52,090
You're naked in the fucking steam and good
on you, but I show up. All right? Hey,

615
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:54,790
how you doing? Whenever you throw
a fucking towel, cover yourself.

616
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:57,580
You fucking animal, right? He
doesn't want to do it. All right.

617
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:59,740
He's naked in the steam room guy.
Fine.

618
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,440
Then he walks out without a
fucking towel on, you know,

619
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,630
he doesn't give a fuck. He
comes back. Then I leave,

620
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,600
stay in the fucking steam
room and put a fucking towel.

621
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:18,000
You guys walk around like, is this
house? Why don't you just take a dump?

622
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,190
Right. I was just Adam. I
Dunno. I Dunno. You know,

623
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:24,510
I don't want a lot of you guys just say,
well bill,

624
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,270
why do you keep taking those
fucking Steve? Cause I like to,

625
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,080
it's one of the perks of those other
have double the, the fucking hotel.

626
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,000
There's always somebody is
going to fuck it up, right?

627
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,690
There's always going to be the guy
with his deck out the steam room.

628
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,860
There's always going to be somebody's
pain in the hotel pool, right?

629
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,580
There's always gonna be somebody down
at the hotel bar that can't handle their

630
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:48,460
liquor and either pukes just
starts to fucking fight.

631
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,020
There's always just going to be
that guy. And this is why, you know,

632
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:57,310
like when you see lifestyles of
the rich and famous, you know,

633
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:00,400
and they're always doing that shit.
They have their own movie. They attack.

634
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,320
They have their own bowling alleys.

635
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:07,380
That's because they have the money to not
deal with the guy with his dick out in

636
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,374
the steam room.

637
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,520
They have their own money to not deal
with the person who can hold their fucking

638
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:16,780
alcohol. You know, if anybody's going to
pee in their pool, it's going to be them.

639
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,630
You know,
they got the money

640
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,070
to basically just exit

641
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:31,060
the society and I understand
the older I get, Jesus Christ,

642
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:33,100
look at Saint Louis,
Pete and Seattle

643
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,240
at the Fuck Outta here.

644
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,600
I don't see this whole up.
Oh my God,

645
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:46,780
Pete is going to beat his family dog
tonight. If they fucking lose this one,

646
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:50,320
they lost last week to the,
to the cowboys. It's so,

647
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,820
this is what it's so fucking hard to
repeat his super bowl champion because the

648
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:57,910
second you win the fucking thing,
every coach

649
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,990
on like the team immediately
thinks that they're a head coach.

650
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,100
They're not the best defensive
coordinator in the game that year anymore.

651
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,270
Now there are fucking head coach,
right? The offensive coordinator,

652
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,270
defensive coordinator, both of them,
I don't even know if they lost them,

653
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:16,460
but it's inevitable they're going into,
if they don't lose them this year,

654
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:20,270
they'll lose them within a couple of
years. I was under Pete Carroll and uh,

655
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:24,170
you know, now I know shit, right?
That's what happened to the Patriots.

656
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,110
Charlie Weis, Romeo,
Krummel, all of those guys,

657
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:29,810
that fucking baby face kid
who's back coaching with us,

658
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,130
he got a head coaching job at,
I'm in Denver.

659
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,930
Romeo chromal got fucked.
He went to Cleveland.

660
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,460
Charlie Weis got a head coaching job and
Notre Dame and then all your players,

661
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:43,300
you know,
you've got to have a couple,

662
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:44,740
two or three that are
going to take the money.

663
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,310
Maybe they feel like their body's breaking
down or they don't feel like they're

664
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,150
getting it.
They got respected for them,

665
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,550
their part in what they did
to win the championship,

666
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,600
and then they take some money
elsewhere. It's so hard to keep the, uh,

667
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,540
the group together, which is why
one of my favorite speeches ever,

668
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,790
which I had never heard. I didn't
know how. I didn't hear about it.

669
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,130
Watching the Celtics Lakers rivalry.

670
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:11,020
I didn't hear about it until I read
Bill Simmons Book on a Bass Basketball.

671
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:13,330
The uh,
the um,

672
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,050
okay.

673
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,400
Patrick Riley's speech to disease of
more when he wanted them to repeat,

674
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:25,020
he said the disease or more
when everybody, when the,
when everybody wants more,

675
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,020
people want more playing time, they want
more money, they want more screen time,

676
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,841
they want more of this,

677
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:35,000
they want more of that and if
totally fucks up what got you there?

678
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,883
MMM.

679
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,680
You know, what do they always talk
about? They always said, well you know,

680
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:44,520
they played a lot of games
this year and a a, you know,

681
00:41:44,521 --> 00:41:46,260
last year in the playoffs,
you know,

682
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:51,060
they didn't get as long as break and then
the celebrated too much and blah blah

683
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:54,580
blah blah blah blah. Which
obviously I think plays a role. But

684
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,300
um,
I dunno,

685
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,370
I dunno. I've sucks cause back
in the day was like free agency,

686
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,930
that type of shit that
didn't really exist.

687
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:06,930
You could actually hold a group together
and you could have like those big time

688
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:07,890
dynasties,
you know,

689
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:13,300
like that Seattle defense should have
been doing that for like a good three,

690
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:14,134
four years.

691
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,510
Okay.

692
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,450
Um, and would have been one of the
legendary defense has had they done that.

693
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,470
You dominate a Superbowl like that. I
mean, that was like, I, that's like,

694
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,970
I haven't seen anything like that since
the 85 bears. That's just, it's a shame.

695
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,070
So fucking shame. Um, but anyways,

696
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,340
what else did I want to talk
about already talked about a bola.

697
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,970
I'm not afraid of that. Even if there
is like a fucking dope, it's a win win.

698
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:41,090
Okay.

699
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,520
It's a win win either.
It doesn't.

700
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,053
MMM.

701
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,950
Do you know either they contain it,

702
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,020
which is a win or they
don't contain it and, uh,

703
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,600
we have a much needed burn
off of the population.

704
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,210
I know it's brutal to fucking
say, but you know, if you take,

705
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,400
if you take the emotions out of it,

706
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,880
okay.

707
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,090
I mean, people, you get 7 billion
people on the fucking planet. Well,

708
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,360
we're on our way to 14
billion. Everybody's going
to have a couple of kids.

709
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:16,330
What the fuck are we doing? Okay.
We got manmade salmon people.

710
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,530
I mean, if anybody needs a
fucking plague, it's human beings.

711
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,530
Jesus fucking Christ.

712
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,610
How many more casinos can they build out
Vegas and they keep getting filled up

713
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:29,590
with mouth breathers.
They just keep coming in.

714
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:33,580
And then if you don't believe
that we need a plague,

715
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:38,350
then I would say you did not watch
that Fsu Notre Dame game yesterday,

716
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,350
which for my money was the best
college football game of the year.

717
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,190
Unbelievable game.
I took my wife out last night,

718
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:46,660
so I missed a lot of the second half,

719
00:43:46,661 --> 00:43:50,440
but I kept peeking in when we
were in bars and shit. But um,

720
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,600
it was just an instant classic.

721
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:55,870
But the only in as much as it killed
me to miss the game, what I, uh,

722
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,711
or a lot of the game,

723
00:43:56,711 --> 00:44:01,190
what I loved was that I didn't have
to listen to those mouth breathing.

724
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,500
Fucking morons.

725
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,410
Yeah.

726
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:08,790
I mean they play that God damn, Whoa, Ooh,

727
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,530
every fucking day. Play it for every
occasion. If they do something good,

728
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:14,364
they play it.

729
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,720
If the other team does something
good to get their fans psyched up to,

730
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:21,120
to try to get back into the game.
It's like,

731
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:23,580
why don't you just write like
two or three of those songs?

732
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,950
Just switch it up a little bit.
Like I don't,

733
00:44:26,951 --> 00:44:30,760
I just can't imagine as a fucking
fan. I can't even do, once again,

734
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:36,210
the fucking Boston red sox play that
stupid sweet Caroline boop, boop boop.

735
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,440
I've never sung it.

736
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,760
It was stupid from day fucking
one and I never fucking song it.

737
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,330
And just to sit there and watch those
people and that's just once a game.

738
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,020
Okay.

739
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,680
Magic. If anytime everything
went good during a red sox
game, everybody just went,

740
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,730
Bob,
Bob,

741
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,260
Bob like a hundred times
in nine fucking innings.

742
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,640
How could you possibly still be a fed?
I Dunno.

743
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,910
I have no idea what I feel like somebody
just walking into the hotel room right

744
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:11,120
now, probably complaining about
me cursing and Shit in here. Um,

745
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:17,040
yeah, that's the type of shit that I see
and then I'm just like, you know, I is a,

746
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:24,030
it was a plague really that bad
a thing. Uh, Jesus Christ. Bill,

747
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,490
Jesus Christ. Um, all
right. What do we like 37,

748
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:30,140
38 minutes into this fucking thing?

749
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:32,990
Minus whatever the hell it to however
long it took me to read these.

750
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:34,720
Yeah,

751
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,800
the fucking, uh, advertising. Uh, all
right. You don't have to do it. I went to,

752
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,930
I'm going to take a break
right now cause I'm waiting,

753
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:44,900
still waiting for the advertising of
the questions to come in. And, uh, we,

754
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,430
you guys didn't need to know that.
Did you? Hey, why you don't want came.

755
00:45:48,431 --> 00:45:49,690
I want to watch this week.
Uh,

756
00:45:49,691 --> 00:45:54,691
the big game I want to see is a cowboys
and giants because I'm actually a

757
00:45:55,781 --> 00:46:00,340
closeted, um, cowboy's fan.

758
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,060
I never quite got on board, wants
to, Tex Schramm and Tom Landry left.

759
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:10,980
It was so fucking different. It
was this stoic, classy franchise,

760
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,460
which of course I know the players are
like, they were brutal and cutthroat,

761
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,490
but I didn't see that
part. I just saw the, the,

762
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:21,140
the propaganda and they went from
that to habitat, them cowboys,

763
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,120
right? And this guy with a facelift
and everything. And it became,

764
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,770
I just felt like I was
watching like Falcon crested
or literally the show Dallas,

765
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:34,010
um, became like a reality show.
So I never quite got into a,

766
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,280
I dunno,
I just never got into them after that,

767
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,070
even though they went all those times
and I was psyched that they won.

768
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:45,270
But I don't know, I never quite was, I
was a rabid fan when I was growing up.

769
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,973
Um,

770
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,450
okay.

771
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,030
But now that they're back again in,

772
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:55,190
cause Tony Romo took so much shit to
finally see this guy getting protection,

773
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,510
it playing great and everything, I'm
really hoping, uh, that guy wins one.

774
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,570
There's certain people you just have
to root for after a while. Tony Romo,

775
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,150
Don Mattingly,
um,

776
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,390
just people that I think are just good
guys that have just taken a fucking truck

777
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:13,770
load of Shit and uh,
I dunno if they could use a break.

778
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,900
So anyways,
I'm looking forward to watching that.

779
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:20,070
And plus I also believe it or not, even
as a patriots fan, I love the giants. Uh,

780
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:24,660
I always love teams that are like
defensive minded and I just feel like,

781
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:28,350
uh, ever since the Harry
Carson Lawrence Taylor days,

782
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,550
when they revived what the
giants were before my time, well,

783
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,530
they had Sam huff, the violent
world of Sam hough. MMM.

784
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,060
I Dunno.
Like I,

785
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:46,050
I like those teams that are allegedly
like boring that when like games like 17

786
00:47:46,051 --> 00:47:48,420
to fucking nine,
um,

787
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,120
in Ely always steps up during big games.

788
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,840
And I would say that the guy has a
horseshoe up his ass, but he did it twice.

789
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:59,040
So at that point, you know, once
you're lucky twice she had good. So,

790
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,390
um, you know, I dunno,

791
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,210
I'm really looking forward to that
fucking game and uh, and that is it.

792
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:08,110
So I'm going to take a break here,

793
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:12,110
wait for this shit to come in and I'll
be answering your questions, blah, blah,

794
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:16,180
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, whatever. All right. Okay.

795
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,290
Taking a break at,
why am I saying I'm taking a break?

796
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,810
Because you're not going to hear the
brake is just gonna come right back.

797
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,940
You know, see, watch.

798
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,240
Oh, look at that. And
I'm back just like dad.

799
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,600
And it didn't take any time out of your
life, just like a fucking extra point,

800
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,050
just like an extra point.
Um,

801
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,350
I was actually sitting there waiting
for the questions to come in, um,

802
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,140
for my buddy to send them to me.
And um,

803
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,370
I saw that stupid commercial. Have you
seen their commercial? The Ah, no, no.

804
00:48:47,371 --> 00:48:52,000
Drinking and driving commercial with
the dog is sitting there waiting for his

805
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:56,520
master to come home and it's sitting
there and the dude doesn't come home.

806
00:48:56,521 --> 00:48:57,570
So they make you think that all,

807
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,760
maybe he died in the drink
and drive and or whatever.

808
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:01,110
And then the kid comes
home in the morning,

809
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:05,880
he's like, you know, hey a fluffy,
he couldn't drive last night,

810
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,990
but I'm home. No, what
are you doing? You know,

811
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:15,030
I just want the dog to be like, Hey, yeah
dude, it's great you came back. But I Fyi,

812
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:17,250
I took a shit in the kitchen.
You know,

813
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:19,380
you haven't been home for
like fucking 15 hours,

814
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,650
so don't even look at me like that.
I peed on the carpet.

815
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,370
I shit in the kitchen and I need to go
out right now and I need some fucking

816
00:49:26,371 --> 00:49:28,230
food. All right, next time
you're gonna to go out pose.

817
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:32,340
And how about leaving some food
out? Maybe some water, you know.

818
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,080
Okay.

819
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,831
Jesus Christ.

820
00:49:34,831 --> 00:49:38,310
Every time you fucking come home I greet
you like he accomplished something.

821
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,780
Even if he just went to the store,

822
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,110
it would it kill you to leave out
some food but it fucking kill you.

823
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,300
Um,
anyways,

824
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:48,330
you can't do that anyways cause fucking
dogs would eat all of it in two seconds.

825
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:51,720
And then Yak,
if he left out 15 hours worth of food,

826
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:55,320
they'd have it done in 15 seconds because
that's what they do because they're

827
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:59,860
dogs. They're fucking animals. All right,

828
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:04,680
let's read some questions for
the week. A stinky coworker, a,

829
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:06,340
uh,
Billy switchblade.

830
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,380
I work in a small office with another
girl who was really nice and helpful,

831
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,340
helpful.

832
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,360
Her and I share a small cubicle and I've
noticed since the first day she does

833
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:21,280
not shower and she smells
like B. Oh. Oh Jesus.

834
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,200
Oh Gee gauge. Um, anyway,

835
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,270
since we are so close together
for eight hours a day,

836
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,830
it seems to be ruining my concentration.
My question is,

837
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,210
how do I tell her to get rid of the
smell without offending her or without

838
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:39,950
getting my boss involved?

839
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,450
It seriously is making me think about
switching jobs. Thanks for the help.

840
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,400
Big Fan of your comedy and the
podcast. Ps, go fuck yourself, dude.

841
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:50,300
I don't know.

842
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,120
Okay.

843
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,050
If it was a dude, you could just
say it. How do you say it to a lady?

844
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:57,800
Yeah.

845
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,470
All right, well let's, let's just
brainstorm here by the way. 21,

846
00:51:01,471 --> 00:51:05,730
19 and they go for two points.
Seattle, La, where they don't get it.

847
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:07,460
Okay.

848
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,293
They don't get it.

849
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,500
Yeah. It keeps a fucking, just 21, 19.
Seattle's gonna win this fucking game.

850
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,510
Anyways, let's see. What the
fuck would I say? Hey, listen,

851
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:24,790
I'm not trying to be a
jerk. You know, you know,

852
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:28,090
I love you. I love working with
you and everything, but uh,

853
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,690
you know, you just Kinda, I
don't know, how do I put this?

854
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:39,610
You just kind of like
smell really bad. I mean,

855
00:51:39,611 --> 00:51:44,310
how the fuck do you, there's no way to
say it, dude. You stink. Hey, listen,

856
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:48,210
let me try this one. Hey,
listen, semantic, come here
for a second, you know. No,

857
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,450
that's close enough.
Uh,

858
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,510
come over here, but stay there
if you know what I mean. Um,

859
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,560
I want to hose you down. I, what the fuck
do you say? I don't know what to say.

860
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,990
You fucking smell. There's no
way to say it. Like, listen,

861
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,590
okay.

862
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,620
I hate to be the one to tell you this,
but you don't smell good.

863
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,220
You need to bathe more often.

864
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,150
You're coming in here and
you smell like body odor.

865
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,660
Ah, dude, there's not, there's no
way to fucking do it. There's no way.

866
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,860
The only way you do it is you go to your
boss and then you look like a bitch.

867
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:30,980
Okay.

868
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,813
Or

869
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,390
You,
you can go passive aggressive.

870
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,893
Okay.

871
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,920
MMM.

872
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:44,850
You could just bring in like a ridiculous,
not, you go out and you buy a bunch of

873
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:49,300
air freshness. All right. And he just
stick an air freshener in the cubicle.

874
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,243
Okay.

875
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:54,800
And if she doesn't get the hint the
next day you have to air fresheners.

876
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,560
Wednesday there's three.
You get the point right?

877
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,620
And you just keep bringing in more and
more air fresheners until she finally

878
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:05,810
takes the bait and says,

879
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,160
why do you have all those air fresheners?

880
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,220
Why do you keep putting all these air
fresheners in there and it without saying

881
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:15,940
a word? You look at
her, you hold your nose,

882
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:19,570
and then you just pointed
her and then that's it.

883
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,750
And then you turn back around
and you go back to work like it.

884
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,800
Like it never happened.

885
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,990
And then when she runs
out of the cubicle crying,

886
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,940
you quickly take all of the air
fresheners. You throw them in the basket,

887
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,250
he tie him off,

888
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:40,230
you hand them to a coworker
who's obviously Ben informed,

889
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,000
you know of what to do.

890
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,300
You handed off to them and they sprint
to the fucking trash bin and they throw

891
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:48,540
it out. No one, the
boss shows up and says,

892
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,860
why did you tell old fucking stink
toast over here that she smelled? Uh,

893
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,610
you like, I never said
that. I never said anything.

894
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,990
I know w w and she says you
have a bunch of air fresheners.

895
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,770
There are no air fresheners here, sir.
I do not know what you're talking about.

896
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:06,060
And he just fucking deny all of it.

897
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,680
Okay.

898
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,640
Did you at any point pinch your
nose and point in her direction?

899
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,610
I have no recollection of
any type of behavior. I was
at my cubicle doing my job.

900
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,740
Did anyone hear him pinch
his nose in point in her?

901
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:25,350
Absolutely not. No one can hear that, sir.

902
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,360
Even if he did in you're covered.

903
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,610
You just have to realize at that point
you're going to be trashing a year

904
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:34,230
working friendship.

905
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,073
Yeah.

906
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,440
What if you just went out and you
bought some ladies Deodorant, right?

907
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,330
And he put a little pink bow on it and
when she walked in you bowed your head

908
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,850
and genuflect it as you held it up to her.

909
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,650
Okay.

910
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,910
I'm trying to think of a nice way of
telling somebody that they stink a female.

911
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,563
MMM.

912
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,780
All right. Here's another one where you
get like your other coworkers involved.

913
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,003
MMM.

914
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:11,510
It's like throwback sports
fan day and you just sign,

915
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,080
everybody's going to do the wave.
All right.

916
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:17,770
And then the one person conducting them
also has this little spray bottle of

917
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:21,310
perfume oil rig comes by her for
be like, Hey, she raises her thing.

918
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:25,570
Like people on either side just spray
perfume into our armpits really quickly

919
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,260
and then everybody runs away now
than ever. She'd start crying again.

920
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,150
Just ask her. Just say, listen,

921
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,900
is there a way for me to tell you that
you have body odor that won't make you

922
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,020
cry?
Is there a way for me to do that?

923
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,870
How quick is there anything worse since
when somebody puts you in a position to

924
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:47,010
have to fucking do that,

925
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,173
you know,

926
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,950
oh my God,
you fucking stink.

927
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,500
You know what's the worst
is the air freshener thing?

928
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:56,520
Cause there's going to be this,

929
00:55:56,521 --> 00:56:00,780
this tipping point where the air freshener
in the BIA or con or are competing

930
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:02,280
for your fucking sense of smell.

931
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,490
And if you can somehow tough your
way through that day without puking,

932
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:06,510
you're a better man than me.

933
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,363
MMM.

934
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,080
Is there anything worse than when you're
watching your own fucking team and a

935
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:16,420
guy catches a ball and you
just watching the quarterback,

936
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:18,240
so to just escort him down the field,

937
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,810
it's like at any point are you going to
try to take a proper angle or at least

938
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,120
dive at their fucking what are you doing?

939
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,500
Sorry. Alright. [inaudible]
animal research. Uh,

940
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:35,970
Dear Bill Nye the scientifically
illiterate guy. Ooh, he got clever there,

941
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:39,780
everybody. Um, all right.

942
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:44,700
I'm curious if you have any thoughts on
performing research on lab animals for

943
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,040
the benefit of humans.
Um,

944
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,470
we're not talking about testing
lipstick on bunnies here,

945
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,980
but serious medical research using flies,
mice,

946
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:59,981
primates and other animal models of
devastating human diseases like cancer and

947
00:57:00,111 --> 00:57:01,250
Alzheimer's disease.

948
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,300
I bring this up as I recently made the
difficult decision to leave a prestigious

949
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:08,180
genetic lab,
Nobel peace,

950
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,570
a Nobel prize winning researcher.
No Shit.

951
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,340
Real deal during my phd training as I
couldn't rationalize subjecting mice to

952
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:19,940
painful procedures and an
all around shit life anymore.

953
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:25,090
I am currently refocusing my career
to only performing research on human

954
00:57:25,221 --> 00:57:27,560
patients that give informed consent.

955
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,530
This decision has already
helped me sleep better at night.

956
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:33,410
So what do you think through
the costs of animal suffering,

957
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:36,980
ultimately justify the means of
increasing our knowledge of human disease?

958
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,890
Let's get fucking philosophy
philosophical here.

959
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:44,390
Thanks for your comedy and the podcast.
Best regards. All right. First off, uh,

960
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,380
I take back making funny. If you're Bill
Nye the scientifically literate guy,

961
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:52,940
sometimes it pisses me off when I know
morons are writing me just as dumb as I

962
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:54,980
am, and then they're going to make
fun of me for being dumb. But you,

963
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:58,100
with your background, you had the right
to do that. So my apologies. All right.

964
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,020
Secondly,
secondly,

965
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:04,280
who would know better than
somebody who actually did the job?

966
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,770
There's no way I could
fucking do that job,

967
00:58:06,771 --> 00:58:09,410
but selfishly I reap the benefits of it.

968
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:14,620
I think what you're saying is
ultimately the way we should do it,

969
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,913
um,

970
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:22,780
is that it should be human beings making
an informed decision that they want to

971
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:26,980
be tested. And uh, you know what?

972
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:28,660
They'd still figure out something evil.

973
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,040
They go to the third world and they would
find people don't have a fucking pot

974
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:33,581
to piss in.

975
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:38,380
And they would somehow flimflam them
and get them to sign some shit that they

976
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,050
didn't even know what the fuck
they was signing. But, uh,

977
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:44,530
that's what human beings do.
But yeah, I would say that, uh,

978
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,990
yeah, we should not be doing
that. We shouldn't be doing
most of what we're doing.

979
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:55,510
Um, and then a lot of
times I think, you know,

980
00:58:55,511 --> 00:59:00,270
I go back and forth on,
you know, whether we, um,

981
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,270
being a vegetarian or eating meat,

982
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,360
I just love the way steak tastes
and chicken and all that shit.

983
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:10,770
But I definitely think that, uh, you know,

984
00:59:10,771 --> 00:59:14,580
we shouldn't, shouldn't be killing as many
animals as we do or if we're going to,

985
00:59:14,581 --> 00:59:19,050
you gotta be like raising them like
cattle and then you kill them. I Dunno,

986
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,301
but I don't know.

987
00:59:20,301 --> 00:59:25,301
I saw something recently
about how Vivian Campbell,

988
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,740
who's been playing in Def Leppard
for awhile has cancer. And, um,

989
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,770
so I was reading up on him and I saw a
picture of Def Leppard and what are they

990
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:36,880
guitars? The guy with the short
hair who's been in the band forever.

991
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:38,800
He standing there in his fifties,

992
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,660
shirtless in the guys absolutely
fucking shredded. So I'm like,

993
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:44,980
what the fuck is this guy though?

994
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:50,020
And I looked it up and for the last 20
years he quit Busan and he's eating a

995
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:54,250
Vegan diet and he's kind
of on a mission to, uh,

996
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,170
tell people that you know,

997
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:01,210
that you can get shredded and be fucking
ripped eating vegetarian and all that

998
01:00:01,211 --> 01:00:01,721
type of stuff.

999
01:00:01,721 --> 01:00:06,640
So that fascinates the hell out of
me because as much as I love cigars,

1000
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:08,980
I love booze and steak and
all that type of stuff.

1001
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:13,570
You definitely feel fucking awful.
Afterwards,

1002
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:14,860
the next day hung over.

1003
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:20,070
He got that cigar fucking awful
taste in your mouth and you know,

1004
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,180
and eat a steak dinner.

1005
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,930
Especially if you have like the taters
and you eat it with something that you

1006
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:27,910
know, it's going to be difficult
to digest. You fucking,

1007
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,590
you just need to take a nap.

1008
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,250
But if you eat a vegetarian
meal, you'll, yeah,

1009
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:38,350
I don't know. I always still feel
light and I feel fucking energized.

1010
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:43,000
I feel I might, I'm in a great mood and
it's one of those things where like,

1011
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:47,410
I know that I should be
doing that most of the time.

1012
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,910
I just Kinda like doing the
wrong thing more of the time. Um,

1013
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
and also I'm stuck in my ways
and I'm too lazy to read up on a,

1014
01:00:59,050 --> 01:00:59,883
you know,

1015
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,580
learning vegetarian dishes.

1016
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,700
Like tonight I'm going out and I'm
getting a pork chop. I know. Yeah. Yeah.

1017
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:13,620
I've been thinking about it all fucking
day and I'm going to smoke a cigar later.

1018
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:18,300
I already know doing that. But every
once in a while while I'm doing it,

1019
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,940
I pictured myself 30 years in the,
in the future,

1020
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:26,210
sitting on one of those hospital examine
her things. You know what the fucking,

1021
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:31,050
that frontal covering smoke with
my ass hanging out the back,

1022
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,950
waiting for the doctor to come back and
I'll start thinking about all the pork

1023
01:01:34,951 --> 01:01:38,700
chops and cigars. I smoked
and I'm thinking, I don't
want to be that guy either.

1024
01:01:38,701 --> 01:01:41,460
So I gotta I gotta do something here.
Um,

1025
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,540
but getting back to what you say, yeah,
no, I don't think that they should do it.

1026
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,630
Um, ultimately, no.

1027
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:53,790
I think that the fact that we've always
put human life ahead of everything else

1028
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:57,630
is why there's 7 billion people on the
planet and the polar ice caps are melting.

1029
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:02,040
Now, do I have any sort of background
to make that statement? Absolutely not,

1030
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:05,910
but that's what podcasting is all
about. So go fuck yourself. All right.

1031
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,470
Calls after a date.
[inaudible] Hello William.

1032
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,770
I went out on a date with a girl.
Congratulations.

1033
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:17,460
We both seem to have a great
time. Uh, at the end of the date,

1034
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:19,790
she initiated the hug and yes.

1035
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:23,390
What I asked if she wanted to go
out again. That's wonderful. Well,

1036
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:27,980
I called her a few days after the date
and left a message. No callback. Texted.

1037
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:30,080
I texted her the day after.
No reply.

1038
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,700
Should I give her a few days to reply
or move on? Move on, dude. Move on.

1039
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:39,680
Abso-Fucking-Lutely move on.
And a,

1040
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:43,910
that sounds like somebody who
doesn't know how to say, Hey,

1041
01:02:43,911 --> 01:02:48,350
I had a great time, but I don't want to
see you again. I think you, you know,

1042
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:52,580
what does it say? You asked her? Uh, yeah,

1043
01:02:52,581 --> 01:02:54,050
you asked if she wanted to go out again.

1044
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,620
She probably initiated the hug
so he wouldn't try to kiss her.

1045
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,280
And then she just said what you wanted
to hear so she could get the fuck out of

1046
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:04,040
there. And that's what I would guess.
But uh, either way, who gives a fuck?

1047
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:08,870
You asked her out. She said yes. You
know, you're in the game. You know,

1048
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,230
they're not all going to be hits,
but if you bat 300,

1049
01:03:12,231 --> 01:03:15,020
you make the fucking all star team.
Don't ever forget that. So keep,

1050
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,880
keep swinging away. Their
buddy, they fuck. Oh, um,

1051
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:24,910
all right.
Oh Jesus.

1052
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:29,050
I thought that whole was going
to go on forever. Should I dumper

1053
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,600
uh,
dear Barbara Rasa

1054
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,370
the fuck does that mean
and hopefully Nia to, um,

1055
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,900
I'm in a fucked up situation right now.

1056
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:45,950
I've been dating this chick for the past
six months and it's been going fine and

1057
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:50,951
Dandy until a few days ago we were
at the house having crazy sex,

1058
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:55,160
but just as she was about to climax,
she kind of yelled her ex's name.

1059
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:03,050
Fuck you. That did not
happen. I'm calling bullshit.

1060
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,860
Get the fuck Outta here,
dude.

1061
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,730
That's hilarious. That is fucking
not only what I have laughed,

1062
01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:14,450
I would have kept fucking her until she
was done. I just be like, Hey, look,

1063
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:17,270
I understand. Sorry. I'm getting on a
cough drop here. I understand. You know,

1064
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,770
you're not ready. You're not
ready to get into a relationship,

1065
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:23,390
but you're ready to fuck somebody else.

1066
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:27,110
That sounds like a perfect situation
for me. I don't give a fuck.

1067
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:28,550
Yell out anybody's name.
You want to,

1068
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:34,130
I'll ghost write this fucking
this blowjob. I don't give a fuck.

1069
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:46,770
Sorry. Jesus Christ. Um, anyways, uh,

1070
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:52,130
he goes on to say I was dressed up and
just left and we haven't talked since.

1071
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,170
Now I know for a fact that she can't be
cheating on me because her x is dead.

1072
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:00,180
He died like two.
Oh Jesus.

1073
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:03,360
He died like two years ago
when they were still together.

1074
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:07,110
My rational side is telling me that
I'm a dick and should just forgive her,

1075
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,420
but my instincts are telling me,
fuck that bitch.

1076
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:14,370
What should I do best regards
from Italy? Oh, first of all,

1077
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:18,090
uh, I can't, I had a great
time. I was in Italy, went to

1078
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:22,620
Rome. I can't wait to come back.
I know rob was kind of like, uh,

1079
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,560
the basic place you go
when you first went there,

1080
01:05:25,561 --> 01:05:28,190
but this is the first place ever
when I learned to see the column a,

1081
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:32,940
the Coliseum, where
else should I go? Milan,

1082
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,400
Florence, Venice. Where should I go?

1083
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:38,700
Person from Italy or anybody from Italy
listening. Let me know where I should go.

1084
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,490
But getting back to your question,
should you move on? Absolutely.

1085
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:45,150
She should always listen to your
instincts. They're always right.

1086
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,190
Okay.

1087
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,610
Are there,
are there is a reason.

1088
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,330
Okay.

1089
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:52,670
You know, there's a reason. I mean, dude,

1090
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:59,030
your rational side is telling you that
you're a deck and you should forgive her,

1091
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,430
that there's nothing rational about that.

1092
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:02,700
Yeah.

1093
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,280
Let me ask you this, dude.
If you were banging her,

1094
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:10,890
let's just say her name was Maria,
right. And right as you can and you went,

1095
01:06:10,891 --> 01:06:14,400
oh, and then they're like, what?
What the fuck would she do?

1096
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:17,170
Do you think she'd be back with you?
Okay.

1097
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:17,970
Okay.

1098
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:21,960
Would you even question her if
she didn't get back with you?

1099
01:06:21,961 --> 01:06:23,070
You're totally agree with it.

1100
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:26,340
If she actually got back to you
with you after you did that,

1101
01:06:26,341 --> 01:06:29,070
when you be sitting there going,
what the fuck is wrong with this person?

1102
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:32,370
How low is your self esteem that
you're going to put up with that?

1103
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,150
And if you have low self esteem to that
level, how many dicks had been in Europe?

1104
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,440
Ah, sorry. That's how guys
stick. Yeah, Dude. No.

1105
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,280
Okay.

1106
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,500
I only thing I would say is
don't say fuck that bitch.

1107
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,470
She went through something
unbelievably traumatic, you know,

1108
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,120
and Java c loved the guy.
I feel bad for and so should you,

1109
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:56,420
but you shouldn't get your heart and
mixed up in that shit. All right.

1110
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,670
That's what I would do.
Um,

1111
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,673
okay.

1112
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,740
Yeah, they didn't add a very nice
way. I would just say like, you know,

1113
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,660
I just don't think you're
ready to be in a relationship.

1114
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,113
MMM.

1115
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,880
Yeah.
No matter what she says,

1116
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:15,840
you just hold it to the fact that you
called out you're dead boyfriend's name

1117
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,850
when you had an orgasm.
There's really no, uh,

1118
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,500
you should just stop talking and
come in for the hug right now.

1119
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,083
Okay.

1120
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:30,350
And I will not let go til you tell it too.

1121
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:31,913
I'm sorry.

1122
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,313
Ah,

1123
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,510
oh, big love. Until you
say somebody else's name.

1124
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,200
Um, alright, let's plow ahead
here. I'll tell you one last story.

1125
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:50,550
I did a benefit this
weekend for a all simas.

1126
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:56,110
Now the joke he gave the officers would
be like, for what? Alzheimer's for what?

1127
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,070
You see what I did there? You know
that guy whenever you say, yeah,

1128
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:02,440
my grandmother is hard of
hearing, he goes, what?

1129
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,270
You get it fucking joke book Larry.

1130
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,160
I fucking hate people that do that.

1131
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:13,060
Unless you're doing it because you know
I hate it then I love you then that's

1132
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,920
funny. But if you're
actually it for real, I,

1133
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:19,960
it just like gives me joke Douche
chills. Like I, uh, oh my God.

1134
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:23,380
Look at the fucking tits on error.
Whoa.

1135
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,270
What kind of an asshole is still brings
a defense sign? The d and the fence.

1136
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:32,270
We get it. It was a funny joke
and NFL films in the Seventies.

1137
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,610
MMM.

1138
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,570
Holy Shit.
Saint Louis is up 28,

1139
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:42,110
19 with five 30 to go.

1140
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,710
What do they down by right now?
Was that nine points?

1141
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:54,730
Seattle's got the ball.
What do you think, Bill?

1142
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,430
I think if they didn't win
the Superbowl last year,

1143
01:08:58,431 --> 01:08:59,810
they would actually win this game.

1144
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,040
But I got a feeling they
probably lost too many guys

1145
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:09,620
that they're going to come up just
short. Oh, there he goes. Russell Wilson.

1146
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,320
I just don't see the rams
being able to hold on though.

1147
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:20,190
I got to root for the underdog. Oh, pills.

1148
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:23,250
Quit being a bitch. Just pick
a team. You know what I say?

1149
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:27,990
I say fucking Seattle comes back. They
come back now that they're past midfield,

1150
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:32,970
GI bill really going down in
Olympia. Anyways, so I did this, uh,

1151
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:37,680
I did this benefit for
Alzheimer's for y and um,

1152
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,960
it was for a,
Seth Rogen put it together.

1153
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:47,790
It was just fucking amazing.
Lineup. And, um, I didn't realize,

1154
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:51,030
I mean usually what do you do? Those
fucking things. Nine Times out of 10,

1155
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,530
they're fucking, ah, they're
outside and it sucks.

1156
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:00,420
And it's a bunch of fucking, you
know, rich people walking around,

1157
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,380
trophy wives with their red bottom
shoes and nobody paying attention.

1158
01:10:04,381 --> 01:10:06,510
And then it's a benefit.
So if he call them assholes,

1159
01:10:06,511 --> 01:10:10,680
then you're the counter or
whatever. Um, I actually, uh,

1160
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:14,940
it was not outside.
It was at the palladium,

1161
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:16,470
right on sunset strip.

1162
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,530
And that's actually where Richard Pryor
recorded a live on the sunset strip,

1163
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:27,180
you know, way back in,
I think around 1980.

1164
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:31,140
He did it and it was a bucket list of
mine too, at some point do a show there.

1165
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,600
And uh,

1166
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:38,130
it was so fucking amazing to be
able to perform that. Unfortunately,

1167
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:41,950
I was really sick, so I couldn't be
as social as I want it to be. But um,

1168
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,050
it's fucking awesome.
Show Craig Robinson and his band,

1169
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,403
uh,

1170
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:53,990
with a house band and they will
hilarious. Plus an awesome band. And um,

1171
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,170
Seth hosted the thing.

1172
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:57,590
Yeah.

1173
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:01,010
And, uh, what the fuck was
appointed? My God damn story. Weird.

1174
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:05,210
Al Yankovic was on it. Sarah Silverman
was just a fucking awesome show.

1175
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:10,870
And um, I can't remember what the
point in my fucking story was,

1176
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:14,380
was the point of my story
just was awesome to form there

1177
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,200
that it was a good cause. Oh
my God, it was for Alzheimer's.

1178
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:23,100
I'm literally doing the joke. Um, let
me see what happens to somebody's brain.

1179
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:23,641
Fuck of works.

1180
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:27,480
I started watching the rams Seattle
game cause it's getting exciting.

1181
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:30,000
It's Russell Wilson rods for a foul.
They stopped.

1182
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,713
Yeah,

1183
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:37,250
I fucked in a, I don't know what I'm
talking about it anymore. Anyways,

1184
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:42,140
I want to thank Seth Rogen, um, but put
me on the show. Uh, I had a great time.

1185
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,970
Anytime,
you know,

1186
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:46,400
anytime he wants me to do something like
that I'll definitely do it cause I'm

1187
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:51,140
such a fucking asshole and I lived such
a great life and I'm still a dick that I

1188
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:55,430
need to do benefits to somehow
balance out my Karma. Um,

1189
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,793
okay,

1190
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,520
I'll definitely do it. But
anyways, it was a fucking amazing.

1191
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:00,620
Okay.

1192
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,870
What's amazing about that?
Places it's still looks

1193
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:04,220
okay

1194
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:08,970
like the prior special when you walk
in there, even if you didn't know, um,

1195
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,000
that they, uh, recorded it there.

1196
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,580
Okay.

1197
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:16,240
Get the fuck Outta here. He goes. Seattle
all the way down to the nine yard line.

1198
01:12:16,241 --> 01:12:19,420
St Lowest. Same Old fucking rams. Come on.

1199
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:26,020
I always got to root for the underdog,
but my money says Seattle. Jesus. Fuck.

1200
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,030
Ah,
the guy slips on the turf.

1201
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:29,750
Yeah.

1202
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:32,840
Um, anyways, it was
fucking amazing. And um,

1203
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,820
I'm hoping to someday
do my own show there.

1204
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,800
That is definitely one of the
bucket list I'd ever read.

1205
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,960
Told you guys the bucket list.
Uh, theaters, they're all just,

1206
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:45,830
staters were my favorite.
Standup specials were recorded.

1207
01:12:45,831 --> 01:12:50,720
I already got to do constitution hall
where, uh, Eddie Murphy delirious was,

1208
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:52,723
um,

1209
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:53,960
okay.

1210
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,740
And then the palladium is Richard
Pryor live on the sunset strip.

1211
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,920
And then there's a theater in Long Beach.
I don't know what it's called now,

1212
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:06,170
but that's where the greatest
one was. Richard Pryor, uh, live,

1213
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,680
uh, live in concert. That
one I want to perform there.

1214
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:14,360
Whoever bill Cosby did, Bill Cosby
himself. I can't remember where that was.

1215
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:19,520
I did Carnegie Hall. That's where Lenny
Bruce and George Carlin voltage specials.

1216
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:24,110
Well, Lenny Bruce was an album. Um,

1217
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,010
okay,

1218
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:28,140
where else I want to do red rocks.

1219
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:29,430
Okay.

1220
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:33,630
I did stand up there one time, but it
was before a, uh, like a film thing.

1221
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:38,460
Um, and that place was unbelievably
cool, was not a good show,

1222
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:39,751
you know,

1223
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:42,510
that was outside and everybody was here
to see the movies and then they just

1224
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:46,320
brought me out. No one knew who the
fuck I was and I sort of survived it,

1225
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,170
but it was still cool to perform there.
Um,

1226
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,570
so I got a bunch that I want to do.
Oh, I know. Uh, I want to do whatever.

1227
01:13:54,571 --> 01:13:59,470
Sam Kinison did,
his standup special on the sunset strip,

1228
01:13:59,471 --> 01:14:03,010
which I don't think it was at the Roxy.
I want to do a show there.

1229
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:08,260
Um, whatever. I have all these, these
different things. But anyways, let's,

1230
01:14:08,261 --> 01:14:11,480
let's close out here by talking
about patriots jets, but, but

1231
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,140
Bordeaux,
Bordeaux,

1232
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,433
um,

1233
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:26,460
that was fucking ridiculous that we were
actually able to win that Goddamn game.

1234
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:30,840
And I felt vindicated by watching that
where all my friends was trying to say

1235
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,390
that the patriots turned around and that,

1236
01:14:33,391 --> 01:14:38,391
that team that I saw that got pounded by
the chiefs that now somehow they're not

1237
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,400
that team there, this team this
week. And I was trying to say no,

1238
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:45,420
they are somewhere in the fucking middle.
Um,

1239
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,420
okay.

1240
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,760
And uh,
I dunno,

1241
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,200
statistically we didn't deserve the
win the fucking gay by a long shot.

1242
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:56,370
I guess that was the first time anybody
ever controlled the ball for more than

1243
01:14:56,371 --> 01:15:00,660
40 fucking minutes and still
lost the game, you know.

1244
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:05,460
Uh, as much as I want to
credit the Patriots' defense
that we stopped them in the

1245
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:06,391
red zone,

1246
01:15:06,391 --> 01:15:10,410
I felt that they were stopping themselves
a lot with bad fucking penalties and

1247
01:15:10,411 --> 01:15:12,360
shit like that.
Um,

1248
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:13,720
okay.

1249
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,620
And I got to admit,

1250
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:20,380
as much as I can't stand rex Ryan
because I think he talks a bunch of shit.

1251
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:21,700
Okay.

1252
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,730
Where he has a good team and I thought
he was really disrespectful to a lot of

1253
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:26,080
people around the fucking league.

1254
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,740
I still think he's a great coach and um,

1255
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:31,430
okay.

1256
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:35,900
If they shifted jets didn't fire him
and wanted to start all over again

1257
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:41,880
because he's not the GM of the team,
so he doesn't get to pick the players.

1258
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:45,240
As far as I know.
I think the guy,

1259
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:46,690
yeah,

1260
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:49,750
I think he's a good coach,
is not a lot of good coaches out there.

1261
01:15:49,751 --> 01:15:51,190
I think he's a good coach to the jets.

1262
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:55,690
Just fucked up with their player
personnel or whatever. Um,

1263
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:57,380
okay.

1264
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,010
I Dunno that guy. I think that that
guy, if he gets fired, that's a,

1265
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:01,340
that's still a good pickup.

1266
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:05,150
Even though I don't like
the way he conducts himself
when he has a good team and

1267
01:16:05,151 --> 01:16:08,090
he talks all that shit. Nah, I dunno.

1268
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:10,310
It just always clearly comes across to me.

1269
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:12,260
Okay.

1270
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:14,960
That you're insecure when you
talk like that level of Shit.

1271
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,300
Do you know what I mean?
Like up,

1272
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:21,140
my wife watches his fucking reality show.

1273
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,280
Okay.

1274
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,100
I don't know if it's called love and
hip hop. I don't know what it is,

1275
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,520
but it's this chick who has like this
re ridiculous fake fucking tits and a

1276
01:16:32,461 --> 01:16:37,110
ridiculous fake fucking ass.
She looks ridiculous.

1277
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:43,900
And she walks around talking about herself
like she's fucking God's gift and I'm

1278
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:46,280
sitting there watching this shit.

1279
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:47,770
Okay.

1280
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,710
And I said to my wife,
I was like,

1281
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:55,630
do you realize how truly fucking
stupid you would have to be to be that

1282
01:16:55,631 --> 01:16:59,820
confident
to just be walking around like that,

1283
01:16:59,821 --> 01:17:04,260
thinking that you're the be all end all
and that you fucking know everything.

1284
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:09,090
Like how truly fucking stupid you would
have to be. Cause whenever I listen,

1285
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:10,320
people who act like that,

1286
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,560
you're either unbelievably insecure and
you're trying to overcompensate it or

1287
01:17:15,871 --> 01:17:19,620
you just unbelievably fucking naive.
You're a fucking moron.

1288
01:17:19,621 --> 01:17:21,630
So that allows you to be that confident.

1289
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:24,600
And then every once in
awhile you'll meet somebody

1290
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:27,263
who just

1291
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:32,240
is just the man and they're
confident and they fucking know it.

1292
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:36,620
You know what I mean?
Which to me is like 1% of the population,

1293
01:17:36,621 --> 01:17:39,890
basically that benchmark person
that everyone's trying to be.

1294
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:43,040
Then when they're that fucking confident,
you know,

1295
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,380
it fucking makes sense
as far as confident,

1296
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:51,020
but only confident as far as like
what it is that you do. Like,

1297
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:55,160
if you're an athlete or an actor or a
musician, or you're running a business,

1298
01:17:55,161 --> 01:17:57,110
like, you know, you're the best at it,

1299
01:17:57,111 --> 01:18:00,170
you know you're the best and you're
fucking confident that I understand.

1300
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:02,240
But just straight across the board,

1301
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:05,200
walking around like you're
the shit and you know, you,

1302
01:18:05,201 --> 01:18:07,730
you like moving planets
and shit with your mind,

1303
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,680
like walking around like you
fucking know everything. Let's just,

1304
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:12,800
how fucking truly dumb you have to be.
Um,

1305
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,430
to be that confidence. So I could
never get into directs. Ryan,

1306
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:17,780
when he was talking all that shit,
I'm like,

1307
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:20,750
this fucking guy is actually
good at what he does, his job.

1308
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:23,630
But I don't know if it was cause he
has to live up to his dad or whatever.

1309
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:26,750
I just feel like this guy's beyond
fucking insecure and it's uncomfortable to

1310
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:30,920
watch. And uh, I dunno.

1311
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,780
I Dunno. He just, I don't know.

1312
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,880
He just always looked like if
you punched him in the belly,

1313
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:39,290
he'd cry and make like that
Pillsbury doughboy knows
noise. You know what I mean?

1314
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:44,060
Those noise, I dunno, I'm
fucking rambling at this point.

1315
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:48,200
Go fuck yourselves. All right.
That's a podcast for this week. Um,

1316
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:50,690
thank you for everybody
who's been listening. Uh,

1317
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:53,190
I'm site the new hours common to get,

1318
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:55,823
no,

1319
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,530
it was looking bleak.
I've been writing on this show.

1320
01:18:58,531 --> 01:19:01,320
I haven't been getting the stage time.
I wanted to. I've got a couple in there,

1321
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:05,550
a couple reps. All of a sudden you've
got the Ebola thing coming out.

1322
01:19:05,551 --> 01:19:09,510
I got some new material.
It ties into some other bullshit,

1323
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,840
couple of random thoughts and it's all
starting to come together and I can't

1324
01:19:15,121 --> 01:19:17,730
wait. I got a gig coming up down in, um,

1325
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:23,500
down in Florida because I'm
going down for the FSU. Whoa. No,

1326
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,910
no, no. I'm playing against
a University of Miami

1327
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,320
and, uh, Oh, 28, 26.
Sherman just knocked down,

1328
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:37,000
uh, just knocked down a
pass. And believe it or not,

1329
01:19:37,001 --> 01:19:40,870
he walked around nodding his head,
uh,

1330
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:45,760
as quickly as one possibly could.
He can't believe how good he is.

1331
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,090
He just can't, he can't
find, can't get over himself.

1332
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:54,150
The guy is in awe of themself and
that's always fun to be around.

1333
01:19:56,350 --> 01:20:00,430
Um, all right, listen, that's
a podcast for this week. Go
fuck yourselves. All right.

1334
01:20:00,431 --> 01:20:03,130
Cowboy's giant's my prediction.

1335
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,220
They had the lost Victor Cruz.

1336
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:10,200
All right, I'm going to go.
I'll make a gambling prediction.

1337
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:12,000
Not even knowing what
the fucking spread is.

1338
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:16,710
Rams with a first down rams with
the first down. Where's Sherman now?

1339
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,240
Nodding his head.
Oh wait,

1340
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,810
now the rams guy is not in his
head and he's walking around.

1341
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:26,670
Everybody can't believe
how awesome they are. Five.

1342
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,000
Jesus Christ. Oh wait, no, I'm
sorry. It was a fake fucking
pun. That was the punter.

1343
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,960
Hilarious.

1344
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,930
The putter is walking or can't fucking
believe how awesome he is. I knew it.

1345
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:41,730
I knew I was better than this position.

1346
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:43,490
Yeah,

1347
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:46,610
I used to do a joke about that way back
in my way back in the day that I was

1348
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:49,190
going to start celebrating
after fucking jokes worked.

1349
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:53,170
Like they way that the way they do when
the NFL, when you run for a first down,

1350
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:57,740
you start stomping around like
Jerome Bettis. Um, anyways,

1351
01:20:57,741 --> 01:21:02,520
I'm rambling at this
point. Uh, by the way, oh,

1352
01:21:02,521 --> 01:21:05,580
you Fsu people. Okay. I know
I'm coming down on your team,

1353
01:21:05,581 --> 01:21:07,950
but you guys really need to come
up with a couple more songs. Okay?

1354
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:10,020
Before you give me shit,
because I performed at your school.

1355
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:12,480
I had a great time at your fucking school,
but you know what?

1356
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,960
You know I had a great time because you
guys showed up and during my fucking

1357
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,890
show you weren't going to be
fucking two seconds. All right?

1358
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:23,790
So don't be a bunch of whiny cuts about
the constructive criticism that I'm

1359
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:26,910
giving you. I'm not saying
stop doing the Tomahawk Chop.

1360
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:30,270
That's up for the date of Americans to
try to fucking enlighten me about that.

1361
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,550
But why don't you get a
couple, you know, switch it up.

1362
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,560
P did he come down there and do maybe a
couple remixes on the same fucking idea?

1363
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:42,690
You know, just to, you know, just
for the viewer at home. Anyways,

1364
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:45,060
that's the podcasts. Go fuck
yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.
