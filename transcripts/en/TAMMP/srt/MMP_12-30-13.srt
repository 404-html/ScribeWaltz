1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,730
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:06,540
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,420
Um, December 30th, 2013 all my God,

4
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:17,310
it's the last Monday of 2013.
You guys,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,150
um,
I'm actually still enjoying the holidays.

6
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,250
I don't know about you
guys usually buy the,

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,290
at this point I'm so fucking sick of
everything and I do mean everything then

8
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm kinda like,
I almost excited to go back to work.

9
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,060
But this year has been a great thing.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,190
Other than seeing that
fucking have yourself a merry
little Christmas commercial,

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:45,840
like 58 fucking times.
Every God damn hockey game,

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,580
you know,

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,580
or that one with the Douche who who
he's got a family right already.

14
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,950
He's hateable,
you know.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,280
Oh is that your little fucking
fake television family?

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,171
You know,

17
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:04,620
that didn't notice the film crew watching
you guys having a Christmas and he

18
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,530
makes the home videos and
everybody fucking gets around,

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,320
you know the TV and they're all
tearing up. Whoa. What a set amount.

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,100
A little sad thing you made were
crying because we are so happy.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,260
Right?
Nobody trashes them

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,670
cause I'm a little sensitive little pussy.
Something homophobic,

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,020
like it would really go down.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,550
Now everybody is tolerant
of this fuck and his little,

25
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,890
uh,
always that movie with the chick,

26
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,370
with the Rose pedals coming
down on her tits, right or that,

27
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,730
and the kids film in the trash
and nobody understood a man.

28
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,450
That's who he should have been,
you know,

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,510
getting shot in the garage.
Whatever the fuck happened.

30
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,200
Something happened in the garage,
then somebody gets shot. You know,

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,800
I thought it was a little on
the nose that the hard ass guy,

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,870
I'm cross the street was gay.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,230
You know that whole thing that people
who hate gay people, it's secretly,

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,020
secretly because they're gay.
You know what I mean?

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,990
I'm not saying it doesn't happen,

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,920
but I mean people who hate the al Qaeda
is that cause they're secretly the al

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,810
Qaeda. Well, it metaphorically
speaking maybe, oh, gives a fuck.

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,570
I don't need to see the commercial
anymore. That's all I'm saying.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,100
Is that all you say? Oh, I take it
is I think that's what I'm saying.

40
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,950
You want to start an argument
and ruin my fucking holiday week.

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,610
I just told you consummate a good
mood. What more do I have to do? Um,

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,290
with holidays,

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,380
with the holidays comes family members,
dude.

44
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,360
Um, the reason why this podcast is extra
latest one cause I'm on vacation and I

45
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:53,190
don't give a fuck. You
know, I don't give a fuck.

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,450
All right. I'm trying to work, but it's
a half day for me too. Just like if you,

47
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:02,020
if you, if you've asshole boss made you
come in today to do the end of the year

48
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,120
spreadsheets, whatever the
hell you got to do. Right.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,000
And all you're hearing is fucking
a bowl game music and you had,

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,540
I understand you. That's where,
that's where I'm at. Okay.

51
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,420
So why don't I do a little longer podcasts
this week and help you limp through

52
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,960
your fucking half day.
You know the, you know,

53
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,460
you're the only port Basta that's
in the office right now. You know,

54
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,490
the boss trying to make you
feel like you're special.

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,070
I'll tell you only brought
my best employees today.

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,090
Then you six,

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,360
or at the top of the list of people that
I knew were in debt just far enough and

58
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:41,100
we'll raise just well enough to
not tell me to go fuck myself.

59
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:45,450
So that's why I asked you six.
I was wrong about the other two.

60
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,830
Um, so anyways, um, I couldn't do
the podcast today because I have a,

61
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,933
you know,

62
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,680
some relatives over here crashing with
me and I don't have a podcast studio

63
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,750
except for the all things
comedy podcast studio,

64
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:02,640
but I don't wanna use that when I
interview people. I'm like Dave Techno,

65
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,000
FIFA, miss that one. Um, other than
that, it just do what my fucking house.

66
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,730
So all my shit's downstairs.
You know,

67
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,090
one of my cousins is asleep downstairs.
I got the shit in there.

68
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,010
I don't want to wake them
up or whatever. So, uh,

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,170
I'm also doing my end of the year shit,

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,410
what I have to get all my
paperwork together, you know,

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,440
to make sure all the i's are dotted all
the t's across to make sure a February

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,650
there's a knock on the door from those
cons who were on the legal side of

73
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:30,360
stealing come up to me and say,
Oh,

74
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:35,010
do you have your paperwork so we can
take this money from you and then do

75
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:39,860
whatever the fuck we want
with it. You know? So, um,

76
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,520
I've been avoiding doing this,

77
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,170
but over the years of paperwork has
just gotten too big. And I went down,

78
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:50,310
this is what I did this morning.
Okay. During my vacation,

79
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,180
I drove down to staples and
I bought a file cabinet.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,760
I gotta tell you it was a

81
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,210
okay

82
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,600
if you two wasn't playing over the
speakers, and thank God for you too,

83
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:05,100
by the way,

84
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,100
that somehow something of that level
of quality can actually seep into the,

85
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,520
uh, the, the whatever, the, the, the
place selection at a fucking office Max.

86
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,980
You know,
it's brilliant,

87
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,030
but they can still be that
uplifting yet still be pop.

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,430
And still be played in a department store.

89
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,080
That was the only thing keeping me
going cause a fucking soul crushing.

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,170
I don't know what it is about buying a
file cabinet and I don't want to hear any

91
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:32,630
countries, the Oh first
world problems. You know,

92
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,390
you might have fucking people who've
never left the first world and don't even

93
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:38,420
know anything about the fucking third
world other than what the fuck they see on

94
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,680
TV, which is basically some fucking
reporter with an army helmet on,

95
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,000
standing and we're trying to get to,

96
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,830
we're trying to get more bambot and
have a fucking wealth built. I mean,

97
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:52,070
what do you know about the third world
before you tell me that before you lean

98
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:55,910
over your potato skins and a
fuck an Applebee's, you know,

99
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:58,790
and act like you're appreciating your,
your fucking lot in life.

100
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,310
You're eating potato skins.
Okay? They should be doing that.

101
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,210
The third world,
if they have nothing to live for,

102
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,460
stick that down your throat and
have a fucking heart attack.

103
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:11,700
Here you are living in the fucking best
goddamn situation she can possibly be in.

104
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,750
And what are you doing? Huh? You're
draining the oil out of your ass.

105
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,390
Sorry. So I go there. Yeah. Um, and,

106
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,430
and one the people too who I think even
used that expression first world problem,

107
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:28,151
didn't even know what it means.

108
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:31,120
They just heard enough people say
it and then they get a just, Oh,

109
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:34,960
you kind of say it during this part of
a conversation. I do that all the time.

110
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,280
I have all kinds of words in the English
language that I could not give you a

111
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:40,031
definition of,

112
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:43,360
but I could use perfectly in a sentence
cause I heard enough other people doing

113
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,200
it.
You know,

114
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,860
it's like all those people who can do
Michael Jackson's fucking leg kick with

115
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:52,030
the loafer, you know, can they go beyond
that? No, but they can do that part.

116
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,970
They've seen that park has, yeah,
they've seen that enough. Right.

117
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,200
Okay. But if you notice when they walk
down the street and out of the fucking

118
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:04,420
sidewalks lighten up. And that's
what I'm, that's my point.

119
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,670
If you can't do the fucking math on
that, then right. Get help. Yeah. Um,

120
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:12,470
so I go into this staples and,
uh, it was a good youtube song.

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,680
It wasn't one of their douchey ones.
Like beautiful day.

122
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,590
They fucking start slowing it
up. Good. I can fucking relax.

123
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,680
And then all of a sudden
Bano starts screaming at me.
What a beautiful day it is.

124
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,430
It's like, yeah, it was a beautiful day
until you started fucking screaming at me.

125
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,750
Why don't you tell the edge to take it
down to Larry to get off the fucking

126
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,720
crash cymbal? Maybe ride on a fucking
high hit, maybe take out the brushes,

127
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,440
get off. Um, anyway,

128
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,620
so I walk in there and
these are my selections.

129
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,400
There's either a, the staples. Okay.

130
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,030
First of all,
you hit,

131
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,290
you have the company that all we do
is we make file cabinets. All right?

132
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,320
And they have this fucking bandaid
beige four drawer fucking file cabinet,

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,433
you know?

134
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,660
Okay.

135
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,030
I just looked at it and
I, my, you know, I just,

136
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,950
I just stuff just felt something in
my chest just gave way. You know,

137
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,670
I think it was hope. Some
former hope. I Dunno.

138
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,140
Something like say I live 80 years,
you know,

139
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:26,950
I would've lived 80 years and a half
a day if I didn't do what I did this

140
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,320
morning. You know what I mean? I really,
I've been, and I believe that shit too.

141
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,430
I think anytime you're doing something
in life that you don't want to be doing,

142
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:37,790
I think that adds up. And
the other rent, you know,

143
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:42,791
you would have been 90 but in the end of
your life you die at 82 because if you

144
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,590
add up all those fucking moments
of going into staples, you know,

145
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:51,610
or we need batteries and standing in
line at the fucking drug store with the

146
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,680
skeleton shift yet.
Oh.

147
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:56,910
And there's nobody there to fucking unlock
God damn thing to get you the fucking

148
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,570
batteries. You've got to wait
till the fucking lines down.

149
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,100
So the chick behind the register and come,

150
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,000
all of that shit ends up adding
up to like eight and a half

151
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,640
years I your life. And that's
just trying to buy shit. You know?

152
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,320
Forget about if you're a living with
the wrong person. Oh. Speaking of which,

153
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,880
not to fucking,

154
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,110
not to air the dirty
laundry of my neighborhood.

155
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:23,050
That I got to tell you something.
All My neighbors,

156
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,500
I lucked out fucking great people,
but I got to have like three,

157
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,150
three doors up the fucking
street is this older couple.

158
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,250
I don't know how old they are. They
sound like they've been together forever,

159
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,230
but they, the width of the energy they
have when they scream at each other,

160
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,230
I still think they're
in their 50s you know,

161
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,360
like they got one more big contract
they can ask for four years.

162
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,140
You know, life's only going to give him
three and then they're gonna fucking,

163
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,570
they're gonna move to Seattle,
like can know. Right. So

164
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,600
when they yell at each other,
I swear to God.

165
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,153
Yeah.

166
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,220
The, the, the,

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I can't even the hate the fucking
bile when they yell at each other,

168
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,970
like they are so done with each other.
I see.

169
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,570
Every time there's a pause in
the argument, bye. He says,

170
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,070
fuck. I'm like, the
fuck. I can't even do it.

171
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,020
It's like,
it's not quite blood curdling scream.

172
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,490
Yeah.

173
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,900
And it's not quite just
like maniacal rage.

174
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,340
It's somewhere between the two.

175
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,640
Yeah.

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,030
That the only way you can duplicate it
as if you have that sort of pain in your

177
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:47,650
heart and they scream at each other and
every time they pause when there's that

178
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:51,280
pause, I've just, I went cause
I'm waiting to hear the gunshot.

179
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,953
You know what I mean?

180
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,073
I Dunno

181
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,970
inward then is up weird part too that I
as it also makes me feel good. Like wow,

182
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:02,140
I have a great relationship.

183
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,990
I mean I know we have a battles.
I know I've been a fucking idiot.

184
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,620
I've done everything I could to steer
it into the fucking fucking son.

185
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,950
But at the end of the day, I come home
with a chocolate chip cookie. I'd die.

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,690
Do what I gotta do. Right. So I
mean, I didn't know how the fuck,

187
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,860
what the hell was. I was back at
staples, don't back at staples.

188
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:30,130
And I'm looking at these
things. So I, and as always,

189
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:33,850
they get like one person at the register
and then one of the poor bastard who's

190
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,470
got to cover the whole fucking floor.

191
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,290
So I walk up there and I'm like looking
around, there's nobody to help me.

192
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,670
All they have is to shit on the floor.
I don't, there's no box I can grab.

193
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,840
It's in the back. So I just walk up
and I say to the lady at the register,

194
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:52,420
cause I see there's a guy with a two
wheeler helping somebody else with

195
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:56,620
something heavy and I
set it over his shoulder.

196
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,020
I was talking to the fucking
lady behind the register,

197
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,450
but he didn't realize that I go,
is anybody who can help me, uh,

198
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,320
get a file cabinet and without turning
around, he goes, I will help you sir,

199
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,510
when I'm done helping this customer.

200
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,170
So I immediately get it. The old
me would have been like, Hey,

201
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:17,711
first of all,

202
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:20,710
I wasn't talking to you and I understand
that you can't do two things at once.

203
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:23,320
All right? But I didn't, I
understood the whole fucking thing.

204
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,560
We said nothing to do with
him and nothing to do with me.

205
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,340
I guess I had to do with
me. You, I could've stepped
more to the side, you know,

206
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,080
had more of a, a straight on conversation
with the registered lady. But a,

207
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,990
I knew it was going on, this hit this,
this had, this came from corporate,

208
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,810
they will running as few
fucking people as possible.

209
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,250
This guy was having to do way too fucking
much for what he was getting paid for.

210
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,680
So that caused him to come at me the way
he was coming at me and I was coming at

211
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:52,120
them the way I was coming at them
cause I couldn't get any fucking help.

212
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:56,260
And in the end, the real concept created
a sitting on their Christmas yet.

213
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,220
So I let it go.
I just laughed or whatever.

214
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,730
And he came back and I made
a joke about how, you know,

215
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,930
he already have another five
guys out there helping them, um,

216
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,550
which relax the situation. So
now here we are, the two of us,

217
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:12,190
him having to cover way
too much square footage,

218
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,080
you know like a five on three and hockey
except it's the staples version of it,

219
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,580
you know, maybe like more like a
five on two if that was possible. So,

220
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,320
and there I am standing there trying to
pick out which file cabinet I want both

221
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:30,220
of us minutes just just
falling off of our lives.

222
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,780
And he got guys, so what's,
I guess I need this one here.

223
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,520
And I told him I go do, I can't believe
how depressing this system by this thing.

224
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:44,140
And he just started laughing and I
go, all right, so these look the same,

225
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,670
why is this one $50 more?
And he's like, all right,

226
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,520
that's a so and so.
They're known for making file cabinets,

227
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,310
they make the file cabinets and
that's just the staples version.

228
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,170
So I got all right, I start
pounding the file cabinet, you know,

229
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,960
listening to the sound hit,
neither one of them, you know,

230
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,740
trying to figure out which
one sounds more solid.

231
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:09,130
Obviously the guys that that's all
they do. There's sounds more solid.

232
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,450
Staples is trying to undercut
them being such douche bags.

233
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,100
They put this right next to it.

234
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:19,570
They make it the exact same color for
like 50 bucks less. Now I should say,

235
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:22,360
you know what,
fuck that file had cabinet people.

236
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,460
I should just save myself 50 bucks. But
that's not how I'm wired. I don't know why

237
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,910
I said fuck those staples cons like the
file cabinet people actually give a shit

238
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:37,130
about me.
I don't think they do.

239
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,220
But they give a shit enough to make a
fucking higher quality file cabinets.

240
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:44,860
So I go with that one. And uh, I dunno,

241
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,230
we wheel the fucking thing
out. I'm sitting there going,
can this fit in a Prius?

242
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,290
I have a truck. I didn't realize
I was going to buy this thing.

243
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,890
I was hoping it was
going to something else.

244
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,700
And I realized somewhere
between the fucking u two
song and the fucking boy band

245
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:03,530
that I had to buy a God damn file cabinet
and we'll laugh and we put the thing

246
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:06,140
in the back of the car. I tried to
tip him. He goes, no, no, no, no.

247
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,430
Cause this is what I do,
right.

248
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,740
The Guy who he's fucking won't
even take the Goddamn money.

249
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,780
So he leaves and I'm driving
this fucker thing home, you know,

250
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,150
feeling like that dude and the end of
the movie and last American Virgin when

251
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:24,020
this fucking chick cheats on them with
the dose should her up earlier and he's

252
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:27,140
driving away in the purple fucking station
wagon with the tear coming down his

253
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:31,700
eye. That's what I feel like. So a, I was
like, how can I turn this shit around?

254
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,211
So anyways,

255
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:35,750
they get back to the house or relative's
is still fucking sleep and I've got the

256
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:39,560
file cabinet, the back of the Prius. I'm
an old man, I got a bad back, you know,

257
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:42,920
but I got that German Irish blood. I'm
like, I'm, I'll fucking door myself.

258
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,750
I'll put it over my head. I'll open
the gate with my foot. Nall a slip,

259
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:50,330
another desk. And I was fine.
Like, you know what? Fuck this.

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,170
I'll wait till my cousin gets up.
That's all they say. Western mass.

261
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:59,060
Sometimes my cousin, um, I don't
even know if it's western mass.

262
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,270
I don't know where the fuck I heard
that in my travels. Uh, and I just said,

263
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,380
I'm just gonna fucking leave it there.

264
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,320
So I sit down and put it on
the TV and Lo and behold,

265
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,420
Lo and fuckable hold what's on television
as I put it on my favorite goddamn

266
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,270
show. All right, fast and loud.
The gas monkey garage guy.

267
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:15,520
So I'm sitting there
watching them and they,

268
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,590
everything they got to customize it and
all that type of shit. And you know what?

269
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,100
Okay,

270
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,340
I'm thinking about my stupid file cabinet.
How fucking cool their lives are,

271
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:26,070
their motorcycles and their awesome
cars and how they make everything look

272
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,420
fucking cool. And I was
like, you know what?

273
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,380
Why don't I have somebody fucking
paint this damn file cabinet.

274
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,050
I live in Los Angeles,
California.

275
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,340
We are hot riding hot rodding
allegedly started all,

276
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:41,610
they do the best interiors out here.
They do all these fucking great page jobs.

277
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:42,720
Why don't I get somebody,

278
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,430
it's fucking soul crushing
bandaid light brown.

279
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,970
It's even lighter than that. Throw a
little bit of cream in there just for you.

280
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:54,210
Lactose intolerant people didn't
make everybody puke on this podcast.

281
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,090
That's what it looks like.
So here's my question for you.

282
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,520
Does anybody know anybody
in the Los Angeles area?

283
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,200
Or I could bring a file cabinet over
there and they could paint it a color

284
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,030
that's gonna that's gonna make me
happy and I don't, I don't even need,

285
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,590
I don't need some fucking design.

286
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,820
Just put maybe the just m
m m m p on the side of it.

287
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:16,710
It's just something fucking
cool so I can look at it

288
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,330
and, and not just like, I mean, just
tap my shoulders slumped down like,

289
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,480
like that fucking quarterback for
the cowboys when he threw that last

290
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,070
interception against the eagles,
man.

291
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah.

292
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,593
Jesus Christ.

293
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:35,130
Are the cowboys fans paying enough
for their five fucking Superbowls?

294
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,830
Good Lord. A buddy of mine texted me
God's team before that, before the,

295
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,600
uh, before the game started. And uh,
I don't know what you guys did to him

296
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,250
and how will you, will you guys too
arrogant after you last Superbowl win?

297
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,570
What did you do to take
out your 10 gallon hat?

298
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:58,980
Take a shit in it and fucking put it
over a Steelers fans head or something.

299
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,760
I don't know what the fuck
he did, but Jesus Christ. Um,

300
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,800
I, I've, I've, you know,
I was a cowboys fan, uh,

301
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,070
right up until they fired Tom Landry
and texture, texture. I'm left any fire,

302
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,580
Tom Landry.
And it went from this stoic,

303
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,950
we do things the right
way over here to he here.

304
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,080
How about them cowboys? Hey, wait,

305
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:26,730
it just got to fucking cartoony for me.
Um,

306
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,660
even though I like all, I like
everybody on that team. Um,

307
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,350
and I think I rooted for him
and all the Superbowls didn't,

308
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,710
I played the bills twice and then
they played the Steelers. Yeah,

309
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,080
I had to root for him against
the Steelers cause I lost money.

310
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,480
First fucking Superbowl I bet was 78 game.

311
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,970
Arguably the greatest
amass of talent ever.

312
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,630
When the cowboys played the Steelers
and lost to him, I lost 75 cents,

313
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,320
which was a lot of fucking money to me
in the fourth grade. It was, you know,

314
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,260
that was a hot lunch back then.

315
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,060
So anyways,
so here's the deal.

316
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,170
If you guys know anybody out here that
would do it, would take it off, you know,

317
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,650
and up and come and paint or something
like that. I have some ideas.

318
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,900
I definitely have some ideas, you
know, uh, of some shit I want done.

319
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,090
And I would probably be great
if I could give you a fucking,

320
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,390
just hit me up on Twitter
or hit me up on Facebook.

321
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,670
Send me a message or something
like that. Uh, I don't know.

322
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:32,370
Turn this fucking thing and just
something I want to look at.

323
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,800
I'll pay you top dollar. I don't give a
fuck. Just I have to have a file cabinet.

324
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,343
All right.
Let's see.

325
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,940
I don't know what else to do with
all the papers I'm supposed to pick.

326
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:45,870
Keep for these fucking God
damn people run and shit.

327
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,930
I just can't look at this
fucking thing anymore. All right.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,430
I even left it in the box. Um, all right.

329
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,830

397
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,990
All right, what am I talking about now?
Uh, what did I do this weekend? Well,

398
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:22,991
I did some sets around town getting ready
for my bucket list show at the Wiltern

399
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:27,890
theater and I got some new ones
for you. Sons of bitches. Oh,

400
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:30,230
do I got some new ones?
I was out last night.

401
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,920
I went down to the comedy store and I
got to run my set twice because they're

402
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,960
awesome.
They get like two,

403
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:39,170
three shows going at all times down at
the wonderful comedy store and they put

404
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:43,460
me up twice and I had a great time.
And um,

405
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,200
I was doing that all weekend.

406
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,010
I did take Saturday night off
because I wanted to watch that UFC,

407
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,700
UFC championship.
Um,

408
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,810
UFC one 68 Anderson silver
versus that other guy.

409
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,370
I still don't know his name.

410
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,910
I haven't even taken the time to learn
his fucking name because I was so

411
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:06,260
convinced that you know that he lost the
first one just because he was fucking

412
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:10,820
around and Ah, I shouldn't know the
champ's name here. Let me look this up.

413
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,850
Anderson Silva

414
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,600
Verse Chris Weidman. Hope I'm saying
that right. We've Weidman. I'm sorry.

415
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,160
All right. I thought the writing
was on the wall because, uh,

416
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,390
Matt, that terrorists Sarah was
in his camp and I'm like, Oh man,

417
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:34,070
that's like when he knocked out George
Saint Pierre and everyone's going,

418
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:38,150
all George didn't fucking train and
Yada, Yada Yada. And then then, uh,

419
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,220
Matt, the terrorists, Sarah was going and
let them eat or drink wine or whatever.

420
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,390
I thought it was hilarious, but he ended
up coming back and beating him. Um,

421
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,050
you know, I'm not trashing obviously
Matt Serra at all, but I'm just saying,

422
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,320
so I just thought that maybe this was
going to happen again because the first

423
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:55,340
time they had the fight,

424
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,950
like I've watched Roy Jones Jr like
make fun of people or clown them is the

425
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:04,490
youth says, I never seen it done
at the level of that first fight.

426
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:07,640
It was like fucking ridiculous.
Um,

427
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,520
and he ended up making a stupid face.

428
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,810
The guy punched him and knocked him
out. So it's like, all right, you know,

429
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:16,310
he's coming in this time and he's just,

430
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,070
he's going to handle this
business right as the youth sis.

431
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,680
How do I get all his fucking hip
hop shit in my, I don't even know.

432
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:25,730
I don't even listen to
this stuff. Um, so anyways,

433
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,170
maybe cause it's ruled the charts for 15
years, Bill and, and it is mainstream.

434
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,710
Maybe you heard it. It's staples.
You Red Cunt. Um, so anyway,

435
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:38,700
so I get this fight cause I want to see,
uh, the rematch to see if this Chris, uh,

436
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,240
we'd been a Weidman
guy's for real crushes.

437
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,620
It kills me that I don't know his fucking,

438
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,090
that I'm not pronouncing
his name correctly. Um,

439
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,490
okay.

440
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,580
But anyways, I wanted to see that. And
then also I wanted to watch that, uh,

441
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,970
that Ronda Rousey,
uh,

442
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,670
Mishna Tate fight cause
me and the lovely Nia,

443
00:26:56,671 --> 00:27:00,990
we're watching the UFC fight club
fucking show the whole season.

444
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,560
And I gotta tell you, man, it was
an unbelievable night. Unbelievable,

445
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,870
unbelievable night of fights.
If you haven't ordered it yet,

446
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:08,040
it's totally worth the money.

447
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,450
And I had a bunch of people come over and,
uh,

448
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:16,290
we watched the fight and I'm
not, there's no sport. All right.

449
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,170
Spoiler alert if you, I don't know
if you live in under a fucking rock,

450
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,150
you weren't paying attention.
Uh,

451
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:24,450
Anderson Silver fucking
snapped his God damn leg.

452
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,570
Oh the second time this year I've seen it.

453
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:32,770
The Kid on Louisville and now
that it's just, it was not a,

454
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:36,740
it was not pretty, but I got to tell you
that and that the other dude Chris was,

455
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:41,400
was, was winning the fight at that
point. You know what I want to,

456
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:42,570
I want to ask Joe Rogan.

457
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:46,380
I got a call on his podcast because he
said something during that fight that I

458
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:51,150
thought was a really interesting,
where he said once you get knocked out,

459
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,021
you know,

460
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:59,021
you're never the same as far as your
ability to I guess take a punch like that

461
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:00,950
again. Like I, I don't,

462
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:03,950
I didn't quite understand it cause
that's not like you lose brain fluid.

463
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,470
It's still sitting in
the same amount of fluid,

464
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,810
but maybe I don't know what's going on.

465
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:11,540
So I wanted to ask him about that
because I found that really fascinating

466
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,720
because I remember Roy Jones
Jr no one could ever touch him.

467
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,540
And then he finally got knocked
out and after he got knocked out,

468
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:22,220
it seemed easier with each time to knock
them out and people were trying to say,

469
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:24,470
Oh, you know, uh, the, the,

470
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,420
the air of invincibility has gone and I
didn't think that. I just, it seemed like

471
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,890
something, there was something
different about them. I Dunno.

472
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,760
I found that really interesting.
So next time I run into him,

473
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,020
I'm definitely going to ask him about it.

474
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,190
I thought I had a lot to say about
that, that UFC shit. I guess I didn't,

475
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,420
I was just get blown away. How fucking
tough those guys are. You know, like,

476
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,610
I'll tell you one thing that
that guy who came in, the guy,

477
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:54,530
the lumberjack guy who was really in
bad shape for an ultimate fighter,

478
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,380
I,
we were sitting there watching and going,

479
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,270
this guy has the fucking torso
of like a regional manager.

480
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,380
If he didn't have that,

481
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:04,670
I will murder your whole family and
then sit down and eat soup afterwards.

482
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:08,270
Look on his face. One of the most
terrifying looks I've ever seen.

483
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:12,860
He came in like, not like, I'm going to
beat you. He's like, I'm going to like,

484
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:14,630
I was know he was going
to kill the other guy.

485
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,510
So they end up having their fight and uh,

486
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,600
all fucking awful torso takes a
knee to the head, drops to his legs,

487
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:28,720
grabs the other guys, drops to his
knees, grabs the other guy's legs.

488
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:31,240
And this guy range like,

489
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,670
I dunno for elbows and he must've been
using the perfect technique because when

490
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,080
they showed it in slow motion,

491
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,240
it was almost like this beginning of
a break dance move. It was very, uh,

492
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:47,920
fluid the way he was doing it with the
eye, with a little bit of Flair, you know,

493
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:52,320
it wasn't like, it was just bringing
it up like a jerk off like me. Like,

494
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,610
Heh, Heh, Heh.

495
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,600
It was like,
it was like this aerodynamic,

496
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,660
I don't know what he was doing.

497
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,620
I look fucking great.
He should have a little pinky out was,

498
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,900
it was like six of the classiest fucking
elbows to the side of the head I've

499
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:11,700
ever seen. And that was the end of that
lumber jack in any murderous thoughts.

500
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:15,340
He ever had had? Why is
my voice cracking? Um,

501
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,740
I dunno.
I always liked seeing that.

502
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:20,770
I love seeing when a guy goes into the
octagon and I just see the look on his

503
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:25,771
face and I feel whatever manhood I even
possess just drain out of me and just

504
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:29,050
see the other guy just lacrosse
ring like Ooh, that's a tough look.

505
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:32,710
You got there with gauge with gage
gage and then it's fucking over,

506
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,910
you know? Then you wish you could do
some something like that. You know,

507
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,420
maybe just some terrorist on a flight
and then you land the plane and they want

508
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,500
to give you the key to the city,

509
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:43,570
but you don't show up cause
you to fucking cool for it.

510
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,540
Anybody else just go on those
long fantasies like that? I do it.

511
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,150
I do it all the time. You know
what? I want to apologize for it.

512
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,070
I like living in my own little world,
tweed. My two years I in my two ears,

513
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:58,120
I am a hell of a fucking guy.
I'm a war veteran.

514
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm a hero. I know how to fuck
well, I'm good at math. It just,

515
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:03,994
it's endless.

516
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,273
MMM.

517
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,040
Anybody watching any of
the NFL football yesterday?

518
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,490
Um, I actually went on a
hike yesterday, you know,

519
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,940
like the half a twinkle toes I m and a
with another buddy of mine just to make

520
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:28,050
it even a more homoerotic and uh,

521
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,550
I dunno, I wasn't interested in
any of the earlier fucking games

522
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,820
and plus I've been eating like shit,
you know,

523
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:37,440
with the holiday food and everything.
So I was like,

524
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:41,070
I gotta get out at least to try to walk
around a little bit so we decide when

525
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:43,550
you're going, what we're going
to go on this hike. And uh,

526
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,600
we just kept extending it and extending
it and extending it and I knew I was

527
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:51,480
going to pay the price for it. Long
story short, we get fucking lost.

528
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,670
We tried to cut down this one rich and it
just ended up getting so fucking steep.

529
00:31:56,671 --> 00:32:01,020
Like, I was just like, if one of us
falls, um, I'm not saying we're, we're,

530
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:02,790
we're going to die from the fall,

531
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:07,080
but we're going to die from laying there
for four days until coyotes finally

532
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:10,680
find us and like just pick us apart.
You know,

533
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,270
as we try, if we were just
laying on our backs, you know,

534
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,370
making those noises you make as you're
trying to fight off jackals with a stick,

535
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,090
you know? Um, I would stab
myself with a stick. Personally,

536
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,190
I'd always take the coward way up,

537
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,910
how going to feel that wild animals
breath up against my ear lobes if it's

538
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:37,200
trying to get a better fucking lock on
my neck. I don't, I don't need that.

539
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,540
I don't need that. Um, Oh, speaking
of if some reason that made me feel,

540
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:46,040
think of Ronda Rousey has she just fucking
gradually got the arm bar going there.

541
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,493
Um,

542
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,100
people flipped out when she
didn't shake hands afterwards.

543
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,580
They were born the shit out of her.
I thought it was a great fight.

544
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,150
I'm a right if they don't
shake hands afterwards, hey,

545
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:59,160
how about after you
fucking break their arm?

546
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:03,000
You show a little bit of class and shake
the fucking arm that he didn't break.

547
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,870
It gives a fuck. You know
I liked it. I enjoyed it.

548
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,370
I liked that you did shake the heads.
What does that teach the kids?

549
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,760
What does that teach him?
You know what that done?

550
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,160
Punching their friend in the face
and then fucking snap and their arm.

551
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:21,840
Or if they don't get up and shake
their fucking quivering hand.

552
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,360
I liked it. I enjoyed it. Oh
the lovely Nia. Everybody.
She was going shush. Shush.

553
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:31,350
I have things to do. Are you
with your fancy shoes? That's it.

554
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,620
You look great. Thank you. Alright. Um,

555
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,520
anyways, the fuck was
I talking about? Yeah,

556
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:45,460
I enjoyed it and I didn't have a problem
that she didn't fucking shake your hand

557
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:48,510
up. I liked both fighters and
I wish him well. Oh look at me.

558
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,120
We get a goddamn doubled
the diplomat here. Anyways.

559
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:55,710
What the fuck was I just talking about?

560
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,130
Oh, it's talking about a NFL football
on another, the hike. That's right.

561
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,400
So we ended up getting lost when?
20 minutes in the wrong direction.

562
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:07,360
So those of you who are halfway decent in
math, it's a 40 minute fucking mistake.

563
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,480
And uh,
we were just laughing by the end,

564
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,220
we ended up being a four hour hike.

565
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,150
My buddy's like one of these dudes
who's like really into technology.

566
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,470
So with every hike he has something else.
You know,

567
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,340
I got an APP on my phone that
hell tell us how far we went.

568
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,820
He starts with that and then the next day,
yeah,

569
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:32,821
I got a bracelet that's measuring all
the calories I'm burning gave you some

570
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:38,430
sort of indicate it's like, cause
the fuck he gives a fuck. He's into,

571
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,880
he's into that ship. So, um,

572
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,320
okay.

573
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,080
I think at the hike ended
up being like 11 miles.

574
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:50,110
We like walked half a marathon and the
running joke was I was going to be back

575
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:53,750
in time for the one o'clock kickoff,
one o'clock out here for the pats game.

576
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,890
And it was every mistake we made,
I just kept saying like,

577
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,410
am I going to have to have
Nia tape the fucking game?

578
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,270
We ran out of water and um,
but you know,

579
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,680
we weren't near enough to civilization.

580
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:11,090
There was other hikers there in that
type of shit. But it was a, I dunno,

581
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,680
all I know is I ate like shit when I came
back and I still woke up today with a

582
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:19,390
flatter stomach than I had yesterday. That
is how far we hiked. And you know what?

583
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:19,520
Well what

584
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,090
people, that's the end of
my mediocre hiking story.

585
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:29,000
We're taking callers. Does anybody else
have a mediocre and hiking fucking story?

586
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,940
Um, all right, let's get to
some questions for this week.

587
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,870
I didn't talk about the Patriots game.
Um,

588
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,030
fucking great game could not finish off.
Uh,

589
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,780
should have lost the game if
the bills didn't, I dunno.

590
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,770
I Dunno what they were doing.
I actually tweeted in the,

591
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,620
the end of the third
quarter actually tweeted,

592
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,190
did the bills bet the Patriots?
And I got to tell you,

593
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:55,860
the amount of people who thought,
who read that is,

594
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:59,040
did the bills beat the Patriots?
And I got all these people.

595
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,870
Why don't you just look it up instead of
tweeting a bar? You Dom can't. So I get,

596
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,770
I got to write back to a bunch
of people going bet that beat.

597
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,280
I didn't say anything mean
I didn't trash them at all.

598
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,350
I just corrected them cause I knew that
that would hurt more. And you know me.

599
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,520
You know what I mean?

600
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,900
From Twitter's to fatties I'm all about
shaming cause that's how I was brought

601
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:25,380
up. Um, patriots bills, everybody, uh,

602
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,460
I don't know what to say about the
game other than it fucking rained.

603
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:34,030
I'm happy that we won another unbelievably
successful season for the Patriots.

604
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:39,031
I think Tom Brady had is arguably his
best season just considering what the fuck

605
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:43,360
he was working with now that the
defense route rose to the occasion.

606
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,100
But having said all of that,

607
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,490
I will be surprised if we win
more than one playoff game.

608
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:52,540
And I won't be surprised if we're
one and done just because, uh,

609
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,830
well the UFC is kind of weak, but I
dunno. It's a just, it's different.

610
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,670
It's different when it comes to January.
She probably gotta be asking yourself,

611
00:37:00,671 --> 00:37:03,760
well then who you pick and bill you
staying with the fucking dirty birds out

612
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:06,640
there. The Seahawks, I guess.
Dirty birds of the Falcons? Yeah,

613
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,250
I think it's the Seahawks,
the loose,

614
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,660
it's huge that they got the home field
because for some reason I don't know why

615
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,080
they don't quite play as well on the road,
but they still ended up with what,

616
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:22,030
13 and three. I definitely think
at that it's theirs to lose. Um,

617
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,670
I dunno,
I was in Europe for fucking three weeks,

618
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:26,930
so I missed a lot of the football.

619
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:30,800
I can't really even talk intelligently
about who I think could beat them.

620
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,290
You know,

621
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:38,060
my buddy's saying the 40 niners that's
always a good pick to pick a division

622
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:41,080
rival cause they know each other so well.
Uh,

623
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,330
but I definitely think it's theirs to
lose and it would be nice to see them

624
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:49,070
finally win a Superbowl and give their
fans something to actually be loud about.

625
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,020
I know I've trashed a lot of the Seattle
fans for that dumb record, but I do,

626
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,611
you know what?
I didn't know.

627
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:59,611
It just annoyed me that your owner fucked
you so bad on those premium beers and

628
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,620
you guys busted him for it.

629
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:08,850
And then immediately he just gets back
in your good graces by just stroking your

630
00:38:09,611 --> 00:38:14,080
fucking balls, taint and ass hole
with this loudest fans. Horseshit.

631
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,410
How much money did he make
off of that fucking beer?

632
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,300
Fucking you guys over as you sat there
screaming your fucking heads off,

633
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,510
you know that's all it takes.
A couple of trinkets,

634
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,400
little placard on the
wall and everybody goes.

635
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,790
Actually somebody said tonight that last
night I was talking to this other comic

636
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,090
and he was telling me how he likes the
pope and I like to pump like this guy.

637
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:35,950
He said, he's cool with atheist. You know,

638
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:38,170
they don't mind if gay people
get married and blah, blah, blah.

639
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,020
It's like that's because
they're hemorrhaging cash

640
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,080
in the fucking West. In the northern
hemisphere. It's a business.

641
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:50,700
They're only adding people down in
South America, but as far as up here,

642
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,000
they're fucked.
They're losing people day by day,

643
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,480
so they have to adjust
their message the same way.

644
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,840
When BP was involved in
that horrific oil spill,

645
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,760
all of a sudden now their logo is
painted in the color of grass and corn or

646
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:10,690
sunlight. Hey man, it's great they
care about the framing mia, that's,

647
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,410
that's,
that's what the Seahawks owner did.

648
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,960
He was doing that boss Hog shit and you
guys caught them or somebody caught him.

649
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,770
I got to give you guys the link to
that video. They had the thing right?

650
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:26,570
They had the tall beer, the premium
fucking bear, the cost more.

651
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,110
And then they had the short fat one and
somebody finally sucked down a short fat

652
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:34,920
one and then poured the tall one into the
short fat one is the exact same amount

653
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:38,100
of ounces. They didn't have the
decency to make it two ounces more.

654
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:40,560
So it kind of spilled over
and that would have ended it.

655
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,300
They was so fucking cheap.

656
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,480
I'm going to halfway through this and
I'm forgetting if the actually was the

657
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:48,390
Seahawks owner, but I'm too
far. I'm in too deep now. I
just gotta go with the lie.

658
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,710
Maybe it's the truth. That's what
they did. So what does he do?

659
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,650
He starts getting fucking
former celebrities,

660
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,380
people from top gun to come up there
and ring that bell to get the 12th man

661
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,223
thing going.

662
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,180
He just stroked your fucking
balls and you bought into what?

663
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:09,000
He's not your friend. All
right. And having said all that,

664
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:12,190
I hope you guys won a championship
because I like to see hawks way back, uh,

665
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,160
when they had Jim Zorn and Steve
Largent, David, Greg, Kurt Warner.

666
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,360
I liked those teams. Um, I absolutely, I'm
not being a Douche share. I don't mind.

667
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:25,310
You knew they were one of the few teams
that had a nice uniform and actually was

668
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:29,610
sort of a lateral move. But
I liked the older ones. Man.
I like that silver helmet.

669
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,690
I thought it was fucking
cool. Um, all right.

670
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,220
Enough with my half ass.

671
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,450
Okay.

672
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,110
Half ass fucking NFL talk. Uh, I am
going to the pro bowl again this year.

673
00:40:40,111 --> 00:40:42,910
People in this time, I'm hoping
I'm going to make it. Um,

674
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,130
last year I ended up getting some active
work, but it was uh, was actually, oh,

675
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,250
I never told you guys this story.
It's my blues.

676
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,180
The final episode I got to do on a
breaking bad and I won't ruin it because I

677
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:56,100
know people are watching the thing,

678
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:59,430
but it's basically it's a scene in the,
well,

679
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:02,340
you know what it is because you'll watch
the last half of the fifth episode and

680
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:03,091
you'll see the last one.

681
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:05,940
I'm in that scene where I'm sitting in
the car with those two other characters.

682
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,150
Um,
that was,

683
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,230
I had a gig Saturday night in Honolulu.

684
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,883
Um,

685
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,910
and then the next day me and Jay law
had Rosebowl legend and one of the,

686
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:25,720
uh, comedians on the show
tomorrow night at the Wiltern. Um,

687
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,100
we did the show and then the next day
we were going to go to the pro bowl.

688
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,750
And uh,

689
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,390
okay.

690
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,980
I Dunno,
there's this running joke in show

691
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,710
business that if you want a book
acting work, you know, books,

692
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,540
some sort of vacation book,
some sort of fun.

693
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,850
Because if you're sitting
there watching the phone,

694
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,960
like you will not work for 10 years.
But if you go, you know what, fuck this,

695
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm going to go, I'm gonna
go, I'm gonna go. I Dunno.

696
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,820
We're going to go on a fucking vacation.

697
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,830
I don't know what money you'd go with
if you weren't getting act and work,

698
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:54,440
but whatever. Do you
just plan something? Hey,

699
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:56,240
me and my boys are going to
go to this game immediately.

700
00:41:56,241 --> 00:42:00,690
You're getting acting work.
So it's kind of, it's kind
of a good thing. But uh, mmm.

701
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,010
So anyways,
I had to,

702
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:06,940
I did the Gig and then I literally had
to fly back to la the very next day and

703
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,390
then from La to Albuquerque,
New Mexico,

704
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,370
and then we were the
first one out of the gate.

705
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,590
That's why I couldn't go to the game.
I remember that. We shot that scene.

706
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:15,424
It like a,

707
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,030
okay.

708
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,550
God, what was it? I think the call
time was like five in the morning,

709
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,051
five in the morning.

710
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:25,250
And I think we started shooting at
six and we were done by like six 30.

711
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,580
Like that was the thing about
when you did that show was the,

712
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:30,200
everybody was so god damn good.

713
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,993
MMM.

714
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,000
They just had the coverage.
They had the dialogue,

715
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:40,280
they just had it down and uh, I
dunno, they made you look great.

716
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:42,320
So all I did was just make sure
I always knew my lines. No,

717
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:44,630
you fucking lines say what they wrote.

718
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:47,080
Hit your mark and they're going
to make you look great. And uh,

719
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,950
the other two guys were regulars,

720
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:51,890
so they were an awesome so they
know what the fuck they were doing.

721
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:55,790
So we are in and out of there and like he
had an eye. There were like 30 minutes.

722
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,580
Oh, back to back. Mediocre
Story. I'm fucking crushing it.

723
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:06,500
Just slapping signals to the opposite
field. Hitting for average here, people.

724
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,830
Um, anyways. All right,

725
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,300
so let's, let's go here. All right,
let's, let's read some of the letters,

726
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,170
some of the letters.
How come there's not a new year song?

727
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:26,171
I feel like singing this week and then
all areas is that awful one awful fucking

728
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:31,070
won. What is that? How's it going? Hey,

729
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:34,460
he's a jolly good fellow,
right? Is that how it goes?

730
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:40,270
Shut all the acquaintance be
forgot and never abroad to ma.

731
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,350
I never understood what that meant.

732
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,810
I don't know what all anxiety means.
It's just a sad fucking,

733
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:53,670
I had grapes of Wrath kind
of shit. Just, you know,

734
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:57,090
I just feel like I'm in the dust bowl
when I sing that fucking song. It's just,

735
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,820
it's not a happy song. Ah, Jesus. Bill,

736
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,690
Jesus Christ. Who pissed in your cheerios?
Um, all right. Newsletter pay bill.

737
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,250
Do you have a newsletter to let me know
when you'll be live in the south again?

738
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:16,320
Um, I announced him on this
podcast and I, I announced it, uh,

739
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,800
via Twitter and Facebook or whatever.
That's basically how I do it.

740
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:22,340
Speaking of which,
uh,

741
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,480
we have almost got all the dates for the
Canadian tour lined up and I'll let you

742
00:44:27,571 --> 00:44:30,030
know I'm going to some
fucking places that a,

743
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:33,060
I never thought I'd so it's
not just a hockey cities.

744
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:38,061
I'm also going to other ones just to get
your Canadian hopes up that you're not

745
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:41,510
going to have to drive over
to another province. Um,

746
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,480
I probably shouldn't have done that,
but uh, there's definitely some, uh,

747
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,840
some pretty fucking
that's going to be fun.

748
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,690
It's going to be fun and I'm
bringing my hockey stuff up there.

749
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,600
I'm going to figure out where there's
a pond hockey game or someplace where I

750
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:56,550
can play and I want to go up
there and get embarrassed.

751
00:44:56,551 --> 00:45:00,900
I want you people up there in Canada did
show me once and for all that it is in

752
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:05,820
fact your game. Okay. Um, I don't know.

753
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:09,090
I'm going to figure out that I want to
do that and I want to get drunk and do

754
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:14,010
some curling and I, I feel like my
time up there will be a complete,

755
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,900
okay, I want to do that and I
want you to help me do that.

756
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:19,734
So next week,

757
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:24,050
but then the week I'm going to announce
the dates for the Canadian tour and um,

758
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,310
or at least to cities and then I don't,

759
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,220
the reason why I don't do it
is because then people go to,

760
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,240
is there a link and then there's not a
link. Well, when is it going to be a link?

761
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,200
I just like to fucking put it out there
when I have all the information. Like,

762
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,020
Hey, I'm coming to Canada. I can tell
you this. It is going to be in March.

763
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:45,330
All right. There you go. All right,
here we go. Okay. Friends, cheating.

764
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:47,460
Wife a there.

765
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:52,140
Billy bad AI is a longtime fan. Love
your comedy. Thank you very much.

766
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,471
Uh,

767
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:57,471
I'm currently in the air force and one
of my coworker's wife is a total slut.

768
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,420
Now wait a minute. Let's see what she's
done here. My wife and his wife friends.

769
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,710
Oh wait. My wife and his
wife's friends are friends,

770
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,080
so she shares a lot of details with her.

771
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,850
She's sleeping with numerous guys on
base and a couple of guys in our work

772
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:18,900
section. Oh No. And she's
telling your wife about it.
What she wants to get caught?

773
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,501
Uh,

774
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:24,501
the messed up thing is that he knows
all the guys that she's messing around

775
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:28,050
with. In the past, my
coworker was a real dog,

776
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,240
but he's cleaned up his
act since getting married.

777
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,110
He did all his dirt before
marriage or before marriage.

778
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,890
But she sees this as a
payback. Oh. Oh, well.

779
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:41,400
What the fuck that they never
should have gotten married.

780
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:42,950
Yeah.

781
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,170
I mean, I'm not going to judge
anybody in the store. You know,

782
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:49,040
they have it for the grace of God. Go
I, I was a piece of shit, you know,

783
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,890
but they,
they shouldn't have gotten married.

784
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,470
Okay.

785
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,540
He did all his dirt before marriage,

786
00:46:55,541 --> 00:47:00,541
but sees this is payback and even told
my wife that she only married him for the

787
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:02,704
benefits.

788
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,270
Okay.

789
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,850
Yeah. Well, what are you going
to do? This thing was, uh,

790
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,170
this was built in sand with
some toxic waste in it.

791
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:16,120
It's so crazy that one of the married guys
she's sleeping with, sat at the table,

792
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,120
the same table with us during
our annual Christmas party.

793
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,360
That's not the bad part.
They have two children together.

794
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,290
Every time we deploy for six months,

795
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:31,000
she brings the guys to their house.
Wow.

796
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,410
Dragging the kids into it.

797
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:33,620
Okay.

798
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,440
Oh right. She went Jordan on
that. She just took the fucking,

799
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,170
she should change the game there.

800
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,970
I'm leaving this base soon and I
feel that I should say something,

801
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,520
if not directly, maybe indirectly,
to help him figure it out himself.

802
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,540
What do you, what do you
think? Maybe you think,

803
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,020
yeah,

804
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,550
maybe you think about
making a stop in Guam. Oh,

805
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:01,960
you went the other way. Okay. Uh,

806
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:04,510
I'll be there for the next three months
and I know that you'd kill with the

807
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:06,760
military community. Do what?
I'd fucking go to Guam.

808
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:12,000
It's not from the Spanish
American war there. Um,

809
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,530
uh, Jesus Christ. So obviously he was
fucking around before they got married

810
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,340
and now, oh, now he's stopped.

811
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,470
Okay.

812
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,150
This is a,
this is a friend of yours.

813
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,110
Uh,

814
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,960
I'm currently air force and one was my
coworker's wife, so he's a coworker.

815
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,530
All right, well, let's see.

816
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:45,470
I think this is up to you if you want
to get involved in this thing. Um,

817
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,940
I dunno how about anonymous letter?
No,

818
00:48:49,941 --> 00:48:52,090
I don't do that because then
he's trying to think who knows?

819
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:56,720
And who doesn't know? I Dunno, Dude.
I don't know how to cross that one.

820
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,250
I don't know how to cross that one.
Um,

821
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,003
yeah,

822
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,970
tell him I don't know. We'll
look at, you know what,

823
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,810
it's hard to have sympathy for them.
I mean, you can't sit there and uh,

824
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,870
do that to somebody and think they're
not going to do it back to you.

825
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,010
I've learned all the lessons in this
fucking story and my horrific fucking

826
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:25,990
single life. So, uh, I got, you know,

827
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:27,700
sorry,
how do I tell this one?

828
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,520
Okay.

829
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,970
I knew a guy, I know a bloke. No, no,

830
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:36,780
it was a bloke and now a bloke that uh,

831
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:39,471
how do I say this?

832
00:49:39,471 --> 00:49:42,080
He was going to get married to this girl
and he knew that she was fucking around

833
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:46,940
on him and he went and told the dude
and the dude didn't believe him and then

834
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:49,160
got mad at him and then
stopped being friends with him.

835
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,580
And then he went on and had two kids
and she continued to fuck around and 10

836
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:56,450
years later he's paying alimony
and child support. So, um,

837
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,640
it all depends on your piece of mind.
I mean,

838
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,770
this guy is in front of you is what
the fuck? Just say like, look, dude,

839
00:50:00,771 --> 00:50:03,080
we're not friends. I'm leaving.
I don't have a dog in this fight.

840
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:07,200
I just feel like he should know. I
guess that that's what I would do. Uh,

841
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,770
you should do it.
You should do it for the fucking kids.

842
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:16,610
Good Lord. Good Lord. Good Lord.
Those kids are going to be fucked up.

843
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,170
They're already fucked up.
It's over.

844
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,310
So Jesus Christ,

845
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,600
if they would dogs, they put them all down
in the street. They're all [inaudible].

846
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,600
They all got rabies at this point.
Terrible, terrible, terrible things.

847
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,120
Terrible things are done. Jesus Christ.
That was a horrible fucking story.

848
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,250
A burst doc, whatever
that means. Bergen stock,

849
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:45,380
um, long time. Uh, Billy
freedom trail. Longtime Fan.

850
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:46,940
I was wondering to myself the other day,

851
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:49,850
how much longer until we
get a bill burr event,

852
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,430
some type of festival and event.
Well,

853
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:55,100
you're the ring master
and master of ceremonies.

854
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,870
You could host pie eating contest.
I'd make the fucking pies a judge,

855
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:03,740
a beauty pageant,
actually a pie eating contest.

856
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,850
They don't really make good pies,
do they? They just sort of bullshit.

857
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,130
You just eat out the filling a judge,

858
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:14,390
a beauty pageant and cut a ribbon with
the novelty size. Pair scissors. Do to,

859
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:17,930
if I could judge a pig too, I would
do this. You set it up. I'll do it.

860
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,620
Vendors will sell Turkey legs,
cotton candy and fried dough.

861
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,560
Babies will get their faces painted.
Uh,

862
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,260
and while you're not hosting an event,

863
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:30,980
you'll be walking around the grounds in
a seersucker suit. Dude, I'm fucking in.

864
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,330
You'll probably say something about
not many people coming up for it.

865
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,830
That's not true. A few thousand
people would come out. Uh, Liz Walker.

866
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:43,700
We'll cover it on the six o'clock news
and the following year there'll be 10,000

867
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:46,790
people will fly in from lots of places.
If they get enough notice.

868
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,910
Don't bother explaining
why this is a bad idea.

869
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,830
Every one of your listeners is
adding up their vacation days. Dude,

870
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,060
this is fucking, you know what? I
don't know if I want to host it,

871
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:59,390
but I want to go to it.
I want to go there with this though.

872
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:02,840
I want to go to something
with his fucking a prize pig.

873
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,970
That's what people are fighting for.

874
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:06,630
Yeah,

875
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,450
I would do that in a
second, sir. You set it up.

876
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:15,170
You set it up and I would
change and I would bring in,
uh, what else would I have?

877
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,690
Okay.

878
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:18,980
He needs some sort of music.

879
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,750
Okay.

880
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,050
You know what,
I bring more in like street performance.

881
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,090
I know a couple of them from
back in the day in my, uh,

882
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:29,410
when I was living in New York,

883
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,120
it was a couple of guys that I knew that
were fucking great and I actually did a

884
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,740
comedy show and I had one of them come
down and perform and uh, he crushed it.

885
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,280
I'd add that element to it.
So what you do with this is what you do.

886
00:52:42,281 --> 00:52:45,500
You have a little backward shit going on.
You do it in the backwoods.

887
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,470
So all the backwoods people show up.
But then you know,

888
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:49,250
what about the people who live
in the backwoods and there,

889
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:50,910
but they were into shit
beyond the back woods.

890
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,530
That's when you bring in the street
performers from New York. Right.

891
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,730
So people think that even though it's
down home, it's also a little dope.

892
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,690
Is that the kids used to say
that are now older than me. Um,

893
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,180
okay.

894
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,100
I would do something like that.
I,

895
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,950
any of that shit that's
considered fucking, uh,

896
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,530
I dunno what it's considered.

897
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,860
It's looked down upon by a lot of
people out here in Hollywood. You know,

898
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,040
who think that you know,
those debts,

899
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:21,040
they'll fly over state stuff and that
there are a cut above because they write

900
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:24,730
jokes for four camera shoot sitcoms,
um,

901
00:53:24,731 --> 00:53:26,070
with next door neighbors.

902
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,440
Um,
I like all that shit.

903
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:30,463
Yeah.

904
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:34,270
Do it. Set it up. You get the
ball rolling. I'll fucking do it.

905
00:53:34,271 --> 00:53:38,560
Throwing some fucking some sort
of car. Show a prize pig. Right?

906
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:43,120
There's gotta be some sort of blue ribbon,
one for a farm animal. I already know.

907
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:45,260
There's like a zillion of these things.
Just tell me where to go. I want,

908
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:49,030
I want to go to one of these things.
Do I get to shoot a fucking gun? Hey,

909
00:53:49,031 --> 00:53:52,420
by the way, I just saw, um, somebody
recommended this last night.

910
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:57,450
I just watched a bobcat Goldthwait
bobcat Goldthwait can't even talk today.

911
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,930
Yeah. Made this movie called
God bless America. Uh,

912
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,520
I'm going to go out on a limb and
say that it's a dark comedy. Uh,

913
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:08,080
it's on Netflix.
Check it out.

914
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,260
I'm still working my way through
the first season of the killing.

915
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:15,700
Just giving these people off free.
Fucking Nah, what do you call it?

916
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,600
Shout outs here. You know I do
this because then you guys go, oh,

917
00:54:19,601 --> 00:54:23,350
we should check this out. You should
check this up. Um, you know, I actually,

918
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:26,140
somebody told me a book I should order
and I ordered the fucking thing and it

919
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:30,870
never, it never showed up. I
ordered shit and it doesn't show up.

920
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,630
I think I don't hit the
complete the deal button,

921
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:41,120
but what do you, there's no
store to go to. It's fucking
genius. I don't even know.

922
00:54:41,121 --> 00:54:45,320
Where is amazon.com based out of,
where is that store?

923
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,430
Is that information exist? We're
in. They do buy. There's no taxes.

924
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:54,070
Everything's free. And
it is wonderful. Oprah.

925
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,060
Turn your fucking head to the left
and see the tent city on the horizon.

926
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:03,100
All right. Yeah, I would
do that. I would do that.

927
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:08,110
I would go to a Rodeo. I do any of that
shit. All right. Girlfriend hates you.

928
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,400
Well, she should, uh, deal dear Burbank.

929
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,160
Read slowly buddy.
I know you can do it.

930
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,180
Yeah,

931
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,810
he wrote it in all capital letters to ah,
your ball busting content.

932
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,710
That was a funny one. It's not too old one
is it? Holy Shit. Where did the day go?

933
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:33,260
Um, all right. All right. Travel
all over the country as you do.

934
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,750
Except I don't do it to make people laugh.

935
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,760
I do it so my current boss can
make money anyway. Lately I've,

936
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,230
lately I've been listening to your podcast
and my truck and my girlfriend can't

937
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:50,180
stand it. She literally hates your
guts simply because you curse.

938
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,640
What the fuck?
Uh,

939
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:56,740
we ended up making deals where we
listened to 10 minutes of Bullshit Beyonce

940
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,170
than 10 minutes of your podcast.
God Damn it.

941
00:56:00,171 --> 00:56:04,610
I tried to tell her that your podcasts
make my day and that you are hilarious

942
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,190
and generally a good guy,
but she totally disagrees.

943
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,650
Can you tell her a few things
that you do that are nice, uh,

944
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,800
besides the fact that you make
people laugh for a living,
which should be enough.

945
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,670
No, it shouldn't cause I get paid
for the uh, like charity work,

946
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:23,560
going to the make a wish
foundation or whatever. Fuck.

947
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,510
Let her know you aren't a conch,

948
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:30,550
even though you are much love from
your Canadian friend, Ole, Ole, Ole,

949
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:34,210
Ole. He wrote, Oh, first of all,

950
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,840
sir,
I don't need your girlfriends approval.

951
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,620
I don't give a shit what she thinks
about me. Breach for a wrist.

952
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,820
Make sure she doesn't shut
this off. Okay. Hey Lady,

953
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,820
look what you're doing to the man
in your life right now. You make it.

954
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:53,470
I'm so fucking miserable. He enjoys this
podcast. He likes that I fucking curse.

955
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,440
He likes it.
Can you just have that?

956
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:57,730
Yeah.

957
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,370
What's worse?
In all honesty,

958
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:05,620
the Horse Shit that I do on this
thing or listen to somebody say,

959
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:07,960
I don't think you're ready for this jelly.

960
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,283
You know,

961
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,720
at least I'd take the piss out of myself.
Every podcast.

962
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:18,870
I don't walk around like some arrogant
ass talking about how fucking great I am

963
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:21,640
and all this shit I have. Does she do
that? I don't even know how she does it.

964
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:22,660
I don't want to listen to her stuff.

965
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:28,310
Um, you know, least I fucking,

966
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,900
I go in one direction.

967
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:33,870
I don't come up with something that's
funny and then or whatever. Interesting.

968
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:38,160
And let's say 50 times in a fucking
row do I? It'd be lagging a bad.

969
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,030
It'd be like they made better
ring or 20 minutes fucking later.

970
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,510
[inaudible] or else what?

971
00:57:45,511 --> 00:57:48,390
You're going to go suck another dick
if I don't give you something shiny,

972
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:53,370
like just gimme something shiny right now
or I'm going to go blow somebody else.

973
00:57:53,371 --> 00:57:55,350
Hey Lady,
start walking.

974
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:56,910
Okay.

975
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,270
Go do that little mind walk like you're
going down a fucking escalator right

976
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:03,540
down to the dude's Dick next to you.
I don't give a shit like this country.

977
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:08,370
I don't respond to threats. Okay?
Actually we do, but not terrorist threats.

978
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,490
I don't respond to that.
Okay?

979
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,190
Okay.

980
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:19,190
Listen, first of all, if
I sat here and listed,

981
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,460
you don't do nice shit to tell
people you're doing nice shit. Okay?

982
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:26,090
Isn't that in the Bible? Hayden's pray
in public. Ooh, look out holy we are.

983
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:29,690
Look what the fuck we're doing. If
you're lady thinks all I do is bad shit,

984
00:58:29,691 --> 00:58:30,980
I don't give a fuck.
Okay.

985
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:32,980
Okay,

986
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,130
good Lord.
What kind of world that you live in it,

987
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,970
you're driving a truck
and you listen to Beyonce.

988
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,380
Oh my God.

989
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:45,643
Yeah.

990
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,210
I, I gotta be honest with you. I,

991
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:52,750
I can't watch performers who don't seem
like at any like date they have this

992
00:58:53,991 --> 00:58:56,630
look on their fucking face that did just,

993
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,380
they can't even believe how
fucking amazing they are
at that point in the crowd.

994
00:59:00,381 --> 00:59:01,790
I'm just like, well, you don't need me.

995
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:03,330
Okay.

996
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,460
Yeah. Yeah. Look, you know,

997
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,910
that's like when these fucking people
like they score touchdowns or they've day

998
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:09,860
the athletes,
right.

999
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:13,880
They fucking dunk balls and do this shit
and they start thumping their fucking

1000
00:59:13,881 --> 00:59:14,714
chest.

1001
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:15,860
Okay.

1002
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,090
I can't match that energy.

1003
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,420
Yeah.
Pau Gasol

1004
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,960
dunking a ball or whatever it
does a lay up and that goes right.

1005
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,330
Ah,

1006
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:35,040
like you're in 300, you know, I'm not
disrespecting their level of athleticism,

1007
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,200
but you put a ball through a fucking hope.

1008
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:38,790
Yeah.

1009
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,600
Jesus Christ.
Punching your own chest.

1010
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,970
Did deuce chills. All
right. A lot of that left,

1011
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:53,700
that type of shit. I can't
get it to, you know, my Jay Z.

1012
00:59:53,701 --> 00:59:57,360
I really enjoy Jay z. But at
some point you're like, I get it.

1013
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,040
You have a lot of stuff.
Your life is amazing.

1014
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,600
I could never hope to have a life as
amazing as yours because you are that

1015
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:12,950
amazing.
Please by all means.

1016
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:17,900
Tell me about your next big purchase.
Um, yeah, so dude, I don't give a fuck.

1017
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,170
I don't give a fuck whether
you're, you're, you're, you're
a woman likes me or not.

1018
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:26,000
Um, if a woman's listening right
now, you're a selfish dose. Okay?

1019
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:27,760
Okay.

1020
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,300
Does he sit there going off on
Beyonce? Maybe he does. I don't know.

1021
01:00:31,301 --> 01:00:34,870
Maybe the two of you just need to
have a little more respect for, uh,

1022
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,300
your playlist. Okay.
They do make headphones.

1023
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:43,840
Why don't you put the fucking
headphones on and listen to Beyonce?

1024
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,630
Why he's driving the truck. He can't
have headphones on. That's illegal.

1025
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,180
And then you could listen to her,
you know,

1026
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:56,020
making a financial deals for her
vaginal area. Uh, New Year's,

1027
01:00:56,021 --> 01:00:58,450
everybody. Here we go.
Dear Billy Ball drop.

1028
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:00,890
Okay.

1029
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,910
Not going to ask you what you're doing
on New Year's cause I already know you

1030
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:08,870
and your Rosebowl crew will be tap
dancing at the Wilton over there. Uh,

1031
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:13,340
I'm going to be there with
the girl. I'm 50% into. Okay,

1032
01:01:13,341 --> 01:01:17,030
well then that affects, uh,
what you should be buying
her that night. And he goes,

1033
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:20,210
she's cool, she's hot and I don't
have any major complaints about her.

1034
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:24,560
I'm also not in love with her and really
can't see anything beyond hooking up.

1035
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:29,030
My plan is to laugh my ass off and see
what happens. All right, if we hook up,

1036
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:33,380
that's great. If not, no big deal, dude.
You're in the zone. You're in the zone.

1037
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:36,650
This is some demand shit. You don't
care if she comes, stays laser praise.

1038
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,860
Now you got the head dude. Um, I don't,

1039
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:44,990
I told two friends and they boast,
advised against talking up with her.

1040
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,470
All right, well, I don't know your friends
and I don't know what their motive is.

1041
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,720
Let's see if you explained this.
Here he goes,

1042
01:01:50,721 --> 01:01:54,380
I would never let that decide
whether or not I would.

1043
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:58,040
But the interesting thing is that they
both said independent of each other,

1044
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,100
that hooking up with a girl
on New Year's Eve, Mike,

1045
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:05,240
give her the wrong impression and that
she's going to be a leach afterwards. Oh,

1046
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:09,290
that's fucking, that's just
fear mongering. That's bullshit.

1047
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,220
What does your finger
on as the ball drops,

1048
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:16,820
all of a sudden you have a relationship.
They had a good time at some labs,

1049
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,240
so like you don't to go to the
farmer's market. No, I don't.

1050
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,760
Do you have something against farmers
markets? Not really who they are.

1051
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:29,680
Why didn't you where to go?
Because you know I don't,

1052
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,170
I don't feel like going with you.

1053
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:36,171
I don't feel like the spark your fucking
ass off for what being honest I have.

1054
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,990
Fuck you there. It's, it's the end of
the relationship. Anyways, he goes,

1055
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:44,991
I can't even fathom why New Year's Eve
would be be considered a special occasion

1056
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:49,680
that would lead to her thinking that this
whole topic is ridiculous and I can't

1057
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:53,100
even stand to waste time talking about it,
but I wanted to hear your opinion.

1058
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:58,080
I think I just gave it to you. My question
to you is, do you agree with that?

1059
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,521
And also,

1060
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:04,110
do you think there are any days on the
calendar that would make a girl think you

1061
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:07,680
were into her? Oh yeah. If you
took around on Valentine's Day.

1062
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,800
Yeah, it's about it. Valentine's Day.

1063
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:14,850
Okay.

1064
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,520
Valentine's Day that that would be it.

1065
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:18,500
Okay.

1066
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,600
What else? What other
day? Saint Patrick's Day.

1067
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:22,690
Okay.

1068
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:25,190
You know, you sit in there eating
a fucking meat pie next door.

1069
01:03:25,191 --> 01:03:28,150
It hammered out of your mind
with a green plastic hat on.

1070
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:33,310
I think he really likes me.
Um, the key and if I could,

1071
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,570
if I could do my single life
over again is I would have been

1072
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:42,460
way less fearful to be honest.
You know,

1073
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:48,900
when relationships were starting,
you know,

1074
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,090
uh,
women are not as

1075
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:52,920
okay.

1076
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,940
Psycho is, you think, I mean, a lot of
times when you say that women are psycho,

1077
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:01,020
it's because you were being
deceptive and a, yeah.

1078
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,900
Then they go fucking psycho.
Yeah, they definitely do. But you,

1079
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:04,980
a lot of times creative.

1080
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,460
If you just tell them straight up front
when they're like, so what is this?

1081
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:09,001
And just be like,
look,

1082
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:12,150
I'm not looking to get in a
relationship right now or like, listen,

1083
01:04:12,151 --> 01:04:15,800
I enjoy your company, but I'm not
feeling like this spark like this,

1084
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,890
something to that next level.

1085
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:21,891
I just feel like you should know that
and you'll be surprised at how well they

1086
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:25,800
take that. You know, they,
it's not that always, you know,

1087
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:31,170
if you say that the second you feel it,
it's usually pretty early on.

1088
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:36,600
So there's no really deep feelings and
that's all people just don't want to get

1089
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:40,110
hurt. Okay. And believe me, I heard
a lot of fucking people believe me.

1090
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,450
And um, so that's what I
learned. I remember one, um,

1091
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,820
Jesus Christ years ago

1092
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,540
and I was at just a
lad living in New York.

1093
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,250
Yeah.

1094
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:57,660
I remember I hooked up with this, this
woman, and she was just like, you know,

1095
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:01,920
so what is this? Where's this going? And
I was just like, uh, nowhere. I'm like,

1096
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:06,570
fucking 1235. She was 23. I'm like,

1097
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:10,680
I'm like 12 years older than you,
you know, by the time you took 30,

1098
01:05:10,681 --> 01:05:13,020
I'm going to be like 60.
What do you think it's going?

1099
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:18,010
She actually laughed and I was just
like, you know, she goes, so what are

1100
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,450
we doing? But just
hanging out, having fun.

1101
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:21,640
So whatever crazy thing you want to try,

1102
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:25,130
but you don't want to do it with
your husband. Do it with make

1103
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:31,570
and that was it. And she was
just like, all right, cool.

1104
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,970
We had fun for a few weeks and then that
was fucking hit and nobody got hurt and

1105
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:41,590
uh, you know, lost touch with her
and that was it. No harm, no foul.

1106
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:46,090
Had a great fucking time. So
there's no light, but look,

1107
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:50,170
you take them out on Valentine's Day
and you get them a rose and all of that

1108
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:54,010
shit, you start leading them on.
So what you're really talking to,

1109
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:57,530
I feel is you're talking to two
younger guys like me probably at that,

1110
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:01,390
like meet like how I was, I mean,
how am I trying to say this?

1111
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:04,930
You're talking to two guys who
had their age right now. I,

1112
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,830
their skill level was what my skill level
was where they don't know how to set

1113
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:12,290
it up. So they're sitting
there going, oh, don't do this.

1114
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,410
Don't bring them out on this day.
Cause that makes them this. Um,

1115
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,780
all that says to me is that they don't
know how to communicate what's going on.

1116
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,630
So they feel like they,

1117
01:06:23,631 --> 01:06:26,390
and they're also in that thing where
they feel like they have to fucking throw

1118
01:06:26,391 --> 01:06:31,080
their jacket over a mud puddle and let
them walk on it in order to get fucked

1119
01:06:31,081 --> 01:06:32,120
that night.
Which you don't,

1120
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,890
you just have to be honest because women
enjoy sex too and they also enjoy you

1121
01:06:36,891 --> 01:06:40,580
telling them what the fucking deal
is. All right, so there you go.

1122
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,920
So you don't have anything to worry about.

1123
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,130
Just don't give her a card saying I love
you. I know. How many kids do you want?

1124
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:49,990
I want to meet your parents.
Just don't do that shit.

1125
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,040
I'm feeling like you have to say that
shit to them. All right. You know what?

1126
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,920
Just look the fact that you've, you, you
know that those guys are full of Shit.

1127
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:59,830
I don't need to keep going on with
this and it's already past fucking two

1128
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,780
o'clock here. So I've got to
get this podcast uploaded. Um,

1129
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:05,650
that's a podcast for this week. Happy
new year, everybody. Once again,

1130
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,440
thank you so much to everyone who
came out to my shows this year,

1131
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:13,840
it really was the best year of standup
I had, had the most fun on stage.

1132
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:17,110
I got to go to the most places,
perform to the all kinds of people.

1133
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:19,990
It was absolutely phenomenal
year for me and, uh,

1134
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:22,090
can't do it without you guys
showing up and thanks to you,

1135
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:26,300
to everybody who writes into the podcast,
listens to it and all that. All right.

1136
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,770
Given thanks like it's thanksgiving,
but it's fucking new years. All right,

1137
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:30,970
so get out there.

1138
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:32,520
Okay.

1139
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,240
Paced your drinking. Pick
your target early, close in.

1140
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:41,760
Make her laugh. Okay. Take
it down before 10 o'clock.

1141
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:46,380
There you go. Happy New Year. Go Fuck
Yourself. I'll talk to you next year.
