1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,070
Hey, what's going on is bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,760
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Dan,

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,880
just checking in on you. Oh, I
almost passed out doing that.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,510
I'm just checking in or just seeing how
your week's going. How's it going, man?

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,490
You're almost there. You're almost
there. You're almost to the weekend.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,310
It's going to be your world again.
You're gonna get to do site.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,180
Decide when you wake up.
Do side no d side.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,380
I said greatest fucking thing about
Saturday morning. You decide all right,

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,650
and I don't care if you got kids.
I don't care if you've got a wife,

10
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,050
you've got a husband and this Dan,
I hear you guys.

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,350
I need you to shut the fuck up.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,690
You're not the boss of me.
It's Saturday.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,490
I'm staying in this fucking bed.
Hey, the kid's crying, sweetheart.

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,990
I am crying. What did they cry? They
didn't want to fuck. They're crying about,

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,220
oh they downstairs. You know what?
What? What are they doing right now?

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,451
What are they crying about?

17
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:15,940
What toy does somebody want
that somebody else he had this.

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,750
That's not a life or death situation.

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,730
I am going to lay in this fucking bed
and I want to get up when I decided

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,220
that's what Saturday's all about
Santa,

21
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:34,221
that feeling you have on Saturday morning
when you can basically do whatever the

22
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:39,000
fuck it is you want, provided the
woman in your life is afraid of you

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,543
joking.

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,150
You can do whatever it is the
fuck you want to do. All right.

25
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,900
That feeling right there,
that's the feeling that you
should be working towards.

26
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,210
Okay. That misery, that
Monday through Friday awaken,

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,930
I got away. Glad I got to wake
up cause I have, cause I fucking,

28
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:05,010
I get an agreement with these people down
the street that I have to be there and

29
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:10,011
they have to be able to see my face at
this particular fucking time and I got to

30
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,480
trudge in here and do this fucking job.
However,

31
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,090
once you get to feel what it's
like to be living your dream

32
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,390
acquaintance, you gotta
be thinking, what bill?

33
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:26,190
I can't fucking lay in a bed a whole
fucking, you know, Monday through Sunday.

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,040
How would I eat?
How would I eat that?

35
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,950
Right there is what
handouts or for it's what?

36
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:37,080
Seven 11 to four you want to sleep
in every day? This is what you do.

37
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:40,710
You sit outside is seven 11 you
make a little sign. All right.

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,230
You don't write it on a nice
piece of notebook paper.

39
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,290
You got to write it on like a piece of
trash you so people know that you're

40
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,940
struggling right now. I'm fucking
with you. Somehow you got,

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,230
you got to become self employed.

42
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,190
You got to work for yourself if
you want that Saturday morning.

43
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,160
Granted you're going to still be working
on only you get to work Monday through

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,200
Friday when you're self employed,
you work Monday through Sunday,

45
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,500
but you'll get up when you want to get up.
All right?

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,120
And you at least have that feeling of
a little bit of control and freedom.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,400
Then he can take it too far. Like the
ultimate Saturday I'll get up when the,

48
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,970
wherever the fuck I want to is that
fatty cakes there in North Korea.

49
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,120
Okay. And you can tell by his build that
Guy Sleeps Til at least 11 every day,

50
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,500
you know? I bet he has like kid pajamas.
Does he look like he would, you know,

51
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,810
giant speed racer bed or some shit.
Something about him.

52
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,070
He seems very childish,

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,333
you know.

54
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,210
I Dunno. You know what it
is. I bet he just, because he
was the, the dictators son,

55
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:47,720
nobody ever picked on it, but he
looked in the mirror and he was like,

56
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:51,440
the only reason why they're not
picking on me right now is because

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,480
if they did, my dad would feed
them naked to two wild dogs.

58
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,910
That's the only thing
stopping the Calafat. I am,

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,910
look at me just standing there
looking at his hair. Hairy,

60
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,860
hairless fucking tore self. Right. I
bet he's getting any right. Some man,

61
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,130
whole fucking level.
Any,

62
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,570
there's some whole enemies
trying to fill. Um, anyways,

63
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:24,180
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about. How about those Cleveland?

64
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,430
God Damn Indians. 21 victories in a
row. You're never going see this again.

65
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:33,660
I mean it's fucking amazing.
That is really amazing. Um,

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,290
and how great would it be to
see them and they're ones,

67
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,220
was it 1948 they ended it this year?
I Dunno about my red sox.

68
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:42,054
I don't know.

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm going to keep saying that hope
and I jinx them into coming together.

70
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:47,490
I kind of fucking fell out
of love with this team.

71
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,030
I've said it before when they fucking
yelled at Eckersley I was like, come on.

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,180
There was no discipline about,
that's a hall of Famer.

73
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,930
You know what you're doing in a
hall of famer walks in a room.

74
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,450
You shut the fuck up.
That's what you do.

75
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,800
And if he criticizes you,
you say, okay, fair enough.

76
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,700
I'll try a little better. Their
sport maybe asked for exotic now.

77
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,900
Now you don't ask for his autograph. You
want to be a professional. If you want,

78
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,960
if you want to act like you're,
you're, you're in the same business.

79
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,310
You never asked for an autograph within
the same industry. Okay? None of it.

80
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,490
Forget that. I've seen people do it.
It's an ugly, ugly fucking scene.

81
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,370
I know a guy that fucking play golf
and a celebrity fucking tournament,

82
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,810
right? Why can't I ever
type in my password and talk
at the same fucking time?

83
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,973
It's unbelievable.

84
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,840
He played in a celebrity golf tournament
and one of the guys in his fourth son

85
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,860
was actually a fan of his and then
fucking hanging out the palling around.

86
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,170
Everything's going great.
And then when that,

87
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,160
when they would done at
the end of the round,

88
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:52,600
he asked for a picture in the guy's
face just dropped. And that was it.

89
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,040
It was over. He went from hanging out
with that guy to be in back in the crowd,

90
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,830
thrown his panties out
of what is my point?

91
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,860
My point is I like sleeping in on us.
Um,

92
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,740
all right.
Let's see what's,

93
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,290
I don't have anything to talk about
today because I'm just stuck in a fucking

94
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,550
writer's room. We just, we're doing the
table read this morning for episode, uh,

95
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,660
three Oh seven. Oh I can't be screaming
at, my daughter's still sleeping. My mom,

96
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,290
my wife's probably going to
fucking kill me right now on say,

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,950
is there a reason why
ever since Bill Clinton,

98
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,000
they just won't let somebody be president?
I really think you know what it is.

99
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,830
I think it's because of,

100
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,670
I think it's because of social media and
24 hours news networks and all of that

101
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:35,600
type of shit.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,873
Yeah.

103
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,230
This is like CNN,
CNN who refuses to cover any,

104
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,220
anything about Hillary
and the Democratic Party,

105
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,290
ignoring the votes during the primary and
boxing out Bernie Sanders who actually

106
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,160
gotten more votes.

107
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:56,080
And then Hillary actually has the fucking
balls to be like we should do away

108
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,210
with the electoral college.
Oh,

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,500
because the fuck over that you ran on
Bernie Sanders then was done to you.

110
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,090
I've never seen such an
entitled fucking person.

111
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,870
Everybody talks about
how entitled Trump is,

112
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,830
and I'm not saying he
isn't Jesus fucking Christ.

113
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,470
She really thought that that job was hers.
It's fucking unbelievable.

114
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,770
Anyways.
Um,

115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,393
okay.

116
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,520
It's unfucking believable. Um, all right.

117
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,410
It says Sean Spicer basically admitted
that he was willing to lie for Trump.

118
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,830
Now,
what is shocking about that?

119
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,233
Okay.

120
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,310
Do you think there was nobody in Obama's
cabinet that was willing to lie for him

121
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,210
or bushes or Clinton's or
first Bush or Reagan or Carter?

122
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,950
That's what happens.

123
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,750
Yeah.

124
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,140
Think about in your life,
there's people you're willing to lie for.

125
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,990
Yeah.

126
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,420
You know, your buddy's fucking hammered
behind the wheel. The cop comes up,

127
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,100
you sit down, officer, he's, oh, he's
fine. He's only had a couple of, you know,

128
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,790
you do that.
It's a friend,

129
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,680
Jesus fucking Christ and everybody
fucking sitting here acting like the

130
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,900
president runs the country
is fucking hilarious.

131
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,520
Like he's decisions aren't decided

132
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,790
pie all the money that you fucking need
to get in the fucking office. Right.

133
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,020
I don't know. They keep saying Trump
used most of his own money. I doubt it.

134
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,390
I don't fucking, I don't even know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

135
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:27,610
I'm just so fucking sick of people.
You know,

136
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,320
acting like this guy is way worse than
the other guy because the two or three

137
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:34,470
issues other than that,
as far as the environment,

138
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,040
as far as the food supply,
as far as the heroin epidemic,

139
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,730
it's the exact same thing. Don't
fucking say shit about it. Right.

140
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,550
Is that what it is? I Dunno.
All right. After Chicago, Tj,
ginger is found dead in a,

141
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,790
in hotel freezer.
Mystery lingers.

142
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,410
This is why I don't want you to know
North Korea's latest nuclear tests so

143
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,960
powerful.
It reshaped the mountain above it.

144
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,760
Okay?

145
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,990
Okay. Well, we have its nuclear
power. It's powerful. Rush your fires.

146
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,770
Cruise missile at ISPD stronghold.

147
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,730
Is that the cool way to say Isis
now is I a stronghold in East Syria?

148
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,200
Russia is about to kick off a war
game that is freaking out. NATO.

149
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,900
Here's what we know. This is why I
don't read the news. I wouldn't know.

150
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:26,070
I wouldn't know any of this.
It's a game having a game.

151
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,680
They can't play a game
in their own country.

152
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,030
Coordinated attack in southern
Iraq kills at least 50

153
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:35,950
okay?

154
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,790
Okay. No good news yet. All right,
let's go to the United States.

155
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:44,770
Let's see what good news is here. Eight
dead after South Florida nursing homes,

156
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:47,710
air conditioning fails
following Hurricane Irma.

157
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,163
Great.

158
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,990
Next one as the White
House calls for her firing.

159
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,960
Okay.

160
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,850
Espn Jamelle Hill.
Address the elephant in the room.

161
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,040
Okay.

162
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,690
What the fuck is this?

163
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,290
How the fuck did we go from the White
House to a reporter on ESPN? Now this,

164
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,540
now this, I'll tell you. Let's here.
I gotta read this one. I got to read.

165
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,673
All right,

166
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
here we go. Here we go. What did we say?

167
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,220
How's hours after a White House
spokesperson called for Espn to fire her?

168
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,970
Because she called president Trump
a white supremacist on Twitter.

169
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,360
Jamil Hill or Jamelle modal.

170
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,070
He'll tweeted about the topic Wednesday
night saying she was going to address

171
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,150
the elephant in the room after becoming
the latest flash point in a cultural

172
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:45,510
skirmish that is involved. The
sports network. Once again,

173
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,270
hashtagging your tweets.

174
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,350
Hashtag facts hill wrote my comments
on Twitter express my personal belief,

175
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,550
my regard,

176
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,580
my regret is that my comments at and the
public way I made them painted ESPN in

177
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:02,970
an unfair light.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,780
My respect for the company and my
colleagues remains unconditional. Yeah.

179
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,660
How the fuck do you have that job? And
No, you can't tweet some shit like that.

180
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,460
You're going to get fired
because at the end of the day,

181
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,430
all ESPN gives a fuck about
is ratings in, in, in money.

182
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,970
That's what they care
about. Uh, all right,

183
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:20,190
so when asked Wednesday
afternoon by the Post,

184
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,240
David knock a mirror lockup Moreau.
It's a good last name.

185
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,880
Uh,
about hills original tweets.

186
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,440
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she was
unsure whether the president was aware of

187
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,950
the kerfuffle they cause, but
at, of course he was aware. Okay.

188
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,140
Fucking tweets every day.
It's like a seventh grade girl.

189
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,950
I think that's one of the more outrageous
comments that anyone could make and

190
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,700
certainly something that I think
is fireable offense by ESPN.

191
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:45,720
Get the fuck Outta here.

192
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,350
Okay.

193
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,670
Oh,
give me a fucking break.

194
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,290
I love how ESPN thinks that
reflects on them and all they is.

195
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,280
A couple of [inaudible]

196
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,610
Iran may have, you know, further
woo at the bottom are prevalent. Oh,

197
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,320
ain't gonna walk to see if the Yankees
beat the fucking Indians tonight.

198
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,130
Okay.

199
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,070
Yes you are.
What else are you going to do?

200
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,970
Read a book.
It's his sports network.

201
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,630
This is some of the dumbest people
on the planet, myself included.

202
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,290
Okay.

203
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,150
You how many times I've tried,
I've gotten so disgusted with the NFL.

204
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:23,890
I tried to walk away. Then I just had
to admit that I was too weak to do it.

205
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,070
I like how the NFL ratings are down now
and they're trying to blame that stupid

206
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:33,300
Colin Kaepernick thing. That's what it
was. Oh, that's what it Wa wasn't what,

207
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,430
you know what it was is they just got
greedy. I think it's the NFL plus it,

208
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,970
it goes in cycles too.
You know what I mean?

209
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,620
It's like the NBA where they
had bird magic into fucking, uh,

210
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,020
Jordan and then there was a little bit
of a lull there for a minute. Right.

211
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,720
And then like a,
I dunno.

212
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,780
Okay.

213
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,610
I guess the spurs more fucking
exciting enough. Um, I dunno.

214
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,180
And then you know, eventually you other
guys came along, the Brown came along.

215
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,290
Yeah, the next one. Right. I think
football goes to the same thing,

216
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,960
but the problem is that these,
these, these guys in the NFL,

217
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,490
they're trying to go global and
they're trying to appeal like please,

218
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,440
as many people as humanly possible.

219
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:19,540
So they kind of abandoned
their original fit in the end.

220
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,660
You know where the NBA is right now.

221
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:25,550
The NBA is where you two was when Bano
started wearing those big fly glasses,

222
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,290
the big mosquito glasses

223
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,420
and was saying shit like this is the
most surreal night of my life, man.

224
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:33,740
He started playing a character,

225
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,803
you know,

226
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,630
in eight years they went from

227
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,610
carrying a fucking white flag and all,

228
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,260
whatever the fuck it is
they were doing back then.

229
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:48,860
I was never the big youtube
guy. Okay. As I told you before,

230
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,020
I didn't listen to the
right music in the 80s.

231
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,230
I was listening to a crocus and helix,

232
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,830
how's this and all those fucking beds,
you know what I mean?

233
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:04,580
And then I was watching sports and I was
flunking math and French class. I mean,

234
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:06,650
that's basically what you've been
listening to all these years.

235
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,900
If you ever wondered,
um,

236
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,720
I don't need to go to ancestry.com
to figure out my mystery.

237
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,900
I am a fucking dope.
I am a dope dope when I walk into a room,

238
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:25,190
dopes shut up just to listen to
what stupid thing I'm gonna say.

239
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,870
Um, anyways. Yeah. They fucking,

240
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,370
they, they did the pink thing. Let's
have the football players wear pink.

241
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,851
I love how,

242
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:40,851
like for some reason the fact that a
football is a really male testosterone

243
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,610
aggressive thing that like for some
reason guys have to apologize for that and

244
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,570
they just can't have,
is that the word of feminate?

245
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,350
They can't make it like,

246
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,000
like feminine enough all of a sudden

247
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,240
cause all these feminist bitch
moaning and complaining has all these

248
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:08,150
corporations all in a myth like,
oh we don't want to be considered sexist.

249
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,240
The next thing you know,
they're wearing pink for a month.

250
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,630
It's if the NFL gives a flying fuck

251
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,040
okay.

252
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,790
About anything other than making money.
Cancer.

253
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,030
This is what we care about. Your brain
Terman into scrambled eggs. Yeah.

254
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:26,340
We don't get in. You killing
yourself by the time you're 50.

255
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,740
We don't give a fuck about
that. Oh, is that what you did?

256
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,350
Here's 40 bucks for everybody
who ever played the fucking game.

257
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,350
They don't give a shit.
Um, according to reports,

258
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,950
they kept like 95 to $97 for every hundred
dollars he made off of that pink shit.

259
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:38,940
So give me a fucking break.

260
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,100
They show people in the crowd
that are in the military,

261
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,870
they charge that branch of the military.

262
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,440
They treat it like a commercial as
they tell you to support the troops.

263
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,750
The Fuck Outta here. Right? So now what?

264
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,260
So now all these women's groups sit
there bitch moaning and complaining.

265
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,770
So now they got, they got female referees,
they get women calling the games.

266
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,140
They got the guys wearing pink
for an entire fucking month.

267
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,680
They got lady Gaga singing at the
fucking halftime at the super bowl.

268
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,710
They took a total fucking left turn.

269
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:08,760
And when you do that like you to do
is you're going to lose a lot of your

270
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,250
original fan base that are like,
hey man,

271
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,120
I liked him back when the
boy I liked the first album.

272
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,140
I saw him when there was only
8,000 people at the fucking show.

273
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,550
That's basically what they're
going through and they're
going to survive it and

274
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,360
they're going to transition from,
you know,

275
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,870
the frozen Tundra and all of that fucking,
you know,

276
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:35,190
making it seem like it was fucking d day.
All of that great shit that I loved.

277
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,180
They are going to transition
out of all of that and

278
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,730
I think that there's going
to be a lot more futures in,

279
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:48,731
in teals and all that type of stuff
coming into the NFL is they try to,

280
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:50,064
uh,

281
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,080
okay.

282
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,411
I Dunno.

283
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,500
I think I say try to get ahead of this
next generation of people that that's

284
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:59,300
coming up that goes out to comedy
clubs and literally just stares at the

285
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,940
comedians.
Like that's what I'm experiencing now.

286
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,860
I was at the comedy store last night.

287
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:06,080
Granted something fucked up
happened before I went on stage.

288
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:10,540
I guess it should have realized
that. And uh, they, yeah, just uh,

289
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,010
just staring at me
staring at me.

290
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,320
So I dunno. I Dunno what I have
to do. You know what I'm thinking?

291
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,410
Actually maybe I'll,

292
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,940
I'll start wearing pink on stage and
then people will think that I care.

293
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,970
Um, anyways, I don't want
to, I don't want to fucking,

294
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,230
I don't want to call out any
fucking specific fucking people.

295
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:39,720
I don't want to fucking do that cause
you know, I sucked as a comedian.

296
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:42,720
Eventually I got better at it,
but I mean, Jesus fucking Christ,

297
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,120
if you're going to go down that road,

298
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:50,130
you still have to pick somebody
that's of a fucking certain level of

299
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:53,820
professionalism. Now, if you're going
to have a fucking national game,

300
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,403
yeah,

301
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,310
I mean Jesus Christ,

302
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,520
and I'm not talking about that poor
bastard that froze like a deer in a

303
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:05,380
headlight. That fucking kid on the side
too. I just felt bad for that dude.

304
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,940
You know what I mean? But
I'm just saying, you know,

305
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:11,510
if you're going to call a fucking game,
good fuck it,

306
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,930
Lord. Good Lord. Um,

307
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,900
this is actually my dream.

308
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:22,901
My dream is somebody that like is like a
fucking went to broadcasting school and

309
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,980
then you pair them up with
someone that played the game.

310
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:26,540
I know they tried to do that all the time,

311
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,630
but someone that actually can tell a
story that played the fucking gate,

312
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,190
that's when it's the best. Like
Collins worth, John Madden,

313
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,910
Phil, I love a lot of people. Didn't
like Phil soon. I love Phil Simms,

314
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,390
the Guy Fucking, you won a super
bowl. He's the first guy to say,

315
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,340
I'm going to Disneyland.
I'm not going to listen to this guy.

316
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,180
All these guys who play fantasy football
trying to say the guy doesn't know what

317
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,280
he's talking about. Yeah. What? What
would he know about what? You know?

318
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,980
He only played the game professionally.
You fucking moron.

319
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,623
MMM.

320
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,053
I Dunno.

321
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,403
Okay.

322
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,410
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on here?

323
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,030
All right. I don't know what the Hell I
just did. I had my recorder on the floor.

324
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:10,830
I don't know when the hell
I just chopped it off,

325
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,230
but I had the thing
recording on the wrong speed.

326
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,500
I Dunno what the fuck happened anyways.
I don't fuck,

327
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,510
I don't know what's going on and
what's going on in comedy clubs.

328
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know what's going
on and a in the NFL,

329
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,740
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing and this is just,

330
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,360
it's just part of becoming old.

331
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:29,960
Okay.

332
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,780
Like why did I got a partner
of street lights up so bright?

333
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:34,970
Like I'm just an old man.
Don't fucking listen to me.

334
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,473
Okay.

335
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:37,801
Anyways,

336
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,590
I don't understand how I had a half hour
to do this before nine o'clock and it's

337
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:45,150
almost nine o'clock and I only have
fucking 20 minutes done probably because I

338
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,750
stepped on the recorder and
I said the fucking worst.

339
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,920
I'm the worst anyways.
So congratulations to the NFL.

340
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,260
I know you guys want to go global.
I hope you fucking do it. Um,

341
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,231
you know,

342
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm sure you're jealous of the UFC that
started way after you guys and they were

343
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,350
able to do it.
You are free.

344
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,340
MMM.

345
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,790
You know,
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

346
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,720
Okay.

347
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,750
I Dunno what the fuck to tell you.
It's just like, I don't, I, uh,

348
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,240
I kinda like college football.

349
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,650
My start watching that and then eventually
they're going to get pressure to

350
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:24,651
fucking make this game a male
testosterone game for some reason.

351
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,540
We need a bunch of estrogen in it.

352
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,830
Yeah.

353
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,820
You know, this is what I don't
understand about women. Okay.

354
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:36,510
Every study says that they're
way smarter than men. Right.

355
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,180
They can handle a stronger level of pain.

356
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,380
Okay.

357
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,270
They're more in touch with their emotions.

358
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,990
They could do all of that shit and you
know, for them, far as my experience goes,

359
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,640
I'd agree with it for the most part.

360
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,370
Yeah.

361
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,290
I don't know about the arrogant.
We're smarter than you.

362
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,260
It depends on what the fuck you talking
about. Right? But I'll give you,

363
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:57,630
I'll give you all of that.
But if that's all true,

364
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,950
what if fuck kitchen starts your own
sports league? Why don't you do that?

365
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,300
Okay.

366
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
What do you constantly have to
fucking infiltrate some shit?

367
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:09,990
A bunch of guys doing some shit that you
know at the end of the day you think is

368
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:13,650
fucking stupid. It's a bunch of guys
smashing into each other's scrambling.

369
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:18,651
They're fucking brains trying to get a
ball crossed the fucking line to score

370
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:23,290
points. You know, you don't
give a shit about that.

371
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:28,291
Why can't they come up with their own
Goddamn fucking sports league and then

372
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:31,780
from top to bottom,
fucking can be all women.

373
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,800
Then you turn that thing into a
global billion dollar fucking entity.

374
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,290
And then women get all that fucking money.
There's your power.

375
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,640
You'll fucking join a guy's league.

376
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:47,350
And then they give you a pink flags
to throw holding office. It's like,

377
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:52,150
why would you do that? I don't
know. I don't fucking know.

378
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,550
I don't know.
I don't understand these things.

379
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,240
Yeah.

380
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,910
All I can, all I can do is we equate
it to my life as I can tell you this,

381
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,470
when I worked for somebody else,

382
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,930
I like the fuck over is you
can't, you can't keep up.
You can't keep track of him.

383
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,200
Okay?

384
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,240
That's when you get stolen from the most.

385
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
That's when your dream
gets crushed the most.

386
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:15,100
When you fucking work for somebody else,
if you work for yourself,

387
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,800
you have more control. Granted,
you work way more hours,

388
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:21,550
but that's the price you pay. We're
taking collars. Um, all right.

389
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:26,320
Let me read a little bit of advertising
here. Everybody. Um, by the way,

390
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,880
a fucking oh Billy, no
fun, no booze. 28 days,

391
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,070
28 days a week.
I don't fucking booze.

392
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,280
28 days a week.

393
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,680
I stare at the ceiling
trying to go to sleep. Ooh,

394
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:49,590
I love that whiskey.
It's my Tylenol pm. Um,

395
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,420
speaking of which, this is going to
be the biggest test for my air quotes.

396
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,560
Sobriety. I'm not fucking sober. I'm
just not drinking. Okay. All right.

397
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:02,330
This is the biggest test.
Saucy thought.

398
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,930
The Miyao guys saucy.

399
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:08,740
Everyone at some point has
wished they could just have beer,

400
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:11,560
wine or liquor delivered.

401
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,800
Will someone filing decided to
do something about it? Oh my God,

402
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:18,610
I love these people. Next, please mention
all the talking points below. Dude,

403
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:21,700
I'll fucking sing these if you want to.
Want me to.

404
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,350
Introducing thought the meow,

405
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,370

408
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:41,500
This is great. This is
fucking great. Uber's great,

409
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,560
right? I should say lift cause they
fucking advertise on us, right?

410
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,290
Oh I love those. Those, those guys
at Lyft and the ladies, right?

411
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,690
They fucking uh,
you know,

412
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:55,430
they cut down on drinking and driving
right now they're going to cut down on

413
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:59,740
fucking ruin in the ozone layer. Might
get some stores to drive liquor store,

414
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,300
drive it over to you, whatever. All he
knows you're not in the street, dude.

415
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:06,920
You turn your fucking apartment
into the club. You never leave.

416
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,970
They never shut you off.
This is great. Okay. Now,

417
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:15,460
if you're in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Chicago, San Diego, away,

418
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,720
whale's Vagina or Sacramento,

419
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,040
you're thought the order will arrive
at your door in 30 minutes or less.

420
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,810
Ready to drink. All right
guys. Now La, San Francisco,

421
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:29,780
Chicago, San Diego, Sacramento.
You got to fucking drink up.

422
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,980
You got to get these people the money
that they need to expand. All right,

423
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,050
for the right. This is like the original
sex except as five cities first, okay?

424
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:41,780
For the rest of us thought

minimums, no delivery fees,

427
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,030
no running to the store.
If you've got the saucy app around,

428
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,160
you've got a fully stocked bar on
your phone and for a limited time,

429
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,430
dude,

430
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,600
you can start drinking top shelf booze
now cause you're not going out playing in

431
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,300
a cover and or any of that
type of shit, okay? You go out,

432
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:09,800

just hand no, no, my hitting on checks.

433
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,993
Right.

434
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,630
And maybe buy that fucking robot doll

00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:40,000
I just watched a clip. I had
to shut it off. Forgive me.

579
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:43,050
I don't know what radio show it is,
but she's sitting there.

580
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,030
She goes and she's trying to
get the black vote and she,

581
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:48,910
they asked you what's something that
you always carry around with you?

582
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:50,680
And she said,
hot sauce.

583
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,160
What I found the Clintons are the fucking,
I swear to God.

584
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,410
Okay.

585
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,520
Can't you just see both of them on a
used car lot to one of those cheesy local

586
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,890
commercials?
Do they had the fucking devil?

587
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,033
Okay.

588
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,910
I remember when Hillary
Clinton ran for fucking, uh,

589
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,230
Senate after eight years of being in the
White House to fucking Yankees had won

590
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:20,130
four world series. She never showed
up, never said a fucking thing.

591
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:24,450
And then all of a sudden she's running
for fucking a Senate in New York,

592
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,040
shows up with a brand new Yaggie hat goes.

593
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:31,740
I've always been a Yankee fan.
And then this big grand,

594
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:36,360
like I said it now, they got to like
me. This is how out of touch she is.

595
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,300
She literally thinks that. She just
has to say, I carry around hot sauce

596
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,690
and I'll, all black people are going to be
like, oh shit. Oh, I can relate to that.

597
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,890
What's she gonna do next?
You get to go to fucking Chinatown,

598
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,800
which I always carry around soy sauce.

599
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:04,830
We go down south, you know, I
love guns and my cousins, sorry,

600
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,970
sorry, I shouldn't have
said that. Um, hot rods.

601
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:11,730
I've always liked hot rods.
Fucking shameless.

602
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,060
This is the thing about like when
you're at her level of fucking wealth,

603
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:19,470
which is really, I don't know how you
explain it. You know, when her husband,

604
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,280
you know,
had the highest office in,

605
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,070
in public office and you
only is president, you only
make four, 500 grand a year.

606
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:28,390
Somehow they threw their daughter
a $3 million wedding. I mean,

607
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,120
how does the math work there?

608
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:31,790
Okay.

609
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,650
They are the fucking, she is the fucking
devil. I'm telling you. You know.

610
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,120
Oh my God, what a fucking selection this
year. Can you fucking believe this shit?

611
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,400
A reality show star.

612
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,260
Okay.

613
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,060
You know who's sitting
there with that fucking,

614
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,410
I don't know what the other guy's name is.

615
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:52,160
Nick talking about the size of their
hands and having a good size of your dick

616
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:56,470
debate running for office.
You got Hillary.

617
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:59,260
You fucking write it. I'll say
it. She doesn't give a fuck.

618
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,520
This is why I gotta be honest with you.

619
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:06,720
Why I like Republicans better than
Democrats because the Republicans at least

620
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:08,410
have the decency to just show,

621
00:37:08,411 --> 00:37:12,120
to openly show you that they don't
give a fuck about you and Democrats.

622
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,390
They actually tried to act like
they give a fuck how people thought.

623
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,840
People who work for a fucking living,
they don't did the same fucking people.

624
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,840
They just lie about it.
You know? I swear to God,

625
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,890
if Bernie Sanders would just
fucking gold the hallway,

626
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,680
you know what I mean?
Don't stop in Kuwait.

627
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,800
You got to go all the way to Baghdad
with these fucking bankers. Okay?

628
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,850
That's what you gotta do.

629
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,420
You gotta tip over the statue when you
got to have all those top level bankers

630
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,260
swinging at the end of a rope.
That's the only way to stay.

631
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,410
Got To start over again.

632
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,980
That's my candidate. None of them
are saying that. So it, it's over.

633
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,590
And I know you're thinking,
Bill, you don't know shit.

634
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,230
And you read conspiracy theory
and you know what I say to that?

635
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,060
You're absolutely right. Okay.
All right, let's move on.

636
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,250
That was, uh, that was, uh, that was
political comedy right there, if you will,

637
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:09,330
if you're wondering what that was
supposed to be, she goes to little Italy.

638
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:12,750
What do you always have in your purse?
A jar of Marinara sauce.

639
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Who's your favorite singer?
Dean Martin.

640
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,550
Oh my God. Did you see the house?
She looked like she rolled her eyes.

641
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,510
I don't want to put like shit on her that,
that's what she fucking did.

642
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,660
Okay.

643
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,150
That's how out of touch she is.
Hillary Clinton thinks black.

644
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,440
All black people walk around with hot
sauce in their purse because white don't

645
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:37,990
know how to season food.
Uh,

646
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,350
I'm not saying there aren't some black
people did do that. You know what I mean?

647
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,410
But you know, that would also
be people who aren't white,

648
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:48,160
who look at white people and think we're
all in the upper 1% standing on a yard

649
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:52,210
shooting the shit with one
of the Kennedy's and they're
fucking weird in Brenton

650
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,890
inbred dentition. I never
understood the Kennedys. I, they,

651
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,070
they're from like the nose up. They're
really good looking people, great hair,

652
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,730
you know, nice fucking
big five head, you know,

653
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:08,350
it looks great on TV, decent eyes, you
know, and then you just get to that,

654
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,490
you get to those, those, I
mean it was kid. No, they
look like from the nose down,

655
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:14,830
they look like Clint Howard.
I don't know what it is.

656
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,300
There's something going on with
that family. You can't, uh,

657
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,980
you know what it is, is they still
look ethnic. They feel, look at, um,

658
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,690
if you look at like,
like white people from like,

659
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,490
like look at Joe Dimaggio, you know, he's
probably considered a good looking guy.

660
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,050
That guy is fucking deck.

661
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,303
Okay.

662
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,130
I don't know what happened once
everybody got all mixed up,

663
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,770
like all the fucking Nash and I was
getting mixed up. Like do you know,

664
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,460
started streamlining the looks and
people are way better looking now.

665
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,480
Don't you think then when you look
back in the day, I mean, Jesus Christ,

666
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,860
Babe Ruth, every once in Lou Gehrig was
a good looking guy. You know what I mean?

667
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,060
But Babe Ruth, that guy was
a mess. Joe Dimaggio mess.

668
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,810
I can say what I want.
Bad Looking. I don't know.

669
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:05,760
I'm just saying when you
look at the shit back then,

670
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,970
like an Italian guy looked a hundred
percent fucking Italian. I don't want to,

671
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:12,330
you know something.
And when I went to Italy,

672
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:14,730
they were better look in the back then.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

673
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,230
We allegedly had better food back then.
People were shorter.

674
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,121
I don't know what it was.

675
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:23,640
Did you ever notice that when you look
back and when you really look at those

676
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:24,390
old pictures?

677
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,480
I love looking at old pictures and
it's like that George Carlin bit.

678
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:28,710
When you look at an old
picture and you're like,

679
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:32,280
everybody in that picture is dead.
If for some reason in a morbid way,

680
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:35,880
it's like fascinating. When I look
at those old pictures, I just,

681
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:39,360
that's what I think. I God damn it,
there was some fucking ugly ass people.

682
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,980
You know what I mean? It was a game
changer was, uh, three things. Polio,

683
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,810
vaccine,
penicillin and braces.

684
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,890
Those three fucking things could just
hide so many fucking imperfections.

685
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,050
You know what I mean? And once
you get braces, Jesus Christ,

686
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:06,130
if you just brush your fucking teeth
in remotely, keep yourself in shape.

687
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,600
You know, you throw on some nice clothes.
People have no idea where you came from.

688
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,623
You know,

689
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,110
back in the day, people, they saw it on
your teeth, told the whole fucking story.

690
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:22,790
You just smile and be like, hi, I can, I
can see you're going to have tuberculosis.

691
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,510
You live in a damp Dag fucking
apartment with no fucking windows.

692
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:30,060
You saw it in their fucking teeth,
right? I don't know about it.

693
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,540
Heard what's his face?
Jp Morgan had like Rosacea.

694
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,220
Is that how you say they're all over
his face? He was just all fucking angry.

695
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,090
Those old school rich guys, you know,
he used to walk around with top hats.

696
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:44,960
It's like the penguin harm while
walking down the street. Um,

697
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,230
is this a podcast anymore? And I don't
even, what the fuck I'm talking about?

698
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:50,570
Let me, let me do some advertising
here and then I'll, uh,

699
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:53,750
I'll get to more babbling
here in a moment. All right.

700
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,960
Hot Sauce. A shameless fucking
shameless. She looks in,

701
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:02,110
bred her fucking teeth.
There's something going on with Tara.

702
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,260
There's some go with you see how Bill
Clinton collapse now. It's like he's a,

703
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,510
like a marionette puppet.
He has his mouth open.

704
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,180
That's how he made it. But that
smiling with his mouth open. Oh,

705
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:21,020
I'm going to fix it. I'll fix everything.
How you doing? Call me later. Oh.

706
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,500
Oh,
whoa.

707
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm sick of Obama's wife.

708
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,400
This is some Republican rants either.
It's just kind of first ladies in general,

709
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,020
you know, I don't know what it is all
throughout my life with each presidency.

710
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,700
Like these first ladies, they've just
gotten more and more like, like a,

711
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,070
like chatty, you know, more,

712
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,920
more chime in in like
leaning into the frame,

713
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,290
fitting out their ideas. It's just
like, well, why are you talking?

714
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,910
You weren't elected.
Shut up.

715
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,370
Your husband's not running a lemonade
stand here. He's running the country.

716
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:44,800
You don't just Shyman.
Let me guess.

717
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,330
Is this considered sexist?

718
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,800
Hello?

719
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,660
Okay. You're just not at
link. Let me ask you this.

720
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,320
Let's say you had a leak in your
house. Okay? You call a plumber up.

721
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,370
He shows up and he goes, yeah, I took the
links coming from the upstairs bathroom.

722
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:02,940
We need to shut it off. Then all of a
sudden his wife walks in. Who is it?

723
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:03,774
A plumber?

724
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,960
What'd you be like with all due respect?
Shut the,

725
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,250
I need a plumber in this moment

726
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,370
sending all of branch here,
right?

727
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,110
At some point there's going to be
the first female president, right?

728
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,450
Exactly.
He's at

729
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,870
that moment.
You're going to have the first male first,

730
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,493
right?

731
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,790
When that happens,
that too needs to shut his trap.

732
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,540
I don't want to hear a word out of him.
I want to hear from the president.

733
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,490
You served. Go do some
first lady stuff. Alright,

734
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,080
go get yourself some gloves
that go up to your elbows.

735
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,140
Smile and nod during speeches.

736
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,460
Go put your own flair.
Redecorating the White House.

737
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,763
Hi.

738
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,740
Shoot.
I'm Michelle Obama right now.

739
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:03,270
She's sitting there holding up those
Hashtag for that Hashtag bring back our

740
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,300
girls. Remember, it's like,
that blew my mind. It's like,

741
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:10,200
why are you showing me that?
I'm a stand up comedian,

742
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:13,830
like what am I going to do
to get those curls back?

743
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:16,380
Why don't you look across the dinner
table? It's like you see that.

744
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,350
Tell him to pick up a phone call

745
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,870
some navy seals and saw the,
well, what am I going to do?

746
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,990
Show up with a sharp and Mike said,

747
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,413
oh,
it's unreal.

748
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:45,490
I'll tell you what kills me. Hillary
Clinton might run, she might,

749
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:48,370
she might run by blows my mind.
She became a center.

750
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,580
She went from being the president's
wife to being a senator just like that

751
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:52,443
lateral move.

752
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,960
That's like Tom Brady's wife become
the next quarterback of the ramps.

753
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,360
It's like what?

754
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,630
You're hanging out.
You just pick it up.

755
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,190
I sucked at sports and then I bank Tom
Brady and I don't know what happened.

756
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,240
I just picked up a ball.
I started Weiss in it.

757
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,430
I'm leading receivers was incredible.

758
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,810
I knew it was going to be like this

759
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:50,260
going on his bill burr, and this is
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

760
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,290
September 14th,
2009 um,

761
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,430
it's like fucking 10 20 at night.

762
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,100
I finally got some time
to do the podcast today.

763
00:47:00,101 --> 00:47:04,810
I was flying back from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. I lost my cell phone,

764
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,320
you know, once again, I
lost another cell phone.

765
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,150
Every time I get a nice cell phone,
I lose him.

766
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,270
So I just reactivated
my little flip phone.

767
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,540
Those of you who go on to bill
[inaudible] dot com when you listen to my

768
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:17,201
podcasts,

769
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:21,420
you see that picture of me right there
looking down at the bar and that little

770
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,530
15 year old chicks flip phone that I
got there, that's what I'm back to.

771
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,340
I went from a blackberry to that thing,
you know,

772
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:31,391
you know,

773
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:36,370
just once I would like to lose a fucking
phone and call it and have someone on

774
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:39,910
the other end be my savior.
Be like, why? Yes, yes.

775
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:43,600
I have found your phone and I
would love to return it to you.

776
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:48,070
There was nothing more. I would like to
do the maternity now, free of charge,

777
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:51,600
free of charge. That's what happens
to everybody else. I know you talked,

778
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,420
my girlfriend loses her cell phone. She
calls up. She just, you know, oh my God,

779
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,480
I have my cell phone and that
she just picks up Mike. She goes,

780
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:00,730
let me use your phone. And
then she just goes, you know,

781
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:04,360
rings like twice and it's always the
nicest person ever on the other line.

782
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,640
She's like, Hey, yeah, yeah,
it is mine. I thank you. Oh,

783
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,290
that's awesome. Oh, okay. Got It. Right.

784
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,860
And then I'm driving her somewhere
to go pick the fucking thing.

785
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,110
That never happens for me.

786
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,840
It just rings and rings and rings and
then I just hear my voicemail. Hey,

787
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:23,351
this is bill.

788
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:25,900
You've reached my cell phone that
you're never going to fucking see again.

789
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,000
Please leave a message and you
might want to call river, you know,

790
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:35,070
call fucking Verizon and avid shutoff is
for somebody calls Trinidad on this God

791
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:41,500
damn thing. Fuck. So that was my day.

792
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,490
This is how old I am too. You know what?
When I was flying out here, there was a,

793
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:49,990
there was nobody sitting next to me and
actually he was fell asleep, you know,

794
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,720
laying down on the row.
And when I woke up,

795
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,980
like I felt like my lower body
dislocated from my upper body.

796
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:01,120
It wasn't even like my back hurt.
It was just like,

797
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,830
I felt like I hit by a fucking car.

798
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,400
It's been a brutal day is what
I'm trying to say. People.

799
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,310
But my weekend in Philly was awesome.
So many people showed up.

800
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:13,780
So many people showed up. We added a show
that's never happened to me, you know?

801
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,430
So I want to thank everybody.

802
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:18,220
Before I get going on this
long rambling podcast here,

803
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,220
I want to thank everybody in
Philadelphia who came out to see me.

804
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,200
I had a great time and I was
working there with, uh, Joe to Rosa,

805
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:30,010
the a teen idol,
the new hot shot teen idol on the opiod.

806
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:33,910
Anthony show was opening up for me and,
uh,

807
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,500
all my God did the Raiders just score
a fucking touchdown is in no flag.

808
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,240
Holy Shit. Are they finally
going to beat the charges?

809
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,330
Okay. I don't want to ruin you guys.
Who Anybody Tivo the fucking game.

810
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:52,330
They just went up 1917 with two 34 left.

811
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,840
You know, it's funny, I
was supposed to have a bet,

812
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,520
you know I'm a patriots fan and I was
supposed to bet these guys shredding

813
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,060
Reagan out in Buffalo,
right?

814
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,620
I made him a $50 bet last year when Tom
Brady went down that they are patriots

815
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:07,960
who are gonna make the playoffs. Cause
they was saying that they would done.

816
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,000
So if the Patriots didn't
make the playoffs, I on
both 50 bucks. But if I won,

817
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:18,040
they had to read a written apology to
build Bella check that I wrote and they

818
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,550
had to read it on the air.
We went 11 and five but we didn't make it.

819
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,580
So I owed him 50 bucks, but I never went
to buffalo and it can never pay him.

820
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,720
So Lo and behold, the first
game of season, we're playing
buffalo. So I go, hey,

821
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:33,050
let's go double or nothing, you
know? And they wouldn't touch it.

822
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,480
They would not touch the fucking
game on air. I was like, dude,

823
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,880
the worst you could do is break even.
And then they still,

824
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:43,610
they still wouldn't back their own
team and look at the fucking game.

825
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:45,830
They actually almost want it.
They were actually did win it.

826
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:50,360
They just blew the game.
But uh, so I'm glad,

827
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,050
I'm glad I saved myself. 50 bucks each.
Shredding Regen. If you listen to this,

828
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,950
you guys punked out. And you know what's
funny was when I got off the plane,

829
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,830
I actually got a message from
one of the guys that works.

830
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:04,460
There's t trying to get me to
call in at the last second.

831
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:09,170
I bet a lot of their listeners call them
punks for not taking the bet. And uh,

832
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,140
unfortunately I'd lost my cell
phone or I would've called in,

833
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,280
but it worked out for me.
Um,

834
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,710
I'm too fucking frazzled to do this guys.
I really am. I can't fucking do this,

835
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,110
but I got to get this done because I got
too much shit to do tomorrow usually.

836
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,370
And I enjoyed doing the podcast.
It's usually in the morning.

837
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:32,300
I'm usually screaming and I'm having a
good fucking time, but now it's late.

838
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,500
My dog's asleep.
My downstairs neighbors asleep downstairs.

839
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:37,550
Neighbor doesn't like us.

840
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,150
We have hardwood floors and my
girlfriend has high heel shoes.

841
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,410
So you can do the math on that one. Let's
just get, let's just cut to the chase.

842
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:50,210
You guys mind if I do a short one this
week? Yeah. Well to fucking bed. Um,

843
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,540
let me, let me give you some happy shit
because this isn't going to be happy.

844
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,440
I'm fucking exhausted. Let me give you
some youtube videos to watch this week.

845
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,650
All right. This first one, um,

846
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:04,850
I stumbled across because someone
else showed me something else.

847
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:06,710
Um,

848
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:12,850
this video which you want to search
is it says try not to laugh or say

849
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,240
WTF. Basically what the fuck. But
you just write WTF all lowercase.

850
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,890
Try not to laugh or say WTF and a,

851
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,670
I'm have a feeling a lot of women won't
find it funny because it's just really

852
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:34,030
like you'd have to be in the seventh
grade or a mail to find this funny.

853
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,270
I can't even explain why.
It's why it's funny,

854
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,780
but it just makes me laugh my ass off.
But it's,

855
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:45,200
it's a great video cause you will either
laugh or you will say, what the fuck?

856
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,660
Um, here's another one.
Somebody sent me a search,

857
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:54,170
gay top gun.
You guys ever seen the movie top gun?

858
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,820
And you've seen Tarantino goes on his
rant that it's actually a homo erotic

859
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:02,780
movie. The way this person
edits it is fucking hilarious.

860
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,680
And I haven't seen the movie.
Oh my God,

861
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:09,920
I probably haven't seen that movie since
the late eighties. You know, I remember,

862
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:14,120
I saw, did I see in the movie theaters
now? I think somebody bought it.

863
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:18,170
So many, my family bought that movie that
was actually considered a good movie,

864
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,220
you know, and uh, you know,

865
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:25,470
we had it on Vhs, so, you know,

866
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:27,690
the usual life of a VHS tape,

867
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:32,100
it lasted like a fucking year then it
was all screwed up from being rewound,

868
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,870
you know? So I haven't seen it basically
since of what have 89 or 90 and uh,

869
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:42,000
I got to go with Tarantino on that one.
At least the way this Guy Edison movie,

870
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,580
man, it's fucking, it's
really funny. All right.

871
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:47,970
The last youtube video you might
want to check out at this one.

872
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,820
And I'm just search a dance kick baby.

873
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,340
Alright. Comedian, last night who I
worked with, very funny guy told me to uh,

874
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:04,110
Jeff and I've already forget
his last name. I'm such a
moron. He was hilarious. So,

875
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,120
uh, he told me to check this
while dance kicked baby. Um,

876
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,540
it's, it's, I can't say it's funny. It,

877
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,160
it'll definitely make you put
your hand over your mouth. Um,

878
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:20,460
cause it's not dance kicked baby.
It's not that.

879
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:25,050
It's dancing and then a baby gets
kicked. All right? You want to,

880
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:28,800
if you want to see what happens when a
toddler gets fucking, just check it out.

881
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,860
All right. There's a lot of sick fucks
are going to look at that one first. Um,

882
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,400
like I said, this is going to
be real economical, economical,

883
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:39,990
whoever the fuck you say at this week,
uh, let's plow ahead. Here's some advice.

884
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:43,240
Somebody wants to listen to this story.
This one really a,

885
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,800
this one really grabbed me here
on a lot of levels. All right,

886
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:49,170
bill asked bill a bill.

887
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:52,350
I was at a family birthday party
today when some friends of mine,

888
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,530
friends of my dad's showed up with
their smoking hot daughter, um,

889
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,000
make after making a few
glances at each other.

890
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,210
I figured I had a good chance of
getting her number. I went over to her,

891
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,480
my dad introduced us and we made a little
small talk. Her mom then asked if a,

892
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,300
she wanted a piece of cake or anything.

893
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:13,230
So I decided to be a fucking gentleman
and offered to get her a piece.

894
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,690
So I come back with a slice of cake
in hand only to see my brother,

895
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,730
and he's written this in capital letters.
So you know,

896
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:22,860
this isn't going to go anywhere good.
He goes,

897
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,180
I come back only to see my brother
capital letters talking to her,

898
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:28,770
um,

899
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:33,330
and already getting her number on the
guys that she's interested in getting into

900
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:36,920
law enforcement and he
happens to be a cop. Uh,

901
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,080
that pretty much canceled me out since
there's no way I was going to pull the

902
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:44,010
same shit in which both brothers
asked her for her number. Yeah.

903
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,990
That would've been creepy. So he goes, uh,

904
00:55:45,991 --> 00:55:50,610
I handed the cake and the three of us
talk some more until her parents decided

905
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:55,050
to leave since it was towards
the end of the party already. Um,

906
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,430
after that, after they left, I
immediately told my brother, you know,

907
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:02,520
walked up to my brother and I told him,
what the fuck.

908
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,910
Since everybody could tell I
was trying to get our number.

909
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,260
He joked along with my,
what is that?

910
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:14,820
U. N. D. E. S. I don't
know what that word means.

911
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,080
Eat all my uncles. I couldn't read that.
Sorry. This is volumes up way too high.

912
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:22,320
Here. Let me turn this
thing down. Sorry. Um,

913
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,400
record level.

914
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,090
I don't know. I don't know how to
fucking do that on the fly to it.

915
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,430
Does that work? That's better. Hello? No,
it's still fucked up. All right. Whatever.

916
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:38,230
I'll hold the mic away from me.
Told you guys,

917
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:42,730
this one's going to be brutal
and exhausted. Um, anyways,

918
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,460
so he goes, yeah. So I went up
to him. I said, what the fuck?

919
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,160
Since everyone could tell I
was trying to get a number.

920
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:53,161
He joked along with my uncles
saying she's 26 and uh,

921
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,700
I guess he's 20 and his brother,
the cop is 21.

922
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,730
So he choked her with his uncle,
said, come on man, she's 26.

923
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:05,500
She's out of your league. And that
he beat me to it. I figured, yeah,

924
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:07,660
I guess he did and didn't.
Uh,

925
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,600
so I did make a big deal
or anything after that.

926
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:15,850
Since I'm not a little bitch,
who's going to cry about it?

927
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,570
I'm going to cry about some twice number.
However,

928
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:23,350
I still thought it was fucked up.
If it had been the other way around,

929
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:25,270
I would have just let
my brother do his thing.

930
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:30,030
I guess it comes down to the bar scene
where if you step away to get a bitch of

931
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:34,780
drink, you're leaving the field pretty
much open for anybody else. I don't know.

932
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:39,940
Do you think it was a fucked up
move or just part of the game? Uh,

933
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,640
thanks and hope to see you on stage soon.
Um,

934
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,550
well what do I think
about that? Ah, all right.

935
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:50,230
I don't want to blame the victim here,

936
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:55,470
but what I learned in that letter is
that your brother's kind of a dick.

937
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,790
You know,
that's kind of a dick move.

938
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,650
And uh, you know, I wouldn't have
done that to my brother, but you know,

939
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:09,640
he's doing it to you that that's, that's
a dick move. And you live with the guy.

940
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:12,490
So you know he's a Dick.
You know what I mean?

941
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,720
And you kind of answered the question.
Yeah, you never, you never leave.

942
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,560
First of all, even if you know,
even if he didn't come over,

943
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:22,630
you're already setting up the
relationship that, you know,

944
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:27,060
you're just going to be
fetching her stuff, offering
her, you know, are you cold?

945
00:58:27,061 --> 00:58:30,040
Do you want me to get you a blanket?
You know, you don't wanna be that guy.

946
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,310
You know your brother.
I don't know.

947
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,660
I really want to make fun of the fact
that he went to law enforcement a,

948
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:40,630
let me teach you how to be a cop. All
right? This is how your Fris somebody,

949
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,270
you know, but believe me,
you use what you got. You,

950
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,650
you think I have never met
her fucking good looking girl.
And I said, uh, you know,

951
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:52,651
worked away in that I was a comedian and
an invited her to his show her in one

952
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:56,680
of her friends hoping desperately she
would only show up by herself so I could

953
00:58:56,681 --> 00:59:01,000
try and fucking banger. So I can't
get mad at him for that. Um, yeah,

954
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:04,270
in the future I would just, I just
wouldn't do that shit around your brother.

955
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,990
That's a really asshole thing and I
think you need to get him back somehow.

956
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:12,550
I want to, I want a story of revenge
from you. That's what I want.

957
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:16,150
But the end of the day do the chicks
fucking 26 years old and you know,

958
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:20,560
she's got a 21 year old trying to
figure out our future, you know,

959
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,870
she's a loser and plus, you know, just the
way you were talking about it, you know,

960
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:26,610
I learned a, you know, you
never leave a bitch alone to,

961
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:30,860
you just wanted to fuck her anyways.
Right. So whatever lesson learned,

962
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,580
lesson learned, and to use the top
gun analogy, your brother is now,

963
00:59:35,581 --> 00:59:39,800
he's not a wing man. He's not a good
wing men. So fuck that guy. And uh,

964
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,590
I dunno,
you know what you could do,

965
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:46,280
this is something I used to do way back
in the day when I was in Boston and I

966
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:49,490
used to go to this place,
daisy Buchanan's on Newbury street,

967
00:59:49,491 --> 00:59:52,190
which was a total fucking meat
market and I'm sure it still is.

968
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,650
I used to go in there with a,
with a couple friends of mine,

969
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,010
you know, going there, you know,

970
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,700
I have a couple of drinks and just
start talking shit to girls or whatever.

971
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:05,720
Trying to fucking hook up because God
knows that's easy to have three guys.

972
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,400
That's always a nice magic number.

973
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,190
No wonder we never hooked up.
But we used to go in there

974
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,120
and I forgot what you just called it,
dropping bombs.

975
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:20,600
I can't remember what it was,
but basically you wouldn't cock block,

976
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,510
but she would definitely fuck
with your friend. If he was,

977
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:25,610
you'd see him hitting on a
girl and it was going well.

978
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:30,620
You'd walk up to him and you would just
make up some detail about his life.

979
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:34,010
That would be embarrassing,
that he would have to somehow play off.

980
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,120
Um, unless she got serious
and you really got mad.

981
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:41,750
Like a buddy of mine did one time and
mentioned that a friend of mine was still

982
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:45,650
living in the basement with his mom.
That's what he said.

983
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:50,060
He had just got done striking out.
So then he came walking up,

984
01:00:50,061 --> 01:00:53,300
all hammered and he's like,
Oh yeah, this guy was fucked.

985
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,260
This guy was one of these dudes.

986
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:58,130
You know all those guys who like who
look up at the ceiling when they talk.

987
01:00:58,131 --> 01:01:02,300
And he was one of those guys and he just
came walking up and that's what he said.

988
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,280
He goes, Oh yeah, yeah,
you liked this guy.

989
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:06,090
Hey did you mentioned that you
still live at home with you?

990
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,150
And he said it really angry.

991
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:15,290
You know what else this guy
did as a classic story? I
kept leaving in a fucking,

992
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:17,330
told us we were in daisy
Buchanan is one night, right?

993
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,660
It was just one of those nights, you
know, I dunno what we were talking,

994
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,600
the women were responding.
We were like, Holy Shit,

995
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:28,130
this is going great for once because
believe me, we did not do well.

996
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:32,300
There's a reason I had to get on a stage
and act like a jackass. Okay. So, uh,

997
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:36,450
I don't know what happened. Met this group
of girls and it was going great and I,

998
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:39,690
we all having a good time and everybody
kind of paired off, everybody was vibing,

999
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:44,090
right? And um, all of a sudden
you just felt the whole energy,

1000
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,980
energy of the bar just look towards the
front door was like somebody, you know,

1001
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:51,090
famous or, or something
was going on. You know,

1002
01:01:51,091 --> 01:01:52,970
like when all of a sudden
there's like a commotion,

1003
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,470
everybody just looks in that
direction, right. So it was weird.

1004
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,680
Everybody just sort of
collectively looked at the doors,

1005
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,850
like a wave that went across
the room every second.

1006
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:05,120
Everybody felt the energy just looked
in the direction you felt the energy

1007
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,880
coming from. And we look over
at the door and I swear to God,

1008
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:13,460
what the fuck just happened?
San Diego just scored Jesus Christ.

1009
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:18,110
Fucking Raiders.
God Damn fucking guys.

1010
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,500
Just can they ever beat San Diego? All
right, let me plow ahead. So they fucking,

1011
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:23,503
um,

1012
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,760
everybody just goes and looks at the door
and we look over and there's this guy

1013
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:33,170
dressed like Elvis fucking
Elvis impersonator.

1014
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,660
This is the most bizarre cock block
I ever got. This guy standing there,

1015
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,250
of course like fat Elvis, some
comic did that joke. Nobody,

1016
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,660
nobody ever dresses up like the in shape
Elvis because no one was ever that good

1017
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:46,820
looking. They always dress like the
fat one or something like that. Right.

1018
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,850
So everyone's just fat Elvis.
He's got the fucking, you know,

1019
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:52,520
right before he overdosed on pills,
sunglasses on,

1020
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:58,300
and he was doing all like these moves
to whatever music was on and uh,

1021
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:03,460
he fucking, yeah, like every girl
in the bar and was like, oh my God,

1022
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:07,200
they all fucking ran over
to the guy. Yeah. Right.

1023
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,640
So it was like everything was going great
with could we're going to hook up and

1024
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:13,590
next thing you know,
fucking fake.

1025
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:17,520
Elvis walks in and the girls just run
away and they all run up to the guy

1026
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:19,410
because they don't want to get
like their picture taken with them,

1027
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:22,770
a fucking whatever. So every guy in the
bar were kind of stand like, yeah, duty.

1028
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:23,820
You fuck you gotta be kidding me.

1029
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:27,120
Right till my buddy who looks
up at the ceiling, he has,

1030
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:31,870
he walks up to the guy, you know,
and the guy standing up to a meeting,

1031
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,320
everybody will show up, man. How
you doing? All right. All right.

1032
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:37,470
Taking care of business. How you doing
buddy? Like doing the Elvis thing.

1033
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:41,310
He's got the fucking leg
shaking and everything. So my
buddy goes up there, right?

1034
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,830
And he starts shaking the
guy's hand. He's like, well,

1035
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:46,860
shut up my Maya and my buddy's
like squeezing his hand. Right?

1036
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,440
And he's looking up at the ceiling.
Yeah,

1037
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:51,510
but the fake Elvis can tell these pissed.
He's like, what? What's the mind of man?

1038
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,450
And my body's just like, he goes, hey
dude. He's like squeezing in his hand.

1039
01:03:56,451 --> 01:03:59,630
He goes, hey buddy, why can't
you just be yourself? You know?

1040
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:02,570
He's like looking up the same way
because why can't you just be yourself?

1041
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,970
You know? He goes, I like the red sox.

1042
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:07,910
I don't come in here dressed like
Roger Clemens and the guys like going,

1043
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,940
he's Kinda dropping character going, all
right man. All right dude. All right.

1044
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,181
All right.

1045
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,510
Like his voice has changed it and they
start having this fucking handshake fight,

1046
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:17,960
squeezing each other's hands.
And they were about ready to go at it.

1047
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,060
And at that point I was like,

1048
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,650
I was gonna see the greatest thing ever
because my buddy was big. I was like,

1049
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:28,510
if he fucking punches this fake Elvis and
I see those plastic glasses helicopter

1050
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:32,500
off of his fucking face, ah,
please let him be wearing a wig.

1051
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,730
And right before they did it was like,

1052
01:04:33,731 --> 01:04:36,940
you ever see like a Nhl game when the
ref steps in right before two goons are

1053
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:39,910
gonna go at it. The guy fucking
broke it up, but it was still good.

1054
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,080
My buddy had a fucking handshake
fight with Elvis impersonator.

1055
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:49,680
It really just broke the guy down.
That's what I loved. Everyone is like,

1056
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:53,340
oh my God, Elvis, what's
going on? I thought you died.
No Man, I'm always alive.

1057
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:58,260
He's just playing along. Oh God. Let me
get a picture of the okay on it. You know,

1058
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,480
he's doing all that shit and then
my buddy just comes up. Hey Dude,

1059
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,730
why can't you just be yourself?

1060
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:13,290
Ah, fuck. Those were some drunk
days. All right, let's plow ahead.

1061
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,860
What the fuck was I talking about?
Yeah. You know what, dude? MMM.

1062
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,320
Two things I would tell you
when your brother, first of all,

1063
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:23,050
don't fucking hit on women when you're
around your fucking conti brother.

1064
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:27,730
And if he does pull some
shit like that, uh, you know,

1065
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:29,950
you got to do something that you,
this is what you gotta do to that guy.

1066
01:05:29,951 --> 01:05:33,160
What you have to do is the next
time he's hitting on a girl,

1067
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:35,080
you have to deliberately
go over and fuck it up.

1068
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:37,060
You got to figure out
some way to fuck it up.

1069
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,480
And what you're doing here is you're kind
of shooting one across the bow just to

1070
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:45,160
let them know that if he
does that shit to you again,

1071
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:47,530
that there will be like repercussions.
You know what I mean?

1072
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:51,100
And then just get the fuck away
from the guy and continue on.

1073
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,430
You know you're doing fine. Right. You
had no problem walking up to the girl.

1074
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:59,140
He had a strategy. You're good. But
yeah, there's no, there's no sense dude.

1075
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:01,690
You're 20 years old, man. You're
in fucking mint condition.

1076
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,920
He don't eat some fucking 26 year
old we can do with that. Right.

1077
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,460
I know you'd fucker. Exactly, but
you're not going to marry you, right?

1078
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:12,970
You don't have any feelings for us. A
fucking fucker. And Fuck your brother.

1079
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:18,820
Fucking 20 year, 21 year old cop
cop were at the mall. How did he,

1080
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:23,440
how long do you have to go to
school to be a cop? You know?

1081
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,050
Anybody else have that?
Like you went to,

1082
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:30,070
there's a kid in the grade above you
and he's like the biggest maniac ever.

1083
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:32,710
And then you become a senior and
next thing you know he's coming in,

1084
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,350
he's breaking up keg parties
and you're like, dude,

1085
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,850
I was in shop class with you six months
ago. No, I'm a police officer now.

1086
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,830
Wow. Well full on. You've
got the gun and everything.

1087
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,660
I think I just missed a
fucking unbelievable game
doing this God damn podcast.

1088
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:54,040
It was two scores late in the game.
You know what I hate about football?

1089
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:59,410
I hate how they always show the Douche
bags who dress up like they're going to

1090
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:04,360
the rocky horror picture show. You know
what I mean? I went to a Raiders game.

1091
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:09,361
Not everybody is dressed like a
douchebag and make no mistake.

1092
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,630
Those are douchebags.
Okay.

1093
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:18,130
There's people who fucking make a
hat out of a football. You know,

1094
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,800
they did it the Patriots game too.
I was joking with my buddy, I go,

1095
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:24,140
can't they just show some regular fan
who looks like he has season tickets and

1096
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:27,820
could actually talk about the game?
This guy had like a, you know,

1097
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,790
silver glitter on his
face with the Patriots.

1098
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:35,050
Amble people wearing football
helmets to the game. You know,

1099
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,630
it's almost like the guy in the TV
truck is just telling the cameraman,

1100
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:42,430
just find the biggest douche bag you can
find. That's what we're going to show.

1101
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,390
I went to, I went to a Raiders game
a couple of years ago. Man, it was,

1102
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:49,690
it was great. You know,
just a legendary place.

1103
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,850
Even though it's been a while
since they've had a lot of success.

1104
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:55,060
They did go to a super bowl,
gets Tampa Bay a few years ago,

1105
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:57,460
but I actually met this older guy,
man.

1106
01:07:57,461 --> 01:08:02,170
He had like the Ken Stabler silver and
white beard at some booze on his breath.

1107
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:03,460
You know,
he's a football fan.

1108
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,050
If I wasn't sitting there dressed
like Boba Fett is fucking dumb.

1109
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,290
Hate people do that shit. All
right, let's plow ahead here. Um,

1110
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,410
all right. Uh, Bill,

1111
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,290
I was bored and thought I might
give you something to think about.

1112
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:22,970
I live in Europe and would love to move
to the u s but I have no idea how to

1113
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:26,780
even apply or even if
it's a good time to do it.

1114
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,810
I'm 30 and I've been stalling for years,

1115
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:33,260
but I don't want to pack a bag and just
end up as a some homeless guy in the

1116
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:37,790
corner in America.
I've always loved New York as the idea,

1117
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,280
as the idea of this,
that city.

1118
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,920
What as the idea of a city that
never sleeps fits me. I'm, as,

1119
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,090
I'm a little older now,

1120
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:51,440
I've already seen most of my friends
friends leave into the domestic lifestyle

1121
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,510
and I just can't fit into that yet.

1122
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:58,340
I spent a lot of time alone for a few
years and it's just like your act,

1123
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:02,420
you start going a little crazy. Um,
I feel like an observer in life,

1124
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:08,320
so I do and say stuff just to
see what happens sometimes.

1125
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:12,800
Would it be, sorry I'm scrolling
down here. Would be a good ground.

1126
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,570
Would that be a good
ground for comedy maybe?

1127
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,040
Or should I have started in my twenties
I also play guitar and people have said

1128
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:24,620
I might have something
musically for years,

1129
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:28,310
but I was always a coward in my youth
and couldn't get on stage unless I was

1130
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,780
hammered.
So I never got anywhere.

1131
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:34,640
Now I'm worried I lost too many screws
and as my social network has begun

1132
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:35,474
failing,

1133
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:39,920
I just get the bitter alone
against the word world feeling.

1134
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,590
It feels like I'm at a crossroads.

1135
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,670
Everything I've seen in life seems like
a weird dream and I'm surrounded by

1136
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:51,230
strangers. What do you think? I
think that's pretty fucking deep. Um,

1137
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,920
what is, well, if you're not married,

1138
01:09:54,921 --> 01:09:57,530
you don't have any kids and you want
to always wanted to move to New York,

1139
01:09:57,531 --> 01:09:58,370
just fucking do it.

1140
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,680
Save up some money and just do what
you're never going to regret. You know?

1141
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,860
Or if you live in America and you're
like, Hey, I always want to go to Paris,

1142
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:10,760
what would happen if I just fucking
went there? Do it. The very least.

1143
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:12,920
You just got to get some great stories.
You know,

1144
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,990
you're going to come over
wherever you're going to go.

1145
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,760
You're going to have an accent.
You're gonna Hook Up.

1146
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,420
It's going to be a good time. I would
definitely say to go and don't mind.

1147
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:23,090
Fuck yourself into thinking
you're too old to do shit.

1148
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:29,240
Look failing. The, uh,
uh, how do we put this

1149
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:35,450
failing is overrated is far as
like the pain that people have.

1150
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:38,780
It's not doing it because I have
a lot of fucking regrets in life.

1151
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:41,600
I got a lot of undergrads,
I'm not going to get into them,

1152
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:46,160
but I got a lot of fucking regrets
and I've failed a lot as a comedian,

1153
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:50,030
but none of them really hurt cause
I just kept doing it. You know,

1154
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,080
remember that old Michael
Jordan commercial where he
talks about shooting the

1155
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:56,750
basketballs, all the shots
he's missed. He's like,

1156
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:59,720
I failed over and over and over and
over again and that's why I succeed.

1157
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,730
You got to take that mentality through.
Failing is fucking hilarious. Failing is,

1158
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:09,440
it's the best stories. It's the funniest
fucking stories. Watch when people,

1159
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,980
when actors go and they
do panel on talk shows,

1160
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:16,020
they never talk about,
you know, oh I did this.

1161
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:19,500
The bad guests go on there and talk.
Oh, I work with his director. Oh my God,

1162
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:20,334
he was so great.

1163
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,600
But the good guests go on there and they
talk about bad auditions that they had

1164
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,990
or stupid things that they did in the
great movie that they're promoting.

1165
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,610
That's what the fuck you do, you
know, to kill as a guest. Look at me.

1166
01:11:32,611 --> 01:11:35,490
I'm a little tired. I'm, I'm,
I'm making a different point now.

1167
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,910
Now I'm telling you how to kill doing
panel even though I've never fucking done

1168
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:42,990
it. Um, yeah, dude moved in New York.

1169
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:44,490
You're not gonna be homeless.

1170
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:48,420
It's like a big river and you just
jump in and you just start swimming.

1171
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,930
But from the outside it looks impossible.
But once you go there, you're fine.

1172
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:57,390
You know? And if you do an up homeless,
fortunately it's a walkable city,

1173
01:11:57,391 --> 01:12:00,720
so there's plenty of people to panhandle.
Although if you're white,

1174
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:02,450
you might have a rough
time. At least. I did.

1175
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,280
Did it one day as a joke just
to see what people would do.

1176
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:09,420
I was dressed really nicely and it
just had a cup. Excuse me sir. Sir,

1177
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:11,430
could you spare a little change?
Just trying to get home,

1178
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,370
try and make a phone call.
But I had a shit eating grin,

1179
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,880
so I didn't make any money.
All right, next question.

1180
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,020
Now I'm plowing ahead
this week, people. Uh,

1181
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:26,490
all right. Hey Bill. I'm a huge fan.
Thank you. Thank you very much. All right.

1182
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,610
You won't be after this
low energy podcast, um,

1183
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,650
throughout my life no
matter what I've done, I've,

1184
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:36,360
I am known for being a horrible child.
All right guys, let's stop here. Uh,

1185
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:40,680
just let's just remember that I
barely got out of college and I have a

1186
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:42,000
communications degree.

1187
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:46,080
So let me communicate with you right now
and let you know that if you guys are

1188
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:48,660
going to go real deep,
cause I had somebody sent me like one,

1189
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:53,540
they would like suicidal and uh,
I kind of didn't touch it because a,

1190
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:55,050
I didn't want to give the wrong advice.

1191
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,060
I was going to say go talk to
somebody quite qualified, you know,

1192
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:05,100
and don't kill yourself. All
right, so let's try it. Let's,

1193
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:08,250
you know, let's, let's back off the
throttle a little bit here. People,

1194
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,830
this is supposed to be a funny podcast.
All right.

1195
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:15,090
The light guy just walking around feeling
like it's the dream and I'm alone.

1196
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:19,860
You know, I, that's when it starts getting
like, all right, I've had those thoughts.

1197
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:22,560
Well, I guess I've had those
thoughts so I can relate. You know,

1198
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:25,440
I thought about killing myself.
A lot of people think that shit,

1199
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:27,750
you just don't do it.
You know what I mean?

1200
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,480
It's like leg sweep and a chick. You
think about it, you just don't do it.

1201
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:37,890
But if someone makes a video of it, you
fucking watch it. And it's hilarious. Um,

1202
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:40,500
all right, let's plow through
here. Throughout my life,
no matter what I've done,

1203
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,980
I've always been known for being
a horrible child. All right?

1204
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:47,640
This guy has gotten right to the root
of his paint. No matter what I did,

1205
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:49,080
it wasn't good enough.
Um,

1206
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:52,200
I think I'm pretty and I feel bad
cause I mean making fun of people as if

1207
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:55,620
fucking really opening up here. So
let me stop doing that. All right. Uh,

1208
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:58,650
I think I'm a pretty good kid
compared to, uh, the people.

1209
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:02,700
I know my grades aren't that good,
but hey, I haven't gotten held back.

1210
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,840
Well as a positive way of looking
at it. You got a D in math? Yeah.

1211
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:09,630
Did I stay back?
Will I write then shut the fuck up.

1212
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:14,110
I'm 15 and I have an older brother, two
years older and I have a younger brother,

1213
01:14:14,111 --> 01:14:17,200
two years younger. Uh, the
younger one is annoying.

1214
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:22,090
So if he starts bothering me, I say
something to him telling him to stop.

1215
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,680
Um, oh, when I do that, I'm being a dick.

1216
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,080
What?
I'm being a dick.

1217
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:33,010
When I could just slap him or something
and then he does the classic shit and

1218
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:37,720
screams like clockwork and my parents will
come in and punish, make, oh yeah, dude,

1219
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:41,140
I've been there. I had three younger
brothers. I've been there. Um,

1220
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:43,230
if he was bothering me first, Oh, if he,

1221
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,390
they punish you if he was even
bothering you first, um, what,

1222
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:48,910
what you gotta do is you've got
to muffle his voice with a pillow.

1223
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:54,460
Or you can go the opposite route is
you can torch room by tickling them is

1224
01:14:54,461 --> 01:14:57,370
basically you sit on their arms
and you do the typewriter thing.

1225
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,810
You know what I mean?
There's a lot of other ways to make,

1226
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,360
obviously the slap isn't going to work
cause he knows he's going to get you in

1227
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:04,991
trouble that way.

1228
01:15:04,991 --> 01:15:08,470
So you got to come up with creative
ways to torture your younger brother.

1229
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:12,430
Start with doing it when your
parents aren't home. All right,

1230
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:17,440
why am I telling people to
do this shit? All right. Uh,

1231
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:20,860
let me go and at some point they need to
stop babying him instead of taking his

1232
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:22,420
side because he's the youngest.

1233
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:25,930
And then there's my somewhat perfect
older brother who was always in the

1234
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:28,120
limelight. I admit, I'm jealous. I mean,

1235
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:33,121
he makes honor role plays football and
works all at the same time and I'm just

1236
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:34,840
the fuck up in the middle.

1237
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,240
Why is it middle kid always feel fucking
neglected I guess cause you're in the

1238
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:43,000
middle. I was so, you know, second oldest.

1239
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:48,670
I don't know where the fuck I was. Um, he
has always been treated better than me.

1240
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,540
I'm his best friend
got him in trouble for,

1241
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:55,900
for laying trash cans on fire back when
he was in the seventh grade and my dad

1242
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:59,680
cursed him out and told him to never
hang ultra cursed out the other kid and

1243
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:02,560
told him not to hang out with
my older brother again. Uh,

1244
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:04,090
what happens in the 12th grade?

1245
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:07,690
I'm there hanging out again
and my parents don't say shit.

1246
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,240
I have a bad friend and I haven't
even gotten in trouble with them,

1247
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:11,890
but my parents won't let
me hang out with them.

1248
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:15,340
My parents let my older brother learned
how to drive when he was 12 and I'm

1249
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:17,500
turning 16 and they
haven't taught me shit.

1250
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:21,340
I probably won't get a
damn license until I'm 25

1251
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:27,670
then they treat me like shit. Last week
I cleaned my bathroom and left, uh,

1252
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:32,500
my mini trash cans sitting outside the
bathroom and instead of being glad they

1253
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:35,020
go eight, because I leave the
trashcan outside the bedroom.

1254
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:39,850
Please tell me what you think
about this situation. Uh, yeah.

1255
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:41,410
You're getting the middle child treatment,

1256
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,940
you're getting the middle child
treatment and this is what I would say,

1257
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:50,890
beat up your younger brother when your
parents aren't around or maybe break some

1258
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:55,720
of his shit when he's not in his
room and a, your older brother, uh,

1259
01:16:55,721 --> 01:17:00,580
you can cut the brake lines on his
car. Now I'm fucking with you. Um, uh,

1260
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:05,430
you know what? Fuck them. Fuck them. If
they don't want to pay attention to you,

1261
01:17:05,431 --> 01:17:09,140
fuck them. Just keep doing your
thing. And I make a joke out of it.

1262
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:16,070
You know, you know you left a
trashcan outside the bathroom. I know.

1263
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:19,940
What was I thinking? I should have been
like my older brother and lit it on fire.

1264
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:24,230
You're absolutely right. At what point
did you realize you were bored with me?

1265
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:27,170
Huh?
When the newer version of me came along

1266
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,910
and then when she tries to interrupt,
just be like, no dad, dad, I get it.

1267
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:35,600
You don't care. You don't, I'm
the Middle Kid. What do you think?

1268
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:38,180
I don't want you to Brady bunch.
I saw what Jen went through.

1269
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,650
I'm going through the same shit.

1270
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:46,420
They bring up that shit about driving.
Huh?

1271
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:50,840
How bad a driver was my older brother
that you just decided not to teach any of

1272
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:54,980
us, you know, I dunno.

1273
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:59,210
Just go with that route. But you know,
above all, don't take it personally.

1274
01:17:59,211 --> 01:18:01,260
You just focus on your own life.
You've got to understand,

1275
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:04,370
you're probably walking around
in 15 you know, you know,

1276
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:06,590
you're at that age where you
kind of think you know some shit,

1277
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,290
but you kind of know that you
don't know a lot of other shit,

1278
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,770
that that feeling never goes away and
your parents are walking around thinking

1279
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:17,060
the same shit. So, uh, don't take them too
seriously. You know, unless they tell you,

1280
01:18:17,061 --> 01:18:20,060
you know, not to do drugs or
hanging out with that Douche bag,

1281
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:22,070
you probably shouldn't be hanging out
with them. But you know what I mean?

1282
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,840
I don't, I don't have to tell you,
dude. It's like that's shit that you,

1283
01:18:25,841 --> 01:18:26,900
you're going to get through.

1284
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,650
It gets better when you're in your
twenties you know, and you never know.

1285
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:34,400
Your brother might have peaked that
am so a lot of people, you know,

1286
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:36,290
if they get in fucking
late in high school,

1287
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,690
like do you want to say
how great your life is?

1288
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:43,280
If you're actually on the football team
and you're fucking a cheerleader in high

1289
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:46,490
school, I mean, I don't
know how you ever beat that.

1290
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,220
You have to become like
a fucking movie star.

1291
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:52,340
Like there's nowhere for those people to
go. That's why so many of those people,

1292
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,550
they, when they go out in the
real world, they, they, they,

1293
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:59,570
they fail because they've always been,

1294
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:05,270
I mean, you're king of the
world. You're on a football team.

1295
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:09,410
You're banging a cheerleader,
right? You both in your teens,

1296
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:13,340
your bodies are in mint fucking
condition and you don't have to pay rent.

1297
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,430
And if you do some dumb shit,
you still charged as a juvenile.

1298
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:19,910
I'm going to tell you right now, it's
never going to get better than that. Okay?

1299
01:19:19,911 --> 01:19:23,090
Are you going to go a long fucking way
as an adult to make it better than that?

1300
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,960
Okay.
So you know,

1301
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:29,450
I don't know if I'm cheering you up here,

1302
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:32,510
but you know it's been in the middle of
being in that mix is not a bad fucking

1303
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:34,790
thing. Being in the middle of the
herd. Cause then you can break out.

1304
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,060
You can try to figure out what you want
to do and then the fact that people kind

1305
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:40,940
of Shit on you, you get a good sense of
humor. You already wrote some funny shit.

1306
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:44,240
You'll be fine. You are fuck your
older brother and your younger brother.

1307
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,090
What are you thinking about that?
I know what to tell you, dude.

1308
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:48,500
I just don't want to fuck you
up dude. I don't, I don't,

1309
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:52,130
I don't have the background to give a 15
year old fucking advice. I really don't,

1310
01:19:52,131 --> 01:19:54,950
but I, I hope I made some sort of
sense, but don't take it too seriously.

1311
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,560
All right.
You know what I would do?

1312
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,770
I would always clean the bathroom and
always leave the trashcan out there just

1313
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:05,771
to deliberately annoy your parents and
then act slightly retarded to the point

1314
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:09,960
that they actually think back to some
drugs that they did when they were single.

1315
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:12,510
And that's why you're fucked up now,
you know, do some shit like that.

1316
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:13,920
Just passive aggressive stuff.

1317
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,770
Started having fun with the fact
that they don't pay attention to you.

1318
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:21,750
In other words, act out. That's what I'm
trying to say. All right, so let's recap.

1319
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,430
Break your younger brother's shit.

1320
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,910
Cut The brake lines and
your older brother's car.

1321
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,740
Ignore your parents and act
slightly retarded. All right,

1322
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:37,520
that's my advice. Um, oh, here's
something for you. I got good. I wrote a,

1323
01:20:37,521 --> 01:20:42,300
I got good feedback from a woman. I don't
get this very often and said, hey bill,

1324
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:45,480
just wanted to comment on your response
to the guy who got shot down at the

1325
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:47,220
sandwich shop a couple of weeks ago.

1326
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:51,300
That was a loaded question and for
what it's worth from a female fan,

1327
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,780
I thought your answer was
incredibly fair as well as funny.

1328
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,860
It is bullshit that men generally
have the burden of approaching women.

1329
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:04,020
And I know that burned is asked to have
her look at him like a Disgusting Chore,

1330
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,470
but just because She's pretty,
doesn't mean she owes everybody.

1331
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:11,820
Whoever tits honor of fucking thank you
card. I really appreciate your answer.

1332
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,410
You could have gone a much easier
and shittier root. Thanks. Yeah,

1333
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,550
you mean like how he did with the 15
year old kids question. All right.

1334
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:23,430
Every once in a while I get positive
feedback feedback from a female,

1335
01:21:23,431 --> 01:21:24,930
so I got to read it. All right, next one.

1336
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,270
I'm just going to read this
like a book this week. People.

1337
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:31,770
I'm literally nodding off here. A as
bill. Hey Bill. Uh, throughout my life,

1338
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:35,190
no matter what I've done,
and I already read this

1339
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:41,070
already. Read this one, right?
Jesus Christ. All right. Oh,

1340
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:44,550
here's some letters from people overseas,
specifically England.

1341
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,520
This section's called English [inaudible].
Hey Bill.

1342
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,820
So you thought my last email wasn't
good enough for your podcast.

1343
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:55,110
I hold no grudges. It's a recession
and you want to keep it all American.

1344
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,973
Fairplay.

1345
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:59,400
So let's keep up the theme from your
last one in attempt to get a mention,

1346
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:03,930
a shameless whoring of myself here.
Uh, you say baseball jumped the shark.

1347
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,530
Let me tell you something. Coming from
the nation that pretty much invent,

1348
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,240
invented all major sports except
the Olympics. Great Britain.

1349
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,270
You know, I like to consider myself
knowledgeable about sports. Uh,

1350
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:20,670
exactly.
What sports did you create?

1351
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:23,820
What sports did you create?

1352
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,840
Egan do the rugby thing and then
rugby developed into football.

1353
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,640
I'll give you that one. That,
that was the spawn of it. But you,

1354
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:35,640
you can't take credit for baseball.
We're going can say that's cricket.

1355
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,390
You guys sit there with that fraternity
paddle from some horrific night of

1356
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:39,811
hazing.

1357
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:42,930
You finally pulled it out
of some freshmen's ass and
now you're tried to hit a

1358
01:22:42,931 --> 01:22:47,520
racket ball over to some
guy from fucking India. Huh?

1359
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,110
What other sports have you guys invented?
Basketball. You didn't invent that.

1360
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,690
I don't know what you guys invented, but
you sure suck at all of them. You know,

1361
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,560
when's the last time you guys
won a World Cup? You know what?

1362
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:06,040
That's a great fucking question. That's
what you guys are known for soccer, right?

1363
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,430
And rugby. Like when those
douchebags over in England tried to,

1364
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:14,780
they always try to say that that foot
football players are pussies because they

1365
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:19,190
were like helmets and that type of shit.
And then you watch a rugby game.

1366
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,790
Those guys are tough. But those guys
would be hitting each other a lot,

1367
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:25,910
fucking harder if they had
pads on and shit. You know,

1368
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,330
I watched the game.
Yeah.

1369
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:31,610
It's a bunch of guys fucking stick in
their heads up each other's asses as

1370
01:23:31,611 --> 01:23:33,960
they're kicking at a football.
That's definitely, and I know,

1371
01:23:33,961 --> 01:23:37,540
you know what's funny is I never
disrespect rugby. I look at it like that.

1372
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,590
That's a tough sport and
tough guys play that sport.

1373
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,530
I don't know why they always
pick on football. I don't get it.

1374
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,550
You know what I mean?
Dude,

1375
01:23:45,551 --> 01:23:50,530
Ray Lewis would fuck up at least five
of your rugby players by himself without

1376
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:51,364
pads.

1377
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:56,290
You got nobody in your fucking little
pussy ass English rugby league that looks

1378
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:59,080
anything like Ray Lewis let
ray Lewis would destroy him.

1379
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,820
Jack Lambert,
once you bring them,

1380
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:07,060
bring me your famous fucking rugby guys
and show me how those guys are hitting

1381
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:11,470
any harder than Lawrence Taylor.
You're out of your fucking minds.

1382
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,740
How do you fucking minds?
Let's look up England,

1383
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,050
England.

1384
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:23,080
World Cup victory.

1385
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:25,620
I'm going to make a guess and I'm
going to say it's, it's somewhere.

1386
01:24:25,621 --> 01:24:27,990
It's gotta be the 1960s or before

1387
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:32,690
England World Cup victory.

1388
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,520
The World Cup victory by England.
1966. There you go. I fucking knew it.

1389
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,260
I knew it was going be back then.

1390
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:43,620
Like when the Celtics were winning
all their championships, right?

1391
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:48,720
Was Brazil not allowed in back
then? Fucking pattern. Your stats.

1392
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:53,190
Um, I'm just fucking with you guys. I
respect your sports, but I, you know what,

1393
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:57,390
what are you pretty much adventure
all major sports except the Olympics.

1394
01:24:57,391 --> 01:25:00,300
Go Fuck Yourself.
You guys didn't invent shit.

1395
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,100
You had a halfass idea that we
made tremendous. Is there any,

1396
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:08,040
you know what I mean? Like the greatest
fucking soccer player of all time. He's,

1397
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,430
is he from England?
It's Palae.

1398
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:14,580
The Michael Jordan of soccer
is not even from England's.

1399
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:19,520
Why don't you guys dominate something on
a world fucking level. I want what, what?

1400
01:25:19,521 --> 01:25:21,920
What was the last time
you guys had an athlete?

1401
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:26,280
Cause I'll tell you right now that good
looking son of a bitch for the La Galaxy

1402
01:25:26,281 --> 01:25:29,220
is not doing shit and nobody
gives a fuck about him over here.

1403
01:25:29,221 --> 01:25:31,960
You can walk up and buy a ticket.
All right.

1404
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,770
I went to La Galaxy fucking game.
I parked right next to the guy.

1405
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:40,630
I didn't even recognize him. I asked
him which way the fucking stadium was.

1406
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,890
The only reason why I knew he was on the
fucking galaxies cause he already had

1407
01:25:43,891 --> 01:25:47,700
his fucking cleats on. All right.
He can't wait to go back there.

1408
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,750
Um, all right, the fuck Bob
Beckham. All right, well let me,

1409
01:25:53,751 --> 01:25:57,440
let me get back to this fucking thing.
Ah, I think I come from some authority.

1410
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,600
Oh yeah. Once you pat yourself
on the back a little more.

1411
01:25:59,601 --> 01:26:03,920
Your English cont here we go. Baseball
always fucking sucked. No it didn't.

1412
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:09,280
And I'll tell you why it's a game suited
for America like no other hours of time

1413
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:12,770
to kill between meaningful play.

1414
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:16,820
Meaningful for some reason is two words,
meaning full,

1415
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,720
like what is the meaning of the
word? And I ate too much. Um, full,

1416
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,450
meaningful as one word.
Get Dumb cunt.

1417
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:28,620
Take the last l off the full and smash
them together. Jesus. I hope that's right.

1418
01:26:28,621 --> 01:26:32,900
Her and I just made an ass out of
myself. Uh, between meaningful, um, play.

1419
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,350
Allowing for re the required TV,

1420
01:26:36,351 --> 01:26:40,970
advertising and selling of Shit.
Overpriced food and poor beer.

1421
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:43,790
Oh Jesus Christ. Really? You
don't have any advertising there?

1422
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:48,680
There's advertising all over
the fizz advertising on the
fucking ball in England.

1423
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:54,080
You know what? Maybe if you guys scored
more than once every fucking 90 minutes.

1424
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,470
You know what I mean? You could stick
some commercials in there. Jesus Christ.

1425
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:05,650
The soccer is like hockey without the
skates and the scoring and the fighting

1426
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,970
and everything.
That makes it great.

1427
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,050
You ever see like a little sissy
get tripped out and I don't know,

1428
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:15,290
during recess and he rolls
around in the ground.

1429
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,330
It makes such a big
fucking deal out of it.

1430
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:19,070
You want to beat him with his own books.

1431
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:23,060
That's what like watching soccer is
like every five seconds. These guys,

1432
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,250
they look like if,
if Pau Gasol,

1433
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:31,010
if you could have like whatever 20 Pau
Gasol is all in the same fucking field,

1434
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:36,140
just bitch and Moan and with that crybaby
fucking face, that's what soccer is.

1435
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,420
See what you did do it.
I actually really enjoy the game,

1436
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:41,420
but you're attacking my shits
and I get attack yours. Um,

1437
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:44,600
minimal athleticism required. Yeah, dude,

1438
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:47,360
really hitting a baseball is one of
the hardest thing you do ever do.

1439
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,300
Why don't you fucking brush
your teeth and give it a chance.

1440
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:53,270
At some point you guys are swinging
with that big fucking paddle.

1441
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,510
Okay. All right. Let me go. You know,

1442
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:59,600
I would never make fun of the bicycle
kick and act like that's a simple thing to

1443
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:02,270
do anyways.
And before you come up with this stock,

1444
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:05,720
we'd like to see you face a hundred
mile an hour curve. I just did that.

1445
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:06,560
That's hilarious.

1446
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:11,570
From insert drugged up goon
here and then talk that shit.

1447
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,680
It's a game. Not a sport.
Like bowling is a game

1448
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,610
now. It isn't. I can, I can
see a bowling's a game. It's
just you standing there.

1449
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:27,680
If somebody was throwing the bowling
ball at your head at a hundred miles an

1450
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,380
hour and it was fucking changing speeds,

1451
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,820
then that would be a sport.
Okay.

1452
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:38,930
Or if he just held the ball like tee ball,
you just hit it off the stand.

1453
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:44,750
Then it would just be, that would just
be a game. I don't know. Athletes,

1454
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:48,830
athletes or people who actually move
around for the majority of the sport,

1455
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,470
cyclists,
rowers,

1456
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:56,000
even soccer players cover
around 10 k per game. Oh God.

1457
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,060
Really? Is that why they
were all built like women?

1458
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,980
You know what your athletes
look in fucking England.

1459
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:06,900
They look like mannequins at the gap.
You know? I know we're fed over here,

1460
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:10,290
but we're more muscular to you fucking
pansies over there with your poor

1461
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,480
nutrition in your
nationwide healthcare plan.

1462
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:14,900
Why don't you get some
fucking protein in your diets?

1463
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:19,320
The skinny ass fucking arms and
your little legs running around,

1464
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:20,070
not being able to,

1465
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:23,220
you know why you can't use your fucking
hands and soccer cause you fags would

1466
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:26,940
break your risks. All right. That
was homophobic. Sorry about that.

1467
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:29,870
Didn't mean to say fag. Sorry. Just
get worked up. Anyways, let's come.

1468
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,840
Let's finish this. The game comes
from an old English game of rounders,

1469
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:36,450
which was by and large a game of women.

1470
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:41,640
The fuck is he talking about now? You
know, I don't even give a shit anymore.

1471
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:48,360
Whilst me, we, me were, while the real me,

1472
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:51,970
we're playing rugby and football.
What?

1473
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,090
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1474
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:57,150
You're trying to say baseball was made
up by a woman as how he trying to say,

1475
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:57,841
you know what,
I love.

1476
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:00,690
Everybody acts like they fucking hate
America and they can't stop paying

1477
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:04,770
attention to us. I don't listen to any
English douchebags podcast. You know,

1478
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:09,120
I don't know a fucking thing.
All I know Tony Blair,

1479
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:14,040
Tony Blair bitched up and
fucking sent you guys, you know,

1480
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:17,040
got you guys into fucking Iraq too. Cause
he didn't have any balls. You know why?

1481
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:21,240
Because he plays soccer. Wow. That
was really fucking me. Alright.

1482
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:26,250
Underrated checkout. This
Scottish comedian, Frankie
Boyle, very dark but funny.

1483
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:29,370
Scottish guys are fucking hilarious.
Um,

1484
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:34,580
I look forward to your [inaudible] reply
and if I do get past your filtering

1485
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:39,300
process, fucking up reading this
out loud. Well, I did all of that.

1486
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,330
I don't have any filtering process.
I read all of these God damn things.

1487
01:30:42,331 --> 01:30:47,040
I have nothing better to do. Where are
we in this podcast? 44 fucking minutes.

1488
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:50,370
All right, let's get to some
overrated, underrated. Um,

1489
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,730
what the fuck are we going?
All right. Overrated. Uh,

1490
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:03,780
okay. Overrated drummer Neil Peart. Now,
before all the prog rock tech heads,

1491
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:06,720
start quoting modern drummer here me out.

1492
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:11,670
We've had the technology since the
1960s to program a computer to play poly

1493
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:12,570
rhythmic beats.

1494
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:17,010
Try having garage band play
Elvin Jones or Rashied Ali.

1495
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,570
I don't know who that is. Um,
dude, you can't say that man.

1496
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:23,700
Those are different kinds of drums.
Although I'm not really into Neil Peart.

1497
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:28,830
I'm not until, I think he's, I don't
know. He's just too fucking on the beat.

1498
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:33,600
He sounds like a robot. He's fucking
amazing. But uh, I like, I dunno,

1499
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,420
I think people either like John
Bonham. Oh, you like Neil Peart.

1500
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:41,340
You know what I mean? Nobody gives a
fuck. They're not drummers. All right.

1501
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:45,660
Um, I think that's it. I think
that's going to be it for the podcast

1502
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,980
as I'm fucking trying
to get a Gig in England.

1503
01:31:49,981 --> 01:31:53,970
I just fucking trashed everybody
over there. I'm just, you know,

1504
01:31:53,971 --> 01:31:57,420
everybody just fucking trashed
and American non fucking stop now.

1505
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,760
And then you go to their countries
and you know, you see fat fucks,

1506
01:32:00,761 --> 01:32:05,320
you see losers. I don't know what
they're bragging about. I really don't.

1507
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,570
They talk about how amazing their beer
is. I got to MIT, I went to Sweden,

1508
01:32:10,571 --> 01:32:13,960
they did as some good beers,
man. Couple of beers from uh,

1509
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:17,230
actually had one from Czechoslovakia,
some checks,

1510
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:19,540
some shit that doesn't even exist anymore.
The Czech Republic,

1511
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:21,760
whatever the fuck it is.
I don't know.

1512
01:32:21,761 --> 01:32:23,380
That's another thing that
bugs me about Europeans.

1513
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:26,380
They think they're so fucking worldly
cause they know all about Europe and shit

1514
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:31,210
and it's like Europe is like
basically the size of half of America.

1515
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:34,510
So if you know something about the state
next to you that's the same as like

1516
01:32:34,511 --> 01:32:36,760
somebody from England,
no one about France.

1517
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:40,630
I mean he can fucking drive there at
this point. It's really not impressive,

1518
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:42,730
but it is beautiful over there.
Whatever.

1519
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:47,170
Hitler didn't bomb bomb and is
still left standing is very nice.

1520
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:51,410
Um, all right. I was a little country
this week just cause I was tired. Uh,

1521
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,460
blame it on that. Um,
and I think that's it.

1522
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:56,870
I think that's all that I
have to say this week. Uh,

1523
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,140
I just want to thank everybody
for the tremendous turnout,

1524
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,680
the tremendous turnout in Philadelphia.

1525
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:06,550
I actually had to stay an extra day
and add a show. That was awesome. Um,

1526
01:33:06,551 --> 01:33:09,490
let me hide my show's
coming up and a don't you?

1527
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:12,910
English cons get all pissed off of what
the fuck I say because I don't even read

1528
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:16,960
half the shit that you guys.
Right. You know, calling me up,

1529
01:33:16,961 --> 01:33:19,060
telling me if I talk
about American sports,

1530
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:22,860
it's boring as if I give a flying fuck,
you know.

1531
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,710
All right, let me get to my
website. He obviously I give a fuck.

1532
01:33:26,711 --> 01:33:29,380
I'm bringing it up.
Um, and I also, if you,

1533
01:33:29,381 --> 01:33:31,240
if you're just trying to
write shit to Piss me off,

1534
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:34,060
it's going to work because I have to
respond to everything because I have that

1535
01:33:34,061 --> 01:33:38,560
disease where I have to make my point.
Um, all right, let's get to the, uh,

1536
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:42,220
what I got coming up,
not this weekend.

1537
01:33:42,221 --> 01:33:46,890
Next weekend I'm going to be at
the Improv in Addison, Texas. Uh,

1538
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,260
September 24th, 25th, 26th.

1539
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,910
And I'm also the Sunday.
Is that the 27th?

1540
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,210
I think I added the day cause I'm
hanging around going to the cowboys game.

1541
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:01,120
Let me see here.
Uh,

1542
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:05,860
checking out the calendar.
Yeah. And the 27th,

1543
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:08,650
I'll be there Thursday through Sunday.
We added a Sunday show.

1544
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:12,400
I'm going to be there. God Damn, it's to
bring your friends down and I'll see it,

1545
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:17,170
the cowboy's game on Monday.
Then on, um, October 2nd,

1546
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:19,870
third and fourth, I'm going to be at
the stress factory in New Brunswick,

1547
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:22,540
New Jersey.
And uh,

1548
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:25,840
the following weekend I'll be at the
Improv and Pittsburgh and all the rest of

1549
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:28,420
my dates are up. My website. I
want to thank everybody for a,

1550
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,950
all the great support. I've really had
a tremendous last couple of gigs here,

1551
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:36,070
you know, going to Atlanta
over to Stockholm, Sweden,

1552
01:34:36,071 --> 01:34:40,000
and then down to Philadelphia.
Really tremendous turnout.
I really appreciate it.

1553
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,750
And, uh, all you guys basically out there
asking me when I'm going to come to your

1554
01:34:43,751 --> 01:34:48,040
country, you know, Australia, New
Zealand, I'm working on that shit.

1555
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:52,720
I'm going to try to put some,
uh, youtube videos up on a,

1556
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:56,740
I discovered when I was in Stockholm,
Sweden, that youtube, you know,

1557
01:34:56,741 --> 01:34:59,630
there's like literally just like
Wikipedia, you know what I mean?

1558
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:00,750
There's all kinds of different youtube.

1559
01:35:00,751 --> 01:35:04,790
So I just stuck with the English one
because I'm a fucking American surrounded

1560
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:08,240
by people speaking English
and water. But, uh,

1561
01:35:08,241 --> 01:35:10,850
I'm gonna try to get some shit
up on maybe the Australian one,

1562
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,070
the England English one or whatever.

1563
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,770
I guess evidently that's a way
to build a following over there.

1564
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:19,070
So hopefully I can travel over there
and maybe I'll check out some of your

1565
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:22,190
sporting events and maybe I'll change
my opinions, but she knows something.

1566
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:27,370
I would be way more open to enjoying
sports from England or someplace else.

1567
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:31,560
If you could just tell me about them
without fucking trashing [inaudible],

1568
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:35,470
you know, American sports first. If
you just want to hear me flip out,

1569
01:35:35,471 --> 01:35:39,900
then by all means, continue
what you're doing because
it's working. All right? But,

1570
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:43,020
uh, you know, hey, no disrespect to
your troops that went over to Iraq too.

1571
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:46,040
You know, I just wanna make sure I
didn't get a little out of hand there.

1572
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:50,270
All right. This is all jokes, so don't
send me any fucking hate mail. All right.

1573
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:53,270
That's the money Moni podcast for this
week. Thank you everybody for listening.

1574
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:58,400
And, uh, I know there was one other
fucking thing I didn't get to.

1575
01:35:58,401 --> 01:36:01,500
Maybe I'll get to it next week.
That's it. That's it for the pot

1576
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:03,510
cast. Everybody have a
great weekend. I'm fucking.
