1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,620
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,100
May 7th,

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,450
2012 2012 baby. What's going
on? Do you guys have a,

4
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:17,240
why am I yelling? Why am
I yelling? You know why?

5
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:20,960
Cause I've got a good night's sleep and
I just had some waffles so I got dead

6
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:25,580
fucking sugar rush. Yeah, I
made, Ooh, just slam my computer.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,090
It gives a fuck. I can't figure
out how to work in any ways. Um,

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,310
I had um, I had some waffles for
breakfast. Now why did you just shut off?

9
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:36,470
You can't.
Oh,

10
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:41,150
I see it just sorta Jesus built everything
that technology does is not an attack

11
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:44,450
on you. Why don't you just
relax? I need, hang on guys.

12
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,110
I just need to talk to myself
for a second. All right.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,420
Just sit and think. Figure out what
happened. Stop taking the bait.

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,303
All right.
I'm back.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,320
Yeah, it's in fucking waffles.
I actually made them yesterday.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,850
I'm gonna take you guys
through my boring day.

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,220
It sounds like the beginning of a
Bruce Springsteen song, doesn't it?

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,330
Hi. Made so waffles. It was over.

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,930
[inaudible] up.
Oh my God.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,400
How does he turn it around the
breakfast limericks from that guy.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,291
You know what,

22
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,230
it's one of my goals to see him live in
concert because I've been making fun of

23
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:19,440
him forever and half of my friends had
been making fun of them and then they go

24
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,880
see him in concert and they were like,
dude,

25
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,020
you got to go see that guy in concert,
you know with his class 300 bike.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,580
Um, he's got, he's got
a, he's got one of those.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,670
I don't know if he was a dog. He'd be
one of those dogs with the motion faces.

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,260
You know,
he's got one of those boxer.

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,100
I'm the same dentition of
like a boxer or like a pug.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,143
MMM.

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,510
What the fuck? Can't get done.
Pugs not breathe or something.

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,980
I know they have the motion face,

33
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,100
but like I always hear bulldogs have
the worst time trying to breathe,

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,940
but like pugs have the most
look of panic on their face.

35
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,890
Like when bulldogs can't breathe,
they just say hi,

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,100
ask gonna to fucking lay down here.
They just seem like a tub of shit dog.

37
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,690
We're like pugs,

38
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,880
like genuinely seemed concerned about
something the way their eyes bug out or do

39
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:06,530
they have like that high metabolism,

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,980
you know when you have something wrong
with your thyroid, is that the right word?

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,480
Huh? Do I have any doctors
that listen to this? Anyways,

42
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:19,400
it made waffles yesterday and the lovely
Nia is killing it and now she's working

43
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:20,690
out. She's on this. Um,

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,040
I'm going to be a fucking
even hotter chick diet. Right?

45
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,900
So she can't eat anything. All right.
In the end, you know the ladies, okay,

46
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,470
they got all that fucking hormonal shit
going on every goddamn month, you know,

47
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:38,180
stuff fucking, I dunno what,
there's always something
going on with them. You know,

48
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,720
they're basically, it's like living with
an addict when you live with the woman,

49
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,150
you know, they always got, he's
got some shit coming up, man.

50
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:48,020
They always that same bullshit.
So now you compound it with the fact,

51
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,650
now she's on some special diet.

52
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:54,080
So she's basically detoxing from whatever
fucking, you know how people eat,

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,410
you know, eat right. Do you get the
sugar, salt rush? The ETU totally stuffed.

54
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,160
You

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,870
mentally think that's what eating is.

56
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:05,350
So then when you actually eat the way
you supposed to and your body isn't like

57
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,940
freaking out, like
fucking Freightos, right.

58
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,860
It's actually just chillin with some
fucking broccoli and some protein.

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,910
You're not used to that. You know you're
used to go into some high energy shit.

60
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:23,290
So anyways, I'm sitting there making
the waffles right. And you don't,

61
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,390
one of those deals when you
check goes on a fucking diet.

62
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,480
All of a sudden you have to
be on the Diet too. You know?

63
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,170
Are you just doing this to torture me?
No,

64
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm doing it cause I liked fucking
waffles. I felt like having some waffles.

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,250
Oh my God, I have to sit here. I have
to eat one time soup for breakfast.

66
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,410
Hey my fault.

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,970
You know I'm not on a diet and then they
do all that shit when they always try

68
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:58,050
to make it seem, it's easier to be a guy.
Guys can lose weight though. It's easier.

69
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,170
It's so much harder for women that Baba
Baba buy we you fucking outlive us.

70
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,393
Isn't that enough?

71
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,680
Isn't that enough? I'm going
to die before you do. Okay.

72
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,990
What is your problem with the soup?

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,790
Jesus fucking Christ Jesus Christ.

74
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,630
So anyways,
that's what I'm fucking dealing with.

75
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,060
And I actually had a major victory,

76
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,480
just one of those silent victories that
you have in your relationship. You know,

77
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,590
those are the best ones to have.

78
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,980
We don't say anything and you see it in
their face and you see that they realize

79
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,770
it and then you see them wondering if
you realize it and you kind of look back

80
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:36,940
and I'm like,
I do realize it,

81
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:40,360
but I'm not going to say it because then
you'll be able to, if I say it out loud,

82
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,330
just somehow fucking do some sort of two
point reversal and bring up some other

83
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,640
shit and then I'll lose,
you know,

84
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,570
I'll just fucking shoot that look right
back at you. Like that's right. Woman.

85
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,300
I won this one.
Okay.

86
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,370
You're gonna have to wait for
another fight because this one is,

87
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,090
oh,
okay.

88
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,320
It's fucking Michael Corleone
says, and the Godfather to, okay.

89
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,723
MMM,

90
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,970
I got a, I got to steal that at some
point. I want to be an argument with Nia.

91
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,610
I can't be a real long
cause she'll get mad.

92
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,350
I'm just going to do it
over something stupid.

93
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,700
Like she wants to go see this
cabin in the woods fucking movie.

94
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:21,360
Whatever the hell it is. It's
supposed to be a perfect movie. Uh,

95
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,100
what does that mean? The guy gives into
the woman? Oh Jesus. A minor fucking mood.

96
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,330
Can I blame it on the Syrup here?
People who was the Syrup out in Jersey?

97
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,060
I can't say out in Jersey.
That's Anthony's impression of him.

98
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,160
I owe him fucking 50 cents
right there. Some residuals. Um,

99
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,050
hey Anthony. Cool. Mia.

100
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,730
Everybody from the opiate Anthony
Program with little Jimmy Norton, um,

101
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,760
on Xm satellite radio. Yeah, little promo.

102
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,740
The fuck was I just talking about?
God dammit. Leave it on the syrup.

103
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,560
Ah, Shit. That thought's gone. Oh, I know.

104
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,690
I had this minor victory at
this minor of victory. Right?

105
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,690
I'm on the road hauling the root again,
right.

106
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,180
Doing my Dick Jokes on the road again.

107
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,480
I don't give a fuck
about you or your friend.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,900
Buy My DVD and get the
fuck out of my face. Um,

109
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,680
I should have fucking waffles. You
know what, this little podcast,

110
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,370
it's going to die. And like fucking 12
minutes in, I'm just going to sugar crash.

111
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,030
We're going to be laying on the rug like
that fucking dude and train spotting,

112
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:29,180
but instead of like falling into it,
I'm just going to nod off like a fucking,

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,580
like a goddamn dog with a machined face.
Oh, we brought it around. What's the do?

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,170
Um, so anyways, yeah, it
was the victory I had. Um,

115
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,450
so I was on the road doing my jokes.
I come back to town. All right.

116
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,100
And uh, and is always,
somehow when I was away,

117
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,930
something got broken and nobody knows
as any fucking idea. It's like my car,

118
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,340
I don't know what happens when I take it
out. Nobody ever really hits it. Somehow.

119
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,870
When Nia takes it out,

120
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:04,460
somebody always hits it and then
I go out and she doesn't say shit.

121
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,560
I go out to use the car and I see some
side swiped down the fucking side of the

122
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,370
car and I just go, I come in,
I go, has somebody hit the car?

123
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,390
And that she's always like,

124
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,200
well,
when did that help?

125
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
How many times can I fall for that?

126
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,550
Do people just not like
you when you drive the car?

127
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,390
That 1:00 AM I talking about
somebody tagged it? Fuck,

128
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:32,391
a month ago when I went over Chris
Porter's somebody fucking tag my car.

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,810
Um, but anyway, so I come back and once
again something's broken. I'm the blender.

130
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,860
The blender was busted,
you know, the engine work,

131
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,440
but the little fucking teeth, things
were broken. So she's just like,

132
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,940
we needed a new blender.

133
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,070
I can't make my skinny girl Margarita
is anymore because the teeth don't work,

134
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,070
so let's throw it, but the fucking
motor works. So I go, well,

135
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:58,630
why don't we just get a fixed? And she's
like, oh, cause she knows what that means.

136
00:07:58,631 --> 00:07:59,500
Why don't we get it fixed?

137
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,170
That means it's going to sit there for
three years before I finally bring it

138
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:07,030
over to a repair shop. All
right, but not, not now.

139
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,230
Not all new fix it Billy.
I said you know what?

140
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:14,890
I'm going to figure out how to fucking
fix that God damn thing. All I did.

141
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,300
You know what?
It was all like I just want it.

142
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,530
All you have to do is just look
up to the fucking, you get the,

143
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,220
I know this is basic to some people but
for a lot of morons and there's a lot

144
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:28,330
that listened to this podcast by
the way. No offense, non taken.

145
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,980
Um, all you do is just whatever the
brand and then the serial number.

146
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:35,140
You go on the Internet and you can,
you just buy the part.

147
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,750
So I buy the fucking part thinks shows up.

148
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:41,980
I do all this shit without talking
to Nia. Right? And I fucking,

149
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,990
I go to take this thing apart, turn it
upside down and I'm fucking pulling,

150
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,750
trying to pull the motor on it and we'll
come out because that thing on the top

151
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:50,710
and I'm like what the fuck?

152
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,340
And then he's going youtube and
I found a video of a guy doing,

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,100
fixing the problem I had.

154
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,260
I didn't need to unscrew the bottom.
All I need to do was just

155
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,110
fucking get a screwdriver and
take the thing off the top.

156
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,950
Which how it doesn't strip the top. I
have no fucking idea. We don't care. Bill.

157
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,890
Get to the point. All right. Long Story
Short, I get this fucking thing on.

158
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,140
It works. So what do I do? Do I get
in her face and say, yeah, a woman,

159
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,180
I fucking fix that shit.
I don't.

160
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:17,830
Yeah,

161
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,650
I don't. I fix it. Make sure it runs.

162
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,170
I try it out and then I just stick
it in the cupboard, you know?

163
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,210
And a couple of days later I go, hey, you
know what to think I'd like a milkshake.

164
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,890
Well, how are you going to do this? The
planner, does it work? Oh, I fixed it.

165
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,310
You fixed it. I fixed it. It
was no big deal. Took it apart.

166
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,240
I got a a fucking fix to myself. There
you go, woman. All right with your whole,

167
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,430
we need to fucking go buy another one.
You know,

168
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:51,150
I realize that wasn't really a major
victory even though like when you're just

169
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,420
in your head, do you like,
yeah, I fucking dominated.

170
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,990
Then I just said that out loud. That was
really no big deal. It's a seven. Does,

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,490
how much I wanted to fix it.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,320
It was a $7 part and I had it
overnighted for like fucking 16 bucks.

173
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,930
So you know,
and I didn't even want a milkshake.

174
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,860
I just wanted to show her that I did
something. I don't know why. Why?

175
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,090
Because I'm a weak person and I
need other people's approval there.

176
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,840
Does that make you happy?
Does that make you feel,

177
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:19,360
does that make you smile
and you're fucking cubicle?

178
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,450
Uh Huh.
Is that what you're doing

179
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,050
when you were in a cubicle and you're
smiling? I've, if I was your boss,

180
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,750
I would immediately think that you're
somehow stealing from the company because

181
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:30,990
there's no reason to smile on it.

182
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,180
Pure in a cubicle, in a
computer, in a cubicle.

183
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,760
There's no fucking reason.
All right.

184
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,740
Unless you somehow figured out a way
to be happy, you know, some sort of,

185
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:47,620
when those Zen Douche bags, why they
douche though? Because they're happy.

186
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,480
You know what happened to you? All right.
What the fuck am I going to talk about?

187
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,120
I was going to do, oh, I know.
We have to talk about everybody.

188
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,090
This is very special.
Guess what it is this Sunday?

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,710
Mother's Day. Mother's Day. Your mom.

190
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,630
Okay.

191
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,010
Okay.

192
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,830
The one that that,
uh,

193
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,050
did most of the heavy lifting is
far as bringing you into the world.

194
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,740
Your Dad was like the Steve Jobs. You
know, you're gay. I want this to happen.

195
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,080
Get on. It's scientists. Right? So
he had a part in it too, you know,

196
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,100
although they never bring that up on the
view. Do they? Um, believe it or not,

197
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,210
this is advertising. All right, let's get
on with this. A pro flowers, everybody.

198
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,240
Mother's Day. It's coming up. All
right? It's Monday. It's Sunday.

199
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,910
You know what that means?
It means it's only six days away.

200
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,250
So what does that mean?
That means you go down to the drugstore.

201
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,320
All the good cards are gone.
At this point,

202
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:42,200
they're all picked over all the
envelopes of laying on the ground.

203
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,770
And the only cards that are left are
either they either just, you know,

204
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,640
it's like a fart joke or they like
oddly incest, you, us, you know,

205
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,920
there's no good cards left once
again, you're screwed up. All right,

206
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,840
so what do you got to deal the ladies?
They liked the flowers. All right,

207
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,880
so here's the copy. Uh, guys,
don't mess up on Mother's Day.

If you will like me. You probably put
it through the wringer as a kid. Dui.

209
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,353

her flowers from Plouffe. Pro Flowers.

211
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:21,910
It's a great way of making up to mom is
by sending her flowers from pro flowers.

212
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:25,600
Everybody, come on, man. You got to do
it. You got to do it. I'm going to do it.

213

Don't you want to be like me?
This is the deal.

214
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:34,300
You get a dozen rainbow roses from mom
plus a free glass vase for only 1,999

215
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:39,080

to last seven days. All right, bing,

216
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:40,060
Bang, boom. This is,

flowers is you get to handle this.

218
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,260
You get to feel like what it's like to
be a rich guy. You know what I mean?

219
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,621
You know,

220
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:50,560
rich people are always working on their
business and they don't have time.

221
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,170
They don't have time to
go out and buy gifts.

222
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,070
So they just sent some assisted out.
Whose birthday is it? Ag Dead, dead.

223
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,890
Go get him a Maserati.

224
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,570
You can do the same thing for
a much cheaper price for 1999.

225
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,120
You can handle the your mom like a
rich guy running a business. What's it?

226
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,220
My mother, she brought me into
the world. You go out there.

227

people@proflowers.com I
challenge you to find a better

253
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,830
read. Um, all right,

254
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,720
moving on here a little bit on what
the hell am I going to talk about? Oh,

255
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,730
you know, I went, I went
into a bar last night. Oh,

256
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:56,840
yesterday afternoon because the
games come on early because um,

257
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,720
I finally accepted the fact emotionally
that my Boston Bruins have been knocked

258
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:06,180
out of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
And uh,

259
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,770
okay.

260
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,960
I've actually, you guys know my hatred of
NBA basketball. You know, I don't hate,

261
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,430
I don't hate it.
I just had finals three minutes.

262
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,860
It drives me nuts with all the time outs.
And I know I brought it up before any,

263
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,540
what's even worse is when
they call the time outs.

264
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,390
I notice yesterday cause I watched a
game is then they start reading copy.

265
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,093
You know,

266
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,560
like anything they can do to just bring
the drama all the way back down to zero.

267
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,270
It's like tide fucking
98 98. Oh, they got,

268
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,900
they got 28 files to give and then they
followed so and sell calls a time out.

269
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,390
And then next thing you know, they're
sitting there reading, you know,

270
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,660
like what I just did
bro. flowers.com. Yes.

271
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,790
Your mother is some fucking, you know,
that's stupid. I don't know. So anyways,

272
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,390
I've accepted the fact that the Bruins
are out of the playoffs and all right,

273
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,830
well the bees are out. Yo, why don't
we go watch the fucking sees kid.

274
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,600
You know what I'm saying?

275
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,150
So Celtics were playing the Atlanta Hawks
who used to be the Saint Louis Hawks

276
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:10,440
and we beat them in 1958 I believe
for their NBA title. That's right.

277
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:14,460
Saint Louis. We own your ass in a sport
you don't even know about anymore.

278
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,080
Um, back when Eisenhower
was an office. Um,

279
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:22,620
so I watched that game and it was just a
phenomenal playoff games as far as like

280
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:27,621
being a fan because it was
over before it even started,

281
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,210
you know,
it was over and there was never a concern.

282
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:37,840
They were up by 30 points and I sat
there drinking beer and eating wings,

283
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,250
becoming fucking, oh, fat boy,
Billy again, Billy fat again.

284
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,173
It's my Irish neighbor.

285
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,500
So I'm, so I'm sitting there
right with a buddy of mine,

286
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,790
right watching the game.
We're having a great time and right.

287
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,630
And like the fourth quarter,
uh, these four girls,

288
00:16:55,631 --> 00:17:00,510
four or five girls come in and it's a
dive bar. You know, I like to dive bars.

289
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,040
You can get as a place to sit,
you know,

290
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,630
it's just one of those deals.

291
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:10,520
Somebody has one of those fucking
[inaudible] character in 48 hours.

292
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,980
You know, they always, there's always
one of those cars parked out front,

293
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:17,180
some fucking piece of shit. Rag Top with
some sad dog in the backseat. Right?

294
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,800
I like those bars. You know the bar
fly car, right? So I walk in there,

295
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,090
we're watching the game and like
fucking with like a, I dunno,

296
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,260
five minutes to go in the game.
So what's that like two hours NBA time?

297
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,370
These like five,
six chicks come in and they're just like,

298
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,030
they just train wrecks all of them
wearing pants where you can just see that

299
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:40,600
clams,
you know,

300
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,300
ridiculously tight pants and other
girls got these cutoffs with this,

301
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,390
her hat turns sideways looking like she's
in some fucking fresh prince video in

302
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,630
the late eighties.
It just,

303
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,660
they were just absolute messes and they
start putting money into the juke box

304
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,440
and they just start singing.
They started to sing along to a video,

305
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:06,420
killed the radio star. Right. And
then they just start, you know,

306
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:11,010
and then there's all these fucking old
guys Barfly fucking Jack Offs like my age

307
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,730
and a little bit older, like way too
fucking old for these checks. Right.

308
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,730
And these girls are being
like really fucking loud. Yes.

309
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,050
And they're fucking dancing with each
other and they're grabbing each other's

310
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:26,850
asses, doing all this shit. And you
see these guys up at the bar, the liar,

311
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,270
they start like

312
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,740
reacting to this sex fucking energy
depth they're putting out there.

313
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:36,260
So two of the girls stand up. They
started, that's what it got dude.

314
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:40,790
It was like the fucking accused,
like times five was going down.

315
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,580
The whole vibe was fucking ridiculous.
So the two girls stand up,

316
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,610
they start like dancing,
grinding up against each other,

317
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,790
and then one of the guys eventually like
some big fucking sex star bear starts

318
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:56,480
walking over and starts pawn at the
girl. And then the girl's like, hey,

319
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,360
knock it off. Get the
fuck Outta here. Right.

320
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,630
And my buddy classic looks at me and goes,

321
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,950
she facilitated that entire fucking
thing. And it's like, exactly.

322
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,100
Fuck. It was a, I don't
know if there was strippers,

323
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,760
I don't know what the fucking deal was,
but um,

324
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,970
it was just one of

325
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,050
the thing that I've always said,

326
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:20,980
we got to have responsibility
for your own fucking safety.

327
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,820
Obviously that guys shouldn't just feel
that he should be able to walk over and

328
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,100
start pawn at some girl.
But you know,

329
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:30,850
when you sit in there with your clam
fucking outlined on the front of your

330
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:33,310
fucking jeans and you're grinding up

331
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,620
against her, your friend and your polling
or jacket off and she's going, stop it,

332
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:40,560
stop it, and you keep
pulling it off. I mean,

333
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:44,670
what the fuck do you think's
going to happen? You know,

334
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,611
I fuck.
You know,

335
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:51,840
there's nothing worse than when people
act like the world is a perfect place.

336
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,680
And then they act shocked when
something bad happens. It isn't. Okay.

337
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:58,830
There's the way you wish the
world was and the way it is,

338
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,420
so fucking act accordingly.

339
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,130
You don't go in there with your fucking
hoo ha hanging out and start grinding up

340
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:10,131
on your friend in front of fucking five
drunk guys who were women haven't done a

341
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:14,980
double take at since the fucking,
I dunno,

342
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,970
Fernando Valance, weightless
struck out the side. Okay,

343
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,010
sign the wrong people. It was just, it
was a really fucking uncomfortable vibe.

344
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:26,880
And I looked at my phone, I go, look, we
don't get out of here in three minutes.

345
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,440
We're going to be testifying in about
fucking six weeks for whatever bullshits

346
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:32,550
about ready to go down.

347
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,620
And you know what kills me is no one at
the bar stop them from doing what they

348
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,990
were doing.
You know,

349
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:43,770
I was trying to think what the fuck and
male version of what they were doing

350
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,521
would be.

351
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:49,000
I guess it would be like acting aggressive
and almost causing like a fight vibe.

352
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,290
All right. But you know, then you
get tossed out. But women could,

353
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:58,040
can create the accused vibe and uh,
I dunno,

354
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm probably going to get shit
for this, but like, you know,

355
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,910
I'm not advocating what that guy did
that what Jack Guy Did was fucking wrong,

356
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:08,380
but Jesus fucking Christ.
What did your dad do?

357
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:12,670
Did He vote by like Fisher price? How
to be a whore? Did they make like a,

358
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,880
remember those little fucking stereos
they made? Did they make like a fucking

359
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,590
okay.

360
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,950
The whore version of that? I
Dunno, I'm at that age. People,

361
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm at that age where I look at women
like that and I don't go like, well,

362
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:28,180
there's an easy mark. I now look at
them, go and like God, Jesus Christ.

363
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,680
What a fuck was your dad?
What didn't he do? Um,

364
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,200
but anyways,

365
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,050
what was actually funny was for some,

366
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,160
this is how drunk they were as they
were grinding on each other and fucking

367
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:42,470
pulling up each other's dresses
and doing all this shit.

368
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:44,120
The fucking for whatever reason,

369
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,680
uh,

370
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,060
out of nowhere they just started
singing the star spangled banner

371
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,860
and then the guys at the bar
joined in and I have video of it.

372
00:21:57,861 --> 00:22:00,620
I'm going to send it to my guy and
hopefully we'll get it up on the site.

373
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:04,550
I got it like halfway through
they sang the whole fucking song.

374
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:08,510
And what was funny was that whole
fucking is somebody going to get raped,

375
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:12,920
vibe went out the window,
both sides for like a good three minutes.

376
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:17,921
We're in harmony with some sort of support
the troops vibe just out of fucking

377
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:21,230
nowhere. And I, this is the
funniest thing about it.

378
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:24,170
This was probably like
seven in the evening.

379
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,060
This is how fucking wasted everybody was.

380
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,450
Um, all right, plowing ahead here. Um, oh,

381
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,890
whatever women,
what do you think about that?

382
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:36,730
Am I being the fucking caveman there?
I'm not advocating that.

383
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm saying that those guys, what they
did was right, but like you can't

384
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,510
I that's like, it's like me,
like I've always said this.

385
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:46,750
That's like me walking through central
park at like three in the morning dress

386
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,970
like Liberace singing.
I'm in the money.

387
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,550
Oh Man.
The money at that photo.

388
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,420
Fucking cash in my back pocket.
Right?

389
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,360
Someone comes up, smashes me over
the head. I get a concussion.

390
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:05,010
I got fucking my cheekbones fucked up.
You know,

391
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,150
they take my wallet and all
that Shit. Does it wrong? Yes.

392
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:11,910
Do you feel bad from a yes,
but what the fuck was I thinking?

393
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,660
Yeah.

394
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,140
You know,

395
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,740
why don't you just fucking give yourself
a bunch of paper cuts and junk jumping

396
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,190
shark infested water and then fucking
go and then it bit my leg off.

397
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,840
You're an asshole. That's bad.
That's, that's my side of it.

398
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,300
Relationship Advice. Follow up.
Success Story. Dare is Derris billion.

399
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,130
You may or may not remember a couple
months ago I emailed you about some

400
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:40,280
relationship advice.
To recap, 22 years old,

401
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,150
been with my girlfriend for seven
years. Most of it long, distant,

402
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120
smallest things that
happened from time to time,

403
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,620
which made me doubt I could trust her.

404
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,360
I gave the example of the Strip poker
thing she lied about and the business trip

405
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,270
where she said a coworker
tried to kiss her. Oh yeah.

406
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,470
I gotta be honest with you dude. I
get a lot of emails like that. So, uh,

407
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,930
and I, I've been that guy. I was
that guy when I was 23. Um, anyways,

408
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,770
he goes, you sent me a very
clear message, pull the rip cord.

409
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,860
I'm just writing to let you know that I
did take your advice and although it was

410
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:16,280
probably the hardest thing I've ever
had to do was 100% the right call.

411
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,590
So thank you for giving me
the extra nudge I needed.

412
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,760
Hopefully in the future I can be a fucking
man about these things and you just

413
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:27,500
do what needs to be done. Um, through
most of the relationship fall out.

414
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:31,100
Now I did have to tell her to get
fucked when she kept wanting to get back

415
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:31,934
together.

416
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,140
She didn't seem to understand that all
of the reason we broke up would still be

417
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,800
their bottom line. I'm happier than I've
been in a long time. Thanks man. Oh yeah.

418
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,310
Well there you go.
And that's the hardest thing too,

419
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,020
is when they're coming back to you because
as you're thinking is your brain up

420
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:52,280
top is going. This is
wrong. You're out. Stay out.

421
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,640
Your Dick is going Free
Pussy, dad, Jeffrey

422
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,000
all wants to fray policy. All
right, that's what you dick saying.

423
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,240
So you have to override that. And
uh, I got to be honest with you,

424
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:10,130
the only reason why she was getting back
with you was just to get with you till

425
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:14,080
she was mentally prepared to walk away
from you so she could pull the ripcord

426
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:19,010
and uh, that's the worst. So you avoided
all of that. So now this is what you do,

427
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,930
son.
Um,

428
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,530
go out and have a good time and don't
get involved with anybody that you don't

429
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:31,460
feel you're going to marry. All right?
Is this the mother of my kids? All right.

430
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,640
Go Fuck Yourself. And that's how you
do it until you meet the one that is.

431
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,320
And then that's the one that's
the one you gave your heart to.

432
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,570
But other than that, fuck all
of them. Fuck them. All right?

433
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,320
I don't mean that misogynistic
way, but just, you know,
when you fucking, you know,

434
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:48,650
two, three dates in and the day, it
doesn't feel fucking weird. You know,

435
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,010
it's this start, it doesn't feel
right. I mean it's still feeling weird,

436
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,520
you know,
at that point,

437
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:59,210
all she has at your place is maybe a
scrunchie or some sort of fucking a

438
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,200
toiletry. The just getting this out, dawn,

439
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,060
you go beat it and you don't have to
be mean. You just be honest. Just say,

440
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:10,310
listen, I, I really like
you. You're a nice person.

441
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,370
I just don't see this a longterm.

442
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,690
So rather than waste your time and my
time and then I suppose getting really

443
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:20,330
hurt,
we'll just just leave right now.

444
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,460
I believe this

445
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,293
does yours.

446
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,200
Um, all right, good for you sir. Good for
you. All right, here we go. Pissed off.

447
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:38,730
Bay Area Fan. Who Mice,
who's also might be cops.

448
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,980
What? All right, thanks for
canceling the Sunday show. San Jose.

449
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,500
You Ginger. Fuck. Oh yeah, I'm doing San
Jose coming up and I had to, I couldn't,

450
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,600
I can't do the Sunday show.
I had to cancel that one.

451
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,290
So evidently this guy says at least 10
of us bought tickets to the show and as a

452
00:26:55,291 --> 00:27:00,190
boozy and had a boozy work night
night out, planned around it, uh,

453
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,240
to say we were looking forward
to it would be an understatement.

454
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:07,350
We are not some random group of
amateurs either. We are dedicated fans,

455
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,120
faithful podcasts,
listeners,

456
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,560
we came out to see you last time you were
in San Jose and we even stood in line

457
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:15,900
to meet you, uh, by,

458
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,940
by the DVDs and buy the DVDs.
Man. Some of us were even women.

459
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,920
And not only that, we actually,
we've actually been polarized,

460
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,660
polarizing on behalf on your
behalf and one you several,

461
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,680
several new fans who also bought
tickets to the Sunday show.

462
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,120
One guy's bitch wife only allows him out
one night per year and this was going

463
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:42,210
to be his 2012 hour in Jesus
Christ. Dude, you're killing me.

464
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,510
We've told him you're a standup guy.

465
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,280
How do we tell him you've thrown us
over and are scurrying out to Chicago to

466
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:55,110
suck up to Vince Vaughn.
Douche. Move Mr Burr. Douche.

467
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,050
Move.
Hey,

468
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,600
what about the other two nights?
I'm going there. First of all,

469
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,340
stop acting like San Jose.
It's like some blue chip fucking city.

470
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,170
All right. San Jose only can
look down to Bakersfield.

471
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:15,200
You look in eye to eye at Sacramento.
All right?

472
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,580
You're both the chicks with the
good personalities. All right?

473
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:23,930
But we all know the Hottie
is San Francisco. Okay,

474
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,120
listen, I apologize. It's
something I have to do. Um,

475
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,030
it, it'll make sense in a few months.
It'll make sense in a couple of months.

476
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:38,690
Why had do what the fuck I'm doing?
I don't talk about the shit that I,

477
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:43,100
that I'm doing because most of it get,
doesn't get picked up.

478
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:48,230
It gets swatted back down to the ground.
So why fucking bring up, oh, hey,

479
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:49,490
I just did this.

480
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,110
And allegedly it has the opportunity
to do that and then nothing happens.

481
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,330
And then it's bad enough.
It doesn't happen.

482
00:28:56,331 --> 00:29:00,950
Then you have to deal with people going,
hey, whatever happened to that thing. Oh,

483
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:03,050
if it failed, it crashed. Didn't

484
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,610
burn. So, uh, I, yeah,

485
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:10,280
I have to go to Chicago. It's a
fucking loyalty thing. All right.

486
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,670
You think I wouldn't like to spend
another fucking night in San Jose?

487
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:18,560
I love San Jose. I don't like this shy.
I don't like you. You're a hockey team.

488
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,650
I respect your fans though. You've
got great fans up there, so I'm sorry.

489
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,840
I'm sorry. Julie, Jim, Dave, Mikey,
Joey, Joey's girlfriend, Rico, Bill,

490
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,010
and several others. All
right, you fucking babies.

491
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,540
Um, and he goes, no, we can't. Oh,
let ps, no, we can't just come Friday,

492
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,460
Saturday shows instead because we work.

493
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:41,240
Those nights were in a local
law enforcement. Oh Shit.
They have guns. Um, yeah,

494
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,040
my fault. I'll make it up to you and
I'll see at the policeman's ball. Um,

495
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,410
there's no way we can get the night
off Saturday, Sunday night. Was it man?

496
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,600
All right. All Right Joe, over what
you think? I'm not coming back.

497
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,210
Shit. You know what? You're good.
You got me with the guilt. You did.

498
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,680
You got me with the guilt. Hey, how
about those La Kings? Everybody's.

499
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:06,750
Anybody else watching
of the fucking playoffs?

500
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,280
The La Kings for the first time since
the Gretzky era. And as far as I know,

501
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:13,860
I didn't look this up. I think only
the second time when their history,

502
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:15,660
they've made it to the
western conference finals,

503
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,540
at least as far as when
I've been paying attention.

504
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,980
I don't ever remember him there.

505
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:23,130
Back when they had those yellow
and purple Laker jerseys on.

506
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,393
Um,

507
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,430
okay.

508
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,370
I Dunno. And the country
devil's keep beating the flyers.

509
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,380
I thought the flyers. I'm not saying
it's over. God knows it's not over.

510
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:40,210
When it's a fucking flight. It came
back down. Oh three against my Bruins.

511
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:45,160
Um, but the devils are
just so fucking country,

512
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,640
you know what I mean?
And I mean that with all due respect,

513
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,250
I hate it when they played the
trap and all that type of shit. But

514
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,010
sons of bitches, man, they played very,
they played like dead disciplined hockey,

515
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:02,180
right? Disciplined. Um, I don't know.

516
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,890
All right, let's plow ahead here. What do
we got? What are we get next? All right,

517
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:09,130
Dell. Is it racist, racist,
racist. Machinic addition.

518
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,950
Um, what is this man? Fuck a machinic.

519
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,850
It's a Murdoch owned paper.
Enough said.

520
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,050
What is machinic?
What the fuck?

521
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,610
What is this throwback? Is
it racist? Machinic edition?

522
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,810
I have no idea what this means.

523
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,610
It says as long as the nets are allowing
Jz to call their marketing shots.

524
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,310
What a shock that he chose black and
white as the new team colors to stress as

525
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:44,070
the nets explained their new urban home.

526
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,570
Why not have him apply
the full Jz treatment?

527
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,180
Why the Brooklyn Nets when they,

528
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,950
they can be the New York words.
What the fuck is this?

529
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,410
The cheerleaders should be the Brooklyn

530
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,380
bitches or hoes team logo.
A nine millimeter.

531
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,430
What the fuck is this?

532
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,420
Okay.

533
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,270
Oh, oh, oh, this is Phil mushed. Nick.
Oh, filled, mushed. Nick wrote this.

534
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,890
Oh, okay. Phil Mutchnik is this guy
who's just, he's never in a good mood.

535
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,120
He could be getting a two on one on a
sunny day in the middle of winter and he

536
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,250
would still find a reason
to complain about stuff.

537
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:28,550
And that's funny coming from me because
I'm one of the biggest concern over was

538
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,020
all right,
Phil Mutchnik.

539
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,760
This is what he wrote about Jay z
owning the nets in um, Brooklyn. Okay,

540
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:35,660
now I get it.
He says,

541
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:38,810
as long as the nets are along Jay
z to call their marketing shots.

542
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,400
Well why shouldn't they? It's America.
He had the money, but the team, uh,

543
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:48,401
what a shock that he chose black and
white as the new team logos to stress as

544
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,680
the nets explain their new urban home.

545
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,330
Okay.

546
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,120
Why not have them apply the
full Jz treat treatment?

547
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,840
Why the Brooklyn Nets when
they could be the New York,

548
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,270
New York and words that Shelia is,

549
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,120
could be the Brooklyn
bitches or hoes team logo.

550
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:08,810
A nine millimeter with hollow
tip shell casings strewn beneath.

551
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,760
Want to be JC hip than go
all the way. Ah, Jesus.

552
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,230
That's just stupid. Well, isn't black
and white? Isn't that inclusive?

553
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,060
Okay.

554
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,640
Like there's only black and white
people in Brooklyn, but I'm just saying,

555
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:27,620
you know why st nine millimeters is a
whole Hasidic population. There's the,

556
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:31,610
uh, growing up Gadi Oh,
population out there.

557
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,400
Okay.

558
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,750
Brooklyn is a,

559
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:36,810
okay.

560
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,710
Oh, Phil, I think he is, he just,
anyways, he says, Bill, is this racist?

561
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,030
There's this Asian girl that I work with
who has a bit of an eye condition that

562
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:46,470
is slowly, oh, this is
a whole different thing.

563
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,423
Ah,

564
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,350
I love this guy was tying that in. I'm
sorry, I'm just a fucking idiot right now.

565
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,340
I told you the Syrup it's was wearing off
the sugar rush or whatever his fucking

566
00:33:58,341 --> 00:33:59,174
wearing down here.

567
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,453
MMM.

568
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,930
Yeah. Why did he do that? Is
he trying to be the next, uh,

569
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,310
who's that guy with the cowboy
hat? Yeah. Wow. That guy.

570
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,330
Um,
he's mad that their,

571
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:17,990
that their colors are black and white.
What is wrong with black and white?

572
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,790
It's not like the nets
had a classic uniform.

573
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,130
I thought then they're uniform
was hideous. They had that,

574
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,820
that gray with the red
and the White was awful.

575
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,620
I think it's cool that there's a team
in Brooklyn. Oh, Phil Mush. Nick,

576
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,790
why don't you go get yourself a Sunday?
You have miserable bastard. All right.

577
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,610
Coming from me. All right, Bill,
is this racist, racist, racist? Uh,

578
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,610
there's this Asian girl that I work with
who was a bit of an eye condition that

579
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,200
is slightly but definitely noticeable.
She's not cross out. She's not cross side,

580
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,970
but something is definitely a skew.
You can tell she's looking at you,

581
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:58,540
but one I kind of drifts off into
no man's land. Yeah. Lazy Eye.

582
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,340
Now normally Google, Google the eyes
would be a pretty big turnoff. Right.

583
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,550
But she almost seems more
are learning because of it.

584
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,720
This had me wondering if Asian women
can pull off this look better than other

585
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:13,110
nationalities.
Uh,

586
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,270
a mainstream example of
this would be Lucy Lu.

587
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,870
She had set an eye thing going on.
I'll be it a slight thing,

588
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,660
but she's revered as a hottie.

589
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,710
Compare that to a Caucasian
Bobby. Bobby Bet. Sia,

590
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,520
the CNN anchor that Nancy
Walls did an impression of,

591
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,760
or African Americans.
Stuart Scott.

592
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,020
Okay.

593
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,100
A lesser example.
He's a male.

594
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:43,750
Is it racist of me to believe Asian may
have the edge when it comes to public

595
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:46,680
overlooking their lazy eyes?
If so,

596
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,170
do you think it's due to their eyes
being almost that's detracting from the

597
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:53,004
wonkiness?

598
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,190
Ah, Jesus. Dude, I think you
just think this girl is hot.

599
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,580
You know, when you'd rather
bang her then Stuart Scott,

600
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,820
I think it's really that simple.
Um,

601
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,420
I don't know who know who
half those other people are.

602
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:11,100
I don't watch CNN or
Fox News. I find it, uh,

603
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,673
I don't know.

604
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,430
I just find both those, they're totally
slanted and opera sit direction.

605
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:18,530
So I never watched that shit.

606
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:22,700
And that Stuart Scott is
battling a for his life.

607
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,080
I believe so. Uh, I dunno dude.
I think you just want to fucking,

608
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,300
I think he just, I just think
you want to bang this girl. Um,

609
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,520
I think that's why you've,

610
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:38,240
I think you like Asian chicks regardless
of whether their eyes are looking at

611
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:41,900
you are not looking at you. You, you like
them. So, you know, when I say sir, I say,

612
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,970
go for it.
You know,

613
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,620
go get yourself a beautiful girl.
You know,

614
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:51,280
it's great she can buy them because we
will do what I was gonna do an easy jokes

615
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:52,140
that I'm not doing it.
All right.

616
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,490
Okay. Here we go. Bill. Uh,

617
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,300
want to bang lesbian friend
who was in lesbian remission.

618
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,570
Okay.

619
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,680
Jesus. Okay, this is outside my realm, but
I'll, I'll try and answer it. Hey Bill,

620
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,750
I want your opinion on this problem.
I have.

621
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:10,860
I'm a 19 year old college freshman and
I'm in a bit of an ethical dilemma.

622
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,030
I have this friend who was a
lesbian and recently she has been,

623
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,210
she hasn't been having
any luck with the ladies.

624
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:18,930
Okay?

625
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,840
So now she's feeling vulnerable
to the point that she's active,

626
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:26,730
actually contemplating about fucking this
guy. She knows after she tells me this,

627
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:30,150
I start getting jealous because I've
always had sexual feelings for her,

628
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,230
but never acted on them because she's
a lesbian and I respected her dude.

629
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:36,060
What kind of a fucking asshole are you?

630
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,640
You know,
why are you hanging out with her?

631
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,530
We were just waiting for daylight. What?
What are you doing? She's a lesbian.

632
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,840
She doesn't want to fuck you.
You

633
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,970
just sitting in an edit yet. It's a
dried up wealth. It's over. Walk away.

634
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,530
What else does it, well, I
guess she's a lesbian. Maybe
she's into some. Uh, I dunno.

635
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,050
Did she fix cars like you?
I have no idea what that,

636
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,270
ah, is there anything worse
than a guy just hovering around?

637
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,730
You know, rather than going out and just
like, I dunno what you're waiting for.

638
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,910
Just plenty of fish in the sea
in 19. Well, but you know what?

639
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:22,860
I'm being too hard on you. You're 19
years old. You have no idea how Cleo,

640
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,350
can you help me out with this
one? Oh, you got to go real quick.

641
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,223
You got to go.

642
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,290
This guy's trying to bang this lesbian
girl who was in lesbian remission.

643
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,940
It means she hasn't, she's wanting to
like hook up with some other ladies,

644
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:41,110
but they're not given it to her.
She'll,

645
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,330
she's actually been contemplating
fucking this other guy.

646
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,810
So now this dude's jealous cause
he's always been hanging around her.

647
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,100
I mean that conversation we had earlier.
That's why guy guys hanging around.

648
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:54,730
Women, either the gay guy or
they're trying to fuck you.

649
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,410
There's really no other discipline. All
right. Why wish you could hang here?

650
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,000
All right, cool. Have Fun. Huh? All right.

651
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,600
That's nice stuff. Your fans thought that
you were coming on and now you're not,

652
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:11,050
you're leaving them wanting more.
You'll, you'll leave them wanting more.

653
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,710
Can we do this real quick? It
has to be very quickly. Okay.

654
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:19,390
So I told you what's going on. Yeah,
I'll get out of here. Um, anyways,

655
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,480
but now that she's in the mood to
go to going back to fucking dudes,

656
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,380
some other Douche is feeling her up.
Even before I knew what was happening.

657
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:28,030
So this other guy got in there.
He goes,

658
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,910
I don't want to make her my book
girlfriend. We both made it very clear.

659
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,450
Neither of us are good at being in
relationships because we're both selfish

660
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:38,230
people. I did not want, however,
I do want to fuck her once,

661
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,260
and I tried asking my cousin for
his point of view on the situation,

662
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:45,730
but he recently found Jesus,
so the only answer is to give.

663
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,140
He gives me his read the Bible
or premarital sex is a sin.

664
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,161
What do you think?

665
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:55,090
Should I sleep with her before she fucks
this guy and realize she doesn't like

666
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:59,740
men and ruin any chance? I
have a wait. Should I try?

667
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,730
Oh, should I try to sleep with her before
this guy fucks her and she realizes she

668
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:07,720
doesn't like men and ruin any chance
I have or should I just go just be the

669
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,400
friend and do nothing.
Thanks.

670
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:14,490
Are there no other women around for you
to fuck that you're just completely is

671
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:17,770
singularly focused on and obsessed
with this girl who's a lesbian?

672
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,860
That's exactly what I said. Why are you
hovering around her? That's what I want.

673
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,500
Is it because you can't have
her or like it's it's a,

674
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,770
it's a chase thing or it's a struggle
that he his leg how what it is.

675
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:30,370
I bet that the same, the same height and
they can borrow each other's clothes.

676
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,563
Just leave it.

677
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,520
I was wondering where you going to wear
that flannel to like cause I feel like

678
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:40,510
getting involved sexually with anyone
who's having like going back and forth

679
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:44,380
with their sexuality and figuring
out is probably not a good idea.

680
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,700
Just cause there's probably a lot of
emotional shit going on along with that

681
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,520
that she may not talk about
and you may not be aware of.

682
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,630
I would just leave it alone.
Yeah.

683
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,180
Why don't you just go talk to a
girl that wants to bang a guy?

684
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,000
Why don't you make it a lot easier?
Make it a lot easier on yourself. Hey,

685
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,280
how do I turn this bus into a bicycle?

686
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,490
I've always wanted this
bus to be a bicycle and a,

687
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:07,430
now it's a men like the chase though,
right?

688
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,600
The you have the layer.
We'd like a layup.

689
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,770
I thought men are all about the chase
and make it difficult and all that.

690
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,420
I thought, oh, that's
what you guys are into.

691
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,430
You guys are ready to
just making it difficult.

692
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:23,440
We want you guys just to fucking
just lie down or recline,

693
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:30,050
stop acting like it doesn't feel
good for you to, you know, no,

694
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:33,010
you know what it is there.
There is as far as like a,

695
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,040
a good feeling is when a woman is making
it difficult and you'd tear through all

696
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:41,150
that bullshit and you're
able to make her a sitcom.

697
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,710
It rolling your eyes in the right. You've
experienced that, haven't you? Well, yeah.

698
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,930
This is the speech that you give before
you tell people like, oh you, you,

699
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:51,140
you are making it difficult.

700
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:54,620
And that dude was cock blocking me
and I fucking I that was that, that,

701
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:55,860
that right there is like a,

702
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,090
remember that year when when Tom
Hanks went back to back Oscars,

703
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,780
he's still a great actor, but you know, is
that ever going to happen again? That's,

704
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,580
that's my, that's my uh, sexual
conquest. The night I brought you down,

705
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:13,050
brought you down like a fucking will.
The base on the Serengeti before.

706
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,830
You didn't have to see what they do. They
just take it away. Cleo, come on. Come on.

707
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,920
All right, well that's my, that's my 2
cents. Okay, so I'm gonna go now. Okay.

708
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,420
All right. I'll see you have fun
right there. Fucking female. Robocop.

709
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,780
I can work it out like a maniac.
I'm over here becoming a tub of shit.

710
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,560
That's right. All right, I'll see
you later. So there you go. Sir.

711
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,350
This is what I think you should
do. And we basically, both of us,

712
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:46,610
you've got to stop hanging out with these
girls that, uh, why are you doing that?

713
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,360
You know,
I know why you're doing it anyway.

714
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,030
They want it because you can be
like, Yo, my dick is so intoxicating.

715
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:00,440
Even chicks a don't like Dick.
Can't say no to my Dick. Oh,

716
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,690
um, all right, let's read
some advertising. Shall We?
People, let's get on with it.

717
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,400
Where the hell is it here?
Oh, Christ. Where are we?

718
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:14,750
Where are we? Okay, here we go. Here we
go. The usual stamps.com. Everybody, uh,

719
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,850
we've done this one before.
This is one. This is,

720
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,120
this is the runaway advertising
hit on the podcast here.

721
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:23,120
Everybody's getting into it. And by the
way, you know, I heard our hit her story.

722
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:27,620
Uh, Nia always listens to NPR.
She always listened to that.

723
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,750
All things considered. Today we're
going to talk about hoe strawberries.

724
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:37,700
You're mead for strawberry doors and
everybody, you enjoyed her. Srovio Jesus,

725
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:42,620
NPR. Good Lord. It's a fucking bore fest,

726
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:47,120
right? Um, she always has it on. So I
fucking sit there and I listened to it,

727
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,380
you know,
and uh,

728
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,370
but they were talking about the post
office and how it's bankrupt and how

729
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:56,480
they're going to be change. They're
going to be closing a bunch of them soon.

730
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,530
And a, at least this is what they were
saying, unless they're super busy,

731
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:04,490
they're going to be closing them.
So why don't you get the jump? Okay.

732
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,690
Get the jump and go to stamps.com and
bring the post office into your home,

733
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,800
your apartment or your cardboard box
in the sidewalk. Wherever you live in,

734
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,880
you can bring the post office
in the your dwelling. All right?

735
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:20,000
They're going to start closing them soon.
You know,

736
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:21,500
you want to be standing outside.

737
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:25,460
They're like that poor son of a bitch who
put all his money in the bank and when

738
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:29,180
a bank fails, he standing out
there with his little, his little,

739
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,750
this little card with the number on it,
but that you said it was in there.

740
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,640
You don't want to be that guy. Get
the job. Post offices are closing.

741
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,320
The Sky is falling. I'm using
fear this week. All right,

742
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:47,910
go to stamps.com everybody. Uh, what
the hell is it called? Copy is attached.

743
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,850
I thought I knew this one by heart.
Christ's sake. I know what it is.

744
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,770

telling you this guy,

758
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,960
this is actually is now a more viable
than ever considering they're actually

759
00:45:41,961 --> 00:45:46,280
closing the post offices,
the offices where they post.

760
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,980
Um, and that's it. Game Fly
gameplay.com is another one.

761
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,810
Do you know what I noticed yesterday
when I was watching the NBA? They out.

762
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,780
They did pro flowers and the did gain
fly.com and I was thinking, you know what,

763
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:02,510
the NBA, they listening to
my podcast of ripping me off.

764
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,610
They have the same
advertises. Um, gamefly uh,

767
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,090

I love game fly.com you get 8,000

778
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,670
Those raids? All right. Um, hey,

779
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,350
remember she wakes up and telling you
guys how I've been trying to get into

780
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,350
learning how shit works and science
and all that because I have such a poor

781
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:04,340
science background.

782
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,870
I have a youtube video of
the week and it basically,

783
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,930
it explains,
um,

784
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,590
how a differential works
on your truck or your car.

785
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,800
And it actually fucking blew my mind.

786
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:22,610
Now the weird thing about this video
is for some reason the first like six

787
00:47:22,611 --> 00:47:23,301
minutes of it,

788
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:28,220
you have to sit through a policemen on
motorcycles doing all these different

789
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,850
formations and these x game tricks,

790
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,530
it's a from like the 1940 so it
has that world war two propaganda,

791
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,490
you know, and uh, you know,

792
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:41,410
they're holding onto each other's arms.

793
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,160
They're standing up riding around this
whole little fucking Hitler youth sort of

794
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:46,450
beginning thing.
It's really weird,

795
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,930
I guess at one point when the going around
and trying to show the principles of

796
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:54,070
a car going around the corner
in the differential, but
it's fucking amazing. Um,

797
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,260
and I know a lot of you guys like bill,
I don't give a fuck.

798
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:58,060
I don't want to learn how to fix my car.
And you know,

799
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:01,360
when I say yes should do the,
Becky had this no way.

800
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:03,250
When you bring your car down
to the dealership and you know,

801
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:05,530
it's something simple but
you just never read up on it,

802
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,920
there's no way you don't feel like a
bitch when you sit in there, you know,

803
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,850
telling you I, you know, I didn't
realize about the differential.

804
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:16,240
I didn't realize that,
uh, it, it also allows,

805
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,810
I know it took all the torque from
the engine and made it go 90 degrees,

806
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:23,320
but I didn't realize
it gave you back tires,

807
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:25,480
the ability to turn independently.

808
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,540
That's what blew my mind because it never
dawned on me that when you go around

809
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:29,290
the corner,

810
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:34,050
the inside tire has to go like wait a way,

811
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,040
shorter distance than the outside tire.

812
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,970
So if they're both turning at the same
time, one of them would be sliding.

813
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,680
I don't know which one. But,
so I guess that makes sense.

814
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:48,970
But for them to figure out a gear as
to how to get those things to turn

815
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:53,450
independently. It's just, it's fucking, it
just, you just got to watch it. All right?

816
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,670
And if you watch it,

817
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:58,000
you're going to be like make and you're
going to get fucking obsessed with it.

818
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:02,080
And you're going to buy the owner's
manual to your fucking car that is about a

819
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,220
thousand pages thick and
you're going to finally like,

820
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,110
I've actually looking at like explosion
drawings of like transmissions and,

821
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:12,430
uh, my whole life I had no idea what
a fucking transmit should look like.

822
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,040
Is this boring the shit out of all of you?
Well,

823
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,880
can I learn something though?

824
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:22,420
I gotta be the sports talking more
on for the rest of my fucking life.

825
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,560
Um, hey, how about those
New York Knicks? Everybody,

826
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,970
they finally want to play
off game. Congratulations
to all New York Knicks fans.

827
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:38,020
Unless you liked the Yankees, then
you can go fuck yourselves. Um,

828
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,880
ended a 13,
a 13 game in a row.

829
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:47,230
Play off game losing streak.
I want to know what do you guys think?

830
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,130
When will that ever get beaten?
That's going to,

831
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,300
that one's going to stand for awhile.

832
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,510
I was actually tried
to do the math on that.

833
00:49:55,511 --> 00:50:00,511
In order to duplicate
that best case scenario,

834
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:05,611
you only get swept two years in a
row or two playoff trips in a row.

835
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,020
Like best case scenario would be you,
uh,

836
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,860
were up three games to none one year,
and then you lost four in a row,

837
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,530
so you didn't get swept
and this four losses,

838
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,050
then you get swept two more
times in a row. That's 12.

839
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:23,350
And then you lose the first game. And the
next one, that's the best case scenario.

840
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,470
The fucking,
Nick's lost

841
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:33,530
some playoff series when van Gundy was
still there. They lost the last two games.

842
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,270
So that was their first two loss.
Then they got swept that six,

843
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,310
they got swept again. That's 10. Then
they lost the first three of this one.

844
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,620
That's 13. I swear to God, if they
lost yesterday, that 14, you would,

845
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,970
they go.
Only way somebody could beat that.

846
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:54,560
You'd have to get swept three times in a
fucking ruts, practically impossible. Um,

847
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,840
and this is what kills me is Paul Versey,
Old Jersey.

848
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:04,490
[inaudible] New Jersey Zone,
the pride of fucking red bank.

849
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,590
He fucking,
we got in this huge fucking debate.

850
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:15,970
He fucking annoys the shit out of me
with his praise of Madison Square Garden.

851
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,910
Like he feels like,
like this venue,

852
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:22,640
like that is the most
overrated fucking venue,

853
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:28,810
I think in professional sports because
it gets so much fucking cloud because

854
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:34,970
it's in New York City,
the Paris of the United States,

855
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,780
and just because it's fucking there
that everybody seems to forget the

856
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:46,130
incredible lack of championships
that have been one there. Okay.

857
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,110
The fucking New York rangers have one,

858
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:53,111
one Stanley Cup since 1940
that's 72 fucking years.

859
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,780
There's been one championship,
one there.

860
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:02,470
The New York Knicks haven't won since
fucking Nixon resigned 40 fucking years.

861
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,150
All right,
and this dude is telling me ego first.

862
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:11,660
He's always talking about how Jordan
said that was his favorite place to play

863
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,300
and he uses,
this is out of the fight started.

864
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,420
He told me that fucking the garden during
game three was the loudest NBA game

865
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:23,540
he's ever heard. And I'm like, really?

866
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:28,250
Do you really think that it was louder
than the Boston Garden or the La Forum

867
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,010
when the Lakers and Celtics
were playing a game?

868
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:33,560
70 you really think it was louder.
Game three,

869
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,380
Nick's verse the heat and
you're down fucking two.

870
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,960
Do you really think the venue was
fucking louder? I mean, what do you base?

871
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:42,920
And he goes, dude, this isn't about
championships. I'm like, it's not,

872
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,840
I'm not saying it's about championships,

873
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,650
but we were playing for championships
so you're going to be even amped up even

874
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:49,340
more.

875
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,340
And he just keeps saying how they use
that stupid fucking expression that that

876
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:58,860
that Madison Square Garden,
it's a mecca.

877
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,680
It's a mecca for basketball and
it's what people don't understand.

878
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,730
I don't the understand what Mecca just
meets people from around the world

879
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:11,390
gathered there to gathering
place. It's like if, if,

880
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:14,600
if Madison Square Garden was in a mall,
it would be a food court.

881
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,880
People gathered from all over the mall.
Some people came there to buy a dress,

882
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,800
other people came there to buy a
slack by some slacks, but they,

883
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,990
they all in the food court
to eat that shitty food.

884
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,600
And yes,
it is a basketball Mecca.

885
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:34,710
People gather from around the globe to
kick the next fucking ass every year if

886
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,170
they make the goddamn playoffs.
All right.

887
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,980
It's just fucking annoys the shit out of
me because I give it up to the Yankees

888
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:43,570
forum like, like that, that, that's,

889
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,090
that's the top team in baseball.
It's not even close.

890
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:51,270
27 championships.
Right.

891
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,760
And he's going to fucking sit there and
he's going to try and talk about Madison

892
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,130
Square Garden.

893
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:04,130
Like this is the crown jewel of the
fucking NBA and completely disregard the

894
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,230
Celtics and Lakers who combined
have one 32 NBA championships Putts,

895
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:15,231
the Lakers BBA championship that they
count as an NBA championship for 33 and

896
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:19,770
you're sitting on fucking too. All
right. I gotta be honest as an outsider,

897
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:22,800
when I think of Madison Square Garden,
I think of Muhammad Ali,

898
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:27,120
I think of led Zepplin Mark Messier.
Yay.

899
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,930
Casually.
I'll think of a Bernard king,

900
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,620
Frank Sinatra, a Bruce
Springsteen, a rolling stones.

901
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,850
I think more music.

902
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,330
I don't think sports because
nothing really fucking memorable.

903
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:51,550
What has ever happened there?
I don't understand what
has happened at the Bruins.

904
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:55,930
Went into the stands and
somebody got beaten with a
loafer. Mike Millbury, right.

905
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,000
That's a rat them out.
But I mean it's on video Mike,

906
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,680
and we just don't understand. Like I, it
just, I just tried to tell him, I'm like,

907
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:04,690
dude, it's not louder. It's not louder.

908
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,790
You think it was louder than when the
Celtics finally one another fucking

909
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:13,690
championship after their drought of
like whatever, what it was 22 years.

910
00:55:13,691 --> 00:55:16,540
Do you really think it was louder than
that? I was trying to explain to him.

911
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:20,380
It just seems loud to you because
you're a Knicks fan. You know?

912
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,650
It's like that dude who was into the
Asian women and he's gone out to do,

913
00:55:24,651 --> 00:55:27,910
they play off the lazy eye.
You just see like Asian women,

914
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:31,150
it's the same fucking thing.
All right,

915
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,350
so just in case there's some
more verses out there. Okay.

916
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,520
You have a nice little venue down there.
It's,

917
00:55:37,521 --> 00:55:41,050
it was made during the cookie cutter time.
Some of the worst fucking venues ever.

918
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,670
The ceiling is ugly and a, there's an
unbelievable, I've done this job before.

919
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:46,990
I always talk about the,

920
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,870
the breeze and Madison Square Garden is
an unbelievable breeze up in the rafters

921
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:56,410
because there's no championship
banners to block the air conditioning.

922
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,290
So anyways, having said that,
congratulations to the next, um,

923
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,590
if the next ever went on a run and we're,
uh,

924
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,100
a championship team,
even then,

925
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:15,100
the best that they could hope
to do is duplicate what, uh,

926
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,930
the Bulls did with Jordan when,

927
00:56:16,931 --> 00:56:21,130
when they were the center of the
basketball universe. But in my lifetime,

928
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,250
they never have been.
And I'm an old fuck

929
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,350
man. I've been around for
a long time at this point.

930
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:30,640
I'm halfway through this journey if I'm
lucky. Hopefully only halfway through.

931
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,440
Um, so there you go. I went out of
my way to trash the fucking next,

932
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,770
even though they just fucking one.
Um,

933
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,450
okay.

934
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,770
I don't, and I don't even
know shit about fucking a,

935
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,040
I don't know shit about basketball.
Why don't I just shut the hell up?

936
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:49,830
What am I up to here? 56
minutes. All right, let's read
some more advertising here,

937
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:54,580

Hey, do you like me? Do you
like my podcast deal? Well,

938

939
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,240
You're like of the troops.

940
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,260

942

dot com. Click on the podcast page.

943
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,570
That thing opens up on the right hand
side. You're gonna see the Amazon banner.

944
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:15,750

945
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:16,883

00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,790
you'll be supporting my podcast because
I get a kickback and 10% of whatever

947
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,260
kickback I get from amazon.com I throw
to the wounded warriors project c support

948
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:29,370

How about that? Can you beat that?

949
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,140
I don't think you care.
So, um, I think that's it.

950
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,600
I think that is the, uh, the
podcast for this week. White.

951
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:40,140
There's some overrated under
Raiders. Remember those things, um,

952
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,110
underrated and a pissing in the shower.

953
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,490
One of the most relaxing
things you could ever do. Grow.

954
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,960
Just lean back,
hands free,

955
00:57:50,961 --> 00:57:55,040
and just let go of all your worries.

956
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:58,520
Trust me. Sounds gross. It's
what he's, but it's awesome.

957
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:04,210
Plus it all goes down the same pipes and
this way you'll save a flush worth of

958
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:09,800
water. It's like the
hybrid of toilet time. Um,

959
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,510
it doesn't go down the same pipe.

960
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,250
It doesn't go down the same
fucking jackass. It doesn't.

961
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:23,250
The toilet goes down your
fucking sewage line. All right.

962
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,520
They don't all,
they don't all flush together.

963
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,850
Tell me they don't all flush together.

964
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:34,440
Then where does that water go to then
get treated and then I wash my hair with

965
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:34,890
the shit.

966
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:39,810
We all shit and pissed in a probably
does this so many fucking people.

967
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,790
Does it go down the same fucking line
now?

968
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,290
Now it would do you would the smell
of shit would become and write up your

969
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:54,440
shower drain?
Maybe.

970
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:58,290
Eventually it does.
I don't think it does.

971
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:04,430
I thought they kept those two separate.
Wow.

972
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:08,130
That's fucking disgusting. Can somebody
please write me and clear that up? Um,

973
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:12,590
anyways, frosting your own beer
glasses at home. Underrated apps.

974
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:17,240
A fuckin lutely. And by the
way, you're required to do that.

975
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,280
Okay. If, if you say, hey, you guys want
to watch the game at my, you are required

976
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,290
to frost up some glasses.

977
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:25,843
Okay?

978
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,590
That's a, that's one of the unwritten
rule. You know, there's unwritten rules.

979
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,970
You don't show up a pitcher.

980
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,153
You know what I mean?

981
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,890
After the whistle blows,
you don't shoot the puck at the goalie.

982
00:59:35,891 --> 00:59:37,450
Those fucking unwritten rules.

983
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:38,910
Okay.

984
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:39,570
You know,

985
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,120
the unwritten rule is that you have
your buddies over to watch the game.

986
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:42,954
He got a frost

987
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,850
glasses,
you know,

988
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,900
and then get mad at them when
they pee all over the seat.

989
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:53,920
Overrated. A giant Oprah style
mansions with 20 bedrooms and shit.

990
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,740
I grew up pretty poor and
it's some small houses.

991
00:59:56,741 --> 00:59:59,680
And I remember thinking as I was
watching those screen movies,

992
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,440
how that Shit could never
happen to broke people.

993
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,650
They had the rich kids in these
giant ass houses, giant ours houses.

994
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:10,560
This guy must be from Europe here.
Um,

995
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:15,010
and people getting murdered in some other
room while the rest of the people were

996
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,010
oblivious,
which made me laugh as growing up.

997
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:21,280
I could hear my mom in the kitchen
walking around on the wooden floor.

998
01:00:21,281 --> 01:00:25,090
What while I was in the bedroom, literally
on the opposite side of the house.

999
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:25,811
No Way.

1000
01:00:25,811 --> 01:00:30,370
Some Mass Douche is slaughtering someone
d masking and then walking back into

1001
01:00:30,371 --> 01:00:34,540
the lounge like, hey guys, what I
miss? Uh, so sleek, tight there,

1002
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,880
Richie rich.
That's fucking hilarious.

1003
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,950
But you know what's crazy
about those houses is,

1004
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,650
you know when you have like 20 bedrooms,
you don't think about it.

1005
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:45,100
But like those rooms are useless.

1006
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,290
20 bedrooms. So you got to go out and
buy 20 beds. What can you do on your bed?

1007
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,350
Sleep and fuck,
right?

1008
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:55,480
Do you need to do then a bunch
of other rooms other than that,

1009
01:00:55,481 --> 01:00:57,700
how long does that take?
For me,

1010
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:02,730
sleeping in fucking takes eight hours
and seven minutes on a good day.

1011
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:06,700
Right? So other than that,
it's just a useless room.

1012
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:08,930
Okay.

1013
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:12,470
I, I you need whatever,
three, four bedrooms. And
then after that everybody can,

1014
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,410
you know, go sleep in the family
room, go sleep in the movie room,

1015
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:19,920
go sleep in my study. You want to
turn those rooms into something else?

1016
01:01:19,921 --> 01:01:21,400
I've never understood.
Uh,

1017
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,160
yeah,

1018
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,390
I don't know. You don't
want to be, see, I, I,

1019
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:27,610
this is why I think those people
live in those kinds of pieces.

1020
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,080
Some people just want a giant house,

1021
01:01:29,081 --> 01:01:32,650
but there is got to be
something really comforting

1022
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:38,350
to live in. Like the Illuminati
is like culdesac you know,

1023
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,700
like if I ever became like,
just like some fucking billionaire,

1024
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,201
you know,

1025
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:48,190
which I really think is inevitable with
the wild success of this podcast and all

1026
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:51,070
this advertising that pretty soon,
you know,

1027
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:55,300
I will become a billionaire.
Um,

1028
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,920
I go fuck yourself,
whatever, whatever. I say,

1029
01:01:59,921 --> 01:02:03,490
I invent the next fucking APP for the
iPhone and I make a zillion dollars. So,

1030
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:07,600
you know, there's gotta be something
comforting when the dollar is crashing.

1031
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,500
If you're in this giant gated fucking
community with its own security.

1032
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,380
Ah, Shit. Even then, even then, any,

1033
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,200
you gotta think the Security Guy?

1034
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:27,490
I would make friends with the security
people, like ridiculous friends.

1035
01:02:27,491 --> 01:02:30,280
I would like if I had that kind of money,
I would pay off the houses.

1036
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:31,870
Well then he wouldn't
fucking show up to work.

1037
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,560
I'd have to do something where
they were on my side. You know,

1038
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,200
I just make a plant dude, when
it, when the shit goes down,

1039
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:43,150
you could bring you and your family
and your pistol to my house. All right.

1040
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:49,470
I have fucking 10 years worth of beef
in my fucking 4,000 square foot fucking

1041
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:51,280
refrigerator.

1042
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,080
Okay.

1043
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,570
Freezer,
we can eat for 10 years.

1044
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:58,270
All and I have enough bullets for
you to hold people off. Can you,

1045
01:02:58,271 --> 01:03:01,150
can you do this? Are you willing to do
this or that? That's how I would plan.

1046
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,170
I would have my own little mini militia.
You know,

1047
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:07,240
I don't buddy my told me
one time they were having,

1048
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,610
they had this fire in the
Hollywood hills somewhere out here.

1049
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:13,060
Can somebody please find me footage of
this because I refuse to believe that

1050
01:03:13,061 --> 01:03:15,400
somebody had this level of wealth,
but it sounded awesome.

1051
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,330
Where the big thing about if when
you live in the hills out here, um,

1052
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:23,380
this is basically what happens all right?

1053
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:27,790
Every year for like a month straight if
fucking it seems like it rains every day

1054
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:28,180
out here.

1055
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,020
And during that time all the hills turn
all green and they're beautiful and

1056
01:03:32,021 --> 01:03:34,270
they're lush and all that type of shit.
And then after that,

1057
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:36,070
occasionally it will fucking rain.

1058
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:41,080
So what happens is gradually the hills
start to dry out and then towards the end

1059
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,350
of the year, the Santa Ana winds
come in off of the desert. All right?

1060
01:03:44,351 --> 01:03:46,630
And it's just flat.

1061
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:50,440
So they come in and like fucking sometimes
upwards of a hundred miles an hour

1062
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:55,030
and it's like nature's hairdryer and
it just dries out all of the hills and

1063
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:59,320
turns them this shitty.
Jesus has common brown.

1064
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,230
And then eventually something happens,

1065
01:04:02,231 --> 01:04:07,000
somebody throws a cigarette out the
window. I don't know what I dunno. Fuck.

1066
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,520
A rattlesnake takes a shit
and hits a piece of Flint.

1067
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,830
I don't know how these things work.
I have a bad science background,

1068
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:16,240
whatever the fucking things catch on fire
and all these rich motherfuckers that

1069
01:04:16,241 --> 01:04:18,100
you're jealous of during those months,

1070
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,830
you're not jealous of when you watch
their fucking houses burned down.

1071
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,220
So one time a buddy of mine was saying
he was watching the news and somebody had

1072
01:04:24,221 --> 01:04:26,900
so much fucking money.
Daddy,

1073
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,760
the dude had his own fire
department basically.

1074
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:35,650
And these guys were on top with these
fucking fire retardant suits and these

1075
01:04:35,651 --> 01:04:36,490
giant like,

1076
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:42,010
like cannons that were shooting foam
all over the perimeter and all over the

1077
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:42,311
house.

1078
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:45,610
So his house didn't burn down and like
the four houses around a burn to the

1079
01:04:45,611 --> 01:04:50,611
ground and his house was fine just
sitting in this giant mountain of fucking

1080
01:04:50,741 --> 01:04:53,170
shaving cream and a,

1081
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:54,840
yeah,

1082
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,510
I just remember thinking that,
that it, that is dead is the shit.

1083
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,560
Like if I was wealthy, that's what
the fuck I would do. You know,

1084
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,840
I wouldn't help the less fortunate,

1085
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:10,460
I would make sure that I could protect
all my shit. Wouldn't, you know,

1086
01:05:10,461 --> 01:05:14,280
that was a nice little selfish moment.
But I am, I'm selfish son of a bitch.

1087
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:18,760
That's the podcast for this week. Hey,
would you guys like to see me do stand up?

1088
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:22,090
Well, why don't you go to [inaudible]
dot com like I'm doing right now.

1089
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:26,020
You fucking bastard. Where the
hell is it? There we go. Uh,

1090
