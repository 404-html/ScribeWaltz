00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,440
Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,180
June 24th, 2013. How are Ya?

3
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:14,480
How's it going? I know it's
Tuesday morning. Had to do
the math there on the date.

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:19,100
I apologize for not doing
the podcast earlier.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,410
I was a,
I was in New York this weekend.

6
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:26,411
Being a fancy man is Jimmy
Norton would say I was at the,

7
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:30,170
uh, the, the premiere of this movie
that I have a really small rolling,

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,550
it's called the heat.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,040
It stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa Muck

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,530
and uh, Michael Rappaport. Now all these,

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,430
all these people,

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,990
all these people are in it and a yours
truly bill Billy red faces in it for a

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,760
couple of seconds.
Don't blink or you will miss me.

14
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:53,120
But that movie comes out this weekend.
Um,

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,930
this upcoming weekend I should
say. So, uh, do me a solid day.

16
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,120
Had to go out and check it out if you can.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,840
I'd really appreciate it's
very funny movie and uh,

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,510
I got to do the whole Hollywood thing.
Went back to New York,

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,140
walk the fuck and red carpet.
You know,

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,520
it answered a couple, two or three
questions. I went in, I saw the movie,

21
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:18,050
I enjoyed it. And then I got drunk
with Joe to Rosa and Paul Versey.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,740
You know, what else could
you ask for in the weekend?

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,990
I know what she could
ask for. Yeah. Victory.

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,270
Send it to fucking gave
seven back in Chicago.

25
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,730
That's something I could have asked for.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,160
I could ask for the
hockey gods to be just,

27
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:38,260
how about we get a fucking lucky bounce.

28
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:42,580
How about one of our shots goes off the
boards and bounces in a weird way and

29
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:45,100
record Shay's off five fucking
guys and goes in the neck.

30
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:49,150
Can we get one of those?
Just one. And you know what,

31
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:53,950
it was not meant to be. Hats off
to the, uh, Stanley Cup champions.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,040
Chicago Blackhawks say, or
definitely without a doubt,
the best team, uh, this year.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,180
And um, you know, they would
just say what is better?

34
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,160
It's all I can say they were better.
Uh,

35
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,780
one goal better every fucking
game it's saved. But, um,

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,690
I got to admit, I, I, you know,
there's no one on their team.

37
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:19,330
I hate and that says something
after watching them for six games,

38
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:23,380
it's like nobody on their teams a
cunt, you know, they got one, they got,

39
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:26,520
they have one pest. That's it. Other
than that, you know, we've got a pest and

40
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,940
Marshawn,
so I will tell you that.

41
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:34,941
What's fucking annoyed me though is I
dunno what this white hair dude's name is,

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,150
but I'm watching on nhl.com how do
you mispronounced Charisse name?

43
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,610
You know,
he kept calling Chera.

44
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,920
Well abroad's Gadda they got chair
a bat there. Eight and Burley. Yay.

45
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,800
It's like he just got brought
up from the fucking minors.

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,840
Guys want to Norris trophy. You can't
pronounce this fucking name correctly.

47
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,410
Um, anyways, Jesus Christ,

48
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,320
you want to talk about a fucking,
just taking the wind out of his sails,

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,860
sitting there on the edge of your seat
thinking, okay, just hold on. Hold on,

50
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:10,281
hold on.

51
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:13,100
Don't let them tie it up and he fucking
tie it up and then they score another

52
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:18,080
one. What was it? 17 seconds later. The
first one I'll go with, but you just,

53
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:21,620
you can't let that other one happened.
But uh,

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,220
okay.

55
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,060
I don't know. Fucking Dave Bollen
guys, just a great hockey player.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,830
I don't know how the fuck that happen.
How does it happen? You know, it kills me,

57
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,930
fucking kills me. But, um,

58
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,720
it was a great series and an original
61 and I actually still like the Black

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,460
Hawks and I think they have fucking
great uniforms and a God dammit.

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,050
God fucking damn. What
the fuck to goals? I mean,

61
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:52,360
we literally went from,
okay. I mean, I'm like,

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,180
okay,

63
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,750
thinking in my head. All right, game seven
can, do you think they can do it again?

64
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,280
As I'm freaking out. Hold on, hold on,
hold on. And then they fucking tie it up.

65
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,450
And I was like, Oh God, another
fucking over time. You're killing me.

66
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,310
Okay.

67
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,910
Can I fucking mentally make it through
another fucking overtime as I sit here

68
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,640
having no effect on the game
for some reason stressing out.

69
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,130
Could I make it through
it? Oh, right day, I guess.

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,630
I guess we don't have to go to overtime.

71
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,730
Thank you day Boleyn for just a
fucking end in that real quick. Um,

72
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,100
but I got to tell you,
um,

73
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:32,700
I was blown away by what the Bruins
were able to do this season that,

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,220
you know, actually, you know,

75
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:39,150
game one and game six was kind of the
Bruins team that I saw years where they

76
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:42,990
would get up to one, three, one and
they had problems holding onto a lead.

77
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,010
So I actually thought,

78
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,590
I didn't even think they were going
to make it out of the first round.

79
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,920
So I can't say I was psyched
that that happened. Whatever,

80
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:53,940
we got a great core base. We can, we come
back, bring up fucking Douggie Hamilton.

81
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:57,170
He got a lot of experience.
The blood, the blue. Uh,

82
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,080
the only good thing about the hawks
winning it in Boston was I didn't have to

83
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,180
listen to that stupid

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,450
Dota.

85
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,430
Just when you think nothing could be more
annoying than Oh, whatever. After that,

86
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,080
after a goal,

87
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,160
that fucking mindless song and looking
at those fat fucking brought Eaton

88
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,360
Chicago Fed back dumb
mustaches. They even have on my,

89
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:27,170
just thinking of a fucking SNL
sketch at that fucking song,

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,400
you mine as well be.
You might as well.

91
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,820
What does that fucking
Song I get knocked down,

92
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,620
but I get up go and like those are songs
that should only be played. You know,

93
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:44,150
when you're on a cruise ship and you've
just signed up for the aerobics class,

94
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,170
you know what I mean?
Nobody listens to those fucking songs.

95
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:50,570
She really got to get rid of that.
Other than that top to bottom.

96
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:54,740
I think Chicago is a great
organization, but uh, you know,

97
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:59,741
they always got to have something fucking
Douchey to either appeal to kids or

98
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:05,480
just get mindless fiddle. Faddle eat
and fucking morons. The buy tickets.

99
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,590
Yeah, I did say fiddle.
Faddle it's still exists. Um,

100
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,350
goddammit.
That shit was good when you were a kid.

101
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,840
Send it right through the fucking roof
with the sugar and they always got to

102
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,010
have something like that. You
know, like the Red Sox, Wally,

103
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,250
really Wally,

104
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,010
how many women were in the room when
that came up? That fucking name Gail.

105
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,260
Hey God, that's cute. You know
what? I'm not going to blame women.

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,760
This is not a sex,
a battle of the sexiest topic.

107
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:45,140
This is just a fucking dose shills
topic. And you, you can file all of that.

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,680
Let's say I told, you know what I mean?
Now I'm being honest about my teams.

109
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:53,120
Why don't we do that next week
for a topic? Write in something,

110
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,990
you know of your home team that
they do that they just really,

111
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:01,991
that's just such a blatant fucking reach
out to try to grab non sports fans.

112
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,360
Um, you know what's creepy about Wally
with the Boston Red Sox is that's really

113
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,930
like, I mean, the team is
basically like a religion.

114
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,350
So you're trying to get them
when they're young. So it's,

115
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,660
it's like you giving them candy, you
know, it's just something creepy about it.

116
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,720
We'll have a fucking adult come walking
up in some big furry fucking outfit or

117
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,990
whatever the hell the guide,
they have thing where's right.

118
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,220
Be like on a mission
to be friendly to kids,

119
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,450
not because it's the right thing to do,
not because you love kids,

120
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,261
because you know,

121
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:43,520
someday that kid is going to have some
sort of alcohol problem and want to

122
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,780
hopefully want to get hammered at your
ballpark and you want his booze money in

123
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,880
your fucking pocket.
Right.

124
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,320
All done under the guise or dressing
up like a fucking woolly mammoth,

125
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,300
you know. Oh, that's right.
People. I'm polling. Um,

126
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,550
well I'm looking behind the curtain
to mascot mascots this week.

127
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,710
I'm pulling back that curtain. I'm
showing you the ugly fucking truth. Um,

128
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,650
oh,
it's going to be a while.

129
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,210
It's going to be a while before I
get over the kick in the balls that,

130
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,490
that last fucking minute
and 10 seconds was

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,633
it was,

132
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,320
I think they kicked my left ball first
and then the Dave Bolan was the fucking

133
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:28,990
right ball.
Uh,

134
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,490
not only did they knock the
Bruins out of the playoffs,

135
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,820
not only do we not win the cup,

136
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:42,821
but now simultaneously hockey is over and
I have to wait for the Nhl all the way

137
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:50,570
until October.
So you know what,

138
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,590
you know I'm going to get over this Bruins
loss. I'm going to watch the day game.

139
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,800
There's nothing better than watching
a day game, a Dodgers game out here.

140
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,550
You just sit there by yourself sipping
on a fucking login and you listened to

141
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:09,030
Vince Scully. It's great.
It takes a second though.

142
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,390
Like I think how deep
into the, uh, the summer,

143
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,060
obviously there was a strike this year,
but how deep into the,

144
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:20,061
into the summer that basketball and the
NHL goes and like how up tempo and high

145
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:26,100
scoring and all that while hockey's not
really high scoring, but whatever, um,

146
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,210
just how the energy level to go from that
to then settle into a great day for a

147
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,330
ball game. Uh, we got a couple of,

148
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,450
it's going to be a pitcher's
duel here at commits Geek.

149
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,520
That's ball one. Yep. Yep, Yep, Yep.

150
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,140
Don't even play that as fast,
but that they've just fucking,

151
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,910
you gotta settle into it.
You have to settle into baseball.

152
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,170
You know what I mean?

153
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,340
It's like you haven't been driving like
a fucking maniac and then your girl

154
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:07,260
looks at you and just like you're
scaring me to have it right.

155
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:12,261
And then you have to fucking mentally
bring yourself down from that play off

156
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:16,710
energy that you will fucking drive and
with and you've got to somehow calm

157
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:20,580
yourself down and then literally
waves somebody into your lane.

158
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,760
That's what it's like to go from the
Stanley Cup finals or even the NBA finals.

159
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:27,690
NBA Finals are great.

160
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:31,980
That was another heartbreaker watching
the spurs lose that one. And um,

161
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,380
and my frustration continues with these
pile on fucking teams. I've come to the,

162
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,690
uh, the acceptance that it is
a new fucking error I guess.

163
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,690
So I'm going to quit whining about it and
obviously all of those guys who won on

164
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:49,500
Miami could have one in any era,
but it's just,

165
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,130
I hate it cause I don't know how to
compare him to bird magic and all those

166
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,350
other guys because uh,
you know,

167
00:10:55,351 --> 00:11:00,351
cause bird magic and Moses Malone never
hung out on p Diddy's yacht right there

168
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,280
on line of flip flops or whatever the
fuck they would have had back then if it

169
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,600
was like today and uh,

170
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,720
decided that they were all going to
go join the fucking Milwaukee Bucks or

171
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:13,530
something. So I dunno. So
congratulations also to the Miami Heat.

172
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:18,320
I don't hate the heat the way,
uh, most Celtics fans to um,

173
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,150
or hate ray Allen.
I mean,

174
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,980
Ray Allen wasn't ours the way Miami got
them. It's the same way we got them.

175
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,900
So I don't know what you crying about.
And as far as the Miami heat go, hey,

176
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,200
good on them.
I mean there,

177
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,750
there are always going to be a fucking
expansion franchise to me. All right,

178
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,250
put that little single digits. Fucking
championships. What are they got three.

179
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,490
Okay.

180
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,870
They got three. Is that what they get?
How many they got? I don't fucking know.

181
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,760
Yeah,
they got three and a,

182
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:52,460
they might be the next Lakers cause
they bought all three of them.

183
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,570
All right. Enough of my fucking bitch
moaning and complaining and whining.

184
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,760
Um, oh by the way, I did last night.
I don't know if he's posted it yet,

185
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,620
which would be classic Jay more to post
it and then give me shit for not re

186
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:12,490
tweeting about it. Um, I did Jay
Morris podcast. We had a great time,

187
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,310
uh, about 10, 15 minutes in.

188
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:20,311
I tried to take them to task about his
it fucking or how I read is a flip and

189
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,620
text message and he fucking took my,

190
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,930
he took my legs out by
immediately apologizing.

191
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,240
Just kind of ended the whole fucking
thing. But uh, you know, it was still,

192
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,900
we still at a great time.
Um, so anyways, what a,

193
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:39,010
what a fucking week in
the world of sports,

194
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:42,570
especially in Boston. The
Bruins loser had Greek. Yeah.

195
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,470
Um, doc rivers signs with
the fucking clippers.

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,570
Um, I'm, I'm going to believe
in Danny Ainge on this one.

197
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,760
And I'm going to go with the philosophy
that you don't want to pay a coach $7

198
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,090
million a year when he has no chance to
win because you're going to just start

199
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,730
from scratch.
But I got to tell you,

200
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,790
like eventually you're going to need a
doc rivers to take you to the promised

201
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,680
land. You know, the guy
knows how to fucking win.

202
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,613
MMM.

203
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,960
I Dunno. It sounded like, I don't know.
From the couple things that I saw,

204
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:20,990
it sounded like doc didn't want to go
through a rebuilding thing and the Celtics

205
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:23,960
wanted to rebuild so they
let him out of his contract.

206
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,010
So thanks to doc rivers and everything
he did for bringing the fuck and shelter

207
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:31,980
x back. And, uh, I'm going
to believe in Danny angels.

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,620
We go through the rebuilding process,

209
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:37,700
although I hate getting rid of
fucking proven people for draft picks.

210
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,340
I was actually watching it this morning.
I couldn't sleep.

211
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,680
I was so fucking upset about
that loss last night. And, uh,

212
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,640
I put it on the NBA channel and I
was watching the 2001 draft. And,

213
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:53,510
you know,
it's not the guys that make it.

214
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,060
It's the guys that don't,
that fucking, it just,

215
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,670
I forget who the 76 is picked in 2001,
but he was some 20 year old kid,

216
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,510
you know, supposed to be this
shot, block and phenom. And I,

217
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,640
I never even heard of the guy, not
like I'm the biggest NBA Fan, but uh,

218
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,580
so that's what makes me nervous about
that shit. So, uh, other than that,

219
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:19,420
what else happened in Boston sports?
Aaron Hernandez.

220
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,590
That story gets sadder and
creepier by the fucking day.

221
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:28,030
Did you see the guy's house
fucking house? That's it.

222
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,910
You made it,
you kept that house at 20 fucking three.

223
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,420
I would just think he's just sitting in
that house just wishing he could just

224
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:38,350
rewind his life fucking six days,
you know,

225
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,180
and just stay home and watch
fucking Beethoven part three.

226
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,540
You have to be thinking that unless
you just a complete psycho. But uh,

227
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,670
all this shit is a legend at this point.
But all of his fucking actions,

228
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,640
he's gotta be neck deep in this shit.

229
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,420
Then you turn in your cell phone and it
comes in you like you drove over it with

230
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:57,380
the fucking car,

231
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,910
you clean your house and then you have a
bunch of people come in and reclean it.

232
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,850
By the way, any cops out there? Any
cops out there? Hey, you know what,

233
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:11,660
let's let's go against the
grain here. Um, I actually,

234
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,380
long time ago when I was doing
the uninformed show with the, uh,

235
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,170
the teen idol sensation, Joe
to Rosa, we actually had a,

236
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,950
this police officer come in that we
knew through a Gotham comedy club and he

237
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:27,900
came in and the big thing was,
uh,

238
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,950
me and Joe are going to try both
of us individually, individually.

239
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,780
We're going to try to come
up with the perfect murder.

240
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,790
So we come up with our scenarios where
we bring the cop in and I go to pitch

241
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,510
mine, and this is, this is how far
I got in mind. I go, all right,

242
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,050
so me and a friend of mine, and
then he goes up. That's it. He goes,

243
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,930
you're already caught. And I'm like,
what do you mean I'm already caught?

244
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,620
He goes to second,
you involve somebody else.

245
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,210
He goes, the chances of
getting caught, it's, it's, if,

246
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,310
if mathematically it was
possible to go beyond 100%, um,

247
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,420
that's what you're doing with
that because now you got,

248
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,260
you had just have twice the
chances of somebody rolling over.

249
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,810
Somebody's getting paranoid,
somebody saying the wrong fucking thing,

250
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:13,070
somebody's feeling guilty.

251
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,870
Somebody leaving some hay is at the
crime scene, the whole fucking thing.

252
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,131
His,

253
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:24,131
his basic thing was if you have no priors
and you just go out and kill somebody

254
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:28,730
that you have no connection to, no
connection to and nobody fucking saw it,

255
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,090
you know, how are they going to catch
you? And then the other thing he says is,

256
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:39,560
do not move the body. He
goes, just leave it there.

257
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,940
He talked, told me a story about
somebody fucking killed somebody.

258
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,460
It felt bad for the dog. So we took the
dog with them or something like that.

259
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:52,730
And that's how they ended up connecting
them to the crime scene was the dog

260
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:56,180
hairs. He took the dog and let it go.
Hoping someone would fucking rescue it.

261
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,030
I don't know what,
but they found this,

262
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,590
the dead dudes dog hairs in his fucking
car is, it's over. You know what I mean?

263
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:06,110
It's fucking over.
How did I get on this subject?

264
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,450
It was just a fucking creepy ass week.

265
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,870
And it Paula Deen running around dropping
the fucking end word ever dental.

266
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,770
He is,
she's making a fucking souffle.

267
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,360
You know I actually met her
one time when I was in Atlanta.

268
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:23,450
She seemed like a sweetheart. I
told her, I go, you know what? I go,

269
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,400
you cook like my mom. And
she's like, you know what?

270
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,440
That's like the nicest
thing anybody could say.

271
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,840
I don't know what, what
do you do? So now what?

272
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:36,260
So now your fire and does
that make her less ignorant?

273
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,760
Does that help her say the n word
less when she's baking cookies?

274
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,640
I don't know.
Then you know what?

275
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,000
I think each race should have
like an ambassador. Right?

276
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:51,720
And when somebody does some shit,
like, like the ambassador just,

277
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,510
they just go out and they go
fishing for a weekend, you know,

278
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,820
and they just sort of talk it out and you
give that person of frame of reference.

279
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,290
So anytime they think it's some
ignorant shit, they go, oh wait,

280
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,620
now what about so and so I went fishing
with, you know, it's not all bad. Right.

281
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,820
Or that guy in ESPN when he said the
stuff about gay people, you know,

282
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,050
God go send them to a musical
and I'll fucking now,

283
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,720
I dunno, but I don't know if the,
the firing thing at Jesus Christ.

284
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,240
Oh, speaking of Jesus.
No, Jj. Did you guys,

285
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,074
uh,

286
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,280
did you guys see that
fucking dude walk on that?

287
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:37,110
Why all the way across the Grand Canyon?
Did you see that shit?

288
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,930
That was one of the most incredible
fucking things I've ever seen in my life,

289
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,210
in my life. I always have to repeat
that twice when I say in my life.

290
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,100
And you know why that is?
Because I saw,

291
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,380
I watched wife swap a long
time ago and this one family,

292
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:58,560
they will live in like pirates if
anybody can find this clip for me.

293
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,360
It's one of my favorite clips. This
guy just decided, he, we were all,

294
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,410
his whole family was going to live like
pirates and they dressed like pirates

295
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:10,680
and arc and they just walked around.
They had no fucking responsibility.

296
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,170
The guy was totally avoiding
being like an adult.

297
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,250
So he worked from home or whatever.
So they'd swap wives.

298
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,420
So his pirate wife leaves and then
incomes like some fucking totally

299
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:25,200
conservative Nancy Reagan
business suit wearing woman.

300
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,320
And she's just like, no dude, you
need to go get a job or whatever.

301
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:33,321
So he goes and he does some job filing
and he comes home that day right after

302
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:34,890
living like a pirate,

303
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:38,400
he has to put on this monkey suit and
go down and fucking earn a living.

304
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,560
And he comes home and she just
goes, so how was it? And he goes,

305
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,040
that was the worst day of my life.

306
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,760
And she goes, well, you know, and he
goes off my, he screamed at again.

307
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,250
It's fucking great.
So anyways,

308
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,420
getting back to the fuck and ginger
who walked across the wire, dude,

309
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,470
I watched it after cause everybody
kept tweeting me gone bill, Hey,

310
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:13,110
I'm really rooting for you.
You put on some weight,

311
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,610
but I'm really rooting for you
to walk across the grandkid.

312
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,980
You'd so I kind of heard about it. So I
was already laughing going, all right,

313
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:22,080
this guy must look like me a little bit.
But anyways,

314
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:25,500
when I was flying back from New York City,

315
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:30,120
I watched it and I was,
I was like,

316
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,910
my palms were sweating
watching this fucking guy,

317
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,490
1500 fucking feet in the air with no net,
no lifeline,

318
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:39,240
know anything.

319
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,980
And he's walking across the wire and
he every step is a thank you Jesus.

320
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,460
Oh, thank you God lord you, Lord,

321
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:52,870
thank you for getting rid of the wind.
Like this fucking 30 mile an hour wind.

322
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:57,820
This guy is, and then he's got his
douchebag. Father going, okay, you're uh,

323
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,360
you're one minute and six
seconds and the journey

324
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,650
your one minute and 36 seconds. He led
his dad do this until about minute 18.

325
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:09,840
And he just finally just goes, Dad, dad,

326
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,290
I don't need you to tell me how long I've
been out here. Like it's fucking arms,

327
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:17,820
a tired as hell.
It was like slanders getting mad.

328
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:20,920
Like he couldn't be like dad, but if
I was on the wire back down his truck.

329
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,450
All right, what difference does it
make a fucking long. I'm out here.

330
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,010
What am I going to punch
a clock and fucking go to
sleep and come back tomorrow?

331
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:35,300
You asshole trying to walk across a wire,
right?

332
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah.

333
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,550
This fucking guy, he's just
sitting there, that's sitting here.

334
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,800
He's walking across doing
like this little slide step.

335
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,930
You know how you would sort of like
insert yourself into a photo to photo bomb

336
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:51,390
somebody at this.
Do you know that little slide step you do?

337
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,220
He's doing that with these little ballet
slippers on and I gotta tell you I was

338
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:59,160
interested that he didn't have those
shoes with the little toes on them.

339
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,220
You know, there's creepy fucking things
that just makes you want to just,

340
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,180
you know, it makes your teeth hurt to look
at them. Surprise. He didn't have those.

341
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:09,830
Maybe it's his case. He had a prom. Make
your luck. His big toe with the, uh,

342
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,790
the index finger or toe. Right.
Hang on like a fucking monkey.

343
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,040
So anyways, he sit in his stepping across
it going, thank you. Fine. Thank you.

344
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,260
Jesus. Jesus. Oh, glory to you.

345
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,400
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Away.

346
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,020
At one point he actually sounded like
he was having sex. He was going, yes.

347
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:37,260
Jesus. Oh Jesus. Right.

348
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,370
I know it was bugging people who aren't
religious. Uh, it didn't bug me at all.

349
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,680
I thought that guy was the shit.

350
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:49,920
And if you think I wouldn't be out there
talking to every God that I had ever

351
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:52,530
heard of, I would have.
Except that would've been,

352
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,450
I would've been cursing at the same
time. I would have been. Oh, thank you.

353
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,230
God.
You mother fucker.

354
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,620
I would've been doing that. The
whole fucking work. Thank you. God,

355
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,160
you all of Fargo.

356
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:14,130
I would be doing that way at some point.
I were to crouch down,

357
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,290
let go of that balancing thing and I
just would have been hanging on to the

358
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:22,890
fucking wire crying. But
what, what would you do?

359
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,450
Do this no fucking way you could ever
get me to do what that guy is like.

360
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,070
That guy is the shit. I don't even know
his name. I don't even know if his name,

361
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:36,150
if he's listening for listening to
this, please pray for me. Um, dude,

362
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:38,130
how is time flying by this fast?

363
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,630
23 minutes in 23 minutes
in on your Tuesday. Um,

364
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,270
all right, let's do us read a of
ads for this week. Everybody. Dude,

365
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,200
I would have been praying
everybody, oh, Buddha, Buddha,

366
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,730
you fat motherfucker just
can't meet across this.

367
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,680
I'd want boulder to be laying down in
the Canon in case I feel like Atlanta on

368
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:01,310
his fucking stomach.
Do that guy had to deal with like,

369
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,120
I guess if, if, if you, uh,

370
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,830
if you're walking in a rhythm,
which you know is basically,

371
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,450
if you have a consistent gate to how
you're walking, when you're on a wire,

372
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:18,740
it starts to bounce up and down.
So every once in a while,

373
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,210
I guess you either have to slow it
down, switch it up, or crouched down.

374
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,650
Like this guy was, he paid,
he took a fucking knee.

375
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,140
How you do that on a fucking
cable? I don't know. Um,

376
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,010
I'm actually predicting this that they're
going to start setting up fucking a

377
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,420
little tight ropes at gyms because
it's good for core strength. You know,

378
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,231
somebody will sell out,

379
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,920
analyze that and they'll put it like
literally two feet off the ground with a

380
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:47,960
bunch of AMF mats all around it.

381
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,290
And you've got to wear a helmet and a
fucking harness and all this shits and

382
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,660
nobody gets sued. You
know, they always do that.

383
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:58,661
Like somebody does some really like
manly takes balls the size of the Grand

384
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,570
Canyon Shit. And then somebody
turns it into like a workout,

385
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,340
like the boxing workout.
They have like the UFC workout,

386
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,110
we'd do the fucking rope thing,
you know,

387
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,250
when you shaken out those fucking ropes,
doing all this,

388
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:14,750
the same shit those guys do,

389
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:18,560
you do everything except fucking get
the balls up to go fight another man,

390
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,500
you know, or woman. Um,

391
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,680
so anyways, you know, I just realized,
you know, that you ever see that,

392
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:31,400
that that bully beat down
thing, which is really an, it's,

393
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,930
it's a terrible show because the cowards,

394
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,840
they still don't stand up to them.

395
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,020
There's usually two pussies that
the dude's picking on. So it's like,

396
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:43,580
why don't you teach them how to fight?

397
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,600
They joined forces and then they go in
the ring and they fight the bully. Right?

398
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,060
Why are you sitting there
having them outsourced? They're
nuts. They lack of nuts.

399
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,020
You know what I mean? Download to somebody
else's balls is more, is more, uh,

400
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:00,740
what they're doing and then he goes in
and he kicks the shit out of them to make

401
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:03,860
it a little fair. You know, it'd be
great. They should take those, those, uh,

402
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:08,861
the female ultimate fighters and bring
him into the ring because they can knock

403
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:13,560
out the average bully. No
problem. And then what's
funny, that's extra humiliated.

404
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,630
All right. That's just an
industry note for that show.
All right, let's get to the,

405
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:20,690

00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,290
I don't know if you
guys have realized this,

423
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,740
but as great as this shows where when
I was coming up in the 70s and eighties

424
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:23,040
and that type of thing, um,
they, they were nowhere the law.

425
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,880
There was nothing like
breaking bad on television. Um,

426
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,740
nothing like the wire, nothing like
all these, you know, walking dead,

427
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,140
walking dead is like a
Zombie movie every week.

428
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,610
You can watch all of this stuff anywhere
you want with Hulu plus and can get

429
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:41,880
caught up, you know, so you'll
have to fill out of the loop.

430
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,820
If you go to a party and everybody's
talking about some show you haven't seen

431
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
anyways, they got all the
shelves, they got community,
modern family, southpark, SNL,

432
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:52,890
Jimmy Kim, oh family guy and more.

the podcast. Everybody. Um,

459
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,170
oh, you know what I've
been doing here? I didn't,

460
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,630
I didn't mention this to you guys.

461
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:32,580
I've been trying to become a
little more worldly. I'm trying to,

462
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,020
I'm trying to learn all the, all the
countries in the capitals. Oh Jesus.

463
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,580
Um, I got, I can do the
Middle East and all of Europe.

464
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,950
Europe's a motherfucker when you get to
the, uh, when you get to Eastern Europe,

465
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:52,060
cause once checklists of Aki
and Yugoslavia splintered
into like seven or eight

466
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:56,210
different fucking countries,
you know what I mean? Just Shit.

467
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,240
You never really hear about like,
uh,

468
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,250
what are some of the ones over that?
I'll fucking enough.

469
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,740
I don't even have it in front of me.
I'm still trying to memorize them.

470
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,070
But what I did learn there was some, I was
just like, what the fuck is San Marino?

471
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,800
San Marino,
capitol San Marino.

472
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:19,390
And then you had like VAD, VAD, dues,
Lichtenstein, and everybody over here.

473
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:22,310
It makes fun of Lichtenstein. I remember
growing up everybody, cause it's,

474
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,610
it was like Beavis and butthead shit.
Like as the word lick is in there,

475
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,950
what are you doing? Their fucking liquid
shy, you know, stupid shit like that.

476
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,403
Um,

477
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,070
evidently there's like five
sovereign states in the world,

478
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,070
uh, or cities, whatever
the fuck you call them.

479
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:44,490
And they kind of exist as
their own little entities.

480
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:45,980
Okay.

481
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,690
And uh, that sounds, if you got the
money to live there, they're great.

482
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:55,040
The tax rate is low. It's like
Vatican City. Liechtenstein

483
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,620
Monaco,

484
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,970
I think Singapore and then something
else that begins with an m.

485
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,380
Yeah.

486
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,020
I don't know if it's Malta, I don't
know this, this, this five of them.

487
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,470
Okay.

488
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,950
And I got to tell you like
I would love if they have,

489
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:13,290
if they ever came up with
this show called, uh,

490
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,570
the money trail or blood
money or something.

491
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:18,600
I can't imagine how much is oozing
out of those fucking places.

492
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,650
Vatican city goes without saying.
All right.

493
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,510
That just goes without fucking saying.

494
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,860
You can't imagine what goes
on in that city. Right.

495
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,730
Considering the pope quit, even when
the pope's just like, listen guys,

496
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:37,050
I can't be the spokesperson for this shit
anymore. Um, and interestingly enough,

497
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:38,850
you never hear anything
about Lichtenstein.

498
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:42,780
You never hear anything about fucking
Monaco other than the fucking Grand Prix.

499
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,380
And it's just a bunch of rich countries
over there tagging fucking top shelf

500
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:49,404
ass.

501
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,690
Yeah.

502
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,810
Like fucking a third of their goddamn age.

503
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,210
You know, how do I get into that
party? That's what I want to know.

504
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,320
Hey, by the way, did you guys see shit
is heating up between China and Japan?

505
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,870
They're going to, maybe they're going to
go at it over some islands and you know,

506
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:10,910
it would be great as a citizen
of the United States here,

507
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:15,230
you don't have to be phenomenal.
If we just stayed the fuck out of it,

508
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,600
you know,

509
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,600
we just stayed the fuck out of it and
he just just got to watch this renewed

510
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:27,710
rivalry. Oh rivalry. That goes
way back to the beginning of time.

511
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,240
All kinds of great fucking
games they add back in the day,

512
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,340
you know, Japan ran up the
score and Nan King, right?

513
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,910
The rape and Nan King, there's a of
bad blood between the two of them.

514
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,100
This is like when the Celtics and Lakers,

515
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,580
like rivalry went dormant throughout
the 90s and then it came back with a

516
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,490
vengeance.
So I think from what I've,

517
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,300
the looks like eventually giant in Japan,
China,

518
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,430
which is just a fucking
environmental disaster.

519
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,270
The biggest mistake they fucking
make, they would just like, look,

520
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,920
we're going to have so
many God damn people.

521
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,550
If you ever decide to attack this country,

522
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,760
there's just gonna be wave after wave
after wave of fucking human beings coming

523
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,250
over the fucking hell.
Right.

524
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,690
Did they not know about nuclear weapons?
You know,

525
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:23,600
you just were one person can just
kind of end the world. I mean, why,

526
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,740
why didn't they just go that route?

527
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,060
This part of the podcast is
called in way over his head,

528
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,700
Bill Byrd discussing world events without
really reading up on him. Everyone.

529
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,290
Um, so anyways, yeah, I can do all
the capitals or the Middle East.

530
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,630
It's great. Then you'll hear world knows
you kind of know where shit is. You know,

531
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,730
like I didn't know that the Czech Republic
was tucked right in between that like

532
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:57,500
a Poland and Germany, like West
Virginia, between Ohio and Pennsylvania.

533
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,730
You see that I use something normal,
something that I could relate to.

534
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,420
Hey Bill, why don't you shut the fuck up
and read a question for this week? Okay,

535
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:09,620
I could do that. Oh, by the way,
the email is bill@themmpodcast.com.

536
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,770
If you want to send it in an email,
let me know.

537
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,330
What's the most embarrassing thing that
one of your home teams does that makes

538
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:18,500
you uh,

539
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,250
wanna either choke somebody in the front
office or punch the fan next to you

540
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:26,150
cause they're participating. I'd love
to hear it. All right. Butte, Montana,

541
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:33,140
Billy boy. Uh, when, when you were on your
red state tour, stop and check out Butte,

542
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:37,430
Montana. Um, I'm excited for your
upcoming show in Bozeman, Montana.

543
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:41,450
I happened to live about an
hour west of Bozeman in Butte.

544
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:47,510
That's just a great fucking, that's
a perfect name for a city in Montana.

545
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,100
Butte, Montana. Beaut.
Where are y'all from? Butte.

546
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,910
Butte won't panel.
I ain't got time for two syllables.

547
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,580
I gotta go man.
The fence.

548
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,930
You'll always a southern accent if the
fucking most northern part of the country

549
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,040
actually may not. I'm
sorry. Alaska is all right.

550
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,770
You're fucking geographical cut there.
Uh,

551
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,310
when you're making the
drive from Boise to Bozeman,

552
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:17,750
you will have to drive through
Butte, Butte, Montana. You're, uh,

553
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,420
you're driving through at a great time
to stop for the afternoon and check it

554
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:22,260
out.
We have a beauty.

555
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,250
We have beautiful old architecture
in old and new giant minds.

556
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,680
Older new giant minds. You're mining
for giants. The fuck does that mean

557
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,990
huge minds? I don't know
anything about mine. Sorry sir.

558
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,040
Talking shop there and he goes,
and the day of your show,

559
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:45,120
it will be evil Knievel day.
I gotta go.

560
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,480
Well, the day of the show might
be cutting it a little bit close.

561
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,620
We got to stop in. Anybody can get a
picture with an Elvis impersonator.

562
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,190
I've never seen an even evil Knievel.
Putin Personator I want I wanna.

563
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,860
You know what sir? I might, I
might, uh, I might check that out.

564
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:02,400
Why am I saying everything fucking twice.
Get the papers, get the papers. I might,

565
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:06,240
I might, I might check it out there.
They're the up, uh, the uptown.

566
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,780
I've got to do it again now.
My fucking myself.

567
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,690
The uptown is filled with daredevil
stunts, booze, good food and crazies.

568
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,520
Something I thought you guys
might like to check out.

569
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:20,610
Probably get a good story out of it.
At least. Can't wait for the show.

570
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,370
Fucking and

571
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,880
I gotta tell you I love
those kinds of places.

572
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,050
I love going to these places that are
considered the middle of fucking nowhere

573
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,350
and checking out, uh, you know,

574
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:38,540
the architect texture here in all the
fucking, uh, history of the places,

575
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:43,020
seen what they do for fun.
I've never heard of an evil Knievel day.

576
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm assuming he's from that area.
Beer, Butte, Montana, evil Knievel,

577
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,380
the size of balls he had,

578
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,310
he would have fucking g would have
driven his fucking motorcycle.

579
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,300
They weighed like 10,000 fucking pounds
in the early seventies he would have

580
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,910
driven it right across that wire,
you know,

581
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,370
with some sort of shoot
that came out too early.

582
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,860
Knock that Jesus freak right off the
fucking wire. Oh, thank you Jesus.

583
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,820
Oh that step was in your
name. Oh, glory to you,

584
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,960
God for making these dancing slippers.
Marrying too young.

585
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,270
Doris billing. Billing's worth
the Reddington. I liked that one.

586
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,150
I would have just gone with
Billingsworth Redington you know what?

587
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:29,180
If I ever moved to Lichtenstein, that's
going to be my name, my fake name.

588
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,280
When I tried to hide my blood money,

589
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,403
you know,

590
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,120
because one day I go to a show and I sell
the DVDs and I take pictures first and

591
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:42,210
I take the door and they take all the
fucking march money and then I just don't

592
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:46,500
do a show. And then I'm going to relocate
to Lichtenstein and I'm going to go buy

593
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:47,520
Billingsworth Reddit,

594
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,820
Billingsworth Reddington and I'm going
to have a fucking pocket watch. And a,

595
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,410
and a little spectacle spectacle. What
do you call that? A little fucking,

596
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,830
not a gargoyle. What do you call that
thing? A cyclops. What do you call it?

597
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:03,831
Thing when you gotta you gotta fucking a
bifocal now by means to not a trifocal,

598
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,790
uh, sing a unit. Unifocal
I'm going bicycle here. Hey,

599
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:11,700
how many more wing walkers are going
to die? I didn't know people were,

600
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:13,360
were fucking wing walking.
I didn't know that.

601
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:18,280
Still fucking existed in like three of
them died. See bad things happening.

602
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,140
Trade. Now you start over at
three. Keep counting them.

603
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,080
I bet thousands of wing walkers have died.

604
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,440
Bad things happen when you walk out on
a wing. You superstitious. Cons. Um,

605
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,040
eight bill, am I getting
married too young? Well,

606
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,920
never gotten married, so I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you. Uh,

607
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,630
but I will read this.
I'm 25 and live with my girlfriend.

608
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,600
She's great.
Pretty and things are going very well.

609
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:50,770
I've dated her for four years and she's
by far the longest relationship I've

610
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:51,604
ever had.

611
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,810
She's from a somewhat traditional family
where people get hitched and their

612
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,830
early twenties.
Dude,

613
00:38:56,831 --> 00:39:01,690
where the fuck do you live that you're
25 and you use the word hitched from

614
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:02,524
Butte?

615
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,330
Me and my girl getting hitched going to
have the wedding out there in the barn.

616
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,620
You know,
figured,

617
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,880
figured we'd she could get
dressed up there in the loft.

618
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:15,910
I'd stay down here next to the horses.
You know,

619
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,460
we ain't gonna have no mute a music.

620
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:23,140
Don't want to spook anybody in
any animals here in a barn. Right.

621
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,240
And they're not consummate
the relationship over there
and that stack of shit

622
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,110
just fucking knock her
out right over there.

623
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,030
Okay.

624
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,140
Um, God, just go there.
Cornhusker sorry. Let's,

625
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,710
let's stick with the fucking letter here.
I'm in Dayton for her for four years.

626
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,940
Uh, but, but Bob, people usually get
hitched. Where the hell am I? Um,

627
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,880
and because we dated for a
while and I lived together,

628
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:52,450
I already feel pressure from her and her
family to pop the question. Oh, Jesus.

629
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:55,710
Yeah, yeah. You know, you're fucking,

630
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:58,920
you've been with her for four years in
the middle of nowhere where they say

631
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:03,900
hitched surprise, they're not coming
down there to have some sort of exorcism.

632
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,641
Anyways,
he says,

633
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:09,540
I'm conflicted as I totally agree with
you on the whole drafting and the first

634
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,820
round idea.
Oh that's my whole theory.

635
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:14,460
You don't want to wait to get married
too long or else you're going to fucking,

636
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,570
you know, all the good, all the
good draft picks had gone. Um,

637
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,320
or what you do is you, you, you
pick up someone who's proven like,

638
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,800
but has had a problem like a Randy
Moss type of chick, you know.

639
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,281
Well,
you know,

640
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:32,430
it's going to be good for a couple of
seasons before she fucking tries to run

641
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,630
over the mailman with the car
or something. I Dunno. He goes,

642
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:39,370
I've had a great time with her
family and she does with mine. Do,

643
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,260
do you love this girl? He goes, hello.

644
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,760
Marriage is a scary
concept to a young guy.

645
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:50,030
It's not much more than what the situation
I'm currently living in with her.

646
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,390
I probably have a Peyton manning on my
hands and I can see my single friends

647
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:59,391
holding out for a Shannon shap or a Tom
Brady in the sixth or seventh rounds and

648
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:00,690
it seems too risky.

649
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,880
I see them chasing mediocre girls around
while I'm going scuba diving and biking

650
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:09,960
with my girl. However, I'm still a young
guy. I haven't dated that many girls in.

651
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:14,370
It seems like it would be fun to have
random sex with some pretty ladies and my

652
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:18,270
city. My girl is awesome, but I
have a penis. Thus the conflict,

653
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,630
that's one of the truest things
you'll ever hear. He goes, all right,

654
00:41:21,631 --> 00:41:22,161
I look forward here.

655
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:25,890
And your advice saw you
kill it up in Boston and you
have more hair in your head.

656
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:28,180
Then you think you do. Ah, that Nice.

657
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,380
It's fallen out by the day
by the second. Um, all right,

658
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:36,740
let's go back here. What does he
say here? Uh, you know what sir?

659
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:38,330
You say a bunch of Nice things about it,

660
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,910
but I never hear you say that you're
crazy about her or that you love her.

661
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,723
You know,

662
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,920
I think that that was the biggest thing.

663
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:49,450
I think maybe that's why you'd have more
of a wandering eye rather than the fact

664
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:53,920
that you just have a dick.
Um, if you love this girl,

665
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,200
I would get married
sooner rather than later.

666
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,953
You know,

667
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,530
every guy that I know that ever got
married and married the right one always

668
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:04,200
said it's the smartest thing I ever did.
All right.

669
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,770
You don't want to grow up like me.
All right?

670
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,170
You don't want to still be out there
drinking fucking whiskey, you know,

671
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,600
looking like the owner of
the bar rather than a patron.

672
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:17,820
Okay.

673
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,260
MMM. Yeah. The like, look,

674
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:22,850
you're asking me one of the

675
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,130
most important decisions in your life.
Who Do I marry?

676
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,440
Should I marry this person? Um, I
would ask myself these questions. Uh,

677
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,010
does all right, are you in
love with this girl? This is,

678
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,610
is this the one? Is this the mother
your kids? If, if the answer's yes,

679
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:48,410
then by all means get on with it.
If the answer's no,

680
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:53,411
then man up break up with her by a fucking
year supply with the condoms and uh,

681
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,240
go have some fun. That's my
advice. How was that sir?

682
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:04,010
I'm fluoride conspiracy.
William,

683
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:07,310
I just listened to you and
to Rosa on uninformed. Oh,

684
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:10,970
our old talk show comes up again.
Talk about fluoride in the drinking water.

685
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,530
I've reached,

686
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,490
I've researched this for some time along
with the other conspiracies and it's

687
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:21,020
true fact is there are independent
researchers from all around the globe that

688
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:23,840
I've done study after
study on sodium fluoride.

689
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,290
Now they all found the same thing.
Sodium fluoride damages,

690
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:30,410
soft tissue including brain cells.
Well,

691
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,410
you know what I've learned with all this
shit after years of being a conspiracy

692
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,640
theorist is you have to,

693
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,720
you have to then research the researchers
and it just becomes way too much

694
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:40,670
fucking work. And I just, after a while,

695
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,360
just put my head down and
go as just gimme a bacon,

696
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:48,020
egg and cheese and just get
off my fucking day here. Um,

697
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,860
that's like somebody tweeted
me, said, uh, some scientists,

698
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,620
sometimes some sciences say that
redheads are going to be extinct by 2060.

699
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,320
I love that. Some scientists
say, what scientist,

700
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,860
what else did they say?
My buddy just had a red headed lady.

701
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,160
Now I had already had a baby.
Um,

702
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,090
okay,

703
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,930
what last year

704
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,450
in 2012 so in 2060,
that baby God willing,

705
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:19,580
we'll be 48 years old.
So like I've said,

706
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,000
unless you people who keep
sending me this shit about the,

707
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,440
the complete extinction,
um,

708
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,140
the final solution for
fucking redheads by, you know,

709
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:34,650
within 40 fucking years essentially,
uh,

710
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:36,660
you might want to look into
your research a little more.

711
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,200
You might want to research the researchers
unless you have some sort of plan

712
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:43,020
that I don't fucking know about.
All right.

713
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,813
Yeah.
Jesus.

714
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,430
I just pictured myself hiding with a
bunch of other red heads with some fucking

715
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,310
brunettes sympathizer,
you know,

716
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,890
sitting in the wall like
some old Anne Frank.

717
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,480
Um, anyways, what are we talking
about here? Sodium fluoride.

718
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,040
All right.
As well as bone.

719
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,030
It doesn't really matter if you switch
toothpaste and buy bottled water because

720
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:11,310
sodium fluoride can be absorbed topically.

721
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,570
One study stated that dental fluorosis,

722
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:17,640
which is slowly sodium fluoride,

723
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,880
was proposed by the u s
government to reduce reduced what?

724
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,890
Brag, I'm guessing cavities.
You left that out, uh,

725
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,660
is in fact up to a lot higher in Florida.

726
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:34,820
A water supply areas. What happened there?
What happened with this whole point?

727
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,740
One study stated that dental fluorosis
is in fact up to a lot higher in

728
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:42,350
fluoridated water supply areas.

729
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,830
Yeah,

730
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,760
that's a fragment sir, isn't it? Or is
it the way I'm reading it? What am I,

731
00:45:48,761 --> 00:45:53,200
what word people am I not emphasizing
that's making this sentence makes sense in

732
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:56,530
my head as I hear it.
Um,

733
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,390
keep in mind that they get the
sodium fluoride from smokestacks,

734
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:05,800
scrub it and acid then sell it to
the municipal water supply companies.

735
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,210
They haven't produced one studies to
suggest it does anything remotely close to

736
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:11,021
what they claim.

737
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:16,021
It does not even a study to combat the
other studies that are done almost every

738
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,220
year by various independent
researchers from around the world. Um,

739
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,070
yeah, I mean, I dunno. I don't fucking, I
don't even know what's sodium fluoride is.

740
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,440
I don't fucking know what it is.

741
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,480
Do I want the scum from inside of
a fucking smokestack on my teeth?

742
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:38,110
I probably don't. I'd be willing to
say that that does more harm than good.

743
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,073
You know what,
sir?

744
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:46,110
Why don't you take that fucking email
and send it to a smart podcast to a

745
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:49,870
podcast that's fucking smart.
Why don't you do that?

746
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,920
Is there a science one
couple of guys in lab coats

747
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,270
sweating in their lab coats,
podcasting. I don't know. Fucking it.

748
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,990
Here we go. William Burp. How do I
come to terms with being average?

749
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,210
Well, let me tell you, sir,
you're asking the right guy. Um,

750
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,410
love everything you do. Coming to see
your show on August 23rd at the MGM.

751
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:17,560
That's right.
I'm going to be at the MGM and Foxwoods,

752
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,940
Connecticut on August 23rd all in,
by the way,

753
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,730
I have a super secret,

754
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,680
very special show that I'm going to be
doing at the end of August. All right.

755
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:34,450
I'm teasing it right now
with another comedian

756
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,470
that is way beyond me or my abilities
and I've always wanted to work with them

757
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:44,310
and I reached out to them and we're going
to do a co headlining show where you

758
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:47,790
ask, I'm not saying shit
until tickets go on sale.

759
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,850
When you ask,

760
00:47:49,851 --> 00:47:54,380
I told you towards the
end of August why bill?

761
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,510
Why are you doing this?
You Ass?

762
00:47:56,511 --> 00:48:00,900
Because I'm learning from other radio
guy ship kind of put half the information

763
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:01,321
out there.

764
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:05,020
You get everybody at the end edge of their
seats and then the fucking Black Hawk

765
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,430
score two goals on you and it's over.
Sorry.

766
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,950
How do I come to terms that I just won't
be financially successful to the point

767
00:48:13,951 --> 00:48:18,670
where money is not an
issue. Jesus Christ. Dude,

768
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:22,390
that that just made me feel sad. Why
would you, why would you think that?

769
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,970
All right. I guess going to go
into detail as to why he goes,

770
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:30,680
I'm 30 held many technical positions
in the corporate ladder at a few big

771
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:34,190
companies. It is everything
office space made it out to be,

772
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,400
which has driven me to file patents or
ideas and improvements as well as start a

773
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:44,810
few side businesses that didn't seem to
really take flight. Well, there you go,

774
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:45,644
sir.

775
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,780
Yeah,

776
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,150
you know you're, you're, you're,

777
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:54,190
you're basing your self worth
on other people employing you.

778
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:59,600
All right. God knows I got enough shit
on my podcast. He voice legal zoom,

779
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:03,950
stamps.com all of that shit for you to
run a fucking side business while you're

780
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:07,160
holding down your job at this corporate
nightmare that you don't want to be and

781
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,630
believe in your talents.
Dude,

782
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,340
you think I just walked on stage and
tried three fucking jokes and then it

783
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:16,460
worked.
I bombed for fucking years.

784
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,460
For years and years and years,
like almost

785
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,960
the first 11 years of my career,
I swear to God.

786
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:28,961
Every time I went on stage
it was a crapshoot whether
it was going to go well or

787
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:31,830
not.
It was even longer than that.

788
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,420
It's basically once you start selling
tickets and people come out to your show

789
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,960
that the bombing goes way down and it
also makes you softer as a comic because

790
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:42,770
people are coming out to see you.

791
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,360
They give you a giant ovation as you go
out there, they're already on your side.

792
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:51,290
It's a home game. All right? Before
you sell tickets as a comedian,

793
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:55,910
every night is a fucking away game and
it's a rivalry game and they fucking hate

794
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:57,230
you.
All right?

795
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,640
Okay,

796
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,670
so I think you're a really talented guy.
I think you know what?

797
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:04,490
A lot of smart people, slightly
depressed, which is what the,

798
00:50:04,491 --> 00:50:07,940
how this is reading and dude,
you just got to get yourself,

799
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:12,260
force yourself to pick yourself up off
the mat and throw yourself against the

800
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,620
wall. All right? That's what not
yourself. Sorry. Stupid idea.

801
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,440
Don't myself against the wall.
Whatever idea you got,

802
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,470
just keep putting it out there.
All right?

803
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,090
And you pat and all those fucking things
and you get yourself a goddamn lawyer.

804
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:30,680
So when these corporate come sniffing
around and they want to dangle some carrot

805
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:31,191
in front of you,

806
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:34,400
you make sure you get as much as that
carried as humanly fucking possible.

807
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,993
All right.

808
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,700
Is it donkey really that dumb that it
just keeps walking towards that carrot?

809
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,030
Is it looking at it like it's a mountain?
Like wow,

810
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:46,660
it's just way off in the distance,
you know?

811
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,270
Is the donkey sitting there praying to
it's God as it just keeps [inaudible]

812
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:55,160
thank you. What? What? What the fuck
would that God be? Can't say Jesus off.

813
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,060
Piss them off. Yeah. So we told me that
day. Why don't you make fun of Muslims?

814
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,370
You Pussy.
Right?

815
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,530
Okay.

816
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,070
I made fun of my own fucking religion.
All right.

817
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,860
I stay within my wheelhouse.
I make fun of what the fuck.

818
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:12,770
I know you heard me try to
talk about Eastern Europe.

819
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:14,720
I don't know shit about it embarrasses me.

820
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,570
I know anything about Muslims other than,

821
00:51:16,571 --> 00:51:20,090
than they throw down the yoga mat every
day around four o'clock when all the

822
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:24,350
stoners start getting baked, they're
actually talking to their higher power,

823
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,960
which is my hour pi or power.
And it's your higher,

824
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,710
we're all praying to the same
fucking vibe, that same spirit,

825
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,540
you know,
so fucking ridiculous.

826
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,950
And everybody's got to
do it their own way.

827
00:51:37,951 --> 00:51:41,640
Now you've got to fucking tap your elbows
twice before you did it and you didn't

828
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:46,280
do that. So now I'm going to
saw your fucking head off. Yeah.

829
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:51,650
In payable, people still show up and give
it money and put on a silly hat. Right.

830
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,800
Who's getting home?
Anytime I think I'm going to die,

831
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:58,280
I always start praying and I pray to
the God that I was told, you know,

832
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,200
I say a prayer,

833
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,010
I say a prayer every time my plane takes
off and ripped Fort Lance every fucking

834
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:07,880
time, say a prayer that it
doesn't fucking crash. You know?

835
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,740
And when I think about it crashing,

836
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:12,860
I know exactly what I would say
to a higher power. I'm sorry.

837
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,620
Okay.

838
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,860
All right.
And then it'll be like,

839
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:22,160
when I die and I go and get judged
and he's like, sorry for what?

840
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:27,180
And it just fits. You know what your way
Lord Buddha, whatever the hell you are.

841
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:30,210
A just straight as straight
across the board. Sorry

842
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,430
for Dell. Dell. Yeah. All of it.
The whole fucking kitten caboodle,

843
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,600
other than 8% of it, the
other 92%. I'm just sorry.

844
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,810
I knew it was wrong.
I know what I was doing.

845
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,520
I tried to pull myself out of the muck
and I just, I was too weak a person,

846
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,700
you know, which baby that's on you
because you didn't fucking, you know,

847
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,830
you put a four cylinder in me,
you know,

848
00:52:53,831 --> 00:52:58,280
instead of giving me enough fucking
horsepower mentally to pull myself out of

849
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:02,710
the ditch. Yeah. Yeah. Blaming.
You want some way? Get Out.

850
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:05,710
You made me, you know the fuck.
If I made a car and it didn't run,

851
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,930
I'm going to blame the car. Ah,
Dad, do what you gotta do. Whatever.

852
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,830
Sorry. Anyways, back to
this year. Um, he goes,

853
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:18,140
I work 50 to 60 hours a week,

854
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:23,210
feeling burnt while trying
my last side business, uh,

855
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:27,900
with no time but work. I'm about
to realize, fuck it. Don't,

856
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:32,180
don't, don't quit. Do
not quit. He goes, uh,

857
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,440
he's about ready to say,
fuck. It just won't be me.

858
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:38,100
I won't be the guy with the lake house
or a guy who can buy cars with the

859
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:43,101
briefcase of money or a guy with 22
year olds on his arm at 40 all right,

860
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:45,150
now you're scaring me dude.
I thought you would.

861
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:48,510
Just some guy that you know wanting to,
you know,

862
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,440
wanting to invent something and feel
good about himself, but you sound like,

863
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,190
okay,

864
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,470
don't you? Oh you want to move
up in your company? Tell him,

865
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,530
tell him that the end of your
corporate fucking a company.

866
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:01,210
They're just tell him
that that's what you want.

867
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:02,690
Okay.

868
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,740
Just walk in and just say, listen,
this is what I want. A house by a lake.

869
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:11,300
I want to buy vintage cars with a
briefcase full of money that nobody knows

870
00:54:11,301 --> 00:54:14,550
where it came from and I
want some 22 year asshole,

871
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:18,650
22 year old ass on my arm the
whole my whole fucking life.

872
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,150
I just want to keep trading them in.

873
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,200
You know like that guy lived across the
street who got the new corvette every

874
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,820
year cause he worked for Chevy.

875
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,940
Right?
You tell him that shit,

876
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,920
they're going to love it because
they're going to be like,

877
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:34,770
this guy is a fucking sociopath.

878
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:40,410
He doesn't want to find love. He doesn't
want to make the world a better place.

879
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,010
He wants to go out there and get his,
that's great.

880
00:54:45,011 --> 00:54:46,120
He wants a house by a lake.

881
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:48,940
We'll get a house by a lake and we'll
give them the chemicals to dump into it.

882
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,590
That's okay.
You want that house by Lake.

883
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:55,260
You got to take our fucking
waste and dumping in that
Goddamn Lake. All right. No.

884
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:59,350
Yeah. I want you to practice shrugging
your shoulders. Oh, I dunno. I got down.

885
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,260
I want to, we want to see that you're
going to be able to do that. All right.

886
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,830
And if you get caught,
you got to take the fall.

887
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,150
Walk up to that podium over there.
Let me, let me see you just improvise.

888
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:13,810
Taking the fall. We're going to throw
out a couple of scenarios. All right.

889
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,810
Just relax. Yeah, we got, we got a glass
of water up there. You have a drink

890
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:22,510
or generic. Okay. All
right. First scenario. Um,

891
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,330
fucking Sheryl crow somehow gets behind
some can't that figures out that we have

892
00:55:28,331 --> 00:55:32,770
three year olds, uh, making the
pampers down there in Honduras.

893
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:38,050
All right. We need you
to take the fall. Go. Ah,

894
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,860
yeah. Um, okay. Uh,

895
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,250
it's come to our attention
that some of our, uh,

896
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:50,570
practices in the a undergarment infant
under garment industry have come into

897
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:56,010
question. Um, we are looking into it.

898
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,970
I accept full responsibility.
The buck stops with me.

899
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:01,570
Okay.

900
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,400
A Dye.
I'm the head of that division.

901
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,940
I don't like babies. I, I'm
sorry. I don't, I don't know
where to go. I have fuck it.

902
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,260
Fuck you. And you're like,
that isn't good. That was bad.

903
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:16,790
And we could see a sweat from over here.
Go back to your cubicle.

904
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,540
Yeah,

905
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,650
that's like parole. That's like a parole
hearing in a corporate office. You don't,

906
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:25,600
they bring in once every seven years
and they see how good you are lying.

907
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,730
And if you're not fucking good at it,
they send you back to the whole back. Gee,

908
00:56:29,731 --> 00:56:33,700
a cubicle. It's like
reverse Shawshank. Um,

909
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,860
anyways, let's plow ahead here. So this
disguise depressed in the shit out of me.

910
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:42,280
He's given up on his dream and he
wants young bitches on his fucking arm.

911
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:44,140
I don't know what to do with this guy.
He goes,

912
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:47,650
I'm starting to think I need to accept
the corporate grind for the next 35 years

913
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:52,890
or the whole life is going to pass me
by spending all my free time trying to

914
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:54,880
start something.
Your thoughts,

915
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,350
it wouldn't be right unless I n ended
this way. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

916
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,070
All right. I don't think you're that bad
a guy, sir. I'm just fucking with you. Uh,

917
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,710
all right. Don't quit. All right.

918
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,160
Don't quit it. You could.
If you quit on yourself,

919
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:15,440
nobody's going to believe in you. It's
going affect your entire fucking life.

920
00:57:15,441 --> 00:57:18,410
You can't fucking quit ever.

921
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:23,950
You never quit unless you wrong.
You know if you fucking rock,

922
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,080
but then what you do is you just
go in another direction. That's all

923
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,583
right.

924
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,030
Like, let's say you always
wanted to be a singer,

925
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,410
but he's saying like me at some point,

926
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:36,770
you got to have that honest moment and
be like, I have a fucking stick at this.

927
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:38,990
But it, who's to say that you're,
you're not a good producer.

928
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:41,150
You couldn't record singers,
you know,

929
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:45,560
or you couldn't manage singers or you
couldn't go down to the church choir and

930
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:50,450
just lip sync and act like you were
singing, right? I'll get a sex change,

931
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:53,390
right? And turn yourself in
some hot piece of ass and be,

932
00:57:53,391 --> 00:57:57,840
get to the top of the pop charts.
There's always a way,

933
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:02,220
sir. And I'm not saying to get a sex
change. I'm not saying not to get one.

934
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,760
All right?
Just listen to me here.

935
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,960
Just fucking keep. Don't fucking give up
on that shit. That's, you know what it is.

936
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:13,920
That's your passion.

937
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,020
Your passion is what you're doing when
you're not working 50 to 60 hours a week.

938
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,100
All right?

939
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,790
And the reason why this is coming off so
depressing is because your heart is in

940
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,570
that.

941
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:28,230
And this voice is getting louder every
day saying you don't have what it takes

942
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,400
and you need to quit. I'd been there as
a fucking comic. It's the fucking worse.

943
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,210
It hits you, hits you right in the chest.
All right? You got to push through that.

944
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,231
All right.

945
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:41,190
What I do is I come up with new jokes
and I go even harder the next show.

946
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,100
So that's what you gotta do.
You gotta come up with a new Flowbee,

947
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,310
a new George Foreman Grill,
a new fucking iPad.

948
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:51,120
Whatever the hell you're working on,
you got to go even harder, right?

949
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:55,200
And someday you'll have a podcast and
you'll repeat shit nine times in a row and

950
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:56,490
you'll mispronounced stuff,

951
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,213
right?

952
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:02,270
And you'll have a house by a lake.
I don't have a house by a lake,

953
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:07,070
but I had one come through my fucking
rough three months ago. Sorry.

954
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,960
All right, sir. Don't quit. That
will crush me. No one that you quit.

955
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:17,090
There's your halftime speech. Do not ever
fucking give up on yourself. All right.

956
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,630
What I would do if I was
in your fucking situation.

957
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,290
I would quit the corporate job first.
I would,

958
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,450
I would downsize my life.

959
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,040
Okay.

960
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,750
All right. You got to make the
sacrifices. Downsize your fucking life.

961
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,070
Take a job that pays less with less hours.
Live with less.

962
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:40,330
Do you need all those fucking tee shirts?
Do you need all that shit?

963
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:41,660
Yeah.

964
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,930
Do you need a laptop? Do you need
an iPad to do you need a mini iPad?

965
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,890
Do you need every new fucking
cell phone yet? Don't you don't.

966
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:54,050
How many fucking glasses can you
drink out of at once? One baby toe.

967
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,030
If you joined in a Frat,
right?

968
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:01,510
You drink out of one reality is sue.
I'll eat one bowl.

969
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,930
One plate, one fork, one knife,
one spo. You know you could
have all your shit. Yeah,

970
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:10,660
you need a fucking, you need a
bed. You need a to, you need a TV.

971
01:00:10,661 --> 01:00:12,040
You gotta see you gotta stay in touch,
right?

972
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:13,420
Cause you've got to see what's out there.

973
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:16,600
What they're selling for 1995 but other,
other than that,

974
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,993
what do you,
what do you mean

975
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:21,823
nothing?

976
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:27,150
You don't need shit.
So downsides,

977
01:00:27,151 --> 01:00:31,350
you fucking life have a fucking
yard sale, sir. And with that money,

978
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,083
you know,

979
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,540
go by whatever the fuck it is you need
to buy to invent some shits you can get

980
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:40,410
out of there. All right? But by all
means, do not accept this as your faith.

981
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,400
It isn't you just,
you're doing your open mics like I did.

982
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:49,110
And you know what? A lot of people fucking
quit. I don't know what they're doing.

983
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:54,150
Okay, but are they doing standup in a
parking lot in an air condition tent,

984
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:57,120
Rhode Island next month
like I am? No, they are not.

985
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,490
All right. You know what I'm saying? Man,
I hope that that fucking pumped you up.

986
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:07,380
Don't fucking quit or raw that don't
make me sad. You want to make me sad?

987
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,780
You fucking cunt. I don't even know
you and you're making me sad. Stop it.

988
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,600
All right. Smoking problems.
Hey Bill. What's up? Nothing
much. What's up? Yo Dope.

989
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:22,610
Uh, my husband, yes, I'm a lady. Oh, I
love when a woman writes in. Finally,

990
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,770
maybe if I wasn't such a Dick Moore
would write in my husband. Yes,

991
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,770
I'm a lady introduced me to your podcast
last year and we both think you're

992
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,420
awesome. Well that's great. Uh,

993
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:36,260
we've been together for nearly 17 years
and have two young children together.

994
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:40,070
I'm hoping that you can do something
using your unique sense of humor and

995
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:43,990
perspective that I um,
all right.

996
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:49,050
Did I have been unable to do after
years of nagging and that is to try and

997
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:54,040
convince him to quit smoking.
Uh, you know something.

998
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:57,340
I don't consider that naggy.
You're trying to save his fucking life.

999
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:58,800
Okay.

1000
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,610
All right. She says, I know you,

1001
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:04,420
you like to look after your health and
he really respects what you have to say.

1002
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,150
I want them to be healthy,
not just for his own sake,

1003
01:02:07,151 --> 01:02:11,560
but so he's around for a long time for
myself and the kids when we retire in 30

1004
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,394
years or so,

1005
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:17,170
I want us to have health and money to
travel the world and enjoy ourselves after

1006
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:20,040
a lifetime of working.
Okay. Cigarettes are

1007
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,840
incredibly expensive in Australia,

1008
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:25,890
around $20 a pack and are only
set to get more expensive.

1009
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:30,210
This happens costs thousands every
year. Thanks for your help. Bill.

1010
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:34,170
Please never stop doing it. You're doing,
oh, that's nice. You're welcome. Um,

1011
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,420
oh, she says Australia next. Come
to new castle just north of Sydney.

1012
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:43,860
Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, well listen,
if I'm jumping on a 14 hour flight,

1013
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:48,330
you can't come one down, one
fucking city south for me. Listen,

1014
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,690
next year I'm doing Perth to Sydney.
All right.

1015
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:56,990
I guarantee it. Or else I'll go on
youtube and I apologize. Like Paula Dane.

1016
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:01,380
Um, I, I'm sorry that are
never came out to Australia.

1017
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:03,260
Okay.

1018
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:06,310
Uh, all right. You guys sound
like you're pretty young still,

1019
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,030
and that's just the thing. You think
you've got to fucking live forever.

1020
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:14,710
And I'll tell you what I have learned now
that I'm in my forties, unfortunately,

1021
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:19,120
is once you hit 40,
it's no joke. All right?

1022
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,130
When you hit 40, whatever you've,
whatever you've been doing.

1023
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,320
Yeah.

1024
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,710
Since you started being a
knucklehead in your teenage years,

1025
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:33,300
starts to take, not even take
root, it starts to blossom.

1026
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,250
It comes to fruition, if you will. All
right? If you've kept yourself in shape,

1027
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:39,610
okay.

1028
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,100
And any Vieten healthy,
you know,

1029
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:45,280
you go back to your high school reunion
and people tell you how great you look.

1030
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,593
All right.

1031
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:51,130
If you've been eating like a fucking
maniac and smoking and all that type of

1032
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,690
shit in your forties,

1033
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:57,810
unfortunately I've learned the hard
way is when people start to die.

1034
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,800
You know, there's nothing funny about
this shit. Look at, look at, uh,

1035
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,320
uh,
James Gandolfini.

1036
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:08,610
Okay.

1037
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,443
You know,

1038
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:13,860
that fucking guy was doing what I've done,

1039
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,990
but he was just doing it too much.

1040
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:20,590
You don't want we all doing over and
indulging. Everybody does that. I mean,

1041
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:22,780
I shouldn't say this like I fucking know,
but like,

1042
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:24,240
okay,

1043
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,000
you know,
I've lost way too many fucking friends,

1044
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,930
way too many friends in the
business and outside the business.

1045
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:34,440
I'm telling you when,
you know,

1046
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:36,840
and this isn't to tell your
husband to wait till these 40.

1047
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:38,220
Yeah.

1048
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,053
Uh,

1049
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:44,450
basically from what I've read is your
body is designed to go 150 years.

1050
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:49,560
That's how great your body is. And
that's how fucked up the environment is.

1051
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,810
And the amount of shit that
you're going to encounter,

1052
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:56,880
that it has to start counting down to
one 50 just so you can make it to 70 or

1053
01:04:56,881 --> 01:05:00,480
80. All right? And there's
already enough shit,

1054
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,390
enough wear and tear enough crap.

1055
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:09,380
Forget about all the manmade radiation,
fucking radio waves and all this shit.

1056
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,950
What the fuck we're putting in our food?

1057
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:13,980
There's already enough shit out there
that can get you and you're just,

1058
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:19,180
you're basically, you're in the fast lane
and you're gonna die. You are basically,

1059
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,850
you're going to die or you're
going to have fucking emphysema.

1060
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,090
This is what got me to never fucking
smoke. When I was in fifth grade,

1061
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:27,310
this guy came to the school and he said,

1062
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:30,550
if you want to know what it's like to
have emphysema, he goes, make a fist.

1063
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,500
So you make a fist and you,

1064
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:33,843
oh shit.

1065
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,090
What did I just do there?
Huh?

1066
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,760
Yeah.

1067
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,380
I turned down the fucking volume. Sorry
about that. I just stepped on my mixer.

1068
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:47,700
Um, he basically said, he
said, make a fist. All right,

1069
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,970
this is hilarious. This is
what you're, tell your husband.

1070
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:55,710
Just say and this just say,
hey honey, do me a favor.

1071
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:59,130
Make it like you're going to
mind like you're sucking a dick.

1072
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:03,680
Yeah,

1073
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,430
that's what you do.

1074
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,710
You know what's funny is the amount of
people who are in cubicles right now

1075
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:09,080
looking over their shoulder because
they want to see the emphysema thing.

1076
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:13,130
Bring it right up to your mouth. Now that
I did the Dick thing, every guy stopped.

1077
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,830
But they'll do it when they're
home alone tonight. You know,

1078
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:18,300
they'll turn up the TV and bring
down the curtains and we'll try.

1079
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:20,780
Basically you try to
breathe into your fist,

1080
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,190
try to draw it in through your mouth,
through your fist.

1081
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:28,820
That's according to this guy what it was
like to have emphysema and that's which

1082
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,070
that's what you're headed towards.
I don't know if you guys have a daughter.

1083
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:32,521
I mean what if,

1084
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,460
what if you're not around to make sure
she doesn't marry some Douche bag?

1085
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,080
What if the guy is a dick?

1086
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,130
But you're so frail at that fucking point
cause you can't do a pull up anymore

1087
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:45,270
and you got that little fucking wheelie
walker thing and you're coming in with

1088
01:06:45,271 --> 01:06:47,760
the oxygen tank and the
shit up you fucking nose.

1089
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:48,860
Okay.

1090
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,770
You know,
I'm telling you all of that shit.

1091
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,820
People start getting those a gin blossoms
on their nose right around 40 all of

1092
01:06:57,951 --> 01:07:00,320
it, all of it. Fucking comes,

1093
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:04,400
comes to a head at 40 but if
you take care of yourself,

1094
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,790
if you keep yourself in shape in your
twenties and your thirties and that type

1095
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,510
of thing, it it, it,

1096
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,520
it pays off fucking 10 fold and
considering you have kids, man, you, you,

1097
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:17,190
you, you, you owe it to them,
you owe it to them. All right?

1098
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,060
Jesus wasn't this just sort
of a feel good podcast.

1099
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:22,670
You'd think I'd be more of
a concept and my team lost.

1100
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:24,520
Yeah.

1101
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,400
All right. I got one more read here and
then I'm going to close out the podcast,

1102
01:07:28,401 --> 01:07:32,540
a stamps.com everybody

so many seconds on this earth.

1105

Why would you want to spend any more
