1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,150
Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird.

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:06,360
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,300
January 29th, 2018 what's going on? Our y?

4
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:16,950
Yeah. Um, all right.
Well this was a board,

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:21,090
this would have been a boring
Sunday because there was, you know,

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:26,020
there's no football, right? They got
a, you got the week off in between the,

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,180
between the Super Bowl and
the championship games.
They had the pro bowl today,

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,610
which was kind of cool. Look like
football in the future where they would,

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,850
you know, they'd start to tackle somebody
and they're like, all right. All right.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,570
All right. All right. All right. You know,

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't know if that's the
concussion thing or the me too.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,090
I don't know what it is.
He does not want you touching him.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,410
Do not throw him to the ground.

14
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:47,920
I have a special guest to
liven up my Sunday there. Uh,

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,680
uh, Jesus sue one and only two
I'd rigs for Christ's sake.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,910
Todd,

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,180
you are one of my favorite fucking people
in this business and you are one of my

18
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,850
favorite comedians. So is all
Azure. Do the appeal. The,

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,350
the feeling is mutual vendor or you don't
have to compliment me on this one of

20
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:08,340
my idols. Dude, you are. You
are the silliest fucking dude.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,010
You make me feel mature. That's what
I like about you, Todd. Rex, okay.

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,600
Yes. Todd Rex who checks off a lot
of boxes in this day of caring.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,760
That's right. You do. I don't
even know what that means.

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,740
I don't know what it means either.
I'm just trying to be progressive.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,480
You would think that somebody would come
his fucking way and finally tapped a

26
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,930
magic wand on his head and make
something happen and say, Todd,

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,980
you've been destroying it at least
three times as hard as 10 times of the

28
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:37,920
fucking order or whatever. The math
is all the fucking comics out there.

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,030
I love working with you, but I hate
following you. He was a fucking murderer.

30
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:43,740
Finally,
this fucking asshole.

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,780
He got himself a special that he's taping
and it needs some people to come down

32
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,920
and then you can,
you know,

33
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:54,720
go on and I can open for you can make me
sweat a little there. No, no, not at all.

34
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:59,460
Right. He's going to be at the
satellite theater in silver lake.

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,540
Uh,

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,770
the satellite la.com for tickets.
That's all right.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,900
Uh, February 11th, uh, you're going
to be doing the show. It's a Sunday,

38
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,150
but usually come out Dave, which
support the all right. Sunday,

39
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,470
which is a week after,
uh, the Superbowl. Right.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,910
So everybody knows that was seven
30 and nine 32 shows, two shows,

41
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,820
two shows to show. So you're going
to go out there. You fucking,

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,520
you knocked the first one out
eagle. All right, I got it.

43
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,160
And then the next one you just go
off Cruze. Is that what you do?

44
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,970
What you do yours? He like dude, be
button of the first ones tightened up.

45
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:36,790
And then I spend the whole night trying
to forget that I'm taping one real and

46
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,740
stop trying to think like,
oh my God, I missed that tag.

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,000
Fuck. That needed to be
documented in the comedy universe.

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,750
I just try to look at it
like, all right, this is just,

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,210
I'm just documenting where my hour was
on this night and this is how it came up.

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,240
And I want you to do that because
every night when you go up there,

51
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,560
I don't know about you but I
mean I'm constantly fucking up.

52
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:04,561
Jokes are constantly leaving shit out
and then it adds to something else and I

53
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,940
never think of it.
Never think about it.

54
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,210
Like I never thought to get you a glass
of water before you sat here for fucking

55
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:14,290
hours. What an idiot. I'm going to have
to hit pause here in a minute. But um,

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,870
that's just how uh,

57
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,010
I had to do it that way just because
I want him to think about your,

58
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,420
I wanted to ask you about your thought
process cause I was curious. Um,

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,090
like I know that the night before
I'm going to be a wreck, you know,

60
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:30,850
just thinking about it and all the
funny guys, worry hacks, don't worry.

61
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,570
Acts are already fucking working
on their next hacky hour. Yeah.

62
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,490
They not even fucking nervous to just,

63
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,250
and they'll go off stage with this
shitty material and be like, dude,

64
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,180
I fucking crushed, crushed in every
funny guys. Like who is it? Good did,

65
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,110
it was terrible. I do
that every, every time.

66
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,670
I just really in a round about way
compliment to myself, I know him. Um, I,

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,700
you know, I got a waste to go. People
like, I don't know. She used to,

68
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:56,350
you're one of them. Did
Beasts. Um, yeah, so I, I uh,

69
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,330
someone told me,
I think Louis C k told me,

70
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,190
and I think you've heard this from
fucking bill Cosby. How funny is that? Uh,

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,410
you heard that, uh, you worked
this hard to get there. Um,

72
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,930
uh, don't forget to have fun, right?
So make sure, yeah. Cause if you don't,

73
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,940
haven't fun, that's going to be, you're
going to feel better about it afterwards.

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,220
If you have someone who
nitpicks at himself,

75
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,600
there's no way you're going to be happy
at the end of it. So just be forgiving.

76
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,070
Just be the fucking silly
fucking hilarious guy you
while you'll be fine. Yeah.

77
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm not really too worried about it,

78
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,210
but I just want to make sure
that I already can tell you,
worry about it. You see,

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,830
you seem tighter than usual cheese will.
I'm doing your podcast.

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,140
It's kind of a big deal for me too.
I feel like it didn't the whole thing.

81
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,370
Now that you've peeked behind the curtain,

82
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:43,910
it's just me with a fucking
$99 mixer from good test ana.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,050
We're sitting here on the counseling,
Ernie and Bert,

84
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,960
the all I did to prepare for you as I
turned on the AC and I squirted some

85
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,030
breeze. That's it. I know everybody
has these fancy fucking studios.

86
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,440
I just did a, I did your mom's house, uh,

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,150
with a Thompson girl and
Christina presents key.

88
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,790
I just did theirs and they
have this whole fucking studio.

89
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,350
Rogan has like literally like a
stern level studio. She's and um,

90
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,800
I should step it up at some point. Yeah,
it was, her house was dope. I don't know.

91
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,990
No one can see it. But your
house is dope. Oh, thank you.

92
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,400
It wasn't when I bought it,

93
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,310
but now that I've dumped all this money
into it and I could never get my money

94
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,830
back. Yeah, this is pretty good. I I,

95
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:30,670
this house was like almost a
hundred years old when I got it.

96
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,700
Almost 90 years old, I should say. Cool.
People live in here before though, right?

97
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,691
Uh,
yeah.

98
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:37,270
I don't want to talk about that though
because then people will fucking figure

99
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,104
out where I live.

100
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,770
I already have to fucking edit out
one of the comments you made earlier.

101
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,110
That will fuck.
Do people have fucking lunatics?

102
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,630
And that's what I'll tell you later.

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,410
It was just enough of something to make
some psycho just turn around and faces

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,400
speaker and start writing down
information. But I'm a paranoid dude. Um,

105
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,900
yeah. Anyways. Um, what
was I talking about?

106
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,310
What the fuck are we just talking about?
My add? I don't know. I have no idea.

107
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,650
You've been watching any hockey.
Did you see my Sean's elbow not to.

108
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,740
I was a thing of beauty. It was a thing.
It was so, it was perfect. Filthy. He,

109
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,520
he's, he got to trip. I know Eddie,

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,620
he's the size of Barney rubble,
so nobody paid.

111
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,490
He's not going to get called out like
all foods. Probably one of the worst.

112
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,730
But dude, he was, and I loved Marshawn
and I love the fucking Bruins,

113
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:29,840
but I love him. Come on. He's, but the
thing is, I don't like that aspect,

114
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:33,350
like doing that shit.
Did you see when a man destroy them?

115
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,060
Oh Dude, my God. Ah, that
was a brutal hit. Oh,

116
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,780
I thought he had like internal
bleeding after that cause he kept,

117
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,630
he kept skating but he kept skating.
Yeah. And he was just going like,

118
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,040
it seemed like beyond
the wit.

119
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,620
The thing about PK and,
well,

120
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,570
I'm so glad he placed her Nashville
not from Montreal anymore. It was,

121
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,280
he just as best as he used to.

122
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,290
He used to get us all the time and
everybody knew that was his move.

123
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
And I don't know why no one could see,

124
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:06,080
just knew exactly when your head was
down for a second. It was two crossovers.

125
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,190
He was inside and then all of a sudden
he was just in front of you. Right.

126
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,310
And he just ended your fucking life
for like, I dunno, like two shifts,

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,380
but um, yeah, I'm, I'm, uh, I always
liked that guy. I never take it to the,

128
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,460
to the point if there's a guy on a
team that I don't like, you know,

129
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:25,340
like when Derek Jeter played
for the Yankees, I couldn't,

130
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,750
I couldn't get myself to, to get to
the point of like actually hating them.

131
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,660
It's like the guy is great. Right? It
is good. Yeah. All you're saying is,

132
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,400
I wish this guy was on my team.

133
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,740
You have to watch some hockey watching
my son play hockey. He was a beast.

134
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,530
Of course. I know you
showed me all the, uh,

135
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,760
the video of them and he like picked it
up in to see who's like playing drums or

136
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:50,300
something. Right. They also play the drums
too and he plays drums. Any place hawk,

137
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,850
he chooses the kid's gonna be crushing it.

138
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,370
Would it get more legs than I am?

139
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,080
You're going to be a fucking grandfather
by the time this special comes out.

140
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,980
Jeez. Where you've been
working to uh, adjust. Uh,

141
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,540
I just flew back today from Phoenix. I
was with Craig Craig Robinson, you know,

142
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,880
been totally anthem for like a couple
of years now when he's not shooting

143
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:15,770
television shows, which is all the
fucking time that got works. Um,

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,960
so yeah. Uh, where were you guys working?

145
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,440
We were working at standup live in
Phoenix. Oh, okay. I know that place.

146
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,460
Five sold out shows. It was
fantastic. Had a ball. I did the uh,

147
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,520
you know what's fucking, that's fucking
nuts as far as like that downtown area,

148
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,550
how lively it is if there's
something going on. But the second,

149
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:35,390
the workday ends like during the week if
you're there like at five o'clock. Yeah.

150
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:39,740
It's fucking creepy. If the sons
don't have a game, it's over.

151
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,040
Yeah. I love it though. I mean, I
couldn't live there, I don't think,

152
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,290
but I have a really good time there.
Um,

153
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,740
I had a good time traveling with
you though when we went down south.

154
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,430
I was just like reading some comments
about the key, give me the keys.

155
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,370
Just give us the keys. Oh yeah, yeah. That
lady, I thought about that the other day.

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,330
We went to check in that hotel and
that lady was just fucking with the

157
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,040
instructions are, Jim is on the fourth
floor. It's open from nine to nine.

158
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,600
We, it's a continental breakfast,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

159
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,000
And I'm sitting there going like, oh
my God, how long is this going to take?

160
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:14,560
And she's in the middle of to go.
Did you just choose the key?

161
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,020
She got like offended.
She was bad for real

162
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,320
dude. I fucking was laughing
like I was in high school, man,

163
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,110
it was one of those labs.
So I was just like, oh.

164
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,600
Cause what it was was the fact
that she didn't find it funny.

165
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,690
It was already hilarious, but the
fact that she didn't find it funny,

166
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,880
it hurt her feelings.
She didn't have to deal with it.

167
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:38,850
And then she got mad all in
like fucking like half a second.

168
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,820
Then I felt like I was in class
again where it's like, oh my God,

169
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,950
don't start fucking laughing.
Or you're gonna,

170
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,920
you're gonna get like the tension or
something. Yeah. You also took me to that.

171
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,210
That fucking, uh, was at that
barbecue place to something.

172
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,070
Oh yeah.
What does it call it was it,

173
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,290
don't say the name of it
cause it was terrible.

174
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,530
Well what the first ones we went through,
then we went to the,

175
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,620
when we went to that,

176
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,600
we went to that one where it was a
giant fucking place and they had like 40

177
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:07,500
fried murder chickens that you can see.
You don't remember that place?

178
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,470
It was gigantic. You know all my God,
this place is fucking unbelievable.

179
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,333
That the place where you ate.

180
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,600
And then we went to the Nascar track and
then you were like TRX wishing you had

181
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:16,840
a salad.
Oh

182
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,840
was that in a Charlotte?
That was Charlotte. Okay.

183
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:28,130
And we did the Nascar experience.
That was very cool though.

184
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,250
So let's talk about crossing it.

185
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,950
That dude who was driving us
around is 20 years old named Dylan.

186
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,210
I know anyways as much as a jockey because
he doesn't want to slow the car down.

187
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:38,910
I couldn't believe what like what a piece
of shit or race car it looks like when

188
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:41,160
you walk up to it.
I've seen formula one cars up close.

189
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,000
They look like absolute like it looks
like if you stepped on it the whole thing

190
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,620
would fall apart cause all it is,
it's just,

191
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,490
it's just an engine suspension and
tires and everything else is just the

192
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,380
lightest. Did you see the uh, the, the
gas pedal, we shouldn't have like a stick.

193
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,980
It was like a bent coat hanger.
It's like real,

194
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,920
it would have like if you had
like that just the floor thing,

195
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,800
whatever that the pedal is
to rest your foot on it,

196
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,440
we'll be able to have that in there.

197
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,720
That's the difference between you like
guess winning the race or a coming in

198
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:13,290
like third row because that fucking thing
sitting there with a piece of rubber

199
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,124
that's in the way

200
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,070
that race that actually there um,
NASCAR is not doing well it's not,

201
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,780
the numbers are down. No. When I
went to the Daytona 500, they'd,

202
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:28,230
they'd painted the seats
like every other seat.

203
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,690
Like they had like three colors and they
would paint them the big it look like

204
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,180
this people in the season. Yeah.
Well, cameras flying by and you know,

205
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,050
used to have it like that
was the Minnesota north
stars used to have seats like

206
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:39,810
that and I thought it was cool and now
I'm thinking well maybe cause nobody

207
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:43,410
showed up for the game and maybe
that's why they moved to Dallas.

208
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,950
So when I hear all those Minnesota North
Star fans still complaining that their

209
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:47,784
team left,

210
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,630
I mean if there was people that well
there was people there I wouldn't have

211
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,120
noticed. Right, right,
exactly. You would've been able

212
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,840
to see the season.
I don't even know how to skate.

213
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,850
None thousand lakes say you
watching either football, was that,

214
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,430
do you watch any of the football?
I haven't been,

215
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,670
I haven't Washington the football,

216
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,820
the only thing that I like of the
Washington Redskins and they're terrible

217
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:09,990
number one on the street from Baltimore
hosts. How'd you become a Redskins fan?

218
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,640
On and off from silver spring,
Maryland,

219
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:14,010
right over the DC line and let
people are thinking bout, okay,

220
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,110
but you know I had grass and it
shouldn't my yard and two cars.

221
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,130
Both parents or I'm not saying that
that's not available at Baltimore.

222
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,030
What people think of the wire and the
corner when they think about Baltimore.

223
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,020
But that's not where I lived.

224
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,040
That's why,
cause that's where I met you.

225
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,240
I met yet the Baltimore Improv
with that fucking debt long.

226
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:36,790
He had walked down like that
three quarters of a mile hallway,

227
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,250
the last mile or whatever. Yeah. That
was the worst location ever for a,

228
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:46,420
uh, for a, for a fucking
comedy club when he club there,

229
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,270
I was all thrilled they'd let me come
down there and they asked me if I wanted

230
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:52,210
to close out the Sunday one time because
somebody canceled and that was all

231
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,380
fucking excited. And I drove there from
New York City to do it and I was like,

232
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm going to get in with the Improv.

233
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:03,030
And I showed up and there was like 10
people there and the owner talk was

234
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,390
talking to the broker,

235
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:09,160
never talked to me and then
walked out while I was on stage.

236
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,910
And I remember being on stage.

237
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,230
I think I knew when I was on stage cause
I was kind of glancing over like, okay,

238
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:18,340
well it's, that works at
Sonic Burger. Um, man,

239
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,710
it was deaf.
It's really fucking annoying.

240
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,970
I don't know why anybody who ran a club,
why the fuck you would ever do that?

241
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,240
Because you don't know who's coming
down. Right. And for all you know,

242
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,750
they're going to go on, you know, and,
and do something. The fact that she would,

243
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,870
I was driving down from me,
he didn't even say thanks.

244
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Classic fucking club managers, the
fat, big 50 inch fucking waste,

245
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,620
you know what I mean? But those
slacks, that giant fucking belt,

246
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,590
well, the Gaberdine, whatever
they're called. What are those flags?

247
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:50,420
Call action slacks.

248
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,460
Yeah, the action slacks. He uh, yeah,

249
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,020
I ran into a number of those fucking
people. That's my big thing though.

250
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:58,730
This should I, do you
know what? I'm turning 50.

251
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,770
Are you really turned it five zero
to 49 in May. You do all right.

252
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:04,604
They're young stuff.

253
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,000
You want to know what the next year
you life's going to be like? I, uh,

254
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,630
hopefully it's going to be
something like yours. No. Well,

255
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:15,950
I've decided that I'm going
to, uh, I'm going to fucking

256
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,840
get myself that. Like, rather
than looking at 50 would dread,

257
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,120
which I'm really not
considering it. I, you know,

258
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:26,980
so many of my friends and fucking died
then even make itself. I was, you know,

259
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,730
they'll record it in DC. Don't tell
me he died. I swear to God. No,

260
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,820
we didn't see did it last weekend.
Last Linda, he fucking died.

261
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,973
What?

262
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,950
Um,
there was like some Carter cardiac event.

263
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:43,250
What are those friends was like coming
from Connecticut going down to Florida.

264
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,470
Hadn't seen Joe in like 15 years.

265
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:48,570
Stopped by his house and they were
going to go to the Improv to watch, uh,

266
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,420
Lavelle Crawford and Joe said he had
a headache and one upstairs or take

267
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:53,610
something like aspirin or whatever it was.

268
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:56,790
I sat on the bed and like laid back
and crows while his buddy was there.

269
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,140
That he hadn't seen it.
15 years.

270
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,290
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?

271
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,820
Oh my to that guy had one of my favorite
fucking jokes were about the current

272
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,020
food.
No,

273
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,640
the jokey did when he was having
unprotected sex with a woman.

274
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,170
And you know, he goes, I'm doing my thing
and I'm doing my thing. She goes, Joe,

275
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,450
don't you come and me,
don't you come and meet y'all job.

276
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,580
Goddamn you don't come at me. And
he goes, I blocks all that out.

277
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,110
Yeah.

278
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,480
Zola's hilarious.
I haven't seen him in fucking,

279
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
I haven't seen him in like 15 years.

280
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,500
There's going to be a GS.

281
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,610
Ah,
fuck

282
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,570
yeah. What we're getting at that age where
people are just dying. And I was like,

283
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,060
you know what's really fucked
up is I know you want to do.

284
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,170
Since the time that I don't, it's not
even like shocking to me anymore. Yeah.

285
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,960
I mean like what I hear now,
I used to be like, oh my God.

286
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,960
But I was at my son's hockey game when
someone called me and he was like, Yo,

287
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,090
Joe record died. I was like, you serious?
And he's like, yeah, I want to know how.

288
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,550
And he's like, I don't know.
I'll find out. And I was
like, all right, call me back.

289
00:15:57,551 --> 00:16:01,540
I'm on my son's hockey game.
Well have years ago,

290
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,890
I know what it is,
is the first wave that goes is,

291
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,980
it's usually a be bad genetics,

292
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,200
bad luck or bad diet.

293
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,940
And then after that it's like if you
had half a bad diet, half bad genetics,

294
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,080
just literally like when the
grim reaper is going to get you.

295
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,460
So speaking of that, becoming
a dad at this point, like
I was fucking old as I am.

296
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,630
I got it. You know, I've cut back
on the booze and, and uh, so I'm,

297
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,680
I'm trying to get myself
down to my fucking, uh,

298
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,020
to my fight and wait and actually maybe
get a personally you look fit. Yeah. I, I,

299
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,540
I,

300
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,540
I took four months off of booze and then
for the last month I've been drinking

301
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,220
like lightly,
but I dunno,

302
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,460
I think I'm just too old now because I
took those fucking four months off and

303
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,110
now going back to it, just, I get to,

304
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,000
and then I drink too and I'm just
like bagged up the next day. Um, so,

305
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,690
I dunno, I think I'm going to go,
I was joking that I'm going to go,

306
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm going to be like staying in my 50
just to like fucking pilates and yoga and

307
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,220
tantric sex.
Try to learn how to come for 40 minutes.

308
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,300
That's how a lot of his music is.
His recorded blood.

309
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,070
People don't know that when a,

310
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,230
it's actually him coming in the
beginning of a synchronicity. Is that it?

311
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,070
Whoa.
Whoa.

312
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,890
That's him. That's him. Record them.

313
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,410
And I recorded my favorite
corner bag and his wife. Right.

314
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:33,580
For the first 40 minutes.

315
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,610
Then the last five minutes he just
sings this song and right as he comes,

316
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:37,444
that's the,
okay.

317
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,020
Yeah.

318
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,970
Gordon Gordon. So Gordon
Commoner there, Jeez.

319
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,570
I saw him at a, I saw him at the Hollywood
bowl with Elma, said Gaylord Perry.

320
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,430
It's a WHO's the guy from genesis that
sank? Sledgehammer. Peter Gabriel.

321
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,650
They're real. Yes. Yeah, they both were
fucking awesome. And they had like an,

322
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,270
I was like, all right, who's
gonna? Who's gonna open,

323
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,920
who's going to fucking clothes?
And they just,

324
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,980
one would sing a song and then the next
one come out and sing a song and then

325
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:07,800
they would just bolt out there and if
there was the other person saw and they

326
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,870
would just sync back up.
Oh yeah,

327
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,560
that's still Peter Gabriel had like
synchronized dance moves and shit.

328
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:17,100
It was fucking Vin and then they were bad.
But that was part of the joke.

329
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,750
But you just see was he
didn't give a fuck late.

330
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,950
It was like two guys like daughter plays
with them too sometimes. Is that right?

331
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,590
There's like the violin and she
comes out and crosses on the violin.

332
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,780
I'm trying to remember
if he had a violinist.

333
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,900
I just know that he was just like
the guy just aged and said fuck it.

334
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,890
Or I was staying was you know,
still in shape and shit.

335
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:37,680
So pdf data look terrible now dude.

336
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:40,350
He came out looking like that headline
headliner that didn't make it.

337
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:41,730
It just doesn't give a fuck anymore.

338
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,080
Comes out with like wearing like the
same sweat suit he was wearing when you

339
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:49,770
pick them up at the airport, just
walks on stage. Maybe you put a hat on.

340
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,940
He had to be at a but big ones that you on

341
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,810
staying always has one of those fucking
those clothes that looks like he's going

342
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:00,660
to do a,

343
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,650
what was that movie he did with the Tina
Turner where she shaved the side of her

344
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:07,420
head. Oh, my Thunderdome. Thunderdome.

345
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,950
I feel like he got a bunch of clothes
from that movie that still fit them right.

346
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:14,670
He still has the trailer, the
wardrobe trailer, all that Mesh,

347
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:19,110
Spiderman looking shit,
flashy underwear peeking out of the back.

348
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,690
Shane Shane Mill cert.
Well, I saw those guys.

349
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:28,880
They fucking, they absolutely killed
it here. I've got to make sure what,

350
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,740
20 minutes. Then at some point I do have
to read a little bit advertising, but um,

351
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,570
through who's just fucking Internet
provider ATNT mine is just,

352
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,090
it's just not happening for me here.
I think I might,

353
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:42,130
I don't even know who I have.
Nia handles that and it's,

354
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,740
it's just been on the Fritz. I gotta
drive on the, Fritz has been on the Fritz.

355
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:50,850
I've got to drive over to
Starbucks, buy something, stomachs.

356
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,970
I don't drink coffee. All right. I mean I,

357
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:56,880
I guess stick the coffee has to be amazing
line strong as it is it because you

358
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:59,730
don't need to be cafe.
Oh, I know. I don't know.

359
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,080
Worse wired is all I'm the worst dude.
I, I need like the reverse of that.

360
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,290
But you go into all of that food,
just socks,

361
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,650
all of their food just fucking
sucks. All right, let me,

362
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,880
let me read a little advertising
here. Um, how much, how much,

363
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,990
how much time are you going to do when
you special? I'm doing an hour. Hour.

364
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,600
That's it. Do you know, maybe a
little longer so we can cut it down.

365
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,370
All do as little as I would do like
whatever you, you want it to be.

366
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,220
I would only do a little bit
more than that. Yeah. Cause yeah,

367
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:32,730
it makes your life so much easier for you.
If you want to do an hour special,

368
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,230
dueling an hour and 10 or then usually
just lift a bit or to the same guys that

369
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:41,090
are uh, shooting want special shot
on the Evans special. That is, uh,

370
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,660
they said that, uh, the owner,

371
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:47,040
they're like an hour and 20 minutes and
that they wanted to cut it down to an,

372
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,630
because showtime wasn't buying an hour,
20 minute specials.

373
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,470
They were just buying our semester. Then
you've got to start killing your babies.

374
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,400
That's the worst.

375
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,510
But he refused to cut it and so
they just took it as an hour and 20.

376
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,260
So if you watched the special, this
on right now is on showtime right now.

377
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,370
It's an hour and 20 minutes.

378
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,130
Jesus on yams telling the business
which way it's going. Wow. Call this.

379
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,580
I would have been like, all right, I'll
cut it down. All right. Oh look, all zip.

380
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,910
Talk about the challenge of
finding great talent. Well,

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,621

for students right out of the fetus.

451
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,380
I was not in gay male shape when I
got him, so I did not look good. I'm,

452
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:36,950
while I'm trying to get it in as good
as shape as those fell is down there.

453
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,930
But uh,
who used to have the pit like that?

454
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:41,390
I want to get in shape now
I want to get engage shape

455
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,910
cause I had a buddy of mine,

456
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,940
all he does is he just loses like fucking
10 pounds and then he just sorta push

457
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,150
us down his shirt, go and do it. I
looked good. You know, you're like pat,

458
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:54,860
you stomach. I think. I think I'm looking.
All right. Um, do you and your wife,

459
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:58,640
do you guys, uh, do you guys,
uh, four kids? Of course we do.

Do Two guys, you guys celebrate
Valentine's Day? Is there at this point,

461
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,940
how long have you guys been
together? Since 95. That's great man.

462
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,550
You 23 years,

463
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,080
but it took me till 2004 to tie the knot.
Oh yeah.

464
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,280
Would it make sure she was the one so many
years? Is that like 10 years ago, man?

465
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,870
Wait, 2001 2004 2004.
So that's a nine years.

466
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:29,140
Oh by all right. It took
me what it was, dude,

467
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,290
it took me nine years to really
the fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Stupid.

468
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,610
I knew in nine months, but I was
just like, I don't know. Right.

469
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,780
And then also my wife was a little bit
of a commitment phobe we're both like

470
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:45,040
commitment phobes yet totally
relationship people. So it totally worked.

471
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,650
You know what I mean?
Right. So He'd lived there,

472
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:50,290
her whole sid and Nancy fucking lifestyle
for a while, you know, not married,

473
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:53,290
no kids party.
And had a great time.

474
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,810
We did that for a while when
it hit all the water parks,

475
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,940
the matching t shirts. Oh
yeah. Matching me undies.

476
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,810
It took me forever to propose to her,
but I tell you why it, why it happened.

477
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:09,540
I went to a party with friends of mine
one night and I ended up spending an ad

478
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:14,130
out in Virginia and I was on my way
back the next day, like 10:00 AM. Uh,

479
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,500
my wife was furious.
She was my girlfriend at the time.

480
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,110
We were living together and she
was furious and she called me.

481
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:21,600
She already left me a message and I
checked the message and then she called me

482
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:25,560
again when we were driving home. And so
when I picked up the phone and say, Hey,

483
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,520
I was just was out here thinking with
my friends. The reason I was like,

484
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,020
I'm out here with my friends
and spending the night.

485
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:32,820
It's like I was talking
to a man, I think, uh,

486
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,560
I think I'm ready to
settle down in Mariya.

487
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,380
Wow.
Was she that you had to come up with that?

488
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,490
She know that she better because, well,
she will now when she listens to this.

489
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:47,930
No Way, dude, I want to get you
in trouble. So what did she do?

490
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,430
Was that she was like really

491
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,070
good. I did want to have a fight when I
got home for, for spending the night out.

492
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:59,670
So yeah. So that defused the
whole like fight those coming up

493
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,160
and set you up for another thousand
more in the next year there.

494
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,860
Um,
I,

495
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,040
I just want to fuck did I do
and I finally just realized,

496
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,850
uh,
I just knew she was gonna leave

497
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,790
it Sundays off the pot. No, it was
some days when I was mad at her.

498
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,560
I would fantasize about breaking up,

499
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:25,560
but even in the fantasy of her
breaking up when she would walk out,

500
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,200
even in the fantasy of that, I would
still go, no, no, no, no, no, no.

501
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,120
It sounds like all right. I got
to make, oh yeah, that's, that's,

502
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,260
that was the,
Paul Versey helped me get through that.

503
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:42,000
Paul Versey has actually helped a
number of comedians get over that.

504
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,080
Like, uh, that's, that's thing, you
know, you think it's a mountainous,

505
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:49,480
you just stepping up on the
curb, which just like, dude,
where are you going? Right?

506
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,840
What do you do? You know,
she's going to be so happy.

507
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,350
You're going to be happy once you get
through the fucking vows and all of that

508
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:58,500
bullshit. Then you just said a party with
all your friends and is fucking great.

509
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:03,450
He was, he was 100% 100%
fucking right. So, um,

510
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,380
I was gonna ask you,

511
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:07,480
do you guys go out on Valentine's
Day and now we don't really sell it?

512
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,170
[inaudible] I'm going to chocolates
and I'm like that or carbs, you know,

513
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:13,800
we might, you know, we have the kids,
so a lot of the times we're just a,

514
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,830
we'll wait till the kids go to sleep
and then we'll have a bottle of wine and

515
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,980
watch a movie or something downstairs.
Some corny like that. That's way better.

516
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,250
We're going out and go out to
dinner. Like, dude, we're so old now.

517
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,160
Sometimes it feels like a,
we want to go out and have a good time.

518
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,040
So we're gonna like we're gonna go out
to dinner and then go into Hollywood and

519
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,680
get some drinks and maybe go to a dance
club or whatever that by the time we're

520
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:34,360
done eating dinner late, do
you want us to go home? Uh,

521
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,550
and it's a how to you when
the other person says that
there's this like, yes, yes,

522
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:42,060
I do. Just want to go, I don't want to
go to Hollywood right now. Yeah. Like I,

523
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,060
I for years would rather drink at home.
I got better stuff here.

524
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:47,200
Then they got out at the bar.

525
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:50,510
They always have some shit stuff and
another rape you or the praise also. Yeah.

526
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,180
And once you're with the person
you're going to be with that,

527
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,750
they got the worst booze. I'm not
interested in meeting anybody. Right.

528
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,280
So all I'm going to do is go out there
and then I got to deal with like,

529
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,220
how am I getting fucking
home? This is before like Uber
and all that Shit. I been,

530
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,510
I been drinking at home the for,
for years or something.

531
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,970
He was like, yeah, we have what?

532
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,850
Bourbon or I have bourbon,
whiskey, Tequila. Yeah.

533
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:19,360
There's really smokey I think whiskey,
one time I was here,

534
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,990
that was probably a scotch. Scotch.
Yeah, it was good. Yeah, it was good. Oh,

535
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,160
did we smoke cigars? Uh Oh no, no,

536
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,590
I don't think we did because
that's how I was thinking.

537
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,870
My daughter just had her first
birthday and I was looking at,

538
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:35,260
at the house that do that, we had
like 16 kids over here. Really all,

539
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:37,210
I have friends who had kids and that,
cause you know, once you have a kid,

540
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,980
all your friends who don't have kids,

541
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:43,090
it's just like they keep live in their
rock star life and you're like, you just,

542
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,410
you get like six more calls like I, and
to watch the kid. And he did. He just,

543
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:50,470
he just fade out and started, you
know, they start disappearing. Horizon,

544
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,120
you just fade out.
Uh,

545
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,330
like that band member who's on
the first album and he was like,

546
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,680
whatever fucking happen that
can, and then they, you know,

547
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,390
they never see that guy until like the VH
one behind the music. He's just so, oh,

548
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,170
I am. I even know it.
Putting out a second album.

549
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,290
They just didn't have a call me and all
of a sudden I was just like, all right,

550
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,920
get some out. Um, yeah.

551
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:14,380
So I was looking around the
living room and we had like,

552
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,530
like 16 little kids and their ages.
The forward encounter it.

553
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,490
Yeah. And just like toys Galore,
just shit all over the place.

554
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:26,800
And I was just looking,
thinking like, you know,

555
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,450
18 months ago this would
have been five of my friends.

556
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,020
We would have been getting shit faced
watching the game and smoking cigars and

557
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:38,500
just how, like how much it changes
in a good way. Like we went to the,

558
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,560
went to the park today for the
first time I went over, I put,

559
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,460
I put her on the swing and
shit. She loved it. Oh yes.

560
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,580
Squeeze mentally greatest clex was a video
of that man because I know it goes by

561
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:51,670
so fast and you'll look back at those
pictures with a tear in your eye. Oh,

562
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:52,690
I know. No, I'm already doing it.

563
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,830
I'm already like this a part
of me that's like uh, uh,

564
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,560
as psyched as I am to be a dad there,

565
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:02,410
there was a mild depression with
her turning one row going like, ah,

566
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:04,690
she's not a baby anymore man.
She's a tod of next year.

567
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:08,320
She turns to her age have doubled
in a year. Yeah. She's all,

568
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:11,350
but I see why people keep having babies
cause you just want to keep hitting

569
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:13,690
reset. Right. Cause
it's so fucking awesome.

570
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:18,691
And I like talking in a positive way
about it because when my wife got pregnant

571
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:21,670
just so many people said all this
negative shit and like all dual,

572
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,090
you know boys league. It's over for you.
Yeah. No more getting low cause he blood.

573
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,260
No, we'll going to Thailand
seeing what's up over there.

574
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,630
Like I'll this degenerate shit.
And I was just like, yeah,

575
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:37,480
this is way better than
that shit though. Yes, no.

576
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:39,690
Today we were over there
and I was just like, uh,

577
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,520
I was having the best time and I, you
know, it was, yeah, it was quite good.

578
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:49,140
Clean Fun is actually getting a
little bit of exercise, um, clean.

579
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,220
And she kind of took her first
step in the park, which was cool.

580
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,360
And uh,
so yeah.

581
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,190
So now have you figured out what the
motivation tactic was to get it going

582
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:01,050
through it? I see. I'll tell you
what's fucked up though, was Imani,

583
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,730
that is the definition of organic in
the deaf in the dictionary versus the

584
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:08,100
definition of organic
within the food industry.

585
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,990
Like they literally changed it
like with law, what organic means.

586
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:13,891
Cause I know when,

587
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:18,810
when we're given her like poison shit
cause she's fucking so excited to eat it.

588
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:23,340
Like no, no, no, no, no.

589
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:26,580
The shit that they call it organic, but
it's really got like fucking this, like,

590
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,390
like they try to get you addicted to it,
like cigarettes,

591
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,130
the same fucking thing.

592
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:37,131
So we had these little puffs
that said organic on them and uh,

593
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,970
I just noticed that like,

594
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:42,000
we would have like really good food and
she would start pointing at the yellow

595
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,400
ones, like a lab rat. And
then one time I went to reach,

596
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:48,360
just reached for the can and she
started like hopping up like, yeah man,

597
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,570
give me a hit. So yeah. So,
um, yeah, we phased those out.

598
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,650
I'm actually, that's not true. We
have, we have one more can down,

599
00:33:58,651 --> 00:34:02,070
so we're going to wean her off
and then, you know, she's a kid,

600
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:05,220
so like she doesn't see it. She's not
going to be thinking of them. But, um, I,

601
00:34:05,221 --> 00:34:09,810
that's the thing that's, uh, that
can also drive you nuts is uh,

602
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,770
that type of shit.

603
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:15,771
And then if you have any sort of a
friend with a kid in your life that is

604
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:20,100
totally up on all these issues, and
then they just, they just come to you.

605
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,000
It's like a fucking,

606
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,350
it's like this cloud of
fear that they just dump on.

607
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,740
You go to this website,
you have to fucking,

608
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,580
but we have friends like that, or at least
a couple in, they're fucking annoying.

609
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,310
And it's like,
and even though our kid likes their kid,

610
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,400
we have to like cut them back a little
bit. I'm like, my daughter was like, well,

611
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:41,220
what did she coming over? And I'm like,
if the kid comes over that's fine,

612
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:42,930
but I can't have the parents
come over here to like,

613
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,310
did you get your kids vaccinated?

614
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,480
How do you handle that?

615
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,580
Because that's what I realize now is
that you can have like you can be friends

616
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:51,300
with people,

617
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,570
like a couple of you and your wife are
friends with a couple and then all of a

618
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:55,170
sudden,

619
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,050
and they have kids but you don't have
kids so you're not dealing with them on

620
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,640
that level.
But then when you have a kid,

621
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,090
the relationship changes now you not
only do you guys have to like get along

622
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:07,740
socially when you go out, you know, you
both vibe, you got to kind of on site,

623
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,790
they gotta be within your wheel house
of how they raised their fucking kid.

624
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,430
And if the kid comes over
and he's a fucking lunatic,

625
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,480
like brighten the dog and shit, like
going to what? What is this caveman?

626
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,150
You got to kind of be like,
I don't want my kid acting like that.

627
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,740
Right. No, we have a,

628
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,850
I'm not saying any names cause I don't
want to alienate any people that might be

629
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:26,451
listening to this,

630
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:31,440
but we have one family who has a kid
that's just fucking rude and I can't have

631
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,580
it and I just, I cannot stand. But my,

632
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,530
my kid wants this kid to come over
and always like, Jesus Christ,

633
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,460
should we let just fucking kid come over
and then like maybe they changed over

634
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:45,070
the last six months and they come spend
the night and it's a fucking nightmare.

635
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,630
What are the rules

636
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,290
if a kid comes over and he's rude,

637
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,440
like what can you say
now to a fucking kid?

638
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,290
Did I started just getting serious with
all I do. Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

639
00:35:57,291 --> 00:36:01,800
So fucking waking up every 10 minutes
and calling for your mommy and then I'm

640
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:05,710

don't call my mom. No, no, no,

641

I don't call him say fuck no, no,

642
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:10,930

one more time. I'm not talking to him.

645
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:20,660
You've got to talk to him cause
I'm gonna Start Getting Mad.

646
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,560
Do you remember back in the day, like if
your friend's Dad said anything you will

647
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:32,020

Oh shit, this motherfucker
serious and it needs to come down.

649
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,490

660
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:18,480
I sleep in all morning and then come down
to the kids who were my wife and I are,

661

667
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,850
Oh I would love to hear a kid

668
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,910
my mother would just be, well that's
all there is. I guess. You know,

669
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,870
I'll talk to you at lunch.

670
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,150
My wife's,
the boss says,

671
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,170
I guess he'll just be hungry then
cause that's what we're having.

672
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,770
And if you're in, if you don't either,
just going to be hungry. It's amazing.

673
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,190
I would like,

674
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,560
some of these kids are rude to sit and
you say something to the parents were

675
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:56,910
like, yeah, she's a little
crazy. She's like, no,

676
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,220
now that's, that's like when people have
a dog that's fucking nuts. Like I did,

677
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:05,540
but I, I quarantine the thing when people
would come over except one time I got a

678
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,190
little confident and watch to me the dog.

679
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:11,100
Whisperers and then my friend had
getting bit j law had got bit by my dog,

680
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,260
bit him on his calf GIM a nip.
Um,

681
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,440
yeah, that dog scared the living shit
out of me. One time we were downstairs,

682
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,940
she was in a cage. Oh yeah. That
doesn't notice. He was a nerd.

683
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,850
I was like walking past,

684
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,780
not the case with the battle of the cage
will scare the fucking piss out of the

685
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,430
whole point.
God cage of the Darby shredded right now.

686
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,460
Yeah. She was a, an adorable hell hound.

687
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,940
She loved the hell out of me and
about six people and everybody else.

688
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:41,800
She treated as a fucking intruder.
And, uh, I would just, you know,

689
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,580
it was the smartest, most painful, uh,

690
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,260
decision I ever made, but I didn't
understand, uh, that I was still going,

691
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:54,170
like I saw, you know, the last two
days in a row, she's in town. Uh,

692
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,340
it's good that you keep it, like you've
kind of still take care of her in a way,

693
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:00,620
right? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah,
definitely. It's kind of like,

694
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,930
and I get pictures of her
all the time and when,

695
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,270
like once every two months she'll
come to town and I just take for,

696
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:11,320
for a hike every single day like this.
You remember your legs the opposite way?

697
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:14,950
She did. And she does. She
does. And, uh, if, when I,

698
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,850
when I go out to where the guy lives,
if I show up, she's kind of look,

699
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:20,470
cause she's not used to seeing me down.
You know,

700
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,420
first they see the shape
and it's the smell,

701
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:25,990
like the whole way the dog
brainworks or whatever. And then, um,

702
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,400
then, you know, then she's all
back to normal and everything.
But I gotta tell you,

703
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,520
I was nervous meeting her
because of the way she was,

704
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:36,220
because I knew at that point she had
bonded with the new person and it might

705
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:40,620
view me as like a threat. I mean
the dog was like, dude, that dog it,

706
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,960
my buddy said that there, uh, as
cleo forsee yeah. Verse he goes to,

707
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:47,530
this should be a 30 for 30 on that dog,
that dog's life.

708
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,140
Like how it was abandoned by the La River.
I mean,

709
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,740
so many times this thing should
have just been like, you know,

710
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:55,150
like whenever the Olympics come around,

711
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:58,210
they always have like those crazy stories
that make you tear up all the shit

712
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:01,360
that they went through.
Like he could do that. Yeah.

713
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,350
And Dyke as a pitbull be in that
big of a pain in the ass like that,

714
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,000
those things, if those things sneeze, they
get put down, it's fucking terrible. But,

715
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,770
um, the fact that she's still
like living this awesome life, uh,

716
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,520
makes me feel good. And every time I see
her, like, um, you know, the dude of God,

717
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:21,760
it was my former trainer.
So, uh, and he, he just like,

718
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,330
she has her first dog friend now.
Every dog, she tried to murder.

719
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,680
Now she's like friends with the dog,

720
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:31,030
but like they needed like his
level talent, like as he says,

721
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:33,360
jokingly said, yeah, I've,
I've been slow cooking her.

722
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,680
She's not someone that you
like, okay, this is how it is.

723
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:39,790
And then boom to that and it's just
been this year long thing that she's now

724
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,110
finally ready to just end.
Even when he started hanging,

725
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,840
she started hanging out with another dog.

726
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,650
There was this whole fucking process
that he had to go through and,

727
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,740
and totally keep an eye on my dog because
my dog does this shit where like when

728
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:56,500
she's going to attack, she's in
the cage. Wow. She did that shit,

729
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,550
but she was out in the open. Um, she just
made the decision. There was no ground.

730
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,000
There was no warnings going wrong.
She just did it. She just, she had,

731
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:06,340
she would just fucking do it.

732
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,530
Let me read 'em let me read some of
the questions here. All right. Um,

733
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,680
taught by the way, you're gonna you're
kind of fucking, I can already tell, Dude,

734
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,620
you're already wound up about this thing.
You're going to fucking murder dude.

735
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,893
Thank you.

736
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,870
I'm excited about it. I really am. Yeah.
I feel like this is like, you know,

737
00:41:21,871 --> 00:41:24,390
I've been doing this shit for so
long and I'm at the age right now.

738
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:26,220
Like if it doesn't fucking
pop for me right now,

739
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:27,150
it's not going to fucking happen.

740
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,800
Nah, that's, that's the old dude.
That's the old way of thinking.

741
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,440
You're totally in control,
right?

742
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,250
I do this business like it's a giant mall.
Okay.

743
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:41,420
And I have my little store in the
mall and you walk into my store, hey,

744
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,770
how you doing? I tell jokes, I
do a podcast kind of cartoon.

745
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,570
See anything you like. That's what I'm
selling. If you don't fucking like it,

746
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:55,520
I get it. See you later. But when I
first got into this business, I would,

747
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,240
you know, it's like you're
walking around the mall. Oh,

748
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,800
we've to this selling shirts. I
got to sell shirts. Oh Fuck Day.

749
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,200
They get sneakers I got to be doing.

750
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:05,390
You try to like do whatever with
the Joneses. Yeah. Fuck that too.

751
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:08,450
Just the way your cartoon is fucking
Hilarious, man. Oh, thank you.

752
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:11,450
Frank Murphy and a and vicar.
My two very guys. Oh yeah.

753
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,820
You went to the UAE to see you wait for
the third season where we're editing,

754
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,440
editing like feeds.
It's going to be out later on this year.

755
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:21,470
I'm not allowed to say exactly when,
I don't have an exact date either,

756
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:23,690
but like Netflix has like,
you know,

757
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:27,410
they don't like the fucking geniuses
of this new thing as they, they,

758
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,080
I remember the last time
like, well last time, uh,

759
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,940
when I had a special coming out there,

760
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:35,900
they wanted me to come in to meet
with them to like talk about,

761
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:38,840
discuss promoting it. And
I'm thinking like, what the
fuck are we going to discus?

762
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:41,150
Throw up a couple of billboards.
I'll talk about my podcast, do it.

763
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:44,090
I went in there,
it was like bill Belicheck shit.

764
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,520
I can't even, I can't even explain
it. Like I went in there going like,

765
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:53,630
this is ridiculous that this is just an
idiot like me with a bunch of Dick Jokes.

766
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,710
And then I just,
I,

767
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,890
I watched them breaking down to how
they were going about promoting it.

768
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,450
Like two people who are watching Netflix
and they're fucking algorithm and all

769
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:07,610
of that shit judged by what
you watched and all that shit.

770
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,420
Not saying it's a perfect
system. It, it blew my mind.

771
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,540
Fucking blew my mind.
They didn't know it doesn't do,

772
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,750
there's a reason why they're
global right now. Uh,

773
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,640
and it's not from hanging out with me
then. Alright. A peach cobbler recipe.

774
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,970
Hey Billy crust king. I like to bake by
the way. Really? Yeah. I mean my daughter,

775
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,420
he told me that before I made
my daughter a birthday cake.

776
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:30,860
I'm doing that every year of a life.

777
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,100
Are you doing the non GMO with the no
gluten than non tasty for Austin? Oh No.

778
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,190
There was a bunch of sugar and fucking
cell phone talk yet. Baby seals in it.

779
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,720
That's a big politically incorrect
cake. Um, all right, dear Billy,

780
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,720
Chris King, I'm invited to a
Superbowl party. By the way,

781
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,340
you know the Patriots are
in it again this year.

782
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,330
Do you realize if Tom Brady w
gets another ring? Jesus Christ,

783
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,530
him and Bill Belicheck we'll have more
rings than every franchise in the NFL

784
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:03,500
except for the Pittsburgh
Steelers. There'll be tied. Wow.

785
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,990
And then their entire 50 years,

786
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,030
50 something years of every
franchise trying to win one.

787
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:12,140
Did Brady doesn't lose
though, just letting you know
that, right? No. Uh, yeah,

788
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:14,330
he does. He loves twice to the giants.
I think this is going to be it.

789
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:17,300
Just give him the rig. No, no, no, no, no.

790
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,460
That talk makes me nervous
through the eagles.

791
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,530
The Eagles got gotta fucking horrific,

792
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,340
horrifically terrifying
fucking running game. And uh,

793
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,820
nick folds is not a backup quarterback
that as a starting quarterback who lost

794
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:32,400
his fucking job and he's coming
back like a fucking revenge movie.

795
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,340
Did Defense looks,
looks fucking great.

796
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,380
And I don't think we would have done
to the vikings what they did. So, yeah,

797
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,200
I dunno.
I would say take the,

798
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:44,730
just trying to be humbled at
how to keep the gods happy.

799
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,350
Take the eagles and the
points. That's what, that's
what I would do with my money.

800
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,750
I'm not doing it. I Edelman's
out Gronk out a concussion. Um,

801
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,380
m and Dola had the game of his
fucking life. Did you hear that song?

802
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:02,570
The amygdala song? It's like
that song, Lola. Real. Oh Dude.

803
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:06,270
It's fucking Dijo la though.

804
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,940
Now they're playing nick fold
in the Super Bowl. That's fine.

805
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,180
It may not show or, all
right. Hey, Billy, Chris King.

806
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:19,440
I'm invited to a Superbowl party.
Don't worry.

807
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:23,280
Just dude's and nobody interested
in commercials or halftime shows.

808
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:27,660
Thank God and I am the
designated dessert maker. Uh,

809
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:31,050
you were talking about peach
cobbler on a Monday morning podcast,

810
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:34,470
but I can't quite remember if it was
a recent one or an old one. Anyway,

811
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:38,220
would you mind sharing your recipe with
me? Because I want to have the real deal.

812
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,580
I'm from Germany and can't figure
out if the recipes I find here.

813
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,150
Any good hope to hear from
you and go fuck yourself.

814
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,180
I just googled and looked at pictures
and then I found one that looked good was

815
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:54,870
this, this is what I
would say. I would say,

816
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,700
uh, I would say if the cinnamon, nutmeg,

817
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,670
whatever they tell you to fucking put in,

818
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:07,110
add more because they'll always be
like an eighth of a teaspoon a court.

819
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,430
They're going to make it taste good,

820
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:11,400
but they're not going to make it
taste great. So definitely be tasting.

821
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,130
You're filling that.
Don't be afraid to get a little,

822
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:17,640
a little heavy handed with some of the
spices, especially the cinnamon sugar.

823
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,200
A little bit of some butter in there.

824
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,640
And then I give it a little Dustin
before I closed the Pi of the Oh yeah,

825
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,170
you gotta it's gotta be a big
fucking delicious gooey mess. Um,

826
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,450
that's how I do it, dude. Everything's
gonna be all fucking baking.

827
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:35,130
I'm trying to get you all right.
Political relationship advice. Oh God.

828
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,530
Here we go. All right, let
me, I want to hear this one.

829
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,950
I literally unfollow people on Twitter
if all they do is talk politics,

830
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,420
unless you rationally kind of trash
on both sides. But like, you know,

831
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,950
if it's going to be like, you
know, so, uh, Trump just did this.

832
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,390
It's just say, all right. I will tell
you that. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean,

833
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:59,130
trauma slotted, Conan, Conan O'Brien and
the funniest fucking joke about Trump.

834
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:01,400
They go, how do you, uh,
Andall the whole Trump says,

835
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,870
what's the hardest part about the
Trump situation right now? He goes,

836
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,100
he goes trying to write a joke that's more
absurd than what's actually happening.

837
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,920
I like OEM Twitter,

838
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,140
like Trump on Twitter just is,

839
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,650
it's just considered normal now that
like a president has the time to,

840
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:22,800
I don't even like people
shit on me all the time.

841
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,830
I don't even get back to them watching
the quote leader of the free world or

842
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,110
just so, you know, that
wasn't a stain on my tie.

843
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,770
That was actually a presidential
seal there. All right.

844
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,470
Political relationship advice.
Hey Billy Willy Concoct,

845
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,060
I dunno what that means.
That's an, you know,

846
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,580
one with a little bit
of alliteration to pair.

847
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,550
Love the podcast and of
course the standup. Thank you.

848
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:51,250
You're the only comic that actually
makes me bust out laughing. Well,

849
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,690
I'll wait till you see Todd special.

850
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,730
So I'm a 21 year old guy and I've been
seeing this girl now for about nine

851
00:47:57,731 --> 00:48:00,610
months. She's great. Treats
me good, loyal, and is pretty,

852
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,380
all of these relationship things.
They,

853
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:05,680
we start off like a horror movie where
that was all sunshine and everything.

854
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:09,220
I'm 21 prime of my life, I think a
darker ship. Everything's going great.

855
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:09,880
All right.

856
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,710
The main problem I have though
is she is a big democrat.

857
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,480
Big Democratic

858
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,640
problem is she's a big democratic
and he's a super conservative.

859
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:26,650
Uh, she's black and I'm almost
as white as you. Oh God.

860
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:28,330
This is like a fucking bad porno.

861
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,320
She gets upset when I post
political stuff on Facebook,

862
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,870
like pro a pro video of Trump,

863
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,500
but yet she posts all this stuff about
kneeling for flags and Obama is all that,

864
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,610
uh, yeah, dude, this, this relationship's
not going to fucking less. Uh,

865
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,310
she wouldn't even talk to me when I wore
a Trump shirt. Oh my God. Yeah. It's like,

866
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:51,990
dude,
like this,

867
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:56,990
this is a guy who like sort of saw how
the Nazis were baited into running over

868
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:01,240
somebody with a car going, well,
you know, this hatred on both sides.

869
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:07,060
Um, dude, I really wanted to side
with you, but you know, this is,

870
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:12,061
this is like astoundingly fucking like
I respect the fact that you like Trump

871
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:14,980
and all of that shit.
You want to wear his tee shirts,

872
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:19,390
but your confusion that she gets
upset is a little fucking weird.

873
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,800
Pisses me off.

874
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:24,070
But I don't want to ruin the whole
relationship over something as dumb as

875
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:25,660
politics that's too late.

876
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:29,290
So since you are already in an
interracial relationship and for,

877
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,330
and for a lot longer than me,
period. What's your advice?

878
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:38,560
Question Mark?
The lovely mia.

879
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:41,350
It's Nia with an end.
Um,

880
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:46,270
can tell me her 2 cents as well, even
though she'll just side with the chick.

881
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,810
Just kidding. Thanks. And is
always go fuck yourself. Ps,

882
00:49:49,811 --> 00:49:52,690
Tom Brady's the greatest
of all time. Uh, sir. Um,

883
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:58,960
I gotta be honest with you, like, if you
don't understand why she is upset, um,

884
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,970
you'd have to try to put yourself in
her position and then read some of this

885
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:08,170
shit in some of his opinions,
I guess would be the best way to do it.

886
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,880
But I'm like,

887
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,810
you're not just a conservative if
you'll be like rocking the t shirt,

888
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:18,850
like you're all in. You know what
I mean? Like a bunch of words.

889
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,650
Girlfriend hates when I wear my
swastika tee shirt. Yeah. Not Nicki.

890
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,950
Do you think that's, it's
that bad? I mean, he has, he
hasn't run like, I mean, no,

891
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,540
I mean, no. Is he like, is
he like a Trump Hitler light?

892
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,350
What kind of booze would hit

893
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,930
was that at least gotta be like Moonshine.

894
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,870
So where's Trump Jaeger?

895
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,713
Jaeger bomb.

896
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,950
That's shitty. Bourbon going Schlog. Yeah,

897
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:55,940
he's like God, Lulu flakes instead of
gold flakes. Yeah. Johnny Walker red.

898
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,820
And there's, there's no,
there's no, yeah, there's no,

899
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:03,170
and uh,
I have a soft rake to fucking mix with it.

900
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,610
What's the worst when you were broken?
So what's the worst period of ahead?

901
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,590
Yeah,
college age.

902
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:11,960
Uh,

903
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Milwaukee's best now worn that or natty
Boh national Bohemian was pretty damn

904
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:17,850
bed.

905
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:18,001
Oh,

906
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:23,001
you know what I always hated was
fucking a Bush light Bush light,

907
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:28,140
which I think Bush itself was just,
yeah, that was just like, yeah,

908
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:31,960
it was like water and then they wanted
that town. We used to east, I never,

909
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:32,221
you know,

910
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:37,221
something I never got into Pabst blue
ribbon because I resented the hipsters

911
00:51:37,441 --> 00:51:41,220
that we're drinking them because it used
to be this blue collar beer that all

912
00:51:41,221 --> 00:51:43,020
these fucking townies drank.

913
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,240
And then all these hipster people
wearing their a flannel shirts. Well,

914
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:50,800
you know those shirts for a while when
they were wearing like the gas station

915
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:52,680
shirt that had somebody else's name on it,

916
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,430
where they actually had to do the fucking
job and they funded some thrift shop.

917
00:51:56,431 --> 00:51:59,820
Like my fantasy was that they ran
into the guy who owned the shirt.

918
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,340
They just walked up like, Hey,
I'm Jim, you know, as much. Oh,

919
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:08,050
I just feel ah, needed to shirt and then
he gets the shit kicked out of them.

920
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:12,870
But most of my fantasies are
violent. Um, my advice is,

921
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:16,190
uh, to, I dunno,

922
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:21,630
get a bunch of empathy. Uh, I don't know.
I don't, I don't see this thing working.

923
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,760
I just don't see it working. That's
going to be like the kids you guys are,

924
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:30,180
so if you're that far
away from each other,

925
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,860
you're not going to get
married and have kids.

926
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,990
Yeah. That's like you'd be fighting over
them politically too. Like, so what?

927
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,150
They're going to be Democrats or
conservatives when they grow up.

928
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,340
So that's a whole nother can of worms.

929
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,630
Yeah.
So enjoy banging her and uh,

930
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,920
I wasn't bossy lets you, while she likes
you and then I would fucking, yeah,

931
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,160
I would just be like, yeah, but
he's also 21. He doesn't know.

932
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:57,000
He genuinely seems like he doesn't
understand unless that was just, you know,

933
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:59,850
sometimes people just lie and they
write and crazy shit. All right.

934
00:52:59,851 --> 00:53:03,180
Girlfriend drinks too much. Uh, dear bill,

935
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,460
I was hoping you get to help me out
with a problem I've been having.

936
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:07,710
I've been living with my
girlfriend for almost a year now.

937
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,670
We are in our mid to late twenties,
just for some background.

938
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,560
Everything's going great
except for one thing,

939
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:16,350
we worked regular nine to five type jobs,

940
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,050
which means most of the fun
we have is on the weekend.

941
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,560
And like most people we tend to lube up
on the liquor while we're out and about

942
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,760
or even just stay in and, well I don't
think anything wrong with drinking.

943
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,570
My girlfriend doesn't know her limits.
Often. She will drink way too much,

944
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,720
too early and ended up passing out or
throwing up though commonly both will

945
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:41,100
occur. Wow. Yeah. She doesn't know how to
drink. You got to pace yourself out there.

946
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:43,110
A few examples,
uh,

947
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,020
she will insist on watching a
movie after we've had a few drinks.

948
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,510
We finally decide,
uh,

949
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,750
we'll put it on and then after
15 minutes she passes out.

950
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,830
Then I'll have to stop because of
course I can't watch it without her.

951
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,670
Yeah. Well the teacher lesson
watched the whole movie and be like,

952
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,030
you missed a great one and
in the end the Butler did it.

953
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:07,760
It's a lay off the booze cause I'm going
to start fucking doing that to you. Um,

954
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,341
number two,

955
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:12,270
we went to a hockey game a few weeks
ago and when we got to the arena,

956
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:16,620
she ordered me a beer and
herself to double gin and tonics.

957
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,360
Oh my God, she has a problem. We had
already had a couple before arriving.

958
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,800
She then proceeded to down both of them
and 10 minutes before the puck drop and

959
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:29,340
passed out soon after
at a hockey game by God.

960
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,020
That's the fucking problem.

961
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,850
I had to drag her up to stand for the
anthem and again when they were honoring

962
00:54:35,851 --> 00:54:40,230
the troops. This is fucking, this
is like a Kristen Wiig character.

963
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,960
Uh,
she then left for the washroom.

964
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,710
That's been one of my favorite scenes
though when she gets fucking wasted on the

965
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:50,430
plane and bridesmaids and she just,
when she goes, man, the fuck is,

966
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:54,990
and as he's walking out, uh, I
see then left for the washroom,

967
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,140
but came back with two more doubled gins,

968
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,850
a hotdog and a bag of popcorn,
which she spilled and blamed it on me.

969
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:08,280
Oh my God. That sounds like a episode
of intervention. Even if I did do it,

970
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:12,300
the first thing you're going to
do as snitch on me. All right.

971
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:15,600
That just took a left turn.
Uh, get the fuck outta here.

972
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:19,470
What's supposed to be a team,
but I digress. Sorry for
the rent. Uh, last weekend.

973
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:24,780
My God, these are all like bullet pointed.
By the way, in the Uber ride home,

974
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:29,670
she per preached, she proceeded to
whip out her tit to try and seduce me.

975
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,360
I told her to put it away because she
was in no condition and I didn't want to

976
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:38,190
fuck up my Uber rating
passes out. Wait what?

977
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:39,730
The passenger gets an Uber rainy

978
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,380
pass was getting ready to for the driver
that might have actually boosted is

979
00:55:45,381 --> 00:55:48,100
ready. If the driver will look back
and saw as little sloppy today,

980
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,470
we fucking gin and tonic on
it. Uh, anyways, I'm going
to fuck up my Uber. A pet,

981
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,820
she passes out 30 seconds later in pukes
in the elevator on the way up to the

982
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:02,250
apartment.
It didn't make it a lot.

983
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,250
It didn't make a lot of a mess as she
was able to hold it back before I got her

984
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:11,190
to the toilet. Oh my. This guys just
truncate the piece de resistance.

985
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,290
Uh, she passed out during the bill
burrs show at the Sony Center. Uh,

986
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:20,540
how do you pass out for that create man
who just came in to entertain us? Uh,

987
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:25,020
just a pre face.
I had an allergic reaction that was toast.

988
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,650
Had a little bit of weed before the
show and I was able to be fully alert.

989
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,320
But yet you are the one that's
falling asleep. Jesus Christ.

990
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:37,410
This is like the fucking war and peace.
This is like Barfly,

991
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,540
uh, saying all this. However, I have
to admit that I'm no saint either.

992
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:46,710
I arguably drank much more than I or
liquid drink, much more than she does,

993
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:49,350
but I hold my boobs a
little better than she does.

994
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,450
I probably made her sound
worse than she actually is. He,

995
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,410
you get to take it all away, down,
raring to go back a little. Now.

996
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,120
You already been going to
look like a drunken mess.

997
00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:01,080
Yeah, but in truth, she's a wonderful
girlfriend who cooks with Matt for me.

998
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,680
Leads to me is very beautiful.

999
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:07,790
Well in fucking live happily ever after,
which he's got three seats.

1000
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,430
She's that puking on the
sheets and as you can tell,

1001
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:16,790
is willing to come to a
hockey game with me. And yes,

1002
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:19,400
she did buy me bill bird
tickets for my birthday.

1003
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:22,740
She's a truly amazing person and
I planned to marry or someday,

1004
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,480
but this is just getting out of
hand and I want my weekends back.

1005
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,380
Can you do me a favor and turn that
light on my fucking eyes or a shot here?

1006
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,750
The Sun's going down here. I'm not trying
to have a romantic podcast with you. Um,

1007
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,720
uh, let's see here. I've had conversations
with her before and when she,

1008
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,470
she's sober, she gets it, but it
doesn't stop her when she's drunk.

1009
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,890
And she would get angry at me when I tell
her she's had enough and I can't stop

1010
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:51,590
her from sneaking off to get
secret drinks with my money.

1011
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,920
She feels bad and I honestly
feel guilty writing this.

1012
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:57,080
You and she is truly amazing.

1013
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,470
I feel like he wrote the first half and
then she walked into the room and is

1014
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:03,230
looking over his shoulder.
Um,

1015
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,910
but it's tough not only for me,
but I know this is not easy on her,

1016
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:10,940
but some to her body sometimes as well.

1017
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,270
I just wanted her to be all right and
for us to be able to have a good healthy

1018
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:16,220
time.
I'm not quite sure what to do here.

1019
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,410
Am I right to tell her that
she's got to take it easy,

1020
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,390
particularly when we go out because
it seems to be working the way,

1021
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:26,180
have to set a better example and
drink less, if at all. Yeah. I mean,

1022
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:29,750
if she's a fucking booze
hound, maybe, uh, maybe both.

1023
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,480
Maybe it both try to, uh,
drink a little bit less.

1024
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:38,330
She might be one of those people,
you know, where once she has a kid,

1025
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:40,880
she'll just fucking knock
all that shit off. Or

1026
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:41,731
Oh God,

1027
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:44,670
I could just drive around
with those completely where
she's a state has hammered

1028
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:45,504
all the time.

1029
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,180
Yeah. You'll have a drunken
baby, you know, coming out,

1030
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:52,960
fucking stop emailing and Bill
Byrd started emailing, drew Pinsky

1031
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,300
kid comes out dressed like foster,

1032
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,490
um,
use it to do a fucking,

1033
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,010
I love positive Brooks run the city
limits drunk comedian. Oh yeah.

1034
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,470
It was fucking hilarious.
Yes.

1035
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,440
And he uh, and he never
really drank. Yeah.

1036
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,430
The way I know

1037
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:24,170
he had it down to like to that that's
back when like being an alcoholic was

1038
00:59:24,221 --> 00:59:25,054
like,
funny,

1039
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,500
this is how much I have to be careful
though is talking about all that drinking

1040
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,130
made me want to drink.
Like I love it. I fucking,

1041
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:36,650
I hate how it makes me feel though
now. So I kind of, I just lay off it.

1042
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,130
That would,

1043
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,390
Craig Craig Robinson didn't drink for
a year and then we just had drinks and

1044
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,040
Arizona this past weekend. We felt like
trashed both mornings that we drink.

1045
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:49,580
Oh yeah. And so he was like,
yeah, I thought I was back
after taking a year off.

1046
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:52,910
I thought I was back when I'm a good old
drinking I think. And I was like, yeah,

1047
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:54,810
man, I don't feel good either.
I had a headache every day.

1048
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,820
It's an age thing, like it's
really, it's a young person
thing. Like it, it, it like,

1049
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,110
but we had fun. We were down to
like, we would do those shows,

1050
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:07,370
those theater shows and we would go to
like the cigar bars have a drink with

1051
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:08,204
cigars.

1052
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I still
like, I think what I'm, I,
my drinking maybe we'll be,

1053
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:15,690
is like a,
this year when I go on the road,

1054
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:19,410
I think like if I go off for three days,
like that Middle Day,

1055
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,490
not the first night, because I traveled
and not the, not the night before,

1056
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:27,960
I have to go to the airport, but just
that middle one, finding a good place.

1057
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:32,310
Um, I dunno that, that might be the, uh,

1058
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,700
that might be the way I'll do, do you
know what I went to last night? Oh my God,

1059
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,350
I went to this fucking,
this eighties, like, uh,

1060
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:44,480
all these bands, this crazy
fucking lineup was, or the,

1061
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:49,050
the real bells was attribute Viv?
No, it was like two, two was,

1062
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,170
uh, what was it? Uh,

1063
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,710
like drama Rama and with them?
Holy Shit.

1064
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:59,940
I think I can remember the song they
said, flock of seagulls, the Romantics,

1065
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:03,030
they were all really their tone.
Loke oh my God.

1066
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:08,090
Fucking the violent femmes Melly Mel
and the furious five for his file.

1067
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:13,360
Uh, and boy George closed. No
way, dude. It was fucking, it was,

1068
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:17,790
there was this, this was at,
uh, the Microsoft theater,
which used to be the Nokia.

1069
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:22,630
Me and Neil went down there and, um, I,

1070
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,910
it was fucking awesome,

1071
01:01:23,911 --> 01:01:28,911
but I learned a lot about show business
watching those p you could tell like who

1072
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:35,460
is sick of singing their hits and who was
also like, fuck this, I'm bringing it.

1073
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:40,650
And then I also learned, you
know, watching, you know,

1074
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,420
he got to take care of yourself.

1075
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,470
I have a story about that
because I swear to God, Dude,

1076
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:50,100
if you see a band that let themselves go,

1077
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:55,310
it's like depressing like us because
you love them and they look like shit.

1078
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,500
And then all you're thinking,
it's like, oh my God, I'm all,

1079
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:02,850
I'm fucking 20 years older than he
was when he put that song out. A fuck.

1080
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:03,930
We're all gonna die.

1081
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,220
But when you just see a band come out
and they kept themselves in shape and the

1082
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:12,240
fucking killing it as much as they
older, it's, it's like, uh, like,

1083
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:16,080
I'm not gonna name names, but I, I saw
one band that made me think like, dude,

1084
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:19,020
I'm never drinking again.
And then I saw when I,

1085
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,880
the violent femmes like,
dude,

1086
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:26,480
they just came out and we're
just a fucking tight sick aspen.

1087
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,360
Like I watched them, I was like, man, I
want to go play drums. I want to practice.

1088
01:02:29,361 --> 01:02:30,200
I want to get better.

1089
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:35,410
Like there was nothing like negative
about watching the big just came out and

1090
01:02:36,951 --> 01:02:41,320
find, they flew, they went on up to
uh, uh, uh, Melly Mel and, and uh,

1091
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,670
through his first five who fucking killed.

1092
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,340
And you couldn't be more
of a different band.

1093
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,340
Polar opposites like literally
at the stage would just turn

1094
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:52,580
oh yeah, that's bad. As I did that,
the I heart radio music festival thing,

1095
01:02:52,581 --> 01:02:55,460
they have like the bandwidth,
the stages of rotate one 80,

1096
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,000
and then they'd have the band and then
they'd do the set dressing behind and

1097
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:00,350
then it would keep turning.

1098
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:05,500
I this, I loved it. I loved it.
They get like a down in Anaheim,

1099
01:03:05,501 --> 01:03:08,590
they had it and like salt and pepper was
on in a couple of people do is fucking

1100
01:03:08,591 --> 01:03:08,801
nuts.

1101
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:13,210
It was you just knocked out like 10 of
the bands that I should have seen back

1102
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:16,720
then. And uh, you know, they all
sounded great though. It was just,

1103
01:03:16,721 --> 01:03:17,680
well I'll tell you off.

1104
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:22,120
It was just one person that I looked
at and it was just like my God,

1105
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,940
but he was still singing great.
But it's just like, fuck dude.

1106
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:29,500
So we saw cameo like six months ago.
Uh,

1107
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:34,610
I can't remember what it was like by
the water somewhere here in La and Roger

1108
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:39,030
Troutman. I remember Roger Blackmun,
wasn't it? Yeah. What songs does he say?

1109
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:44,220
Um, she's on a brick.
Oh yeah, house. Okay.

1110
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,800
Uh, all those dude, he can't, you know,

1111
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:50,040
cause he used to come out and like
leather chaps and a cup, you know,

1112
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,810
it's like the coke spoon around his neck
to do it. He's still doing this. Like he,

1113
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,450
he out with the belly. Oh,
not bad. Hips and knees.

1114
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,810
And he's still wearing a company.

1115
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:04,920
He was like his leather pants in the
back of look like a diaper and it,

1116
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,070
and it would come out and he does like,
dude was a little,

1117
01:04:07,071 --> 01:04:09,370
I try to be sexy in a row,
swivel his hips up.

1118
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:13,560
My wife has died lab and she was
like, he needs to fucking stop. Stop,

1119
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:17,070
stop doing that. And companies, even
when you keep yourself in shape,

1120
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:18,590
and he was not going,
he was,

1121
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:23,180
but you got it. You can't do
that sexy shit. I'm telling you.

1122
01:04:23,181 --> 01:04:28,181
That is a self-involved baby boomer
thing that is being passed down like to

1123
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,420
Madonna isn't un-fucking-believable
shame for her fucking age,

1124
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:34,240
but when she starts twerking,
it's just,

1125
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:38,730
ah Ha, what are you doing? Right?

1126
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,840
Yeah.
And then it's like the older guy,

1127
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,700
which you've got to do is you got to like
a isoc to Derosa about this. You know,

1128
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:51,560
you got to dress like Dana
white when you get older, right?

1129
01:04:51,561 --> 01:04:56,330
Like Dana White is roughly my age.
Dana White, you know, he was a suit.

1130
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,860
He wears to college. Shirt doesn't have
the title, it's a title rather than,

1131
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:04,430
so he's a little bit relaxed, but he's
dressed like he doesn't look like a creek,

1132
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,880
you know what I mean? But if he was
to show up, you know what I mean?

1133
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,040
I'm not just putting it on him,
just saying that, that fucking look,

1134
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:12,440
just so you take a guy the same age,
my fucking age,

1135
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:15,350
and you're going to try to
fucking pull off like a tank top.

1136
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,120
Like even like when you watch these,
these, those P90x things, right.

1137
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:22,540
And the old guys are working at the 58
year old guys with the ABS. It's like,

1138
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,200
dude,

1139
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,200
amazing putting your fucking shirt on
because there's nothing they can do for

1140
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:32,140
the loss of elasticity in
your fucking skin. Yeah.

1141
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,150
You're decomposing in
front of me with Avocado.

1142
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:42,040
They said you'd be sitting in
a giant fruit ball, a little,

1143
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:46,570
little fruit flies flying around you.
So I learned a lot like guy watched,

1144
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,670
uh,
those bands.

1145
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:53,671
And it was the people that
we're comfortable with their
age and kept themselves

1146
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:57,100
in shape and came out.
And what having a good fucking time.

1147
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,330
It was just like, ah man,
this is fucking granular.

1148
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,740
Would like you just were really excited.

1149
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:06,190
But if they came out like you know,
they'd fucking this,

1150
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:07,960
this still fucking
party and like you know,

1151
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:10,600
Keith Richards back in the day and then
they come in and you're going to still

1152
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:13,550
wear like leather and shit.
Um,

1153
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,320
HD net have this concert series a
couple of years ago and there were,

1154
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:20,800
so these commercials for the
concert series and they would show,

1155
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,360
they showed Steppenwolf,
right. You don't know, you can,

1156
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,140
God you love me.
Then again,

1157
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:31,960
and then that middle section that goes
on for fucking ever maybe used to work in

1158
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:32,794
a warehouse,

1159
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:38,790
that whole fucking the psychedelic part,
it goes on for two.

1160
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,790
Sorry I interrupted your story,

1161
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,020
but there was so like them playing
concerts back in like the seventies and

1162
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:46,810
there'll be jam packed arena
and people going crazy,

1163
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:50,680
the crowd and then they show him now
like it was smashed cup from then to now.

1164
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,520
Oh, now they're playing, I'm
like an outdoor stage and

1165
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:55,943
tire audience.

1166
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:00,910
Only about 300 people are sitting
on this lawn like lawn chairs.

1167
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,950
And I'm like, I know cause
we're all too well. Yeah.

1168
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,950
All the people that love it
back then are all now too.

1169
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:10,580
So I'm just like watching people perform
at like the Eggers retirement community.

1170
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:14,920
I know, but those guys have like 70 I
know it's fucking, I'm sure that guide,

1171
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:16,300
the band still sounds
great and everything,

1172
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:18,340
but then it's gotta be weird
having fun with it. Just like fuck,

1173
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:22,330
we still have to make money.
I'm like, yeah. Well in a
lot of those guys they got,

1174
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:27,310
they got so stolen from just completely
ripped off and then you add that if

1175
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:30,850
somebody got divorced and shit, yeah,
you're going to be singing that song.

1176
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,480
I just realized it cross my legs wearing
slippers in front of you. I'm sorry.

1177
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,420
Those are greats liberal.
They are great slippers. No,

1178
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:39,300
I finally bought some new
socks and I just want to,

1179
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,950
I want him to try to keep a white
full one thing for you. I bought it.

1180
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,100
That's why we're a black socks all that.

1181
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,120
Well I can't wear black socks if I have
on like dark sneakers. Why not? I mean,

1182
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:51,370
I can't wear white socks
with dark sneakers now.

1183
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:55,210
I if I'm sorry if I'm white sneakers,
I need white socks. Really? Yeah,

1184
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,240
I guess, yeah, I have mostly
white sneakers. No offense.

1185
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,250
Um, no, but I think a lot of those guys
that, that's what ends up happening.

1186
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:09,880
So I think the way to do it is,

1187
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:12,910
and I haven't figured out
how to get into the game yet,

1188
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:15,890
is you get to a certain point
when you're at the height of your,

1189
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,240
your earning power,

1190
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:21,950
I think you should already be planning
your graceful exit from this business

1191
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:22,784
because it's so good.

1192
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:27,290
So I think rather than going
out and buying flashy shit,

1193
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:31,740
fucking hovercraft and all the
dumb shit that, that artists by,

1194
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:37,010
by stuck buying rent, those man rental
units, I'm not buying a helicopter.

1195
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:39,440
I'd love to, but I, I can't, uh,

1196
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:44,030
I can't justify maintaining it to
fucking play this. I got a kid now, man,

1197
01:08:44,031 --> 01:08:48,890
I can't run smash cut.
Uh, thought that at the,

1198
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:52,400
you know, what's cool is I'm doing Irvine
on Tuesday and Wednesday. You know,

1199
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:55,850
that's like one of the other,
you know, it's like two hours
of traffic. Oh to, yeah,

1200
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,750
I'm renting a little 22 [inaudible] Bob,
uh,

1201
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,400
Bob go right over it and like 20
minutes. That was fucking awesome. It is.

1202
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:08,680
Yeah. Oh my God, Dude. Fuck five.

1203
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:14,180
I did my time. I did my time. Not
fucking do what it might be yet.

1204
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:17,900
Another comedian talking
about how horrific the traffic
was during the first 10

1205
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:20,900
minutes. How about I go up there and be
the comic who's in a good mood, right?

1206
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:25,160
That's what people will come and outflows.
10 minute helicopter ride. Oh yeah.

1207
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,830
That's fantastic.
I'll write up it fucking over it.

1208
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:31,160
And this is the thing like to
look at the parking structure.

1209
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,850
My land right on the roof of the
Improv now, um, we're trying to find,

1210
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:36,550
you got to call up.
It's like I'm learning.

1211
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,780
Every time you fly you learned something.

1212
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:41,480
So I'm learning this time
is like they'll have this,

1213
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,270
all these helipads so you can
even go beyond the airports.

1214
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:47,330
Cause I was thinking like John
Wayne, he's, he's close by.

1215
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:49,040
But then there's another
one that's even closer,

1216
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:53,290
but then there's like these hella
pads on top of buildings and all work.

1217
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,980
I'll just all around you.
But you have to,

1218
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:59,600
you just have to call him and tell him you
go fly down to the solo. No, no, no, no,

1219
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:03,590
no. I don't have confidence to fly
at night. I fly solo during the day,

1220
01:10:03,591 --> 01:10:05,990
but at night it's just a
whole different ball game.

1221
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:10,550
And I'll never forget one night doing a
night flight. I was with an instructor.

1222
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:15,770
And how you transitioned, uh,
the airspace at lax is he,

1223
01:10:15,771 --> 01:10:19,190
that you fly under, you're not
underneath it, but you, you're,

1224
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:22,250
you're along the coastline or the plant
like a hundred feet off the water,

1225
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,840
which is awesome and scary shit. Um, and,

1226
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,880
or you fly over [inaudible] over like
those glow stick things at like, you know,

1227
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:36,020
I think it's like a 2000, I'm only
done it once, like 2000 feet or above.

1228
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,050
So at night we flew
over us over the supple,

1229
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:41,570
that a one and you know,

1230
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:46,430
it's fucking freaky because there's all
these jets coming in that if you're at

1231
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:50,240
the same altitude altitude with t bone,
you said we're flying. I go, yeah man,

1232
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:51,920
I go the cop a pig, that
endpoint, this is crazy.

1233
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:55,070
And how big these planes are landing
here? And he just goes, yeah,

1234
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:58,580
there's one right there.
And it was like almost underneath us.

1235
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:02,510
But because when you're looking down and
there's not a lot of streetlights and

1236
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:05,510
you just see the lights from the city,
I didn't see like a fucking, you know,

1237
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,760
Ho seven 49,

1238
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:09,230
seven 40 said whatever the fuck they fly
now I don't even know what the numbers

1239
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:13,040
are anymore. It was like going right
underneath us and I was just like, wow,

1240
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,020
you didn't see that? No,
but he did this the right,

1241
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,650
this was when I was getting my license.
So I didn't know how to,

1242
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,980
to look for Shit and everything.
So night flying isn't entirely,

1243
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:27,420
entirely different games. So,
uh, I'll be flying down, um,

1244
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:31,620
with one of my instructors. So, but
if it was, if it was like the, uh,

1245
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,770
if it was the fucking summer time though,
but every time,

1246
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:37,110
every time it's going to, by the end
of the show it's going to be dark out.

1247
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:42,000
But that is a goal of mine
who I would love to fly solo.

1248
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:46,530
Let me ask you this, how much does
it cost? It cost you to do that?

1249
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,770
We'll fly down to, because you have to
have like rent the vehicle and pay it.

1250
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:53,640
It's like 300 bucks. I mean it's
a, it's a decent amount of money,

1251
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:58,320
but it's also like, it's not that bad
though. I use cover crops. We grow,

1252
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:03,030
but no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, nothing
like that. It's like 300 bucks.

1253
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,070
And then,
uh,

1254
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,240
and it's fun and then I get another,
like I'll get like another,

1255
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:14,250
I'm going to get another two hours
under my belt flying at night. And, uh,

1256
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:16,470
I got this killer fucking
instructor right now.

1257
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:20,550
My auto rotations are the best they've
ever been where they basically, so, uh,

1258
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,700
we'll, we'll fly around now and
he just sorta like, he'll just,

1259
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:24,960
I don't know what go,
you know,

1260
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:29,700
engine failure and then you just have
to tick a fucking spot and you know,

1261
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:30,900
you just,
I mean,

1262
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,470
we don't take it all way down to the
ground and I land on somebody's fucking

1263
01:12:34,471 --> 01:12:39,000
front yard, but, um, I've learned so much.

1264
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:42,210
I always had great instructors,
but this guy that I have now is,

1265
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,310
it's really got my confidence
back up again where, um,

1266
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,200
for me to go solo and everything would be,
you know,

1267
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,830
I would have the confidence to do
it, but I like, but what's good is I,

1268
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:55,470
I'm super fucking cautious. I'm
not one of those people, you know,

1269
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:58,740
we're with the fucking nine oh two
one oh look on my face, you know,

1270
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,130
show up with like a fucking scarf jurors.
No,

1271
01:13:02,131 --> 01:13:03,900
but there's a lot of people that get,
they get their,

1272
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,290
they get their license and once they get
the license, they stopped the training.

1273
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:11,160
And because it got it well cause they
know how to fly and then you know,

1274
01:13:11,161 --> 01:13:14,820
and then it just, they just
start flying around. Oh right.

1275
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:19,710
So did you fly your parents? Yeah. Then
when they came out here and visit it.

1276
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:22,350
But I also did that with like
an instructor and that was a,

1277
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:26,540
well the impress their
parents blown away that uh,

1278
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:30,030
they definitely day had a good time and
they're very conservative people. So,

1279
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:30,331
you know,

1280
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:35,000
sometimes you don't necessarily know
what they're thinking or going crazy.

1281
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:39,120
They won't go crazy. They would just
like, that was nice. It was very, uh,

1282
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,310
very in trouble.
I was exhilarated.

1283
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:47,510
I heart is beating out of
my chest right now. Um, no,

1284
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:51,360
my, my dad, uh, had a pilot's license has
a policy letter cause once you get it,

1285
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:53,820
so like he held cover and no,
he had fixed wing.

1286
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:58,020
So he knew a lot of the shit
that was going on. So, uh,

1287
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,110
you know,
but my mother thought it was awesome.

1288
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,740
She loved it and wasn't scared at all.
My Dad, I think because he had a license,

1289
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,730
understood the probably more the
danger of it and that type of shit.

1290
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:12,100
So he probably thought it was a little
squirrely when we were a hundred feet off

1291
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:15,580
the fucking water flying on any, do
you know, the Jetson, whatever. But uh,

1292
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:18,910
I tell you one of the great things that
I've done in my fucking adult life and

1293
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:23,140
um, I don't know, but we're not here to
talk about make, we had to talk about you.

1294
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:28,090
We've already done an hour and 15
minutes just like that. Uh, I can I,

1295
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:32,730
can I come down the 90th day dude or
want nothing more than, okay, cool.

1296
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,890
All right. Well some people, you
know, like me, I'd be like, no,

1297
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:39,570
I don't want anybody to, nobody had
fucking know. So it's just one more thing

1298
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,390
we're going to do. Like,
you know, I'm to, come on,

1299
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:45,920
I'm going to be brought from off stage.
I have another comedian opening for me.

1300
01:14:45,921 --> 01:14:49,630
They've got an Frankie quiñones who
does the Cholo fit videos and he usually

1301
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:50,550
towards the Craig and I.

1302
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:53,730
And so I'm going to have someone
bring me on stage from offstage.

1303
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,920
You got that fucking Woolies.
Oh yeah, I'll definitely do it.

1304
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,700
I'll definitely do it. Yeah. Let me
just double check my schedule. I'm,

1305
01:14:59,701 --> 01:15:04,130
I'm 99% sure I'm in town, right?
February 11th, February 11th I,

1306
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,660
Sunday Day. Yeah. What
have I got? I got reno,

1307
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,190
I got Santa Barbara,

1308
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,890
then it gets something at the Patrice
O'Neal benefit towards the end of month.

1309
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,330
Oh Man. Um, that's right. I met Patrice
was mom and sister with you. That was,

1310
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,700
that was fucking amazing. Oh yeah,
that was great. A lot of the best.

1311
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:24,520
They're the best. Hey, so I'll, uh, I'll
tell you this, when you do sound check,

1312
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:28,680
just make sure, speaking of
Patrice, cause I mean one time he,

1313
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:33,640
he did some taping and the sound wasn't
right and when it came time for him to

1314
01:15:33,641 --> 01:15:37,060
do his taping, you know, they thought he
was a pain in the ass, but he was like,

1315
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:38,560
the sound isn't right.
And he was like,

1316
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:42,760
I want to be the loudest thing in
the room, so make sure your monitors,

1317
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,720
so you know,
you got to just make sure that is right.

1318
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,520
That's fucking right.
Then it's like, yeah,

1319
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:53,230
you light saber is totally on
and you know, you know that deal.

1320
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:56,290
If you get up there and you can't fucking
hear yourself and God knows when you

1321
01:15:56,291 --> 01:16:00,550
go to tape, there's always somebody
who fuck, something like that. Oh,

1322
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:04,300
I thought it'd be good to just have
the sound way down, you know? Um,

1323
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:07,540
just make sure all of that shits right
and then Gus go up there and kill it.

1324
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,940
Yeah,
that's the plan.

1325
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:15,940
I've never seen you so fucking nervous.
I'm not nervous. I'm just like,

1326
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:20,710
I'm anxious and I know you are going
to be great if you doing it tonight,

1327
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:22,120
I can tell this whole podcast.

1328
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,770
Well also I don't want to be loved because
I know your daughter's leaving. Oh,

1329
01:16:24,771 --> 01:16:26,680
okay.
I don't know dude.

1330
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,470
And I'm tired and a little bit hung over.
But other than that and a little bit,

1331
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:35,110
yeah, I always want to like this.
Whenever I have one of those coming up,

1332
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:38,620
I just feel like just for, can you
just bring me up now in my slippers?

1333
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:41,440
So I just go out there and just fuck it.
Just do it.

1334
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,830
The waiting is the worst part,

1335
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:49,060
well that's the podcast, dude.
