1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,410
Hey, what's going on is bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,740
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,040
Ah,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,950
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you like a friend,

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,550
like a pal, just calling to say
hello. You know what I mean?

6
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:25,060
You know when somebody calls
just to say air quote hello.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,360
And you know as much as you sitting there
going, oh, you want to believe it? Uh,

8
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:33,490
this is so nice. He's just saying hello.
The thing is the first seven minutes,

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,180
the first seven minutes, she got to be on
pins and needles. Like, when's it coming?

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,330
When's it coming?
When's the favor going to be asked?

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,330
I never hear from this motherfucker.
And now he's called, Hey,

12
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:47,160
just called to see what's going
on, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,190
And they wind their fucking way around.
They dosey doe year round the room.

14
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:53,800
You're like, wow, isn't this
nice? He just called to say hello.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,820
He's really asking me how I'm
doing and my wife are doing.

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,470
And then all of a sudden Eric comes star.
That's great. You know? Interesting.

17
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:06,520
You should say that because dude,
I could use your boat.

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,490
I could use about two grand.
You know, I know what's a lot,

19
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:13,630
I'm embarrassed to even ask
you, but like I just, you know,

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,730
I hit a little bit of a rough patch.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll get it back to you probably by
the end of the month or maybe never.

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,350
Worst case scenario, I'll never
bring it up again, but when you do,

23
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,310
I'll make it seem like you're
the asshole. Like, really?

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,630
You're going to do this now.

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,950
You're going to do this now in front of
my family that they're not here, dude,

26
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:38,800
they left you years ago. Oh, then
you're going to bring that up. You know,

27
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,760
one of those fucking guys, no matter
what you do, somehow you're the Douche.

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,300
Samiah you're the one at fault.
You know that works. People,

29
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,750
you know, they, they don't
take responsibility for
themselves, like make, you know,

30
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,210
I'm a fucking pillar of this community.

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,840
That's when you know it's time to move.

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,430
If I'm saying that type of shit and you
live anywhere near me. Um, so guess what?

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,120
MMM, my old ass kitchen. My
old ass fucking kitchen yeah.

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,980
Is uh,
they started to work on it today.

35
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,810
So we rented a small house around
the corner because last time,

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,580
longtime listeners, you know, we fucking
ended up getting like smoker coughs.

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,940
You can't live in a house where they're
doing demolition. You just can't.

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,530
I've done it twice. I did
it once in New York. Um,

39
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,470
once again, I was putting a
kitchen and it was the ugly,

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,780
the kitchen I had was the ugliest fucking
kitchen you've ever seen in your life.

41
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:42,940
The cabinets were like this,
um, you know, like when,

42
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,130
when they try to have
like the flesh color of a,

43
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:50,300
of a slightly less pasty person
than me, you know, that color.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,170
It's not white. It's
not peach. It's not 10.

45
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,820
It's just that fucking color.

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,920
It was that color counters and cabinets.

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,470
And then it was a dark brown outline
on the cabinets with that far.

48
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,750
It was like,
you know,

49
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:08,560
when they make a doll and it's
supposed to be a Caucasian doll,

50
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,340
like back in the day you remember that?
Fuck it was that fun. Oh, that's perfect.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,240
Minus the rosy cheeks.
It was that color, right?

52
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,770
Like the color that thinks fucking foot.
I had a doll foot colored kitchen

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,590
was shit brown and I mean Shit Brown.

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,560
Okay.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,970
Yeah, no shit. Fucking brown.
Jesus Christ. You're an animal.

56
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:35,090
Shit Brown outline around the cabinet.

57
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,840
And then I had this
fucking stove that like,

58
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:42,260
I swear to God was from like
the Serpico era of New York.

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,473
MMM.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,870
And I want to say the walls were yellow,

61
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,310
like the used to be a sun yellow and
then that basically over the years faded

62
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:55,390
into your dreams have died in,
this is your lot in life yellow.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,410
Um,
and you know,

64
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,340
I could barely afford
to get the kitchen done,

65
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,150
so I had to be there and I was in a
one bedroom apartment and they did the

66
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:10,470
ceiling to floor fucking plastic
shit. It, it means it gets most of it,

67
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:13,770
but the rest of it goes right
into your fucking lungs. I mean,

68
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:15,600
it just took for fucking ever.

69
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,110
Um,
uh,

70
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,400
but when it was done, it was the
shit, oh, it was finally fucking done.

71
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,900
But I remember,
you know what they forgot to do,

72
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:27,450
they forgot to give me a little place
to put a wastebasket and you're like,

73
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:28,620
oh fuck.
And then they just,

74
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,360
Jerry rigged this fucking horse shit that
never made sense. I never even used it.

75
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:37,080
And I lost a little cabinet space,
which is crucial in any kitchen.

76
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:40,410
Forget about when you got a little ass
fucking one bedroom apartment in New York.

77
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:44,790
So the next time I did anything
and you know, left New York,

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,930
sold the old digs, came
out here, you know,

79
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,950
went back to rent and then got a fucking
house and we did the whole downstairs,

80
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,220
which turned into a fucking nightmare
because my house is a 93 years old at this

81
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:00,984
point.

82
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,763
MMM.

83
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,860
So we had all kinds of cloth wiring.
We had all sense galvanized pipe.

84
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,170
We had a gas leak. We
just, every fuck we did.

85
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,070
At one point they were rodents in the
wall. So when we took the wall out,

86
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,250
there was a bunch of
road in Shit in the wall.

87
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,173
You know,

88
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,910
when they listed that thing
and I went to buy it, they did.

89
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:23,550
They didn't say that they, they,
they, they didn't disclose that.

90
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,320
You don't have to disclose to
the prospective buyer that, oh,

91
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,310
by the way,

92
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,180
we had some sort of mouse or rat problem
and they ate through the fucking walls

93
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,570
and they shit wherever they
wanted to, shit in. It was just,

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,370
it was literally a shit show.
So that took a fucking year to undo.

95
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,300
The whole downstairs was completely
fucked up, not up to code on.

96
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:50,670
I took the whole fucking year to get
that fixed and now that's fixed, so,

97
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,050
okay.

98
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,040
And then upstairs they'll fucking jumped.
The floors were warped.

99
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,723
I,

100
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,190
if you put a marble on my floor,

101
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,980
it would roll as fast as that
thing that chased Indiana Jones.

102
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,790
Like that's how fucking walk day where
that giant fucking ball, you know.

103
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,230
Um, by the way, that's the only Scifi type
movie. I can handle it. Cause you know,

104
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:15,280
it was weird. It was like science
fiction, but it was like back in the day,

105
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,320
you know,
so there was still like people's,

106
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:20,740
there were people walking around with
like fucking 0.8 years and uh, you know,

107
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:24,160
grabbing you by your fucking Scapula
and then for some reason pass out,

108
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:28,750
even though it makes no fucking sense
whatsoever. That's a Vulcan nerve.

109
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,510
What? I mean there's nerves everywhere.
What exactly is there? Fuck.

110
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:37,580
Is that dude's name Spock?
Right?

111
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,930
Did he have a last name
or was that not logical?

112
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,330
You fucking Douche with your mo from the
three stooges haircuts, unit, Fullan.

113
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,300
Anybody. Right. And your diva
fucking eyebrows. I too was a fraud.

114
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,320
Okay.

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,760
Anyways, the fuck I started talking about
Spock. No, I bit my fucking kitchen.

116
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,100
So today,
today was a big day,

117
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,720
so he moved into the little
fucking small place. Right. And uh,

118
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,370
you know, just grab clothes
and Shit, you know, that's it.

119
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,240
Bottle of booze. I hate to say that I
actually packed up a bottle of booze.

120
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:16,900
I mean, Bill, how many fucking
red flags do you need to see? Um,

121
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,270
I took that thing with me like,
Ooh,

122
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:25,380
I got to bring that like
I forgot my checkbook. Um,

123
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,640
I to tell you it was delicious. Delicious.
A little bourbon called Yippy Kai. Yay.

124
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,870
Not Mother Fucker for all your diehard
fans. Just Ki Yay. Might be a whiskey.

125
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,600
I don't even know. All I know is
when you poured into the glass,

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,550
you can't put a fucking ice cube in it
because it's just that fucking beautiful.

127
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,790
It would be. It would, it
would be absolutely religious.

128
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,100
Um, and my wife's fucking texting,
calling me right now. What is the problem?

129
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,960
What is the problem? I heard you
pull up. I can't figure out the keys.

130
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,220
Youth. I sense that you're
laying down enjoying yourself.

131
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,750
Is there any way you could
get up and not be relaxed?

132
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,340
All right, here we go. Doing podcast.

133
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,750
Oh, I can't do that. That's
too blunt. What's up?

134
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,960
All right. All right. What's
up? What should I go with?
Qt. Let's go with sweetie.

135
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,040
Sweetie. Pies. That too much. Is that
too pandering? Want to go with sweetie?

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,470
Question Mark? No. Emoji emojis
for, for fucking voice, right?

137
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:35,950
Real men. Don't Emoji. All right. They
take that big fucking deviled egg,

138
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:39,910
Eaton thumbs, and they try to, they did.
They do the best they can. I use emojis.

139
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,780
My favorite thing to do is to use emojis
with another man who fucking for some

140
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:47,320
reason we'll get like
homophobic if you send them one,

141
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,980
you know,
and once you sense that on them,

142
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,000
you just keep sending more and more
emojis and you gradually build your way up

143
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,100
that the, the little fucking smiley
face that's blowing the kiss.

144
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,900
That's a little hard,
you know?

145
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,880
Um, anyways, so we fucking um,

146
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,080
where guesthouse, Dunno. What
the fuck are we talking about?

147
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,220
Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck does
it matter where the fuck I'm doing it?

148
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,903
Okay.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,640
Guest House. You mean garage? They're
always trying to fucking hook shit up.

150
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,170
No fucking downstairs.
She's out in the driveway.

151
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,530
All right. Anyways, um,

152
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,120
okay.

153
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,450
Plowing ahead. Why? Why, why would you
answer it bill? Why would you answer it?

154
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,550
When am I going to learn that?

155
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,300
You just don't fuck an answered and
then they'll be like, where were you?

156
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,170
What were you doing when you see them?

157
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:50,310
Then you just get it all out and it's
so easy to s much easier to say it.

158
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,570
Then the fried try to fucking texts if
forget about that whole voice message

159
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:58,010
saying they'd always ends up fucking
something up, especially pronouns.

160
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:02,950
So whenever it makes any sense that there
or maybe I'm a mumble. And Jack, I said,

161
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:05,820
I'll tell you right now who could
not voice text is Shannon Sharpe.

162
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,380
Jesus Christ.
I dunno who's hard to understand him.

163
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,880
It understand is him or that fucking
guy will pick me up in Scotland.

164
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,460
Bull Bull. Bull Bull. Well yeah,

165
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,440
but futbol.
Whoa.

166
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,070
Okay. You're looking at me. I don't know
what yeah, you literally talking to me.

167
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,530
Yup,
I'll follow.

168
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,170
MMM. Anyway, so today was the
first day that they did the, uh,

169
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,190
okay.

170
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,890
Did the fucking, the
demolition for the fucking, um,

171
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,190
the kitchen. Right. So I go
over there, cause you know,

172
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:49,370
I gotta get some mail and
I forgot some dumb shit,

173
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:51,080
like mouthwash and shit like that.

174
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:54,380
So I went over there to go get the
mail and all that crap and I, dude,

175
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,750
I went in there and it's
unfucking believable.

176
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:57,680
Yeah,

177
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,070
it's unreal how long it takes to build
a kitchen, but to take one apart.

178
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,890
I mean these guys,
they were down to the tile.

179
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,500
Shit was just gone and this is what
was killing me. It was, you know,

180
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,480
cause it's all grout and
all that type of shit.

181
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:15,160
Like I was downstairs getting
the mouthwash and I heard
him upstairs like Bam,

182
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,180
Bam, Bam, Bam. It's like I have
to get the fuck outta here. You,

183
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,770
you don't want to hear that
sound ever in your house.

184
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,340
I just kept picturing these old
revolutionary war nails coming out of like

185
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,350
fucking, what do they call that? Uh,

186
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,760
okay.

187
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,380
Support beams.
What do they call them?

188
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:35,530
The main thing like you can't fuck with
that wall because that wall is a load

189
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:39,940
bearing wall coming out. One
of the load bearing walls. Um,

190
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,800
so anyways, allegedly it's going
to take eight weeks. So, uh,

191
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,780
what's the over under on that guys?
Come on. It's football season.

192
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,440
Okay.

193
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,900
I'll tell you right now, like
the, if, if you had a bet,

194
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:54,490
the over under on a home
improvement project,

195
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,730
if you went to bed on that Vegas like
the fucking over would be off the charts.

196
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,660
You, you'd have to bet a
thousand to make a buck

197
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,490
and the under would be pro.
Well they never give you that go to odds,

198
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:10,800
but you know what I
mean. Um, so anyways, uh,

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,910
that shit began today. Um,
and we'll finally going to,

200
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,670
we're going to fix everything
because we had, you know,

201
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,280
oh you can see the kitchen in the pie
crust making video and you'll see me on

202
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,300
this little island.

203
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,500
And that was back when I having an
island was list this thing to have in a

204
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:34,060
kitchen and whether you had the space or
not and we completely did not have the

205
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,150
space and none of it made sense.

206
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,360
They had to sync up against the
wall and set up against the windows.

207
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,810
The stove instead of being up on the wall
against the wall was like the size of

208
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,150
like, I mean, I could barely get
a fucking cookie sheet in there.

209
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,230
And you guys know how I like
the sweet staff. So, uh,

210
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,680
they're finally getting rid of all that.

211
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:54,280
They're going to open it up a little
bit, uh, hopefully. And uh, you know,

212
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:57,440
it's not the biggest kitchen, but
I would just like to, you know,

213
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,420
like have shit work and I'd have some
big fat fuck hippo of an island in the

214
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,660
middle, push it up against the wall. The,
so they're getting rid of everything.

215
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,500
By the way.
They,

216
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:09,940
the last people who fucking put the
kitchen and rather than doing it the right

217
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:12,310
way and digging up the old floor,

218
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,180
they just put the tile on top of
the old floor. You know, that thing.

219
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:20,140
Let's just keep fucking building on
top of Shit. That's fucked up. Right?

220
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,300
So, um, and then that we had
this beautiful swinging door,

221
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,740
like this old school servant door back
when people had people coming over

222
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:32,200
cooking. I'm not talking slavery here.
I don't to make people uncomfortable.

223
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,230
I'm talking just indentured servants.
These are white people coming over.

224
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,100
The latest group of white
people from a Europe, we'll say,

225
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,050
we'll say this is a
politically correct house.

226
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,530
They only had a same colored
indentured servants. Right.

227
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,580
So when they raised the floor,
they had that, they cut the door,

228
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,180
they cut it up top and it just kills me
because I want to keep the fucking door.

229
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:58,000
But this guy's claiming that there's a
lot of doors like that around here cause

230
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,340
a lot of people read them the houses.
So hopefully I can get one that fits.

231
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,750
So I'm taking,

232
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,850
I'm having them take it off the fucking
tile and underneath that I'm guessing is

233
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:12,121
a hardwood kitchen floor that has now
been fucked up because of this tile and

234
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,960
all the glue and shit that they put on it.

235
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,550
So taking that up right
down to the plywood, which I
know is rotted the fuck out.

236
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,020
I know it is because when we
put a pantry in there, I could,

237
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,340
when we got down to the plywood,
I literally could have,

238
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:27,820
like if I gave a karate instruction
with that you guys would want to take my

239
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:29,800
class would be like Jesus Christ.

240
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,520
How did you punch through four
layers of fucking plywood? Well,

241
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,780
I let it marinate for 23
years under water, 23 years,

242
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,910
I mean since 1923 anyways,

243
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,410
so they're going to pull all of that
shit up and just get it down to whatever

244
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:44,891
you call the,

245
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:48,790
the braces and then they're going to
look down there and if there's any wiring

246
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,910
that's fucked up, if there's any
pipes of fucked up that taking it out,

247
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,120
they're not going around the
shit that taken it all out.

248
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,150
And then they're putting it in and
doing it the right fucking way.

249
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,320
And I'm telling you, I'm telling you,
whoever gets this house after me,

250
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,690
all right, I don't know how
long I'm going to stay there.

251
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,760
Whoever gets his fucking house after me,

252
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:12,080
you're not going to have to do shit unless
I stay in it so long that the fucking

253
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,900
kitchen goes out of style or some shit.
But whatever.

254
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,950
All I know is when you go into the
walls, it's going to have done right. Um,

255
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,980
I don't know.
I don't have that fucking in me.

256
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,850
I don't have it in me to just sort
of half ass something. You know,

257
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,790
people do that today. It's just
bricks and mortar. Fuck the next guy.

258
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,390
Why would you do that to him?
What if he's a good shit? Right?

259
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,110
What if he's a good freckled fuck like me?
You know what I mean?

260
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:40,460
He just going to stick me with
that. She can't. Um, so anyways,

261
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,870
that's what's happening today.
Uh, tomorrow I'm going to,

262
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:46,460
I'm flying out to Durham,

263
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:51,461
North Carolina to do a three nights of
shows with the FEC and former front man

264
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:57,470
of a rock band for 20 years.
Dean del Rey turned comedian, uh,

265
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:02,120
one of the great guys in standup
comedy. Uh, and I'm psyched because,

266
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,210
uh, you know, he's been
dropping all kinds of weight.

267
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:09,350
That's the kind of person I want to be
around. And uh, you know, he, you know,

268
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:12,530
he's like all those rock stars. He's
fucking sober. You know what I mean?

269
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,530
They all get fucking stories and
doing heroin with law. You know,

270
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,900
the lead singer of fucking whoever,
pick a fucking pen.

271
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,030
I don't want to say heroin.
Whatever.

272
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:27,320
They did blow with the fucking
guy from quiet, right? Kevin?

273
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:31,220
Dobro rest, his soul rest
is fucking sold in. Um,

274
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,370
so I got that going on.
But last night,

275
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,840
last night I sat in with the fucking band.
And uh,

276
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,450
it was funny because I told you when I,
when I went over to, uh, I was in Italy,

277
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,171
I was just,
you know,

278
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:50,171
I was jet lagged and I always end up
stumbling on some sort of fucking shit on

279
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,290
youtube.
Like the first time I went over to Europe,

280
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,570
since I've been doing the podcast,

281
00:16:56,571 --> 00:17:00,950
I somehow stumbled upon somebody who
had uploaded all four of the Pittsburgh

282
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:05,480
Steelers first four wins in the Superbowl,
the games in their entirety.

283
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,340
And I just sat and watched and I,

284
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:11,960
I binged watch him cause I was afraid
the NFL was going to take them down.

285
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,810
And um, every time I go over there,
I find something fucker just,

286
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,520
I just end up in some weird part of the
fucking Internet where I find something

287
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,550
cool. And I ended up
gutting across, uh, I dunno,

288
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,820
it was just thinking about back in the
day somebody had asked a question about

289
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:32,670
like me taking drum lessons and
Hawaii who I studied with and a,

290
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,251
and now I used to,

291
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:37,630
I was used to be at this music
store that was in downtown Brockton.

292
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:42,220
I don't even know if it's there anymore
that was yet another victim of a guitar

293
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:44,530
center. But, uh,

294
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,070
that reminded me that one of the
big drums are, they was that, uh,

295
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,060
Bobby Shoe and art, I'm saying his name
right Chouinard, will you say it? And um,

296
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,901
and I was like,

297
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:58,110
he used to play for Billy Squier and I
started watching [inaudible] wire and

298
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,310
that was like, this fucking guy
was great. It's a great front man.

299
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:06,000
He's sort of straddled the
line of fucking rock band.

300
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,320
Pop Band did a great, and even the video
that they said, you know, took him down.

301
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:13,880
If you close your eyes, that was a
hit song in the 80s total hit song.

302
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,210
They just said the wrong video.

303
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,250
And unfortunately they didn't
have another hit after that.

304
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,910
So that's the last thing everybody
remembers, right? Your last season.

305
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:25,600
You only good as your last game.
Right? So anyways, long story short,

306
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,640
a friend of mine

307
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,050
hit me up and he mentioned
he was doing a show,

308
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,900
uh, Frankie Perez. Um, who,

309
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,460
if you guys ever saw that time,

310
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:44,450
I got to sit in with Dave Kush during
a couple of his buddies, wink, wink,

311
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,960
and play highway to hell.
Um,

312
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,810
he was the lead singer's guys just
like a fucking amazing singer.

313
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:53,750
So he mentioned that he was going to be
down at the, there's a bowling alley.

314
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,900
The fuck is it giving,
I'd never know the names of places.

315
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,750
It's right on Hollywood boulevard.
Right,

316
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:03,680
right around the corner from
where they do the Os. Yes. And uh,

317
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,730
so he said his band was
playing. I was like, yeah,

318
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:08,820
I'd love to go down and fucking see
you play or whatever, Yada, Yada, Yada.

319
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:11,340
And then he goes, hey man, you want
to sit in or a song? And I told you,

320
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,300
that's my fucking rule. I don't
force my Hollywood, my Hollywood.

321
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:19,600
I don't fault my Hollywood. I
don't force my hobby. Jesus Christ.

322
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,950
There's a fucking Freudian slip.
I don't force my ego,

323
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:27,330
I don't force my hobby on you. But if
you ask me, I was, I'm gonna say yes.

324
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,710
I don't give a shit how terrifying this
situation is. I'm going to say yes.

325
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,390
So I go, all right, well we'll figure
out this song. I said, by the way,

326
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:39,210
man, this guy is way better
than people remember.

327
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,360
And I sent them this Billy squire,
the lonely is the night.

328
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,710
And then he wrote back, he goes, dude,

329
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:46,290
I fucking love that guy cause
you want to do that song.

330
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,410
And that just struck me as funny. I
was like, yeah, let's fucking do it.

331
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,070
Everybody's always play an ACDC Zeplin
and all that shit. I'm like, fuck it,

332
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,810
let's do it. Um, so then I was
texting my other buddies saying,

333
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:00,660
yeah man, we're going to do lonely night
by Billy Squier. And they were all like,

334
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,480
ah,
that's an interesting choice

335
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,290
by knew Frankie was going to kill it.
So anyways,

336
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,670
so I go down there and he just
has this fucking monster band,

337
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,620
monster fucking band, a players like
this sitting at tuning up to play.

338
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:21,340
And they were going to do a cover of dazed
and confused and the other bands like,

339
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:21,551
you know,

340
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:26,500
load in this shit and just a guitar player
played the first sort of notes of the

341
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:28,510
song.
And I don't mean like the baseline,

342
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,560
I just mean some of the licks and he
had a telecast. It just like Jimmy had,

343
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:32,891
you know,

344
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:36,130
when he first came over here and played
at the whiskey and I was just like,

345
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,560
oh fuck, are they gonna do dazed
and confused? And then he fucking,

346
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,320
he see breaks out the boat and I swear
to God, man, it sounded like the album.

347
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,280
Then the whole band kicks in.
And, uh, the woman on drums,

348
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,690
Valerie Franco, right? She,
there's like a house drunk kid.

349
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:56,060
She says, you know, get that shit out
of the act. Puts in her own fucking kid.

350
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:59,710
She's got a vista like kit,
you know, like, what do they
call it, the candy striped,

351
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,810
um, vintage one. They start miking it
up. It sounds fucking unbelievable.

352
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,910
And I'm listening to a play
and I'm going like, Oh shit,

353
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,070
I got to go on after that. Like, you know,

354
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,470
they're going to pass off one
song to me after she plays. Right.

355
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,160
This is just the sound check.
Um,

356
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,920
I didn't realize that she was only
going like 40%. Uh, I'm actually good.

357
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:23,830
I tweeted a video of her playing a
cover to a mute math of all people.

358
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,600
Um, and I heard that she's going to
be doing something with Darren King,

359
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,300
that drummer. But dude, I gotta tell
you when that fucking show started,

360
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,770
the woman that I saw at sound
check was, was like, it was,

361
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,680
it was not the same person. And I was
blown away by the sound check though.

362
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,210
She fucking destroyed,
fucking destroyed. She,

363
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:48,640
the set began. She just hit the symbols
like twice. And I was like, what the fuck?

364
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,280
It sounded better than
anything I've played 20 years.

365
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,550
Absolutely fucking was murdering on the
drums and what it was common time for me

366
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:00,310
to play the song I was sitting in,

367
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,240
I was literally getting
the same butterflies I used
to get way back in the day

368
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:08,230
when I first started doing standup and
there was somebody killed it on stage and

369
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,900
I was just stuck.
Comedians know this,

370
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:13,030
we're all of a sudden you feel like
you're two inches tall going like,

371
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,010
I can't follow that. So,
uh, she gets off right?

372
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,130
They finished think murders it for six,
seven songs,

373
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:25,150
and then she comes back,
hands me the sticks. She just
like, all right, you're up.

374
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:27,610
And I'm like, yeah, yeah,
yeah, no problem. Right?

375
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,310
So I sit down and we go to play it at

376
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,010
the whole fucking thing went great.
Except I fucked up one major part.

377
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,600
Right?

378
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,310
Like the guitar riff Bannon and then
Annette is a part where the whole band

379
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:45,330
drops out and the guitar
plays, right. Donna? None.

380
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,160
And then on the snare and the floor,
Tom,

381
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,380
you and the bass player at Saint Tango
took, okay, good. Just like that data.

382
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,140
Then Annette Bannon a nun.
And a right.

383
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,100
I fucking forgot to do that part.
So the guitar player,

384
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:02,720
a total rock star goes bad.
Alan, Alan, that miss my cue.

385
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,160
And then so it's just the bass player
going boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boop.

386
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,100
I felt like fuck such a fucking asshole.
I think I literally said oops.

387
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,080
Like if anybody for whatever reason you
know was filming during that, you know,

388
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:23,350
everybody's got the fucking iPhones. If
anybody, you might even see me say oops.

389
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,260
But I don't think anybody noticed cause
I think most of the crowd was like what

390
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:31,180
fucking song is this? Um,
but it ended up going, I was,

391
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,840
I was nervous about the, the first part
because the first time they drop out,

392
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:34,991
you know,

393
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:39,280
he does all this simple barks and a
couple of nods to bottom there and those

394
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:42,760
things went off without a hitch. So
then you start, dude, it's all like,

395
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,300
I've found a few times ever sat and
with Ben the second you lose your focus,

396
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,470
you just can't do it.
All those years I played.

397
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,040
You just play along with,
with like, you know,

398
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,670
playing along with records versus just
being the only person playing is an

399
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,930
entirely different game.

400
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,020
And then if you sit in at a sound
check in the singers not singing,

401
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,150
then you really have to be fucking
paying attention. And uh, yeah,

402
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,010
I just,
once I got past those,

403
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:14,600
that little fucking shit on the high hat
and the little bottom lik I was like,

404
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,700
Oh man,
it's all fucking downhill from here.

405
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,470
This is all pretty much
straightforward shit. And uh,

406
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,310
oh fucking freckles as always,
at some point whenever I'm,

407
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,040
no matter how well I'm playing,
I always turned back into the Pumpkin,

408
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,350
which I think is apropos considering this
the shape of my head. Um, but anyways,

409
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,170
I want to thank all those guys for letting
me sit in and then they were fucking

410
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,420
amazing. This other guy, salad
and keys, I apologize to, uh,

411
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,230
some of the other people. I mean, there
was like five or six people up there, uh,

412
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:49,280
another woman, Kayla singing her ass off.
It was, it was fucking awesome, man. And,

413
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:53,210
uh, I swear to God in another
life, in another life,

414
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:57,380
the same way I would've done comedy
and continued to sleep on a Futon,

415
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,220
right until my forties, right up to
my forties. Like I basically did.

416
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,050
I would have done that to
try and make it as a drummer.

417
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:07,640
It's just too much fucking
fun. Um, but anyways,

418
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,290
let's get down to the fucking thing
at hand. I saved to the end. Oh Shit.

419
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,910
Who the fuck wants the football?
Huh? You know the big story?

420
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:23,090
Tom Brady suspended for four games.
The Baltimore,

421
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:26,420
that fucking Indianapolis Colts.
What other always be Baltimore to me.

422
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,620
The Indianapolis Colts. Whoa.
A good coach. Air Air out.

423
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,000
That's why we lost by 90 fucking points.
Um,

424
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,040
which really losing by 35 really is
about 70 fucking point. She had dopes.

425
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,780
So anyways, and now we've got our backup
quarterback coming in there. You know,

426
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,240
not only do we win,

427
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,230
the fucking colts lose and you know,
it's the greatest thing about it.

428
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,600
We got another matinee. Idol is a
quarterback. Does that guy look,

429
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,320
he does not have the looks of
a backup quarterback, right?

430
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,730
He looks like the fucking lead and all
those coming of age eighties movies.

431
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,160
The guy who's dating the checked at
the nerd wants to go out with, right?

432
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,410
That fucking guy that says
this, what? Indianapolis.

433
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,700
You never going to understand
our quarterback is better
than your quarterback.

434
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,600
Our backup is better than your
quarterback. They're better looking.

435
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,760
They're better in the clutch.
They got more jewelry over the year.

436
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,580
How do you like dad?
Chimor say,

437
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,690
what the fuck are you going to bitch
about it now? I love it. I love all I'll,

438
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,780
I'll Jimmy has to do is
just get one more victory.

439
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,730
Fucking terrible. Tom Comes
back all fucking, you know,

440
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:45,420
fucking anger. Snort. None of his fucking
flared out nostrils. A Nice pissed off.

441
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:49,310
38 year old Tom Brady coming back to fifth
game of the season to get the fucking

442
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,800
Indianapolis Colts,
the old fucking spank and they deserve,

443
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,660
it's going to be tremendous.
I can't fucking wait. Oh,

444
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,330
can you imagine the dream of all dreams
is the Patriots go for no and the

445
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,050
fucking colts go oh and four and then
we hang that fifth loss around their

446
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:08,070
fucking head and then I guarantee you
there'll be some sort of fucking rule

447
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:13,071
change spearheaded by Jim
or say I'm telling you the,

448
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,350
the, the, the biggest bullshit
suspension of all fucking time.

449
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,610
Biggest bullshit. Suspense of all time.
Fucking vikings. Heat up the ball.

450
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:28,350
Get a $50,000. Fine. That's it. Jesus
fucking Christ off poor Tom Brady.

451
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,320
But this is is,

452
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,130
is Matt Nay good looks and his supermodel
wife and is a hundreds of millions of

453
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,310
dollars. This poor bastard
has to sit there and rest.

454
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,730
Oh, he's going to come back fresh
as a daisy. It's going to drive.

455
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,520
It's going to drive cold fence.
Nuts.

456
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,380
Do you have any idea how clear his pores
are going to be having not sweated for

457
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:57,010
four fucking games? All coat fans a
shit and right now, well it's your dead.

458
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,470
He's going to be rusty.
Tom Bailey.

459
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:03,930
Rusty is better than any Indianapolis
Colts fucking quarterback in the history

460
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:07,140
of them being an in Indianapolis.
Now if you want to go back to Baltimore,

461
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,280
they got Johnny Unitas, alright. But
Baltimore is a real fucking football town,

462
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,710
which is why this such Baltimore,
such a great football town,

463
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,680
they accepted the sad sack,

464
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:23,550
Cleveland browns and the second
day went there. What happened?

465
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,570
The whole fucking thing turned around.
The whole thing turned around.

466
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,980
They got out of the pollution and the
vibe of Cleveland and look what the fuck

467
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:36,210
happened. You know what I mean? But
there's hope now for the startup.

468
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:40,550
Cleveland browns. All right,
so to the Gallagher part,

469
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,340
two of the Cleveland Browns,
right?

470
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,080
The ravens sold direct to them.

471
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,790
The original Brown sold direct to
the fucking the junior ones. Right.

472
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,930
And now the Cleveland,
they then,

473
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,120
now they want to fucking championship
right now. All they need.

474
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:59,270
Like this year I'm jumping on, I've got
to jump on the Fucking Red Sox bandwagon.

475
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,240
This is how much I'm on the bandwagon.
I'm going to name every red sock.

476
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,750
I know right now. All right, big PAPI

477
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,100
in Petrolia.
That's all I fucking know.

478
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,030
I told you like fucking 2010,
you know,

479
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,310
by then like the 90th fucking person had
tested positive for roids and I gave up

480
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:22,750
on baseball. It was just like, all right,

481
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,950
either fucking make this shit
legal or get it out of the game.

482
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,690
I'm so sick of getting excited about shit.

483
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:32,470
That's six years you'd tell me
it doesn't really count. So, um,

484
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,020
okay.

485
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,990
You know, this is the best time
of fucking year. I can't wait. Uh,

486
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,370
and my tooth,

487
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:44,371
my first team is obviously the red
sox and then my second team is the,

488
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,880
uh,
the Cleveland Indians.

489
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,850
And then of course I got to root
for the cubs so I'm not a bad guy.

490
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:49,601
Roof my own team.

491
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,790
And then whoever's had the longest
fucking drought and root for them.

492
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,030
You can't get mad at that.
I,

493
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,910
I have an idea right now and I don't
even want any money for major league

494
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:02,290
baseball. I have got an idea. This
is for people like me. All right?

495
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,800
We're all of a sudden your teams
in first place in September.

496
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,500
The only reason why I'm not paying

497
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,400
right now for the MLB package is you're
gonna make me pay for the whole fucking

498
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,350
season.
All right?

499
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,510
This is what you should have
come September 1st. You offer,

500
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,400
uh, you offer the Mlb
Bandwagon bandwagon package.

501
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,510
All right? You charge people for a
month. I mean, I'm telling you right now,

502
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:34,020
you leaving a bunch of money on the table,
all right?

503
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,510
Cause there's a whole bunch of fucking,

504
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:40,260
especially if it's a team like the red
sox, they got fans all around the world,

505
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:42,660
the world, the world,
you know, Yankee fans,

506
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,680
Yankee fans really have fans all
around the world. And I just traveling,

507
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,920
you will always see Yankee gear
the same way. Like over here,

508
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:53,760
if you're going to see some fucking a
soccer where you're going to see man

509
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,350
United for the longest fucking time.

510
00:30:55,351 --> 00:31:00,210
So the amount of fucking money that you're
leaving on the goddamn table telling

511
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,130
him, just throwing it out there,
the Mlb bandwagon package, you know,

512
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:08,880
you know what and you let the people
sign up and then what you do is whatever

513
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:13,370
team they sign up for a is like
a gift. You give them like a, uh,

514
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,760
like a prewarn out baseball hat with
the team logo on it. Like for me,

515
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,070
like a red sox one,
you put like a little salt there.

516
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:22,530
You don't make it seem like I've been
working out where in this fucking thing

517
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:27,390
for years when I really just got
it, you know, just a suggestion.

518
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,670
Just throwing it out there. Oh, by the
way, so somebody sent me a great link. Uh,

519
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:35,900
I should retweet. This is um, you know,

520
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,240
had the origins of all
the NFL football teams.

521
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:42,150
So I went ahead and looked up the rams.
Now that I brought up that question,

522
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,960
like how do they, how do they become the,
the rams when they started in Cleveland,

523
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:49,440
there's no rams out there are mountain
sheep, whatever the fuck they call them.

524
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,110
Uh,

525
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,670
just turns out somebody related to the
people that bought the team was a big fan

526
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:57,270
of this college team. And a lot of
people don't realize this for the first,

527
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,180
like I think decade and a half or so of,
um,

528
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:01,790
okay.

529
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,580
You know, I mean, a couple of decades
for the first couple of decades,

530
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,900
college football was way bigger than,
than the pros.

531
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,860
The pros was considered boring and that,
and old guys and no one gave a fuck.

532
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:15,950
And all these colleges because they'd
already been playing there like a 30 year

533
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:19,940
head start had all these followings
already. I mean, the Ohio State,

534
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:24,050
Michigan thing was already happening
before the NFL even fucking took a snap,

535
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:24,860
I believe.

536
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,693
MMM.

537
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,110
Might be wrong on that. It's been a
while since I read up on that shit.

538
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:33,670
So anyways, um, the way that
they came up with the rams,

539
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,110
there was somebody associated with the
first people that owned that Cleveland

540
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:39,160
Ram Franchise.

541
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,200
And that person was a big fan of this
college program and football program.

542
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,070
And their,

543
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,710
their mascot was the ramps and they
were very successful and everything.

544
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:52,400
So they took the same thing.
So that's how you got the Cleveland Rams.

545
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,890
Um,
and by the way,

546
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,760
here's the sad tale of Saint Louis Sports.

547
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,330
All right.
Um,

548
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,570
I read this the other day, so I'm going
off the top of my fucking dumb dumb,

549
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:10,670
so I might fuck this up.
Saint Louis,

550
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,470
as far as their football goes.

551
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,460
Okay.

552
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,490
They have lost two different
franchises now, but here's the,

553
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,650
here's the reason why they can't be mad.

554
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,160
I'll tell you next time I do a show in St
Louis, this is going to be a rough one,

555
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:27,300
you know,
is they got the cardinals from Chicago.

556
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,430
Yeah,

557
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,430
Saint Louis Cardinals started in Chicago
and then the now Arizona car started in

558
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:36,290
Chicago.
And how they became the cardinals was,

559
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:40,100
they just had these red jerseys and they
said it was a cardinal red and then it

560
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,390
just stuck with them.

561
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:44,450
But they never put the bird on the side
of the helmet to 1960, believe it or not.

562
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,060
So they started in Chicago.

563
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,720
So this is like when Ray Allen came to
the Celtics and then he left for the heat

564
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:55,790
and everybody was getting pissed
in Boston. Like, Oh, what the fuck?

565
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,750
That guy's a trade. It's like, dude,
that's how we got this guy. All right.

566
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,410
If you sign a free agent, it
just put, as a sports fan,

567
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:06,110
you have to understand that's
like dating a stripper. All right?

568
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,010
Don't fucking get too emotionally
involved in that person. All right?

569
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,060
That person has figured out that sports
at the professional level is just that

570
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:16,310
it's a fucking business
so they don't give a fuck.

571
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:17,930
They're going to bounce
around the God damn leak.

572
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,423
MMM.

573
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,970
So anyways, stay. They fucking started
in Chicago, moved to Saint Louis,

574
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:29,971
was there from like 1960 or something
like that in 1950 [inaudible] to 1987.

575
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,320
Okay.

576
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,160
Then they left.

577
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,790
Then they got the Saint Louis Rams in
1996 and they stayed there for 20 seats.

578
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:43,920
Uh, 20 years. 21 seasons, and then
they went back to la. All right.

579
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:45,960
An La got 'em from fucking Cleveland.

580
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:48,570
So La couldn't get mad because
you got them for Cleveland.

581
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,560
Saint Louis can't be mad that they went
back to la cause you got them from La,

582
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,890
you know this,
these are these StreetEasy,

583
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,300
these hoary stripper fucking franchises,

584
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,480
which why it would be so fucking perfect
if Oakland ends up in Las Vegas much to

585
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:05,190
their fans,
sorrow.

586
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,640
I mean that's one of the biggest hoary
franchise of all fucking time where the

587
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,660
Oakland Raiders as well. We're
going to move to la. It's
better here. Oh fuck this.

588
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,010
Oh we get take us back Oakland.
And they do with open arms.

589
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,660
Oakland went back in with open
fucking arbs and look at them now.

590
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,940
Now they're talking about how they're
going to fucking move to Vegas.

591
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,750
That's a travesty, man.
That is a fucking travesty.

592
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,920
I think that the city of Oakland ought
to be able to retain the rights to that

593
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:36,830
fucking logo because that's the best logo,
best uniform.

594
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,420
Certainly in football, if
not all a sports. And um,

595
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,340
yeah, somehow retain it the way the
fucking brown state. It's like, all right,

596
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:49,110
you want to fuck you Cleveland
fans too. It's like, all right,

597
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:53,220
you want to fucking go to Vegas? Yeah,
go be the be the fucking Vegas gamblers,

598
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,940
you know? Um, you know,

599
00:35:56,941 --> 00:36:00,310
but NFL would do that because they're
so fucking pure, even though they, I,

600
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,901
you know,
it's funny,

601
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,330
I can't even remember the name of that
fucking gambling site that they were in

602
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:06,420
bed with last year.
Was it daily something or other

603
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,550
draft kings. Remember those
guys? Everybody fucking
walked away from that shitter.

604
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,660
Um, because everybody bitched at the state
level. They're like, hey, you're cured.

605
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,750
You're gambling in our state. This, we
don't approve of that. You have, fuck you,

606
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,660
you don't approve it.

607
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,080
This is all those kids that draft kings
fucked up is they didn't give everybody

608
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:29,680
a taste. If they gave everybody a
little taste off the Skimm like casino,

609
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,730
give them the skim, every state would have
been fucking fine with it. But anyway,

610
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:37,750
so getting back to St Louis,
so they've had two s sports franchises.

611
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,130
They've never had their own,
though.

612
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,720
They were never awarded a
fucking franchise, which I'm,

613
00:36:43,721 --> 00:36:48,721
I'm calling right now is going to
happen maybe in the next 20 years.

614
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:53,500
When all freckles is 68,
closing in on 70.

615
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:56,560
Still doing pullups
still doing the podcast,

616
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,390
still yelling at his fucking whatever
the fuck it is at that the computer chip

617
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:02,680
in his head at that point.
Right.

618
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,370
I think that they're gonna build a
fucking state of the art stadium and they

619
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:09,610
finally going to get their
own fucking franchise.

620
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,900
Okay. Not some, not some
fucking, uh, you know,

621
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,760
you know, in some retread or some
bullshit like that, right? Some old shoe,

622
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:23,960
you put a new sole on, fuck that.
They're getting a brand new one. Um,

623
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,830
so then you move to that basketball,

624
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,280
they had the saint Louis Hawks,
right,

625
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,980
who I want to say won a championship.

626
00:37:33,981 --> 00:37:37,100
I know we beat them in the NBA finals
and like 58 or something like that.

627
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,570
They fucking move to Atlanta.
So they've lost one basketball team.

628
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,430
They lost to fucking football teams.

629
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,240
And then he,
that brings us to the Saint Louis browns.

630
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,910
The Saint Louis Browns were
initially were designated,

631
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:57,350
I guess to be in Saint Louis,

632
00:37:57,351 --> 00:38:01,850
but for whatever fucking
reason they played one lame
duck year in the early like

633
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:04,910
1900 or something like that.
1899 assumption. Like I said,

634
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:08,090
I read all of this stuff a few days ago.
It's not like I'm some fucking,

635
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,510
I don't take it to this level, but it
just, for me, it was interesting to me,

636
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,810
they fucking played in 1,901 season lame
duck in Milwaukee and weren't actually

637
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:18,680
called the brewers.

638
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,200
Like I don't know how many years before
the Seattle pilots moved over there and

639
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:27,890
became the brewers. I believe that's who
they were before that. That was like,

640
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:31,520
and I don't know what the fuck that was,
the sixties early seventies but anyways,

641
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:34,040
they were the brewers for one year and
then they moved to St Louis and became

642
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:38,830
the Saint Louis Browns and I forget
what the fuck they were named after a,

643
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,920
they took the name from something else
so that they actually one point had two

644
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:45,880
teams. They had the Saint Louis Cardinals,
which is still there, thank God. Right.

645
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,360
And then they had the Saint Louis
Proud to Saint Louis Browns,

646
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,440
eventually moved to Baltimore and became
the second coming of the Baltimore

647
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,030
Orioles. Cause the first port of
Baltimore Oriole team moved to New York,

648
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,870
was called the New York islanders.
And then they became the New York Yankees.

649
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:07,750
Believe it or not, they originally
from fucking Baltimore Self.

650
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:11,170
That brings us back to Saint Louis.
All right.

651
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,560
The Saint Louis Baseball cardinals
and the St Louis Blues. All right.

652
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,550
That stuff that has to be the heart
of the city. Even though, you know,

653
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,160
the St Louis Blues had been breaking
their fucking arts every year. They still,

654
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,890
you still got a level right.
And the cardinals,

655
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,360
other than the Yankees have the most,
the most championships with like 11.

656
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,420
How fucking nuts is that?
That's the closest team to the Yankees.

657
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:38,950
It's still 16 a decade and a half
of winning straight plus one year.

658
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,680
Um, no wait, is that
right? Yeah, yeah. Anyways.

659
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,550
Um,
so they've lost two football teams,

660
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,620
a basketball team in a baseball team.
They've lost four fucking teams.

661
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,130
Okay. And I'm trying to have
empathy for the Saint Louis Fan,

662
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,290
but at some point people of Saint Louis,

663
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,980
you gotta be looking at yourself and you
got to start asking the right questions.

664
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,590
Like,
what am I bringing to the table?

665
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,610
What am I not bring it to the table that
is making this franchise turn around

666
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:14,470
and look up in the stands and be like, we
gotta get the Fuck Outta here. You know,

667
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,000
you've got no one to blame but yourself,
Saint Louis not fucking with you. Um,

668
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,090
it sucks.
Hopefully they'll get their own,

669
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,970
they'll get their own franchise
some day. They deserve it. Right?

670
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,020
I would think so. Like the level of
hockey fan and baseball fan. I mean,

671
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,780
Saint Louis Fans, people, uh,

672
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,150
routinely say are the greatest
baseball fans out there, you know,

673
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,250
as knowledgeable as Boston, red
sox fans without a, what's up g?

674
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,700
It's going on, don't you feeling all right
buddy. None and none of the aggression,

675
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,200
you know. Um, so anyways,

676
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,870
so that should be enough time,
right? Oh Geez. I did 40 minutes.

677
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,360
They did a little overtime for you there.
Um,

678
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,050
I want to say there was one of the
things I wanted to talk about. Oh, so I,

679
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,280
I watched the first rams game.
I've decided that, uh, I'm gonna,

680
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,340
you know, I'm going, I'm going to root
for the ramps that they're out. I mean,

681
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:06,760
I'm Patriots Fan, but like I'm going
to watch them out here because, uh,

682
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,770
it's cool man. There in the division
with the cardinals, 40 niners Seattle,

683
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,610
I never get to watch this division.
It's fucking great. And uh,

684
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:19,390
I was sick of watching charger games
for God's sakes. Jesus fucking Christ,

685
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:25,270
you know, this is certain diseases,
certain level of fucking uh,

686
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,750
masochism you have to have to be
a fucking San Diego charger fan.

687
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,980
I don't know what the fuck they did.

688
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,100
I don't know if that stadium is built
on an old native American grave site.

689
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:38,630
I don't know what the fuck those people
ever got. Dad Did. But Jesus Christ,

690
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,461
Jesus Christ,

691
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:43,970
not only the way they lose the way they
just rip those people and maybe they're

692
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:48,290
just paying the price for the absolute
most perfect weather in the United States.

693
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,250
San Diego, something has to give. What
do you want? You want perfect weather,

694
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:57,080
three 65 or you want fucking 16 Sundays,

695
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,250
you know of right there Fred.
You know what I mean?

696
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,450
That didn't make sense.
I'm saying you the tradeoff,

697
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,940
the tradeoff is you get the
old right there, Fred for
16 Sundays out of the year,

698
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,420
three 65 minus 16 is
three 49 of beautiful,

699
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,820
of absolute fucking beauty.
Most people would take that.

700
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,120
Certainly not sports fans. All right, I
think I'm done here. Yeah. That rams camp,

701
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,810
Jesus Christ. Was that a fucking, was
that brutal of what Steve Young said?

702
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:28,280
The funniest shit. And if you guys caught
a right before halftime, he goes, uh, he,

703
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,660
they showed, I guess, um,

704
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,870
the rams have some high level
draft pick or something like that.

705
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:33,860
Or are they traded for somebody?

706
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,370
It's like a backup quarterback or some
kid just learn it. And Steve Young's like,

707
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:40,280
yeah, he's going to stand
there on the sideline, you
know, hold a clipboard and a,

708
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:43,460
you know, just watch and try and learn,
you know, and then he paused and he goes,

709
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,870
I don't know what he's learned.
Yeah.

710
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,703
Tonight.

711
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,750
I can't believe the only had 85 yards
of total offense, something like that.

712
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,160
It seemed to me like they add a little
more than that, but um, whatever.

713
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,610
So I'm happy. Philosophy. Angela, she
finally got NFL football back here.

714
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:01,010
My condolences to St Louis,

Putting the good vibes out there.
The next time you get your own.

716
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,790
Not a fucking retread.

717
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:11,300
Moving in at the fucking Oakland Raiders.
Fuck Vegas. We're going to Saint Louis.

718
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,500
You're going to get your own.

719
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,200
And what would you, what would you call
it? Give it a nice, good Midwestern name.

00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:14,260
they wanted to break up with somebody and
I was saying, listen, you gotta listen.

the breakup was minivan men podcast,

but

833
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:40,330
I don't know why. I never really listened
to him when I was growing up. You know,

834
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:43,540
Mama said knock you out. Oh,
did chic? Is that what she said?

835
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:46,990
Ll Cool J I don't care. You
know, I just wasn't into it.

836
00:51:46,991 --> 00:51:51,400
And his deodorant and his armpits when
he was jamming with those white guys.

837
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,500
I just, I never got into
it. But lately, lately,

838
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,110
I dunno. I Dunno what
happened. I, Geez, just come

839
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,710
onto my youtube shit.
I don't know what it is,

840
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:05,620
but I was listening to some
of his stuff. Oh, I know why.

841
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:07,180
Yesterday I was trying to remember like,

842
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:12,210
what was that song he used to have that
I'm the type of guy and you're the type

843
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:15,220
of guy,
but what the fuck was that?

844
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,120
And then I listened to it and I kind
of liked it, but I hated that. Oh,

845
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:22,420
we owe part of it really
annoyed me. I'm like, oh,

846
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:24,070
that's why I never downloaded this shit.

847
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:27,730
But then on the side they
had a ll cool j big old,

848
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:32,090
but you know, I play drums at Michael.
Let me hear what this track sounds like.

849
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:32,800
Can I put it on?

850
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,800
And he basically teaches you how to
break up with a girl and that song,

851
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:42,850
but that rap or that, uh, that rhyme,
whatever, however you supposed to say it,

852
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,500
he breaks it down and just
in like fucking 11 seconds,

853
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,930
he sits his girls down.

854
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,580
He's basically hanging out and like some
sunglass hut or some shit and some girl

855
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:59,581
comes in with an insane ass and
he does what every guy does.

856
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:04,030
He stares at and he thinks I want to fuck
that. But Oh shit, I have a girlfriend.

857
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,490
So what does he do? Does
he sneak around on her? No,

858
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,560
he goes home and he sits her
down and he says, listen,

859
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:17,590
I met this girl named Tina.
Okay. Tina's got a big old,

860
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:22,591
but I know that I said I'd
be true really whiteness up.

861
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,170
But Tina a big old butt.
So I'm leaving you. It's,

862
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:32,760
I mean that's just fucking air tight.
You can't fuck with that.

863
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,180
He was 100% I don't know. She
could get mad. I think that's that.

864
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,280
I think women's show expect guys to be
lion weaselly pieces of shit that if you

865
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:47,700
actually hit him with
that level of honesty,

866
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,460
I think they would just be stunned.
Just like the check in the video.

867
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:55,170
Like I didn't think that
that was bad acting.

868
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:58,110
I think that they would absolutely be
stunned if you just came home and said,

869
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:01,230
listen,
I met this girl.

870
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,250
I know that I said it'd be faithful to
you, but she's better looking than you,

871
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:06,690
so I'm breaking up with you.

872
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,710
Oh well what is the comeback?

873
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:17,230
There's nothing that'd be like if
your girl came home and said, listen,

874
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:20,620
I know we're together,
but this guy,

875
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,580
you know I met him at the mall is Dick
is twice the size of yours and he's got a

876
00:54:24,581 --> 00:54:27,940
better car. So it's kind
of a no brainer. Amati

877
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,700
what are you going to do?

878
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,720
What are you gonna do with your little
dick in your fucking Domino's pizza?

879
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:39,340
It's over. You just got to fucking be
like, you know, you only go around once.

880
00:54:39,341 --> 00:54:43,450
So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it.

881
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:48,940
So anyway, so if you don't have
time to a email Al Madrigal,

882
00:54:48,941 --> 00:54:49,780
which you should,

883
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,300
which you should just listen
to a ll cool j big old bud.

884
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:02,290
You got to see his face when he
goes. So I'm leaving you. It's,

885
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,620
it's w I don't, can't explain it.
It's way meaner than it has to be.

886
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:10,060
That's what it makes it funny

887
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:14,920
cause there's a way to read that where
you're kind of letting them down easily,

888
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:19,030
you know, but he, then he
just did it like, yeah,

889
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,530
this is how it works. So they,
you'd go look at that on a holiday.

890
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:29,680
Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning
podcast. It is the end of May. Everybody.

891
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,110

894
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,070

I have a computer. I don't
need to think right. It has.

898
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:04,960
Why is it in September?
Oh, for Christ sake,

899
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,630

It has 31 days.

900
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,301
All right,

901
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:15,040
so you had till have you guys have until
Thursday midnight to make something of

902
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:19,510
May, 2012 all right, are you
on a fucking relationship?

903
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:22,840
You don't want to be in?
Do you want to be in this?

904
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,360
You don't want to be in,
in June.

905
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,320
Why don't you celebrate the end of
May by getting out of your fucking

906
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:31,780
relationship and sitting down

907
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,990
and basically just go
with the ll cool j vibe.

908
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:43,050
Hold her hand and just go straight up
honesty and then what she going to do.

909
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,450
But what's he going to do if
they're going to flip the fuck out,

910
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,370
but the the die has been
cast to ship is said sale.

911
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:55,660
The ball is already rolling, the
sun is setting, the rain has fallen.

912
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:00,580
Whatever the fuck you want to call it.
It's out there. Just put it out there.

913
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,350
Let them scream and yell.
And in your head as much as it sucks,

914
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,220
you're going to be like,
okay, I did it. I did it.

915
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,760
Now I just got to sit here
and get yelled at and uh,

916
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,670
how long could somebody really yelled
before they lose their voice? An hour,

917
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,090
90 minutes and an hour and a half.

918
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,070
I'm going to be in the car listening to
ll cool j driving away from that thing I

919
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,800
didn't want to be in. All right then.
I know I talk about this shit a lot,

920
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:27,340
but I think a lot of people
are in situations like this
and they don't know how

921
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,910
to sit. Somebody dumb it
just say, so I'm leaving you.

922
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,793
Yeah.

923
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,170
You know, if I was ll cool
J and I stop, you know,

924
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:42,030
selling tickets and all that type of shit,

925
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:44,850
that would be a side business
that I would have. I would take,

926
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,210
okay,

927
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:50,740
that little fucking rhyme that he had
and I would custom do it for everybody in

928
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:54,610
their life and just, and then people
could just write you all right,

929
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,080
I need to charge it. You charge them 100
bucks and he would write you a, you know,

930
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:04,750
four bars.
It all rhymes and you just get out exactly

931
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,110
what you say it,
you know.

932
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,050
Okay.

933
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:15,610
Just be like you eat with your mouth
open. I know I said that. That'd be true.

934
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:23,900
But you eat with your mouth open so
I'm leaving you. It just get right.

935
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:28,790
You just get right down to it.
Your mom is a fucking con.

936
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,640
I know,
I said I'd be true,

937
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,440
but she's fucking always coming over
here and something that rhymes with Katya

938
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:39,620
and I, you got, you got the idea by Jesus
Christ. What am I going to be yellow?

939
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,463
One

940
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,710
thing was missing.

941
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,450
Oh my God.
Here's one for you guys.

942
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,240
My boyfriend wants to have his
four skin restored. By the way,

943
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,950
how fresh and new are these,
uh, these emails here?

944
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,500
Just because it's coming from the female
perspective. I love this shit. All right,

945
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,540
that's saying,
I don't want guys to email it,

946
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:30,770
but I would like to have a nice balance
here. I already say enough shit.

947
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:35,390
Trash and women. So it helps if women
come and trash and guys, because,

948
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:39,980
uh, I, you know, it'll, it'll be
a nice balance here. All right.

949
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,520
My boyfriend wants to have his
for skin restored. Dear bill,

950
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:48,170
I wanted to get your take on a situation
I'm in with my current boyfriend. Uh,

951
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,630
I'm a girl. All right. A few weeks ago,

952
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:55,490
my boyfriend of two years told me
that he's become totally upset that he

953
00:59:55,491 --> 01:00:00,491
circumcised and wants to restore his for
skin via taping and stretching methods.

954
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,663
What,

955
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,160
and basically why he wants to do this
is because everybody, they say that, um,

956
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:16,050
intercourse you, you lose like, I don't
know, some percentage of sensitivity

957
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,140
when you have,
you're forced skin removed and um,

958
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:21,360
okay.

959
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:26,100
All I can say is no guy can tell the
difference whether he has a four skin or

960
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:26,934
whether he doesn't.

961
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,870
Because unless you got laid when
you were fucking six weeks old,

962
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,390
you don't know what you're
gaining or what you're missing.

963
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:35,370
So I don't understand
why you would do this.

964
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,920
So t by restore his forced can via
taping and stretching methods, she goes,

965
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:44,970
I know, I know. It makes me want
to throw up just thinking about it.

966
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,310
I want him to tell him, I
think he's out of his mind. Uh,

967
01:00:50,311 --> 01:00:52,800
but I don't want to hurt his feelings.
The thing is,

968
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:57,801
I'm totally grossed out by the idea
of for skin penises are gross enough

969
01:00:59,611 --> 01:01:03,990
already. There's no need to make
it even grosser. Uh, you know,

970
01:01:03,991 --> 01:01:06,600
what am I the only guy that
totally agrees with that?

971
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:09,330
Is there anything more fucking disgusting?

972
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,400
Then I'll fucking flacid
for skin covered dish.

973
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,100
I didn't know what it looks like.

974
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:19,990
Yeah,

975
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:23,880
it looks like I got a fucking,
I don't know what it looks like.

976
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:31,100
I, it's, it's just fucking disgusting.
I don't even have like a reference.

977
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:36,290
Looks like an Elephant Dick. I don't
even know what to say. It's just gross.

978
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:40,790
It's fucking disgusting. Um, she goes,

979
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,740
obviously I can't tell him how I feel.

980
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,680
He's clearly having a
really hard time with this.

981
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:50,600
He tells me that he feels violated
and disfigured. This guy's a pussy,

982
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,600
this throat, this throw this
guy into the fucking pussy, Ben,

983
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:54,620
and get on with your life.

984
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,940
He also claims that for skins has a
lot of advantage for both partners,

985
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:04,270
but it's hard for me to totally buy that
considering the fact I have slept with

986
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:09,260
a couple uncircumcised guy and I
didn't notice any extra pleasure.

987
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,730
Although I did use a condom
with both guys. Yeah,

988
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:17,720
he's full of Shit. He's full of Shit.
It may be more pleasure for him.

989
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,500
I don't know what I mean.

990
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,250
I think it's amazing that women will
put a dick in their mouths, you know?

991
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:26,670
At least you can do is try and tidy up
down there. You know? How about happened?

992
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,500
Little fucking empathy.

993
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:30,400
Okay.

994
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,780
I've asked you this discussion.
It's just fucking extra skin. Yeah.

995
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:39,160
Nothing more sexy or then
extra skin. Yeah. Yeah.

996
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:42,220
It's like your Dick used to be
obese and then lost a ton of weight,

997
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:47,140
but didn't have enough money to have
that surgery. They get rid of the extra.

998
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,970
Ah, that's gross. There's
another two paragraphs,

999
01:02:51,971 --> 01:02:56,170
people just just preparing you for
another two paragraphs of having an

1000
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,940
uncircumcised stretch taped
dick in your head. Anyway,

1001
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:05,320
I think it's absolutely disgusting and
totally weird that he wants to do this

1002
01:03:05,321 --> 01:03:09,190
and I'm starting to get really turned off
by the idea of sleeping with him while

1003
01:03:09,191 --> 01:03:13,030
he's stretching out. As for good,
he told me he's going to tape it

1004
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,180
okay.

1005
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,860
To an elastic strap,
which is going to tie around his leg.

1006
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:22,100
I know. What the fuck is he just
coming up with this shit on his own.

1007
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,170
I told him that he should see a
doctor before he starts to do this,

1008
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:28,004
but he doesn't want,

1009
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:32,030
but he doesn't think that doctors know
much about this sort of thing. Oh,

1010
01:03:32,031 --> 01:03:36,440
so he's just going to take it in his
own hands. Congratulations sweetheart.

1011
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,090
You're dating a fucking moron.

1012
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:40,933
Okay,

1013
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,860
come on. This is the
father. You had children?

1014
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,330
Yeah.

1015
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:48,900
Coming up with, you know, taking an
erector set to his fucking Dick. It was,

1016
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,380
it's the you.

1017
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,810
Yeah.

1018
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,160
Do I have to finish reading this?

1019
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:54,860
Yeah.

1020
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,640
I'm thinking of breaking it off
with them really. Course you are.

1021
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,680
I thought he was a normal guy,

1022
01:04:00,681 --> 01:04:04,430
but I had no idea he had all this freaky
shit going on underneath the surface.

1023
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:07,550
Anyways.
What do you think about all of this?

1024
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,920
You got to go ll cool J.
Yeah,

1025
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,890
it's got to do what he did.

1026
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,350
Okay.

1027
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:21,610
You're stretching out your fucking
Dick. I know. I said I'd be true.

1028
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,590
You're stretching out your fucking Dick.
So I'm leaving you go fuck yourself.

1029
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:31,270
It's over. Yeah. Fucking gross.

1030
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,380
Anyway, what do you think? All this,

1031
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:37,720
am I justified dumping him away or would
that make me an insensitive comment?

1032
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:40,450
No,
it would make you as strong person.

1033
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:42,140
Okay.

1034
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,820
All right.
You go with your gut on this one.

1035
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,320
Yeah.

1036
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,970
This guy is trying to to
do the impossible, like,

1037
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,300
uh, like he said, fucking
scientist in that Michael J.

1038
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,620
Fox movie back to the future.

1039
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,150
Okay.

1040
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,370
He's basically,
you know,

1041
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:04,600
doing the Delorean bullshit with his Dick
and he doesn't want to go see a doctor.

1042
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,030
Any doctor would tell them,
you can't do that.

1043
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:08,430
Okay.

1044
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,440
You'll be funny though,
was if you dumped this guy right,

1045
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:15,360
and it actually works and then he starts
screaming like Billy Mays on TV with

1046
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:19,240
his, his Dick Stretcher
and he sells it for 1995.

1047
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:24,070
It makes a zillion dollar. I'm just
playing devil's advocate here. You know,

1048
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:29,120
there's a 99% chance you're
doing the right thing,

1049
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:32,850
but there is a 1% chance you
could be walking away from a,

1050
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,400
a potential millionaire.
Cause I gotta be honest with you,

1051
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:40,910
if that guy actually pulls this off,
no pun intended,

1052
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:42,680
he pulls this off.

1053
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:43,940
Okay.

1054
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,510
And he's able to do it with some
household material and then he,

1055
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,490
you know, Pete, they already make
millions of dollars with those,

1056
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:54,250
those pills that say they're
going to make your Dick Bigger,

1057
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,910
which we all know it doesn't
work because of it fucking work.

1058
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,420
That would be an international story.
And um,

1059
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,810
and then it still wouldn't work because
then what would happen was everybody

1060
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:06,190
would take big dick pills,

1061
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:10,060
even guys with big dicks because they
don't want everybody else catching up with

1062
01:06:10,061 --> 01:06:10,540
them.

1063
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:15,540
So then having a little dick would
then be like having a six inch dick as

1064
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:17,830
opposed to a three inch,
four inch Dick. Right.

1065
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:19,490
Okay.

1066
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:22,950
It's a math workout on that or get bumped
up. You've got to six, seven inch Dick.

1067
01:06:22,951 --> 01:06:26,300
He just, he just regular, no,
you're actually not regular. Yeah,

1068
01:06:26,301 --> 01:06:27,180
you'd have a little Dick.

1069
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,120
Okay,

1070
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,400
so if this guy actually
fucking is able to pull this,

1071
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:32,810
that doesn't even make sense.

1072
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,700
He's going, he, if he
thought he was disfigured,

1073
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:43,230
now wait till he tries to fucking do this.
I mean his dick is going to look like,

1074
01:06:43,231 --> 01:06:45,540
you know when those people
put that shit their ear lobes.

1075
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:47,123
Okay.

1076
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:52,240
They put those fucking,
those circular circular things.

1077
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:56,410
You could shoot a God damn fucking bow
and Arrow through somebody's ear lobe and

1078
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:57,520
not drawing any blood.

1079
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,630
He's going to do that to his deck except
he's not going to have that thing in

1080
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:04,270
there and he's just going to be
hanging out. Wrightsville we got it.

1081
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,104
It's disgusting.

1082
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:57,960
Hey,
what's going on?

1083
01:07:57,961 --> 01:08:01,230
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

1084
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,700
June 25th could you hear me
looking for the date there?

1085
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:07,170
I kind of like was looking and I,

1086
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:11,050
June 25th June 25th and this,

1087
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,250
sorry. I'm actually excited
because doing it Sunday night,

1088
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:21,080
so this fucking thing is going to be
up at midnight west coast time in the

1089
01:08:21,081 --> 01:08:25,310
continental United States, which means
I don't have to deal with anybody,

1090
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:29,460
you know, giving me shit. Yeah.
They went to fleck. You know what?

1091
01:08:29,461 --> 01:08:32,950
What the fuck right back at you.
I'm going to Greg.

1092
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:37,900
Goddamn move my Lady Lady.

1093
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:43,200
You have left this state and I am all
alone now and I'm remembering what it was

1094
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:48,244
like.

1095
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:49,783
Okay.

1096
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,730
Oh Man.

1097
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:56,560
I just made my freckled ass
so motherfucking chicken.

1098
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:01,210
I had boneless id bone,
those thighs too,

1099
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,310
like a motherfucker. I'm a
such a stupid move. I A had a,

1100
01:09:06,311 --> 01:09:09,250
had boneless chicken breasts.
No boneless chicken thighs.

1101
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:14,070
Um, and brought Brock. Sorry,

1102
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:18,900
I can't say that word without, I can't
say Broccoli without a, an Asian accent.

1103
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:20,340
I don't know why.
I know why.

1104
01:09:20,341 --> 01:09:22,590
Because when I lived in New
York City and I was broke,

1105
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,460
there was a Chinese restaurant around
the corner and I always ordered chicken

1106
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:30,660
and Broccoli. Okay. If I wasn't
eating sketti with fucking Prego,

1107
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:31,950
I would call up every once in a while.

1108
01:09:31,951 --> 01:09:36,060
I would treat myself with little
Chinese food and I would call up.

1109
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:40,350
They like hello, number one.
I'm like, Hey, number one,
what's up? Can I get a good,

1110
01:09:40,351 --> 01:09:42,550
I get chicken and Broccoli.
They made chicken, Broccoli.

1111
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:48,930
And ever since that I've said that.

1112
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:53,280
So just in case you thought I had
any, uh, Chinese blood in me, I don't,

1113
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:57,650
I consider those people, my friends
for all the chicken, Broccoli,

1114
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:01,170
they made me back in the late 90.
So sounds like an apology.

1115
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,370
Like a corporate apology.

1116
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:07,430
I had no dealings with
number one Chinese food.

1117
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,950
Uh, I did stop in there
on a number of occasions.

1118
01:10:10,951 --> 01:10:15,030
I did partake in some of the
cuisine that was offered,

1119
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:19,980
but at no time was there any inappropriate
touching underneath that filthy

1120
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:23,550
fucking glass that I don't
think it was bulletproof.

1121
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:26,340
You know,

1122
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:29,640
I'll tell you the Chinese restaurants in
fucking New York where I lived anyways

1123
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:33,660
when I was on the upper east side,
Jesus Christ, you know what I mean?

1124
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:37,890
It was like you'd have some either
it was either rusty, rusty, great.

1125
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:42,891
Between you and the other person or
just filthy glass plastic or some shit.

1126
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,500
I Dunno. Why don't I don't, oh Christ.
I don't even know what I'm saying.

1127
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,140
Look at my dog. Just fucking
lay in there. Can you,

1128
01:10:49,141 --> 01:10:52,590
can he get a God damn job and you know,
contribute.

1129
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,440
Okay.

1130
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,810
Actually Jealous. Thanks. Fucking
skinny as hell dude with dogs.

1131
01:10:58,811 --> 01:11:03,280
Emaciated. Dropped her off at the trainer.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

1132
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,600
Yeah, we'll be, what were you
doing over there? All right, let's,

1133
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:11,530
let's get the podcast. Let's get
it. Let's get it back under control.

1134
01:11:11,531 --> 01:11:15,210
I didn't do shit to this anyways,
so my woman's out of town. My Lady,

1135
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:19,440
she's out of town. So, uh, you know what's
funny is she keeps checking in on me.

1136
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,550
You know, what are you doing?
What's going on? You know,

1137
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,570
and you don't want it is,
it's one because she misses me into,

1138
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:32,630
because they think that we're fucking
morons and she just wants to hear.

1139
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:38,310
I like how, what a difficult time
I'm having without her, you know,

1140
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,130
like, ah, I don't really
know how to make cereal like,

1141
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:45,480
like I'm some Sitcom fucking
guy. All right? It's not,

1142
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:49,950
I was going down. I did the fucking
laundry. I made myself a healthy dinner.

1143
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,750
A protein, no bigger than the size of my
head. Isn't that what we supposed to eat?

1144
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,220
And uh, in some fun. A
vegetable. All right,

1145
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:02,730
go fuck yourself if you know what,
I had a great time doing it.

1146
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:06,450
I haven't cooked in years.
And you know why?

1147
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,930
Because my woman is
oppressive in the kitchen.

1148
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,620
She loves cooking. So anytime I
go to cook, she comes in there.

1149
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:17,430
She's looking over my fucking shoulder.
Just why you kind of come up that way.

1150
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:21,560
Why don't you think you're like, I
fucking fuck you. You fucking do it. Why?

1151
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:27,570
I'm fucking trying to
make you a God damn meals.

1152
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:31,230
One of the nicest thing somebody can
do for you. Prepare a meal for you.

1153
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:35,850
Just sit there. Shut the fuck up and let
me do you think. What do you think I did?

1154
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,430
800 800 gut damn garbage
kids before I met you.

1155
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:44,140
She just gives me shit about the way I
make my eggs because she, you know, we,

1156
01:12:44,141 --> 01:12:46,800
he says, I always, whenever I
make scrambled eggs or whatever,

1157
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,190
like there's too much egg gets stuck to
the fucking pan and it's a pain in the

1158
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:55,020
ass to watch, to wash. I
mean, you know, it's like,

1159
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:58,950
I'm sorry I don't spray it with,
you know, fuck the ozone layer Pam.

1160
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,670
Every God damn time dripping with
the shit and when it doesn't stick,

1161
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:07,670
I'm surprised it doesn't fucking slide
right off onto the floor. This is,

1162
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,551
you know what,
this is what,

1163
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:12,180
this year just listening to a pathetic
man whose site that he's finally in his

1164
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:16,170
place by himself and he can just deliver
his entire argument without being

1165
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:20,520
interrupted. So, uh, I'm telling you,

1166
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,900
she wants to come back and as much
as she wants the place to be neat,

1167
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:28,530
she wants it to be a fucking disaster.
She wants to feel needed.

1168
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:33,860
She wants to feel that I am fucking
lost without her and I'm such a cunt.

1169
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:40,050
I am not going to let that happen.
This place is going to be spotless.

1170
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,320
It's going to be ready for one
of those movie drill sergeants.

1171
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,350
You know those guys that get in your face,

1172
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,900
you know he can come over here and
bounce a fucking quarter right off my God

1173
01:13:49,901 --> 01:13:53,700
damn face ever.
Whatever the fuck they do off the beds.

1174
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:57,090
She's the very thing I wouldn't
ever make it in the military.

1175
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:59,250
I'm supposed to be able to
bounce a fucking court. Why?

1176
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,930
Why you supposed to be
able to bounce a quarter?

1177
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:05,910
Why does that somehow make me uh,
you know better at fighting the enemy.

1178
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:09,450
If I can throw dirty change
at a blanket and then,

1179
01:14:09,451 --> 01:14:13,390
and then catch it like the fonts.
You know, what happened to you sir?

1180
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,100
What did you really want to do? Get? Oh,

1181
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:18,880
did you really want to do this
and scream at Pete? That was your,

1182
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:23,380
that was your dream to scream at
people for your entire fucking life.

1183
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:27,770
That's what you wanted to do
with that Hitler Fade.

1184
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,880
Do you know Hitler had like a fresh
prince from Bel Air Haircut mixed with a

1185
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:44,760
Martin Sheen in apocalypse. He was
Martin Sheen, apocalypse now on top.

1186
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:48,290
But he had like,
he had a fade down below that,

1187
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:51,300
that will Smith's character with the
eight ball leather jacket would have,

1188
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:54,180
would have loved you would've loved it.
I'm sorry.

1189
01:14:54,181 --> 01:14:57,870
I've been watching a lot of shit about
fucking mass murderer lately and he

1190
01:14:57,871 --> 01:14:59,520
always comes up. Of course.
You know what I mean?

1191
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:03,330
Gay and have a think about mass
murders without Hitler, right?

1192
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,530
Just can't fucking do it.

1193
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:10,350
Can't have a rock show without Zeplin
man, stairway to heaven. You know,

1194
01:15:10,351 --> 01:15:14,430
that's what it is. You got to fucking
ham. That shit in there. So I'm,

1195
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:18,320
so that's my goal. That's my goal.
And I'm actually wrestling with this.

1196
01:15:18,321 --> 01:15:23,321
Should I leave the place a little bit
dirty so she feels like wanted or should I

1197
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,720
be, should I just go
fucking like, you know,

1198
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:34,350
just come with the pimp vibe.
Like this place is fucking spotless.

1199
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:38,280
All right? So you need to be on
Umi. Need to mind your p's and q's.

1200
01:15:38,281 --> 01:15:41,640
Whatever the fuck those letters stand for,
what does it stand for?

1201
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,450
Somebody is going to know somebody
actually knows what, when you know,

1202
01:15:45,451 --> 01:15:48,540
when you say mind your p's and q's,
there's some Douche. Listen to this. Yeah,

1203
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,310
you're a dose.
All right.

1204
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:53,790
That knows what the fuck that stands
for and they've just been waiting for

1205
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:58,500
somebody. You'll fuck it up all excited
so they can be like, I know what it means.

1206
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:00,240
Well,
send me a god damn email and by the way,

1207
01:16:00,241 --> 01:16:03,300
I haven't said the email for a
while here. Oh, what a segue.

1208
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,280
Fucking classic right there.
I should teach a fucking podcast class.

1209
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:11,190
Uh,
you know somebody's going to do that.

1210
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:14,730
Someone's got to teach a podcast class
the same way somebody teach a comedy

1211
01:16:14,731 --> 01:16:17,760
class and that's what you
do when you're failing.

1212
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:22,440
Whenever you're failing at what you do,
you teach it. All right, there we go.

1213
01:16:22,441 --> 01:16:25,440
We just insulted teachers. Um, all right,

1214
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:29,430
the email is bill@themmpodcast.com.

1215
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:34,620
Bill at the capital m,
capital m,

1216
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:39,390
capital P odcast.com bill at
the end, podcast.com. All right.

1217
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:41,850
If you don't fucking know what it by now,

1218
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:46,620
just hit stop and rewind on your
little player and you'll be fine.

1219
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,740
Um, oh, by the way, can you guys, I know,

1220
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:53,280
I really appreciate all the input and
all that stuff that you guys send to me

1221
01:16:53,281 --> 01:16:54,900
because God knows if he
didn't send it to me,

1222
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,620
I wouldn't be able to do this podcast.
See without you,

1223
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,690
I'm nothing is,

1224
01:17:00,691 --> 01:17:05,640
they slowly dim the lights and I go
into some sort of pandering fucking song

1225
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:12,170
like that Jackson Browne song singing
about the roadies. Like he gives a shit,

1226
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:13,963
you know,

1227
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:17,320
I think he fucking pissed them off and
they weren't set in his piano upright.

1228
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,910
So he wrote them a song just so they
stopped fucking with them so he could get

1229
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:22,640
worried of his tour and then
somehow he goes out of that. Right?

1230
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,500
Just fucking the whole thing is,
I hate pandering.

1231
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,013
I don't like it.

1232
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:30,661
And you know,

1233
01:17:30,661 --> 01:17:34,300
the only one of the worst
part of pandering is watching
a performer go on stage

1234
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:38,650
and pander to the audience is watching
you fucking animals. Eat it up.

1235
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,990
Eat it up every God damn time,

1236
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,620
okay?

1237
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,610
I go to jail. You Sob did we played
a lot of cities but Hartford,

1238
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:50,050
you guys,
you guys are the best in every way.

1239
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,170
Okay?

1240
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:54,250
Give me a fucking break.

1241
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:56,870
Okay?

1242
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:58,340
There's nothing good about Hartford.

1243
01:17:59,540 --> 01:17:59,970
Okay?

1244
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,820
You know, you don't believe me? Ask The
whalers. Why do you think they left?

1245
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,510
You couldn't even hold onto the fucking
whalers. How does that make you feel?

1246
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:09,344
Hard for too.

1247
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,213
Okay.

1248
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:16,210
You know why they left? Because
that's stupid ass song. You
splay. Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam.

1249
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:19,690
What's it called? The the,
the brass city orchestra.

1250
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:25,070
[inaudible]

1251
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:57,520
good.
