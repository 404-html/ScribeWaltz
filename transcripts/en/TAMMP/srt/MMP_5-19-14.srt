1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,630
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,730
May 19th,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,580
2048 barometric pressure
outside is about 75 both. Um,

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,060
welcome. Welcome to another
edition of this. Um,

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,470
I don't know what the fuck it is.
It's a God damn podcast. All right.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,980
What are you doing right now?
Are you at the gym? So it's,

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,360
somebody told me recently you always
think were cubicles when I can kill,

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,360
because some of us are on treadmills.
So hello to all the people on treadmills.

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,450
Ah, you're running at this
point and you're just starting.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,710
He just started on your treadmills,
on your treadmill, I should say,

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,690
unless you're running on more than one,
I mean you're, that dude is the Douche,

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,100
the treadmill Douche in the gym right now.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,640
You know that person who for some reason
I do burn more calories when you go

14
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:51,650
backwards,
you know?

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,690
Or is that some sort of mating ritual
where you get your ball sent fucking blown

16
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:00,500
the other way and that somehow attracts
the women on the elliptical behind you?

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,080
I don't know what it is.
You ever seen these fucking jerk offs?

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,360
They run backwards.

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,340
Then they go sideways because I got to
have a lot of lateral movement and the

20
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:11,240
fucking office.

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,810
You never know when the boss is going
to call an audible and start pointing to

22
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,270
your side of the fucking tubes.
Right?

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,250
Like you turn it around yelling at
cornerback down on the fucking break room.

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,910
What are you running sideways for?
Why are you running backwards?

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,290
You fuck a Dosha? Then you fall and you
break your tail bone and who do you sue?

26
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,610
Huh? Chicago fitness.
Whatever the fuck you at.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,430
Whatever the fuck you at. Wherever
the fuck your at. Sorry. All right.

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,890
You know what?

29
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,920
I have to admit something and I have
to call just to the people of Chicago.

30
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:49,340
When I pictured somebody in Chicago
running backwards, I pictured, you know,

31
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,950
a fat guy with a mustache in a bear's hat.

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,990
You guys really have never outlive
that sketch in my, I guess in my world,

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,500
you know Deb bears and I know
nobody says that they're,

34
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,430
they might say a version of it,
but nobody says that. But to me,

35
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:08,320
you guys were always going to be
those, those, those guys. I mean I,

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,670
you probably shouldn't give a
fuck what I think, but you know,

37
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:14,810
somewhere somewhere there's somebody
in Chicago that does give a shit.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,670
You give a shit.

39
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,540
You know what you guys need to do to
lift just fucking self esteem out there

40
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,310
with that whole second city horse shit.

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,510
The next generation of babies that are
born and turn instead of telling them

42
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:29,420
it's Lake Michigan,
just tell them it's an ocean.

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,760
Yeah.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,230
Michigan Ocean Assam Shit.

45
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:36,520
And maybe you'll have the arrogance of
someone who lives on the coast and people

46
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,020
will start taking you seriously.

47
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,610
Yeah.

48
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,220
What are you going to say
right now? CHICAGO? Huh? Oh,

49
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:44,920
what about our Chicago Black Hawks talkie?

50
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,500
You're not controlling finance
like they are in New York City.

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,700
How many old people are you
stealing from in Chicago right now?

52
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,350
The way they are in downtown Manhattan.
I'm just fucking you.

53
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,720
I know Chicago is one of the most
corrupt fucking cities out there.

54
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,630
You got to give it respect overtly racist
fucking with the finance home is some

55
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:12,670
of the fucking top mob guys throughout
history and they got the Chicago Black

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,470
Hawks. So I will tell you, I don't
think anybody's fucking stopping it,

57
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,110
but I'll get to that later via
the bank and downstairs. Um,

58
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,630
as you said that slowly but surely I'm
getting the fucking house repaired and I

59
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,320
know you think about Jesus Christ
the fuck speak in a lake, Michigan.

60
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,350
When did that water pour into your house?
That was like over a year ago.

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,720
Yes it was.
And I fixed the upstairs,

62
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:37,210
but the downstairs was built
like a fucking tree for.

63
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,920
So what I decided to do was
rather than just rebuild,

64
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,150
what the fuck was there,

65
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,540
I decided to knock it all out and start
from scratch and build what the fuck

66
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,444
should have been there.

67
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,320
And if anybody knows me and they look
at what the Dick Jokes in my act,

68
00:03:55,331 --> 00:04:00,070
you can tell the level of quality that
I expect from that job downstairs.

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,210
Hey, is the podcast loud enough
right now? Everybody complaints?

70
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,490
Make my fucking ears heart right now.
How loud I have this turned up.

71
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,400
I think I have it down.
I don't know what the fucking deal is.

72
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:12,130
I hope it's not going to be overly loud,
but every week somebody goes, dude,

73
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:16,900
I can't even fucking hear
the tick. Um, so anyways,

74
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,250
this was,
this was my week.

75
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,060
I guess I got to talk about NHL first
because the first thing before all the

76
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:26,000
bullshit is I watched my boss,
my boss to blue orange.

77
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,840
Uh, absolutely fucking blow it
against the Montreal Canadians.

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,890
I'm just going to pause here for all
the feminist French guys clapping their

79
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:39,580
hands together, like to plant patty
cake with themselves, you know,

80
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,050
with your colorful socks.

81
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,170
Um,
unbelievable that,

82
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,820
that was so fucking embarrassing
to lose that, that series.

83
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,540
It was so fucking like the way we lost it.

84
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,820
It's on bearing the loses the Canadians.
It sucks.

85
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:03,850
But that was the first
time in a long time.

86
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,353
Hmm.

87
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,670
I'm going to go back to the 80s that I
felt that at like embarrassed turning

88
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:11,750
point in the series.

89
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:16,670
I'm going to say Sean Thornton
spraying the water at fucking PK. Suba.

90
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,900
Why would you do that?

91
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,620
Why would you fucking do that for
those of you don't watch hockey?

92
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,900
We were down two games to one
and they won the first game.

93
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:28,550
So immediately we lost home home, ice
advantage, whatever the fuck that means.

94
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:32,810
Right? So we went game to, now it's
one one we go into their building,

95
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:36,500
they win game two they are holding surf.
So we come in,

96
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,430
we got to win game four we fucking winning
game five can we take control of the

97
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:44,570
fucking series we win.
Game five is Paul Versey told me,

98
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:49,130
Joe Tory said the two most important games
to win in a seven game series he felt

99
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,540
was game two and game five which totally
makes sense because if you lost game

100
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:58,541
one you have to win game two or else
you got to win for next five you got to

101
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,020
even that motherfucker,
right?

102
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,410
And then game five you win game five
all you gotta do is win one of two.

103
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,980
You lose game five you got to win
six or seven bill. It's simple math.

104
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,300
We'll believe it or not. Some people
don't know it. So we win game five,

105
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,520
this two and a half minutes to go.

106
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,500
They're judging the Canadians a dejected,
they had the series by,

107
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:23,420
they'll fucking proverbial balls over
there and they let the Bruins right back

108
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:27,260
in it and now they're on the verge of
fucking elimination. So what do we do?

109
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,671
What do we do?

110
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:33,671
Fuck heads that we were one of the people
on our team decides to not only for no

111
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:35,480
fucking reason.

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,060
Spray water at not only
somebody on the other team,

113
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,470
that best fucking player,

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,270
the player that the other people probably
rally around because he's fucking the

115
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:50,150
best guy in the fucking team.
We spray water in his God,

116
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:55,151
Deb face the dumbest fucking thing you
ever remember those old Batman episodes

117
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:02,321
in the 1960s where they'd have the guy
off Batman or Robin is this sit for a

118
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:07,460
cape crusaders but blue bubble and they
will look like they were fucking dead

119
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,720
and the bad guy always did fucked it up
somehow. That was the moment right there.

120
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,710
That was the fucking moment. He
sprays it in that. So then, you know,

121
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,130
you knew they were going to come out
like gangbusters. I said it last week.

122
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,380
I didn't think that they
were going to win game six.

123
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,880
I didn't think we'd get pummeled for
games, for goals to four to nothing.

124
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,380
That's what happened.

125
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,990
They completely dominated wire to
fucking wire dominated that fucking game.

126
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:35,990
So then we go down to game seven and I
had a, I didn't have a vibe either way.

127
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,540
Are we going to win and we're
going to lose? I didn't know,

128
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:43,310
but it's not like the old days when the
Canadians fucking owned us. They don't,

129
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,080
they haven't since fucking 1987 despite
what these fucking idiots will, right.

130
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,860
Because they're lazy.
Sportswriters not only is it been even,

131
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:55,430
we've actually had the better of it for
the last fucking 30 years or so. So,

132
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,310
you know, it was a 16
fucking league. Okay.

133
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,520
With an expansion six was the tail
end of that Horse Shit. All right,

134
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:06,200
can we get over it already? Jesus. Today
I could share my shelf enough already.

135
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,600
It's fucking over.
He's dead.

136
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:12,730
And so is everybody else that watched
him give that speech. Um, anyways,

137
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,420
that probably not,
but who gives a fuck?

138
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,170
So we go into game seven and uh,

139
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,690
it's the usual shit.

140
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,530
I don't think I can remember a series
where we miss more fucking open nets,

141
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,650
hit more crossbars. We were
like, I don't know what happened.

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,140
I Dunno what the fuck happened.

143
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,170
A couple of our guys couldn't hit the side
of a fucking bar and I still love him.

144
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,290
I don't think they need to shake
up the team. I love that shit.

145
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,070
Whenever you lose a series they'll do, you
know, so, so decisions have to be made.

146
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:42,650
You got to make some like, like
you, you don't have what happened.

147
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,130
We had a bad fucking
series. So anyways, um,

148
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,410
the game ends in an a handshake line.
Lucita is telling a couple of,

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,470
you told a couple of you supposed to just
go through the line and no matter what,

150
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:56,250
Grit your teeth, good game, good game

151
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,470
graduations, good luck in the next
round, whatever the hey man, you know,

152
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,600
you were great, you got the better of me,
whatever the fuck you supposed to say.

153
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:07,110
But Luciano did that for a couple of
players and then a couple other players,

154
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,560
he said, I'm going to fucking kill
you, which you're not supposed to do.

155
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,090
And uh, I just wasn't a
good look. The whole thing,

156
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,710
you know, it's fun. It's kind of ironic
that it made fun of how the bad boys,

157
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,540
the bad boy pistons, the fucking cheap
shot out is how they fucking went out.

158
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,630
And they ended up not being in bad
boys that went out like punks when they

159
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,730
didn't shake the bowls hands or
whatever the fuck they were playing.

160
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:33,570
I don't want troop. When they walked
off, I thought we had elements of that.

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,770
Not saying everybody Charo was a
fucking warrior. He was obviously hurt.

162
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,850
The guy looked like me
on skates by game seven.

163
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,810
He was literally falling down out
there. But um, but whatever, man.

164
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,030
Yeah,

165
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,370
I don't like that shit.
I don't like the water bottle.

166
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:51,760
I don't like that saying that shit in
the line. So it actually in a weird way,

167
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,590
ease the fucking pain because I'm not
one of those fans that fucking hates that

168
00:09:56,591 --> 00:10:00,750
behavior until people on my team do it. I
just, I dunno, I didn't fucking like it.

169
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,290
And, uh, even if it
worked, I didn't like it.

170
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,710
Let's say it worked and we won
the series. I don't, I don't,

171
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,870
I don't fucking like that
shit. So anyways, uh,

172
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,420
congratulations to the Canadians
definitely deserved it.

173
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,910
And as much as I hate people
saying no real classy,

174
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,050
they actually won with class and uh,
you know,

175
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,690
I didn't have a problem with
the guy mocking blue Cheech
fucking pounding of his

176
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,140
chest when he scored an empty net goal.
I mean,

177
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,950
you got to think someone's going to give
you shit for that and you don't let it

178
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,210
get under your skin. And I think they
got under his skin. I still love the guy.

179
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,620
I'm not shitting on him, but they,
they got the better of you and we lost.

180
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,500
So there you go.

181
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,180
And that's how it works.
So now

182
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,910
blue block a rules are now playing the
fucking Canadians and they got fucking

183
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,530
smoked. And the first one, but that
doesn't mean shit. That's just one loss.

184
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,910
How many coaches have you heard say, I
don't care. It's shoving Joe a Chevy Joe.

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
Joe Joy cop one watch. Oh, we could go
try learn shop from niche law. Shit.

186
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,190
Y'all going in checking game and
tried to get about this one. Um,

187
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,870
which is what I think they're going to do.

188
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,590
And um, my apologies. So
ranger fans because uh,

189
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,620
there's just something about you. I
don't hear that. Bang. There you go.

190
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,060
That's the guys downstairs. Um, I
just, I don't fucking, uh, I just,

191
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,070
I don't believe in the rangers there.

192
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,400
I said it obviously I
believe in your goal tender.

193
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,250
I believe in the energy that
uh, Martin, Saint Martin,

194
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:33,660
Saint Louis over the fuck you say
his name. I believe in that shit.

195
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,680
I just don't think you have
enough weapons. And then
also I think you're very,

196
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:41,080
even with the Canadians, despite
that seven to two, I might eat kraut.

197
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,960
I did really well on the first round when
the high seeds play the low seats. Oh,

198
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:48,310
I was picking them right and left.

199
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,080
This just, I didn't watch a
lot of the rangers this year,

200
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,430
but I'm going to go.

201
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,820
Okay.

202
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,370
Just with the history of both teams,

203
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,550
the exact thing I told you to ignore it
when I was talking about the Canadians

204
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,001
and Bruins,

205
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:09,710
I'm now going to bring up the Canadian
history because I think it applies in

206
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:12,980
this one. So send you fucking hate
mail to me. I don't give a shit.

207
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,200
I think it applies where

208
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,800
they evenly fucking matched and

209
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,270
okay.

210
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,270
Because the Canadians have their history
and their history of winning their fan

211
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:31,601
base expects them to win and
I've seen it in other sports.

212
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,860
When you have a fan base
that believes like that,

213
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,810
they're able to sometime push a
mediocre team up to a higher level.

214
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:42,090
I'm not saying they're mediocre,
but I think that they're going to,

215
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,410
it's just going to be a different
vibe there tonight when they play.

216
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,750
Hmm.

217
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,370
Like the fans will have that vibe.

218
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:52,160
We're not going to tolerate you going
down oh two they just don't do it.

219
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:54,650
Yankee Stadium,
old Yankee stadium had that sound.

220
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,810
I'm still getting used to
the new Yankee stadium,

221
00:12:56,811 --> 00:13:00,110
but the fans know the fucking game.
They know what's on the line.

222
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,840
They're the ones that's the Yankee fans
started that shit with two strikes.

223
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,860
You start fucking clapping, right?
They understand the fucking game.

224
00:13:06,861 --> 00:13:10,250
Canadian fans do the same range of fans.
Great fence.

225
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,790
I would actually say better fans and the
Canadians because they've put up with

226
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,190
being a fucking ranger fan.

227
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,210
But the thing about the rangers and you
got to own up to this range of fear.

228
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:24,310
Maybe you don't have to, but I feel
don't you fucking you. You are good.

229
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,850
If you're a true range of fan,
you're waiting for the other shoe to drop.

230
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,050
That is the legacy of
the New York Rangers.

231
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:37,460
So it's a series like this where they
finally turned it around, I guess.

232
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:40,550
Well I guess they got it when another
fucking cup. Cause other than you know,

233
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:43,760
you know the deal. I don't need to bring
up your past stats other than the 1994,

234
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:47,900
I'll do it for people who don't
watch hockey other than 1994. I mean,

235
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,380
you're talking like a fucking talking.

236
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,340
Basically they've won one
cup and 74 years. It's not a
good look. Okay. The first,

237
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,300
you know,
27 years of that,

238
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:03,740
they were only competing with six other
fucking five other teams. Okay. So, um,

239
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,910
I just feel that the Canadians are going
to be able to power their way through

240
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,250
and uh, somehow in this series, I hope
it's a great series to original six teams.

241
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:13,941
You got to love that.

242
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:18,770
And then out in the West you got the
fucking black hawks original six first and

243
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:23,420
expansion six with the,
uh, the La Kings. And uh,

244
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,250
I feel that that is the Stanley Cup
final right there. Whoever wins that,

245
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,580
um,
I don't know how evenly matched they are.

246
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,190
I think that King's might've been
a little tired in that first game.

247
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:39,590
It was only three to one, but, uh, I don't
know. I said it a while back. The fucking,

248
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,240
it's the Blackhawks the loose.

249
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,240
I think they have a little bit of a tough
time with the kings and then they just

250
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,310
fuck up either.
The Canadians are the ranges.

251
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,010
That's what I think now if
your or the other teams, you

252
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,460
should be real excited right now because
I don't think I had been right since

253
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,330
the first fucking route.
Okay. Um, all right.

254
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:03,710
So there's my hockey,
my hockey speak for the week.

255
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,860
Oh, it rhymed. Holy Shit. Hey,

256
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:09,650
can I hype a couple of things right
now while you have no fucking choice,

257
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,090
you've got to listen to it.
Uh, the all in comedy tour,

258
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,530
the Monday morning podcast
presents the all in comedy tour.

259
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,810
They're going to be yet
hilarity his comedy club.

260
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,470
One of my favorite comedy clubs,
one of my favorite club owners,

261
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,150
nick costs is a work in there.

262
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,050
And um, I, did I say his name
right? I know a nick costs this and,

263
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,190
and then I know nick is a coastus.

264
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,430
One of them pronounces it the wrong
fucking way. One does the real Greek way.

265
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:41,450
So I say the real Greek ways and I
just fucked the whole fucking thing up.

266
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,340
Anyways, polarities comedy club.
I do not have spell his name.

267
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,510
How about that?
Is that good enough?

268
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,490
They going to be there May 28th through
June 1st for seven shows. Paul, dude,

269
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:57,030
I called it Versie Paul.
I'm not from New Jersey.

270
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,310
Versie add a fucking doorbell's ringing.
Hang on.

271
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,613
Yeah.

272
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,180
All right. I'm back. It was funny,

273
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,480
it was just some fucking person
coming to the door soliciting,

274
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,430
just sitting there going like, ah, hey,
good evening sir. I graphene sir. Um, uh,

275
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,590
from the fucking Blah, blah, blah at
Fannie Mae's money for political gains.

276
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,330
But man, he goes, I'm actually
in the middle of a business call.

277
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:22,390
I have to get back and even get
through. And he just goes, all right,

278
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,320
what was that movie with that guy versus,

279
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,960
he was just talking about gay with the
guy's actually a salesman and somebody

280
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:35,260
calls his house and he does
basically the same thing.

281
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:39,040
And the guy gives up and he just
goes, that's it. That's your pitch.

282
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,050
This is how you're selling it.

283
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,380
And he fucking gets the guy all amped
up to give him his pitch again. He goes,

284
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:47,410
Dan. And that's the sales call. The guy's
like, so do you want the paper? He's like,

285
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:51,340

See them while you still can.

288
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,550
All on the same stage as is like when
the temptations were actually the

289
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:07,270
temptations.
Paul don't say I'm from New Jersey.

290
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:10,010
Versie Joe

291
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,580

292
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,450

Jason Law head, Cleveland Native.
Jason Law had go down there.

294
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,960
If you just want to see
a great comedy show,

295
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,720
these are the guys that opened up for me.
Um,

296
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:29,480
when I'm out on the road and all of
them are going to become headline is in

297
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,650
their own right and a,

298
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,350
I dunno when they're all going
to share the same stage again.

299
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:38,240
This is like when fuck and Frank Dean and
Sammy went out before they were famous.

300
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,430
You know, they were in some supper club
going after some and whore and they said,

301
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:45,230
hey, what if we all go up
here and see what happens?

302
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:49,320
That that's what you're going to see
there in Cleveland unless you stay home,

303
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,090
unless you fucking stay home. I also have
something else to promote. I'm doing a,

321
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,740
Okay,

323
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,640
What's that? Anyways, it's going to be
a at the green building in Brooklyn,

324
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:15,470

14th, I'm working with James
Smith and meanwhile, uh,

325
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,190
two phenomenal musicians. Remember that
band I told you about drew with the drew?

326
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,500
We're just,
everybody in there was unreal.

327

Are you guys sitting out there
watching these fucking reality shows?

328
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,810
Who's the next fucking American idol?

329
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,450
You just want to see musicians who will
fucking making it by getting together

330
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,580
with other great musicians
and making great music.

331
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,080
I highly recommend downloading the drawer,
the drew album,

332
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,590

going to be setting a record for the, uh,

336

I guess longest time to
musicians have played together.

337
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,670
It's going to kind of be like, uh, you
know, like a festival kind of thing.

338
00:19:58,671 --> 00:20:01,070
They're gonna be doing that in one room.
You got a comedy show in another room.

339
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:04,160
We're going to be feeding people.
It's going to be fucking great. Uh,

340
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,450
go to give laughed groove.com
and come on out. Okay. And I'll,

341
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:11,750
you'll be seeing me bringing
the fucking lumber, uh oh.

342
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:15,110
And I'll also be a feeding some people to,
I guess whatever.

343
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,610
It's a fucking charity. Whatever they
need me to do, I'm going to do what?

344
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:20,690
What is it here? What am
I doing here? Where is it?

345
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,150
Where's the copy bill?
Why do you suck so fucking bad at this?

346
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,441
All right.

347
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:31,370
So as I got you and James signed up
to do the last meal pack of each day,

348
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,320
which is four 30 to 6:30 PM
on July 14th and 46 on six.

349
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,790
Okay. The next day. But we're
performing only on the 14th. Uh,

350
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,030
still cool with this course.
Yeah. Fuck yeah. Absolutely.
All right. So there you go.

351
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,950
That's what the hell I'm doing.
It's a check that shit up. Okay.

352
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,220
Back to the podcast. Um,
all right. So this weekend,

353
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,410
um, I had, uh,

354
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,920
I had a relative
graduated from law school,

355
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,670
so I had to fly back to Boston,
go right.

356
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,530
And every time I go back to Boston,

357
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:09,190
they fucking build something else and
tore something down that I loved and then

358
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,660
fucking put something else in
place of it. And I go, well,

359
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:15,910
what happened to it this time?
I went back and he'll,

360
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,950
top steakhouse was fucking closed.

361
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,360
I was on my way up to
giggles comedy club to uh,

362
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,870
I thought only do one show. I did two
shows. I should've kept it at one.

363
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,370
I went into the second room and I didn't
realize that it was a church group.

364
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,260
Swear to God trying to raise money
for something and Ooh, Oh, did,

365
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,380
oh Billy boy munches
fucking balls on that one.

366
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,720
Jesus Christ. It was a legitimate
bomb fucking wire to wire.

367
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,240
It just was not a stellar moment in it.

368
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,900
Like you ever see when a plane
goes to take off and it just,

369
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,560
it's just not at the right speed and just
fucking just clips the trees that like,

370
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,710
that's what happened. Then it
disappears into them. You're like, oh,

371
00:21:56,711 --> 00:22:00,340
maybe they landed safely than this.
The fireball. That was my set.

372
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,260
Uh, but the other place, it was
worth it. Cause the first one,

373
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,910
it was magic. It was a great,
do you believe in magic?

374
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,700
Um, in the fucking main room.
That one was great. So, um,

375
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,230
I got to work with Tony V, one of
my favorites and a Yada, Yada, Yada.

376
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:28,270
At the next fucking day, I go to the,
I go to the graduation and you know,

377
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,610
you know the deal with
graduations, you like, oh my God,

378
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:34,570
this is going to fucking suck. All
right, this is going to be long.

379
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,040
This is going to be hot. It's going to
be hot and long. It's going to suck.

380
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,820
It sounds like a fucking point over
here. It's horrific. All right.

381
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,800
And a pleasant surprise.
We show up. It's indoors,

382
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,490
it's fucking air conditioning.
The Dean comes out,

383
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,200
she starts fucking talking crushes it,
brings up some political guy.

384
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,310
He goes up, fucking crushes it. Then
they bring up the guest speaker.

385
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,953
All right.

386
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,460
This is like when a basketball teams
going on a run and everybody's standing up

387
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:10,750
freaking out.
That eight Tevo rather are the sole Ipos,

388
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,730
the fucking speakers,
a crushing it.

389
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,110
Then they bring up the guy that they hired
to speak and he comes fucking walked.

390
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:20,170
Dr Barack Obama, blue, blue, blue,
whatever the fuck his name is.

391
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,640
He comes walking up. This is how
we started his speech. He goes,

392
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,610
before I speak,
I would like to say something.

393
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,820
I swear to God,
that's what he said.

394
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:40,090
That's one of the greatest fucking
lines I ever heard before I speak.

395
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,710
I would like to say something
and immediately are just
sitting there going like,

396
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:46,280
Oh God,
this is going to be at least

397
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,280
47 to 52 fucking minutes of
absolute fucking boredom at,

398
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,960
uh, fortunately I was Ra like
most of my NHL picks. I was wrong.

399
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,280
This guy crushed it. It, oh, sorry.

400
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:04,610
Talking about being a little kid
and born in fucking Nazi Poland,

401
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,860
Nazi occupied Poland, Poland, excuse me,

402
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:11,030
and how the fuck you got out of their
survivor's guilt and how have you become a

403
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,740
lawyer?
You don't have to be a fucking content.

404
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:15,420
You can actually work pro bono and help
change the world for a better plane.

405
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,360
It was a great speech.
Crushed it.

406
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:21,870
Right now all of a sudden they
handle out diplomas. I'm like,

407
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:25,200
Holy Shit, they're going to
get this fucking thing done
in two and a half hours.

408
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:27,600
This is going to be great.
Fucking great.

409
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,370
And then we're out to
the fucking bears in the,

410
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:33,510
in the food and everything's great.
They hand them all out and that's it.

411
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:38,511
And then the dean comes back and
inexplicably starts fucking talking.

412
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,340
Okay,

413
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,880
keep talk.
10 minutes later,

414
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,180
still fucking talking and a,
and everybody getting restless

415
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,390
and it's just like, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this person doing?

416
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,290
And then like 15 minutes in,
it was so bad.

417
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,870
It just started to become funny.
I mean,

418
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,190
everybody was running for her,

419
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:07,450
wrap it up in 30 seconds and 15 minutes
and she goes, I'm going to tell this.

420
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:08,620
This is just an aside.

421
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,640
And she told the fucking side story that
had nothing to do with the other story

422
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,970
and all this shit she was saying was
basically what everybody else had said.

423
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,070
Yeah,

424
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,720
20 minutes, 25 minutes in, 30
minutes in. And I swear to God, dude,

425
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:25,260
I like I started, I started getting
angry because I was all the way in,

426
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:29,190
up against the wall. I was starting to
feel trapped and I started thinking,

427
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:33,660
she's doing this on purpose. This is a
fucking power trip. And then mercifully,

428
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,650
it fucking finally ended
like 35 minutes later,

429
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,080
35 fucking minutes later.
And she didn't have a clue

430
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,080
how much she was annoying
the shit out of everybody.

431
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,430
The only thing that was keeping me
going was looking around at people.

432
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,010
People were doing everything.
People were,

433
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,180
were just sort of sitting there like
looking at the side of their head at the

434
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:58,730
person next to them. A couple
other people had done that. Uh, uh,

435
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,530
what's known as the confessional posts
or you're seated and you've got your

436
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:05,830
elbows on your knees and your head is
hanging in, your hands are clasped.

437
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,390
There was a lot of that going on.

438
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,050
There was a other people
not even trying to hide it,

439
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,110
looking around behind them like a
year fucking shitting me that look

440
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,110
not just over the right shoulder,

441
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:21,250
left shoulder to right fucking
double threat with that.

442
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,770
There was people, I was
right near, uh, the section,

443
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:28,660
I wasn't near the wall near the railing
and then that was like an exit right

444
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:33,370
next to me. And this one fuck guy,
he walked in, walked out, walked in,

445
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,320
walked out, walked into third time and
he literally put his hands out like,

446
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:41,650
you know, like one of the reps make a
fucked up. The call itself fucked up.

447
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:44,940
Even the head coach doesn't even know it
is. And then they're talking about it,

448
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:48,570
trying to get it right and they've come
to a decision and they don't inform the

449
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:52,710
coach and he just kind of puts his hands
out like the fuck Hap, what? What's,

450
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,450
what's going on? Am I
getting fucked her mom? I am,

451
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:56,520
I am I going to come
out all right in this.

452
00:26:56,521 --> 00:27:00,480
So literally just doing that and
then finally she wrapped it up.

453
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,780
It was still a good time. It was
still a good graduation. But, uh,

454
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,090
I dunno that Dean, I swear to God, it
was just like my performance of giggles.

455
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:13,110
I should've stopped at the first little
performance. I should've ended it.

456
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:16,340
That it was just, it was
horrific. Okay. So anyways,

457
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,290
the next day I ended up
going down to Nashville.

458
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,140
I just realized I haven't written in my
fucking advertising it for this week.

459
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:22,974
God dammit.

460
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,210
I went down to Nashville for the
Vince Vaughn Wild West comedy, uh,

461
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,780
festival,
the first one,

462
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,180
hopefully not the last time cause it was
such a great time and I got to play the

463
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:39,600
Ryman theater and I didn't realize
that was the original Grand Ole Opry.

464
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,580
And uh,

465
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,660
I'm going to tell you about that right
after these messages from our sponsor.

466
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,220
I know. Fuck you too. Fuck you. Go Fuck
Yourself. I got to do these. All right.

467
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:54,750
Dollar Shave Club. Darla Dollar
Shave Club. Everybody, you know,

468
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,700
there are so many things
that pissed me off.

469
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,040
Talk about a few things to
piss you off, Bill. Okay,

470
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,340
let's talk about all the fucking dean
should have wrapped it up the first time

471
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,220
and instead goes on for 35 minutes.
That pisses me off.

472
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,260
You know there did I read,
reach my contractual obligation there.

473
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,130
All right. And paying way too much to
shave. My face is definitely up there too.

474
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,270
Right up there with somebody doing 35
minutes when I was done with you with your

475
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:22,530
first seven. Okay. Nothing feels better
than shaving with a fresh new blade,

476
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,460
but new razors are so ridiculously
expensive that you can't afford to change

477
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:29,940
your blade more than once every six weeks,
six months or so.

478
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,490
You'll end up scraping up
your face with the old blade.

479
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,720
Dollar Shave club delivers top quality
raises for only a few bucks a month.

480

531
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:07,390
podcast. So I mentioned, I played the
Ryman theater, which isn't in downtown.

532
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,790
It's in what I consider the downtown.

533
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,520
It's right with the
Nashville predators play.

534
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,000
They got all the Honky tonks
there and they got all the play.

535
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,810
I don't know if they call them
that anymore, whenever all that,

536
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,180
all the fucking country music
and all that shit. And uh,

537
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,320
and right around the corner, right off
this little street is the Ryman theater.

538
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,843
And um,

539
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,010
that's where the original Grand Ole
Opry was at from like 1930 something to

540
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,370
1974. And, um,

541
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,280
basically who was anybody

542
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:45,230
got to perform even before then, before
he was even the Grand Ole Opry. It was a,

543
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:50,120
uh, of, of Vaudeville, um,
space. So all these other guys,

544
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:53,000
you know, I imagine Charlie Chaplin,
I mean, he was doing the rounds.

545
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:57,960
He was working the road buster Keaton,
WC fields, they had his, his, uh,

546
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,700
headshot. I'm hanging in
there. So we've got see that,

547
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,080
that's how much history this place,

548
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:07,670
even when the people that I'm
freaking out about the Hank Williams,

549
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,930
you know, ah, patsy Cline and all of
them, even when they perform there,

550
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:15,750
that place was already legendary. And, um,

551
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,670
they actually had a couple strips
of wood from the original stage.

552
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:23,510
So everybody who came out to perform
had to go and step on them and distinct

553
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:27,890
that, you know, you know, all
these unbelievable performance,

554
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,360
uh, had been there. And, um,
I'm not going to lie to you.

555
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,240
It was one of the best shows
I've had in my entire career.

556
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,200
I don't know what happened.
I went out there and, uh,

557
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:42,440
usually it takes me a second to get a
little warmed up, get a vibe for the room.

558
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:46,790
But I walked out there and
they used to be a church,

559
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,540
so they have all the original pews.
It was made in like 1898,

560
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:54,250
so they still had all the original pews.
Um,

561
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,770
I'm telling you right now, if you
go to Nashville, you gotta go,

562
00:33:57,771 --> 00:33:59,090
you gotta go see a fucking show there.

563
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,890
There's a bunch of other
great venues there and stuff,

564
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:05,600
but you got to go like I heard
Neil young played there, um,

565
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,930
recently. I mean that's one that I
would just stop what I was doing,

566
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:13,931
get on a plane to go to the Ryman theater
and just sit in a fucking pew from

567
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,870
1898 and watched Neil young.
I mean that's just incredible.

568
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:22,871
So somehow a shit head like me told
enough Dick Jokes and next thing you know,

569
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:25,550
I'm the next guy on the show.

570
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,890
So I walk out there and the sun's
going down and up in the upper deck.

571
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,270
It's really small.

572
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,900
Lots smaller than I thought it was going
to be because people were smaller back

573
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:40,400
then and they pack them in
and there wasn't all this
extra crap luxury boxes and

574
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:41,234
everything.
So

575
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,720
whatever it was like a 2000 seat or
1800 seater and it was the size of like,

576
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:50,320
I swear to God, like a lot of 500
seat theaters. It's unbelievable.

577
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,820
We're literally tripled the fucking size
of these people, I guess. So anyways,

578
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,360
up top, they had these stained glass
windows so the sun was going down.

579
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,193
All right.

580
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,240
The sunlight's coming through
the stained glass windows,

581
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:06,750
it looks like the fucking
blues brothers moment. And uh,

582
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,290
I went out there and it was
a great crowd and I was on,

583
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,980
I started talking,
they started laughing and I swear to God,

584
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,030
I almost did like two hours.

585
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:20,031
I'd be like an hour and 45 minutes and
I left out like three huge bits then I'm

586
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,410
going to do on my special.

587
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,003
MMM.

588
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,700
You know,
you gotta have your blocks.

589
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,270
When I put together a new hour
and I feel like I got the,

590
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,973
I got it

591
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,370
together is you need that big opener,
got to have the big closer.

592
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,920
And then you got to have like,

593
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,750
you got to have three or four
big ones in the middle, you know,

594
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,970
and then you got your little ones,
you give him the rest,

595
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,950
then you go back new big one,
give a little wrestling,

596
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,600
give him to take up on a little ride.
Um,

597
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,330
but you got to have like you got to
have the four corners there to build the

598
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:58,920
structure is how I view it.
I Dunno.

599
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,810
I Dunno why I don't have
a good science background,

600
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:04,050
but that's how I fucking viewed the thing.
And um,

601
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,340
I dunno. I, I've had so much fun.

602
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,300
I'm having more fun than
I ever had doing standup,

603
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,050
so I have more than enough at this point.
And um,

604
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,930
that's the only concern
I have when I go to tape.

605
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:19,940
This thing is I don't
want it to be overly long,

606
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,460
but I also want to document those jokes
so I don't know what I'm going to do

607
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,150
either do all of them and then cut the
special and then have those as extras.

608
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:31,730
I have no fucking clue how I'm
going to do it. But you know what,

609
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,740
it's a great fucking problem to have.
So anyways,

610
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,880
backstage and you can take a tour of
this is they have up on the third floor,

611
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:45,011
they have the Johnny Cash room and they
have the Hank Williams room and then you

612
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,670
go down the floor beneath it.
They have second floor. They have.

613
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,550
That's where all the womens
are because men are better.

614
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:57,530
We're above on floor number three.
And then on floor number two,

615
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:01,850
they had like the Patsy Cline.
I'm the Patsy Cline room.

616
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,970
And then, uh, what else was the fucker?

617
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,810
I'm just so bad at country stars.
This is really bad.

618
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,600
I have no fucking idea who they hit.
I'm sorry.

619
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,080
I just painted the whole picture
and then just drop the brush.

620
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,550
Just let you guys fall right off
the fucking canvas. I'm sorry,

621
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,730
I don't remember, but it was
fucking amazing. I actually went,

622
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,990
I actually came out to Patsy Cline
when I was there. I know it's hacking.

623
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,230
It's touristy, but uh, it was cool.
I've always liked her. And um,

624
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,440
there's actually rumors that she stayed
on the street that I live in out,

625
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,750
uh,
live on out here in la.

626
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:46,430
There's rumors that she actually rented
a house on the block that I live on. And,

627
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:46,521
uh,

628
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:51,521
that's one of the really cool things to
completely make a left turn here about

629
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:57,071
living in Los Angeles is if you are
in an area with a bunch of old houses,

630
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,510
there's going to be somebody
fucking lived in it at this point.

631
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,780
Hollywood and people trying to make movies
as we're coming up on a hundred years,

632
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:09,020
aren't we? Um, as far as
it actually getting going,

633
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:12,440
Hollywood land and all that type of shit,
this, do you know that there, there's a,

634
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:14,900
there's a house,
um,

635
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,280
I actually read about
when it was for sale.

636
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,733
MMM.

637
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,870
Somewhere here in Hollywood are, maybe
it's, I don't know what the fuck it is,

638
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:28,290
but basically the person
who owned the house,

639
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:33,350
they owned it during a prohibition and
then it had a pool and an a cabana.

640
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,550
So it's during prohibition. And he now
the deal, what if they outlawed boost?

641
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,440
I mean,
how quickly would that be a black market?

642
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:45,700
And you'd be fucking drinking in
somebody seller, you know, knocking,

643
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,630
you know, what's the password?
The password is a, you know,

644
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,440
23 Skidoo or whatever and you
fucking get in. Right. So, um,

645
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,780
this person made a bar,
uh,

646
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,070
they turned their Cavana into like a
bar and they just built this little bar.

647
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:05,050
And then I don't know if they even made
their beer in the bathtub or they had

648
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,580
some sort of hook up who knows what and
all these famous people from way back in

649
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,730
the day, Louie Armstrong, Humphrey
Bogart, all these people or whatever,

650
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,613
mmm.

651
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,330
Went over there and drank and they all
carved their names into the bar and it's

652
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:22,750
still there.
So when you went to go look at the house,

653
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,410
you could actually go look at this piece
of history and it's actually protected.

654
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:27,880
Like they make sure if you buy the house,

655
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,600
like you can't tear it down or sell
it or any of that type of shit. So,

656
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,153
mmm.

657
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,240
All of these fucking, you
know, all these icons,

658
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:40,250
they had to fucking live somewhere.
So anyways,

659
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,320
the rumor is the urban myth on the street
that I live on is that she either on

660
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:47,630
this street and the next
street overstayed in a house,

661
00:39:47,631 --> 00:39:51,530
rented it while she was doing,
I don't know what. So it
was kind of cool. Anyways,

662
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:54,980
to come back out, uh, to come out with a,

663
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,060
can you tell I flew today. I'm always
out of my fucking mind when I fly,

664
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,980
my brain's all over the place. I've
had a fucking brutal day. I apologize.

665
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,490
Do you know when I, when I went to the
airport this morning, Nashville, and, uh,

666
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,660
it was this extra long line and you
don't just stand there and I left enough

667
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,380
time where I could get through it and um,

668
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,780
I'm coming up right to where you begin
disrobing and all that shit. Right.

669
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,910
And um,

670
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,340
yeah,

671
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,750
they end up, uh, the lovely Nia.
What's going on? How are you?

672
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,250
I'm telling my, uh, my airport
story from this morning.

673
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,740
So, uh, no, not even that
one. He has his, his story.

674
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,020
So I'm standing in line.

675
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,760
Does long fucking security line
Jesus bill, get to the point. I know.

676
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,040
So I'm getting ready to,
it's becoming my turn.

677
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,950
Why get to fucking take off the belt
and the sneakers and fucking get through

678
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,590
the damn thing. And all of a sudden
I hear this person behind going,

679
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,280
excuse me, thank you for giving me skill
needs. Cannes means killing Sharon.

680
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:02,490
Sharon and I turned around and it's
this guy and he's pushing this African

681
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:08,770
American woman who's in her 50s,
in a wheelchair. So you know,

682
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:13,300
I step aside, she goes by,
and then the dude behind me

683
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,880
goes, he said, he goes,

684
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,710
I got to say that exactly what he said.
He goes,

685
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,320
they should have to wait in line like
everybody else. That's what he said.

686
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,980
He went with they,
he went with they,

687
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:34,130
so they they a day meaning people in
wheelchairs or black people flag I

688
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,030
think. No, I think he met wheelchairs
because those other black people, um,

689
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,920
uh, standing in line.
Right. So, so I turn around.

690
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,233
Yeah.

691
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,030
And I, I don't talk to fucking people
want it and he just, it was just so crazy.

692
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:51,060
I just try, I said, come on man. I
mean, she's in a wheelchair. I go,

693
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:53,430
would you rather be standing
up and sitting in that chair?

694
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,820
And then there was a pause and he goes,

695
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,840
they should wait in line
like everybody else,

696
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,310
like his whole Mississippi burning
vibe and we know it's killing me.

697
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,420
I came up,
I came,

698
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,310
I came up with the fucking line that I
should have said after I got on the plane,

699
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,020
what I should have said, ah, what the
fuck was it? And I already forget.

700
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,820
What did I got to have the proper word.
My brain is just not working today. Um

701
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,250
Oh that's, I'm like, oh, now you
believe in quality. It's not a quality.

702
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:28,260
What does the word now you believe in a,

703
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:29,720
okay.

704
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,110
Oh Jesus, I just blew
it. No, I'm completely,

705
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,300
no, I'm completely fucking
out of it. What the fuck is,

706
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,290
cause he's basically, you know, this
guy, he doesn't want shit to be equal.

707
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,270
But now that she's going by him, now he
wants to shit to be equal. But you know,

708
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,120
if she went to live in his fucking
neighborhood, he wouldn't want it to be.

709
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,930
So he wants to quality. Oh, that was
on sale. Now you believe in equality.

710
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,460
That's what I was going
to say. Yeah. Jesus. Okay.

711
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,460
You just looked up and
you get what I'm saying.

712
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,690
It's always a great joke when you have
to overly explain it to someone who's

713
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:07,680
known you for fucking
years. Ah, Jesus. All right,

714
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:11,760
so she see how that just bombed
everybody? Maybe a pip. It's a good thing.

715
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:14,750
I didn't say it.
Um,

716
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:20,100
that's basically what my second
set had giggles was like, oh,

717
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,020
I didn't tell you that. And
yeah, I fucking ate my balls. No,

718
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:26,620
I did wired to I,

719
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,030
there was one woman's was so disgusted
she wouldn't look at me and I just kept

720
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:32,520
saying, I'm not going to tell another
joke to you. Look at me. And she,

721
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,250
she wouldn't look and I kept going,
I'm not going to tell another joke.

722
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:36,260
She looked at me and she just goes,
yeah.

723
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,360
And continued to look down at the floor
and she was like, you know, 65 70.

724
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,560
Well that's not exactly your
demographic. They were, they were,

725
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,500
they were a church group trying to raise
money and nobody told me I need. So,

726
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,680
yeah, that's, that was my out. That's
my app. That's the story I'm telling.

727
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:59,770
So anyways, so he was
my morning. All right.

728
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:04,771
So I get a car service to pick
me up at lax when I go to land.

729
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,170
Now the whole fucking purpose of a car
service, when you get off the plane,

730
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:11,410
the fucking jerk office standing there.
So you just leave,

731
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:17,200
you want to leave, you paying a ridiculous
amount of money, not for the ride.

732
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,570
You paying the money to
leave to leave the cluster.

733
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:22,420
Fuck that is lax.

734
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,100
So I go down there and there's 10 people
standing there with names and I'm all

735
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:30,610
excited is my name. We had a
name. Did I get picked right?

736
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,120
Am I going to make varsity?
You know,

737
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:38,390
and of course my name is and fucking
there Jarman entitled Jack Ass at this

738
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,130
point. So I'm like, you
know what? Fuck that.

739
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,730
I just walk out and I go right
to the cab line. There's no line.

740
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,260
There's also no caps,

741
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,970
but I see a cab common and the fucking
guy pulls up and then right then I get

742
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:53,250
the text about the guy and he's like,
you know,

743
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,860
trying to explain to me that he's in
the parking lot and he's on his way,

744
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:01,830
but his English is as good as my French.
So it takes a second.

745
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:05,750
So I walk away from the cab,
then I'm standing in a modern gun.

746
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:07,920
He's fucking Goddamn sons of bitches.

747
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,190
You know what the fuck I want to
get out of here. I want to go home.

748
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,980
I got to record the podcast and
being a big baby basically. Right.

749
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,420
And then all of a sudden, two seconds
later, the fucking town car pulls up.

750
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,200
He looks at me, I look at him, I nod,
he nods and I fucking get in the car.

751
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,120
And I'm like, all right,
I see. Once again, Bill,

752
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,580
you lost your shit for no reason
that it didn't take long at all.

753
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,090
So we're driving away with driving
away and I'm in a great fucking mood.

754
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,790
I get out of lax,
I'm feeling great.

755
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,320
And then all of a sudden his phone
fucking rings and he's like, hello,

756
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,460
what? Oh my God, I'm
so sorry. And he goes,

757
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:45,660
I picked up the wrong passenger. So
I'm thinking like, well, you know,

758
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,280
top too bad for that other guy.

759
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,850
So the guy slows down and he goes,

760
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:55,410
we have to go back until we were like
10 minutes away from the airport, right?

761
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:00,450
I'm like, we're not going back.
We can't go back. And he goes, no.

762
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,790
He goes, we have to go back. I got to go
back and get him. You're in the wrong car.

763
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,980
And I'm like, well that's not my
fault. You picked me up. Right.

764
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:10,770
And then he's literally started to turn
around. I feel like some little kid,

765
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,710
I want to go ahead and type stores.
Right?

766
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:17,970
And he's taking me to go see
the dentist. So I'm like, dude,

767
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:21,570
you can't just drive me back. He can't do
that. And he didn't get, he starts going,

768
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,690
you know, stop yelling at me and
I'm like, I'm not yelling at you.

769
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:29,480
Like he thought this was yelling.
That's not yelling, is it? Well,

770
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,231
you know what,

771
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:34,040
you guys need to up your yelling gang
cause that's not fucking yelling. So

772
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,410
Aye, he apologizes. The other guy doesn't
fucking apologize to me. And he goes,

773
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:42,630
I had to sign any shows.
A sign was like fucking guy's last name.

774
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:46,340
It was like Rancho Cucamonga, this
really fucking long name. And I'm like,

775
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,580
I didn't even fucking show me that.
He goes, yes I did. I go, dude,

776
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,280
you're literally telling me I don't
know what my name is. And he's like,

777
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:54,710
stop yelling at me. I go, I'm not yelling.

778
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:57,530
And you're sitting next acting like
I don't know what my fucking name is.

779
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,880
I didn't curse though. So then I finally
just go, you know what, just pull over,

780
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,810
let me out here.

781
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:08,310
So he pulls over and like support that
leaves me off and he's just sitting there

782
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,120
in the fucking driver's seat.

783
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:12,540
Okay.

784
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,040
As I, as I go to get out, pops the
trunk and it's just sitting there.

785
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:22,430
So I leave the passenger side door open
and the trunk open and I walk out like a

786
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:26,890
total fit. Such a chick fucking move.
Like, that's not a man move. Um,

787
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,560
but I did that and I went,
I got my done.

788
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,760
Um, it is, dude, that's
that. That's a pussy.

789
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:38,450
Move it as a footsie move, but
there you go. Who has a pussy check.

790
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,070
Thank you. You know the whole
thing about that scenario is his,

791
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:46,900
like his job is to say,
are you Mister Rancho Cucamonga?

792
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,890
Yes, I am. Are Your any we're
going to this place. Right.

793
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,570
That's normally what
they're supposed to do.

794
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:57,400
They've made sure you got the name
right. I had my headphones on. Okay.

795
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,790
I took my 50% of it all
right. Yeah, because the guy,

796
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:05,791
the driver who have the actual person
who I was at least 50% of my fault

797
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,880
[inaudible] was 50% of year fall because
there was a guy inside holding a sign

798
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:13,540
with your name on it. No,
there wasn't. Not at the time.

799
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,550
But then he called you or
whatever and he was like,

800
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:19,100
I'm coming around and this
and that. Either wet or hear
what you just said there.

801
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,890
What you just said.
What you said,

802
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:24,190
there was a guy in there holding a
sign with my name on it. I said no,

803
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:28,540
there wasn't. And you said not at
the time. Well, they called me.

804
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,770
It was the thing. Well, I call. Okay.

805
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,560
So if the fire department shows up the
day before the fucking house is on fire

806
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:38,740
and sprays water on it, like
it's, this isn't his job.

807
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:41,410
They supposed to have a little
bit of timing. That's why he is.

808
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:43,090
He's supposed to have time
and he should have been there.

809
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:45,220
You should have seen him right away.
That's the whole point of it.

810
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,760
And at other jackass should have confirmed
that you were Mister Rancho Cucamonga

811
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:51,950
and you are going to the right place.
So I'm staying Rancho Cucamonga.

812
00:48:51,951 --> 00:48:54,870
I said in the beginning and I thought I
would go with some different like Walla

813
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,150
Walla Walla are chubby chase.
Uh, I'm joking, but the the,

814
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,060
so now he should have checked.
He fucked up.

815
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,890
Can I say you got all I fucked up the
way you fish kid and kid, I fucked up.

816
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,820
I'm a dick.

817
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,910
He probably told the story to the next
passenger and they both laughed and the

818
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:14,410
next passenger was easy going and fucking
was, was a better person than I wasn't.

819
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:19,330
Gave him a nice, but he messed up. He hit,
he was supposed to check to make sure.

820
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,430
And you've never met the
person before you doubled.

821
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,520
Sort of assumed I was that dumb.
That's basically it.

822
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,030
I should have closed the door
in the trunk. I'm a content.

823
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:32,320
Has a bit of a bitch move. Totally.
Well there you go. So you agree with me?

824
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:37,350
No I but bitch meaning like
busy but not a female necessary.

825
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,540
Well it's not fair. It's not fair
to plunk move. Maybe this, no.

826
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:50,410
Anna pitch 50 like having a fit or
throwing a tantrum like a baby ish move.

827
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,550
Oh definitely mature. Immature.
All about it. We'll go in immature.

828
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:56,230
It was an immature move of you to be like,

829
00:49:56,231 --> 00:50:00,130
well why I'm not closing the
door or the trunk. Take that.

830
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,360
You're both being like unnecessary
because he should have been like,

831
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:08,410
you know what sir? You're
absolutely right. I should
have double checked with you.

832
00:50:08,411 --> 00:50:12,960
I'm so sorry. I got 20 bucks on me. Can I
at least give you $20 for the next doll?

833
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,710
He doesn't do all of that.
Look at this and this.

834
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,110
I think this is why it's called
a chick move. A pussy move.

835
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:21,230
A bitch move is because
guys are progressive.

836
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,920
We cause you guys don't
fight for the most part.

837
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:28,130
You guys don't solve shit
physically. So you guys, you solve

838
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,620
it that way cause you're,
you're more evolved as a man.
You're supposed to flake.

839
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,640
I was literally supposed to,

840
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,300
supposed to take off my fucking headphones
and we were supposed to Duke it out

841
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,990
right there on the sidewalk and whoever
won that was the direction the car was

842
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:44,660
going to go in.
Every Clint Eastwood movie I ever watched.

843
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,960
That's how it was supposed to be done.
And I did all right.

844
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,770
I was like tootsie. That's
what the movie was like. So,

845
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,340
but you still understand that he did
have to go back to get the person who

846
00:50:57,341 --> 00:51:00,040
actually paid for his
car. He, he screwed up.

847
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,190
But he has to go back and get
the person that paid for the car.

848
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:04,540
Okay.

849
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,010
He can't call another car. Well, I don't
know what their whole situation is. He,

850
00:51:09,011 --> 00:51:11,830
I don't think you know anything about
the situation because you don't work in

851
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:14,380
that industry. Well, I just know that,

852
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,980
isn't it enough that I just said I was
100% wrong and that I was a bitch and I

853
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:22,180
threw a tantrum and he just gonna fucking
countersink it and fucking hell no

854
00:51:22,181 --> 00:51:25,680
spackle over it. I got it.
I'm fine. I know you had a
hard morning. I'm not going to

855
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,340
come in here the whole weekend.
Yeah.

856
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:30,820
I swear to God like I was a fucking
idiot this weekend. I got on,

857
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,500
I returned a rental car at Logan
Airport and I miss my fucking missed my

858
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:40,501
terminal because I assumed that something
in Boston with the sign was going to

859
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:44,540
make sense, which it never
does. This is the deal. I'm,

860
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:49,090
I'm waiting to go to terminal e
southwest airlines. Right. So they go,

861
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,590
the first one, there's two buses.
One goes to BNC, one goes to DNA,

862
00:51:53,591 --> 00:51:56,290
so I don't fuck that up.
I actually get on the right bus.

863
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,840
They go to the first one. They're
like terminal dean, fuck in whatever.

864
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:06,140
United Airlines
the south like,

865
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,830
well that's not a day. I
know it's not d. And I was,

866
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,910
I was tweeting once again being a
fucking idiot. So while you were driving,

867
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,970
not while I was writing,
but here's the thing in between Charles,

868
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:20,590
that was terrible. So we get to the
next terminal. Okay, I'm in a bus.

869
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:25,510
I couldn't see what the letter was and
it says, uh, it says next to, you know,

870
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:29,020
next term when he starts, all I
hear is that the airlines, Japanese,

871
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:33,820
their Iraqi air, Turkish air,
United, Arab Emirates. I'm like,

872
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:36,190
all right, international terminal,
blah blah, blah, blah, blah.

873
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,080
And then all of a sudden
we're going back to the,

874
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:41,140
where the fuck I was going to go. Well,
what happened term leader? The guy goes,

875
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,680
I want it to terminally southwest

876
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,320
the International. Does that make any
fucking sense? Japanese air, Turkish air,

877
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:52,830
Iraqi air, south west,
then somebody by southwest.

878
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,720
So didn't a bigger airline by southwest.
Is that have anything to do with it?

879
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:01,040
I thought I heard that. I
thought southwest got bought
by some bigger airline.

880
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,150
What are you hanging out with?
Pilots? No, fuck. Do you know that?

881
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,240
I don't know cause I read
things. I Dunno. I am.

882
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,510
I really could have sworn at that happen.

883
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,980
Okay.

884
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,110
You know what's funny about you?
You don't want to get a fuck anyway.

885
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,160
Wanted to bring this up.

886
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:19,030
How you don't want to get a TV in the
bedroom because you said it affects the

887
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:22,900
connection between the two people.
I'm keeping it clean here and meanwhile,

888
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:26,070
every fucking night, you know, you're,

889
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,040
you're on your laptop. So what's
the point? Why can't I watch the,

890
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:33,540
the end of a game laying there in bed,
rubbing my bulls,

891
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:39,210
watching a game. There's another, there's
nowhere in here to hang a television.

892
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,390
Well, they used to have these things
back in the day called TV stance.

893
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,350
And when you bought a TV that no, that's
not gonna be a TV stand in here. No,

894
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,160
I don't at all. That's hilarious.
I thought I had 50% of this room.

895
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:53,490
Can I be on my side of
the room then? Um, no.

896
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,330
I literally blocked the door to my
closet with a TV. If I could just do it.

897
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,560
Do you want to like it right there and
have the door closed so we can like see

898
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:05,040
it on an angle? I mean, that could
work. That's not a crazy idea.

899
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,430
It's not a crazy idea. It's one of the
best ideas you've ever had. Thank you.

900
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,460
I'll get rid of that closet door.
You're not,

901
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:14,010
you're not going to get rid of the closet.
I'll fucking open that. God. Let's be,

902
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:16,320
let's close the door.
Let's be serious here.

903
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:21,270
I'll play another man who knows how to
fix things. To open that wall up there.

904
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,890
My entire closet into a fucking TV.
That whole walls a TB.

905
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,600
Most people make it in an aquarium,
right?

906
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,370
Like obsessed with lying down
while watching TV. Tired.

907
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,040
Fucking tired.
My brain doesn't work anymore.

908
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,050
I've traveled more and the last fucking
year and a half and I'm old now. Okay.

909
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,260
I'm fucking old. I forgot. I
lost another pair of sunglasses.

910
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,580
I left my car charger. I
just drop off. Rent a car.

911
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,830
I just get out of the car.
Yeah, I mean I shouldn't.

912
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,100
I should be wearing those
hospital loafers carrying an ivy,

913
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,140
but that should be like I told you too
that all of would tag is a phone call and

914
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,880
they were like, no, we don't see it then
fine, you move on. But if they're like,

915
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:07,320
actually yeah,

916
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,750
I just went out to the glove compartment
and there they were working on,

917
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:15,500
I left my sunglasses in a Vegan
restaurant in the dude stole them. Okay.

918
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:19,310
It's still sad about that, huh? There's
something about a Vegan restaurant.

919
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:24,320
Why You keep tying veganism to like your,
your a to,

920
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,560
you know, they're like, what? Sufferable
people out there. No offense vegans,

921
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:29,920
but you know you guys can be too much.

922
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,520
Oh Shit. I said, hey,

923
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:38,870
you know what people wanted me to
talk about Jay z and Salon Juror. Oh,

924
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:42,520
the elevator fail. Whatever the hell
are fucking name. That's a name.

925
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,550
I'm sick of Jay z wearing that.
Roger Moore Tuxedo. We get it.

926
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:51,710
You're fucking cool enough already.
Tom Ford. Oh, is that what that is?

927
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,550
I always feel at this point,
Jay z so famous,

928
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:59,390
you forget he's from Brooklyn and he
fucking grew up in a street corner.

929
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:03,500
Can still beat the shit out of you.
Although him with his shirt off, you know,

930
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,573
I don't know.

931
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,450
He's definitely a businessman
either. Yeah, exactly.

932
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,150
He's fine dining,

933
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:16,660
eating like steak and wine and like
[inaudible] I can tell you this.

934
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,870
I need to do all,
he's got the gift of Gab lab.

935
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,040
He doesn't need to do all of it. Doesn't,
it doesn't, you know, I've, I've, I've had

936
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,090
enough arguments with people.
God bless him and his Roger Moore Tuxedo.

937
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:33,130
Did you talk about the elevator
fight? Have you Kinda I,
I, I, I'll talk about it.

938
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,810
Oh, I'll talk about it. Write down.

939
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,500
I thought Jay z regardless of whatever
the fuck he said that set her off showed

940
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,040
unbelievable restraint.
Okay.

941
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,210
Getting kicked by a woman in high
heel shoes. I've been there. Okay.

942
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,500
That five fucking hurts.

943
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:58,270
And he kept taking it to the hands
and there was a moment at one,

944
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:02,500
I only watched it once. There was a time,
like one of the last times she hit him,

945
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,960
she even flinched cause she was like,

946
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:08,470
yeah at this point he decided to
deserve to get punched in the face.

947
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:11,260
You see her flinch,
she spit at him.

948
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,860
That was what was really awful.

949
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,140
That's what I forgot to do
to that driver this morning.

950
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:20,710
That would have been like Browning
bitch move nine. Never do that.

951
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:25,930
But you know their family has
problems like anybody else's family.

952
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:28,180
I feel like if anything it just,
you know,

953
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,890
it just goes to show you
that you shouldn't feel bad
when you know your uncles

954
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:35,440
or whatever started screaming
at each other over thanksgiving.

955
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:36,610
That is funny though,

956
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:39,340
when you really think about how many
people are at tour judging them.

957
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:44,260
Actually this footage that exists
somewhere of their family fighting in an

958
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:48,810
elevator, it's just they're not
famous and nobody cares. So it's,

959
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,480
it just gets taped over.
I feel like a lot of,

960
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:55,750
there are a lot more like physical
fights that happen in families between

961
00:57:55,751 --> 00:58:00,440
siblings and stuff that
most people wouldn't want to
admit. You know? So it's, I,

962
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:02,590
it's, I really don't think
it's that big of a deal.

963
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,530
I was watching it like salons stop.
No,

964
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,980
definitely said something fucked up
because you definitely has Beyonce did do

965
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:13,570
anything. She, she was, she
was staying with her sister.
She was probably like, wow,

966
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:17,530
that's what happens when you say
x, Y and z. That was her vibe.

967
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:25,390
Uh, yeah. So, but I, I, it's not that big
of a deal. I don't feel like, you know,

968
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,690
well that's kind of a big no, that's
a tough, that's, that's, it's over.

969
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:33,010
Their relationship is fucking over.
And if money wasn't involved,

970
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,440
whose relationship? Jay Z's and
uh, the fucking large, yeah,

971
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:42,390
those sidekick there. She's
not, yeah, she is. Come on

972
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:48,100
Frank. Frank Stallone. No, no.
She has a really good album.

973
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:50,650
I love her music and she has great style.
No,

974
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:55,450
she thoughts me miss as Beyonce obviously
and all these dumb ass Internet people

975
00:58:55,451 --> 00:58:57,760
on Twitter are like, I've never
even heard words. Who knows?

976
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,740
You should be thankful she got any car.

977
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:05,230
This is my nice theory because you don't
know music beyond what's on your top 40

978
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:05,881
radio station.

979
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:09,280
And they play in the morning while you're
going to work doesn't mean that this

980
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:10,390
person isn't talented.
No,

981
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:13,470
I just get annoyed with that is first
of vegans down the music lovers,

982
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,833
this is the deal.

983
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,200
The only way she can make it as if she's
in the same group is Beyonce because

984
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:24,920
that's the way it fucking works.
There's no way.

985
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,980
Never in the history of two people in
the same family trying to be a solo

986
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:34,310
artists. Have they ever made it?
They always, you got to be together.

987
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,640
The Everly brothers,
the Jackson five,

988
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,830
the Osmonds and then what
happens is somebody breaks
out of it and then the rest

989
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:46,640
of them go back to the dinner table going,
I have an album out to whenever.

990
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:51,410
He's like, yeah, we don't care. I
know I'm your mother. I don't care.

991
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,840
Michael is special.
Donny and Marie are the best.

992
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,150
They're younger than you.

993
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,800
They're cuter than you and Jesus likes
them better and that's what happens and

994
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:04,634
you're fucked.

995
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,410
So the only move she had was
when Beyonce was on the way up.

996
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:11,870
She should have been in Destiny's child.
Look at me.

997
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,860
Look at me on the other side of the fence,
just calling off groups here.

998
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,250
Wow. Was she in that group? She was like,

999
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:23,930
I thought it was Kim Coles and a
that chick from Cole from uh, uh,

1000
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,890
the one in the roller skates
today wasn't she had that

1001
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:34,040
name and black people now. Yeah. Um,
now she was like a backup dancer.

1002
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,080
She went on tour with
them when she was younger.

1003
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:39,850
She had an album when she was younger.
She got pregnant. She, Matt Cutts.

1004
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:44,120
They're like, I was in Oklahoma
as a backup dancer. I was,

1005
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,660
remember that ACDC,
that ACDC video who made,

1006
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:50,620
who when I had all the Angus is up there.
I was, well, I was one of the Angus six.

1007
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,350
She, I know she also, I didn't
really, I didn't know. I wish I did.

1008
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:59,500
She also wrote quite a few of Beyonce
songs and I co wrote some of destiny shots

1009
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:04,250
on it. So you know, she's, she's got
other talents, things, you know. Yeah.

1010
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,570
She's seven.
She's like that.

1011
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,320
She's like that chick and I say,
hey,

1012
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:17,370
now go in. And her name is Linda. No,

1013
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:22,280
it is it is it called Jessica.
So you know I'm right.

1014
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,810
I don't know what her name
is. Four non blondes. Yeah.

1015
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,520
Lead or Linda Perry recently married
to Sarah Gilbert from Roseanne.

1016
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,170
Did you know that you could play
Darlene? They're, they're married.

1017
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,310
The last time I saw Linda Perry,
not the last time, like I see her,

1018
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:40,280
but I saw her blonde chick.

1019
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:43,160
Isn't she like fuck she's
gotta be my age probably.

1020
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,980
What's she going around with that
little girl for what he's talking about?

1021
01:01:45,981 --> 01:01:48,680
Sarah Gilbert is older than I
and I saw the show the other day.

1022
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:51,050
She's like 12th that's
cause she looks great.

1023
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,560
Like I was watching the fucking TV show

1024
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,610
just bombing all over the place.

1025
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,440
But now I saw Linda Perry at the rest
of the Vegan restaurant in question.

1026
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,640
Oh yeah. I hope she didn't leave
her fucking sunglasses or a top hat.

1027
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:12,380
I did not. You like her Linda Perry. Oh,

1028
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:16,070
because I had a problem with white
people with dreadlocks. Dammit.

1029
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,230
Fucking snuffed that right out.

1030
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,860
You're too smart for
your own fucking yeah.

1031
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,490
Good. She doesn't have them anymore. Yeah.

1032
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,960
But she had a young writer,

1033
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:33,310
Nia doesn't like white people with dreads
where it's like she doesn't like wet

1034
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:37,940
weds. I just feel like, I don't know,

1035
01:02:37,941 --> 01:02:42,530
tread lugs are a very particular
cult. I don't know. Maybe they don't,

1036
01:02:42,531 --> 01:02:45,620
that style doesn't
belong to anyone anymore.

1037
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,730
You considered it an off
shoot of blackface? I, no,

1038
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,240
I think it's like,
you know,

1039
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:57,140
white people that don't want to do their
hair and like think they're super, um,

1040
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:02,170
like tapped into like roster reggae
music and like what if they really fat?

1041
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:08,570
Really? What if they really, really,

1042
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:12,990
really love weed that, yeah,
that doesn't mean anything. That,

1043
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,620
and they actually normally do really,
really,

1044
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:19,130
really love weed with the goddamn
hemp necklaces and whatnot.

1045
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:21,740
So it's another commitment
to the lifestyle.

1046
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:25,940
That's not all Rastafarianism is though.
It's a religion.

1047
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:31,750
No, it isn't. Yes it is. Google
it not in this country. Well,

1048
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,410
it's one of their holidays.

1049
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:35,690
And how can we don't get the
day off because it's not,

1050
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,740
it's not an American thing. You said it's
not, not in this country. It's actually,

1051
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,080
no, I was joking. I was
just being an idiot. But no,

1052
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:46,400
it's not an like an American or
whatever religion. No, it isn't. No,

1053
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:49,500
but this aren't there enough rosters over
here that they could start complaining

1054
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:54,410
and we could get another day off.
Y'All mine,

1055
01:03:54,411 --> 01:03:58,510
I've come. The Jews got
all that days off. Sorry.

1056
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:02,910
Worst fucking Jamaican accent ever.
Is that what Rastafarian's come from?

1057
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,440
I Dunno. All I know is I
wouldn't fuck with any of them.

1058
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:11,130
I don't believe in magic.
Do you believe in magic?

1059
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:13,770
But I do with fucking those people.
I wouldn't fuck with them.

1060
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:19,410
I saw nothing. Magic. I've
watched stuff voodoo. Yeah,

1061
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:20,660
cause that's not the same place.

1062
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:24,410
It's all Raiders of the lost ark to
me the same thing at all. Listen,

1063
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:29,570
they stay still. They still use to
you, aren't they? Yeah, I went there.

1064
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:31,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's threatening.

1085
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:57,820
We've covered it all.
Mail carrier. I know,

1086
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,770
but that job's not going to
exist in a couple of years.

1087
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,150
The phase and the whole
frigging thing out. Um,

1088
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,840
and back in the day they had a mail
man. Um, all right, wait a second.

1089
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:10,870
I needed to promote something
here. Oh, people, oh,

1090
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:15,700
I haven't got to the fucking questions
this week. Um, oh, people always ask,

1091
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:20,470
where can I email the podcast?
This is where you can do it at bill.

1092
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:25,420
Sorry, Bill at the [inaudible]
podcast.com. Once again,

1093
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:29,080
bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1094
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:34,000
Okay. Day you go. And
on Twitter you can also,

1095
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:39,001
if you want to look up some of the clips
and shit at the mm podcast and MMP in

1096
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:41,440
both things is capitalized.

1097
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,600
Now they have to rewind both whatever
the fuck it takes. All right, Stan hope.

1098
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,030
Um, tons of emails about
the standup episode. Lots of
kind words from listeners,

1099
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:55,370
insane amounts of requests
for him to come back. It's,

1100
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,440
we need him to say thank you for the
flowers, but he never treated me back,

1101
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:01,510
but he has also a gazillion followers,

1102
01:07:01,511 --> 01:07:05,880
so he probably didn't even
see him as he did. He brought
you that, uh, the Nice, uh,

1103
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,390
it's not a bouquet. He bites
you. A potted plant. Yeah.

1104
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:12,040
He bought you the flowers that keep
given and the little floral arrangement.

1105
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,740
I put it out on my little back and either
for some reason he thought that you

1106
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:18,010
weren't going to like, like he was
going to be, I don't know what,

1107
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:19,750
like a bad influence.
He would've loved them.

1108
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:24,100
Came in absolutely killing this
fucking leisure suit. He looked great.

1109
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:26,890
He was wearing a leisure suit.
I missed him. And then he

1110
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,430
never met him, but he sounds cool and he's
really funny and so, oh yeah. Meet him.

1111
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:36,910
Really flooding is an understatement.
He's been like, you know,

1112
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,880
anybody who says that's the funniest
guy in the country for the last,

1113
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,610
at least eight years. I, I
would never, I would just say,

1114
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:47,260
you have great taste in comedy. Now. Get
Out of my way. I'm trying to find my car.

1115
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,060
Oh, entitled bill this week.
All right. Dare Billy faithful.

1116
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,330
You and Nia seemed to have a great
relationship from the listeners.

1117
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:58,480
Point of view. Uh,
couples always play that.

1118
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:00,550
If you could shoot with anyone who would,
uh,

1119
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,420
why did you have to show up for this? Who
would it be game? I'm asking you this.

1120
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:09,400
If you could have one woman from all of
history. I love when people say that.

1121
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:12,810
Like you have any idea when that what,

1122
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:16,160
what like Joan of arc look like?
You just what the way she,

1123
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:21,230
that she was painted women were
fucking ugly back in the day. Oh,

1124
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:24,710
stop it. And the guys were, everybody
was shaped like a refrigerator.

1125
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,370
That's why I hate those old photos.
When your pictures, the paintings,

1126
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:32,390
when you go there,
all those fucking rump roast.

1127
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,230
Everybody just fucking
how many wars did you win?

1128
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:40,750
How are you like get on, just go walk
around the castle a couple of times. Yeah,

1129
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,600
fuck out. Fine Art or Web implies
those people were just there. Yeah.

1130
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:46,970
Live in the life,
eating good food and being served as,

1131
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:50,920
and they just sat around
pasty fat thighs and asses.

1132
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,600
They didn't have to do anything
as the people out in the field.

1133
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:57,180
Those were the people who had gray
bodies. But the aristocrats, yeah,

1134
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:01,790
there's just kind of, you
know, they're turning into
mush as you like to say. Yeah.

1135
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:02,530
Okay,

1136
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:06,580
well we should have painted the poor
people because the fucking bad ass is in

1137
01:09:06,581 --> 01:09:10,910
the castle. They were a mess. No
wonder they wore robes. You know,

1138
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:15,470
everybody else was walking around
with a fucking leaf over their junk.

1139
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,740
All right,
I'm asking you this.

1140
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:24,410
If you could have one woman from all of
history be absolutely in love with Billy

1141
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:29,090
twinkle toes. Oh, it's this for you.
Who would it be? No, it's for you. Oh,

1142
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:29,960
they're writing. It's him. Okay.

1143
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:35,030
Assuming Nia isn't in the picture for
nonviolent reasons, who would be a girl?

1144
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:40,090
Imagine you have 60 seconds to give your
answer and it's going to stick for all

1145
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:45,170
n n Aternity. Uh, thanks
and go fuck yourself.

1146
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,370
Um,

1147
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:53,300
60 seconds on the clock. I know what's
fucked up is what's great about this is,

1148
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:54,900
and it isn't just who do you want to bang?

1149
01:09:54,901 --> 01:09:58,380
I'm going to have to live with this
person when the looks go and that you want

1150
01:09:58,381 --> 01:10:01,320
them to be in love with you
and you have all of history.

1151
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,170
All of history for me is every
hot woman I've seen since the 70s.

1152
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,900
You one choice,
one choice.

1153
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:14,950
There's some seventies women that you
bring up. I feel like you might still,

1154
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,960
I liked all the Charlie. You know what?
Uh, I'd liked all the Charlie's angels,

1155
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:22,700
but I could, I live with
them. Kate Jackson was,

1156
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:26,630
I think the cutest one. I loved
Kate Jackson with that smokey voice.

1157
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:30,010
And when she was on the rookies, what,
how much? Well, how much time I got left.

1158
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:34,910
You think about 30 seconds. 30
seconds. 25. Who else did I like?

1159
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:38,840
Now the smokey voice with some curves
was the chicken the beginning of a

1160
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:45,290
cheers did she was on fat actress
and she looked like, oh yeah,

1161
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:49,900
she's really beautiful. She's
gorgeous. She is beautiful stomach.

1162
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,550
Very beautiful. Fuck. Um,
so Kirstie Alley circuit.

1163
01:10:55,551 --> 01:11:00,230
Cheers. K Jackson. So
good. Charlie's angels.

1164
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:03,670
But you only get to somebody else.
I know somebody else.

1165
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:08,610
This is too fucking quick. No, no, no.

1166
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:12,790
I got 10 seconds. You
got to down sad. Nine.

1167
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,183
Hey crusher,

1168
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,730
that Marion Ross. What? Marion Ross,

1169
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:22,590
who's Marion Ross played the mom
on happy days. I had nothing.

1170
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:26,880
I had to go with something funny so I get
to choose just no pants. But I'm here.

1171
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:30,210
I know you hear it. But the question
was it for you. Let's see. Summer baby,

1172
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,380
summer baby, sunny, Sunny Davies,

1173
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:37,710
sunny baby there when I
answered the door there, Billy,

1174
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:42,810
I gotta admit that's a fucking ah no,
that's actually a good,

1175
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:45,080
he has abs and he could sing,
you know,

1176
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,930
so you get the movie star in the
Rock Star. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

1177
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:54,830
Sorry. Summer baby deer. Billy SPF
1000. You get it. Cause I'm pasting,

1178
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:57,450
you know, some cunt wrote me on
Twitter saying like, hey bill,

1179
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,570
I want to take a picture at the Ryman,
but you're so pasty.

1180
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:04,620
It just looked like a bunch of
clothes and uh, which is true.

1181
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:06,900
I'm definitely pasty,
but here's a little tip for you.

1182
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,120
People out there want to take
a picture during the show.

1183
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,260
Why don't you use a fucking
camera? You know, I love,

1184
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:17,370
I was always me and my pigments.
Faults rather than you and your phone.

1185
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:20,940
You're taking a picture with a phone.
It's a phone.

1186
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,840
It's a cam quarter.
It's a texting device.

1187
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,250
It's something you can watch porno on.
Oh,

1188
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:31,770
when it's also a camera trying to do too
many things. It's wearing too many hats.

1189
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,380
You bring a fucking camera in there.

1190
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,180
It can capture me and all my lack of
pigment. Alright, so quit blaming me.

1191
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:42,900
It's your fucking phone. All
right. Big plans for this summer.

1192
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:46,980
I know you live out there and the
perfect climate. No, I don't. I don't.

1193
01:12:46,981 --> 01:12:50,940
It gets hot as hell here in the
summertime and it catches on fire. Um,

1194
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,290
he said for people not
soil. He said, that's funny,

1195
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:58,760
but what's on tap in the months of June,
July and August,

1196
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:02,700
do you ever think about getting a jet
ski and hunting sharks and the coast?

1197
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,700
Do you have a pool?
What are you excited for or,

1198
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:09,530
uh,
I am excited to not kill sharks.

1199
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,980
I think it's disgusting that
people do that Shit. And, uh,

1200
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:16,120
I think it's disgusting that people
swim in the fucking ocean. I think it's,

1201
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,780
you shouldn't do that shit. That's
disgusting. It's reckless. Uh,

1202
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:24,130
I don't have a pool. What
am I excited for? Uh,

1203
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,870
um,
doing Mike Johnston,

1204
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,500
another one of his workouts and
I'm leading with the left hand,

1205
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,940
one of his drum exercises.

1206
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:35,780
I'm leading with the left hand and it's
getting fucking stronger every day. And,

1207
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:38,380
uh,
I'm having a hell of a time playing drums.

1208
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,570
I'm decided to ride some
motorcycles this summer.

1209
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,120
I'm excited to take my dog on a hike.

1210
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:48,050
I'm excited to not fucking work for a
couple of months after I take my special,

1211
01:13:48,051 --> 01:13:51,950
other than doing the local clubs out
here to build up my next hour. Oh.

1212
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:56,300
And of course, I'm also doing
the, uh, um, doing that, um,

1213
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:59,810
benefit on July 14th at the
green building in Brooklyn,

1214
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:03,890
New York with Jimmy Smith.
Um, James Smith, sorry.

1215
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,590
And um,
Jimmy Smith.

1216
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:11,590
Jimmy Smits fucking Nytd
blue. Um, all right,

1217
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:12,340
last thing,

1218
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,750
girlfriend. Constantly gets
hit on. Ah, Jesus Christ.

1219
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:20,500
Hey Nia,
come in here for this one.

1220
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:27,490
The landscapers. Oh,
Jesus Christ. All right.

1221
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,280
The landscaper did that.

1222
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:33,980
The landscape for these are the people
who actually plant the fucking tomatoes.

1223
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,440
As you can tell,
all I do is tell jokes.

1224
01:14:36,441 --> 01:14:37,910
I don't fucking know
how to do anything else.

1225
01:14:37,911 --> 01:14:40,100
I can't even drive myself
back from the fucking airport.

1226
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:43,880
I lose my sunglasses like an old man.
I have caretakers at this point,

1227
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,740
a dear Billy red balls.

1228
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,800
I've been with my girlfriend for around
a year and I've noticed that lots of

1229
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:54,110
other men hit on her.
I mean a lot.

1230
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:59,150
Now this happens almost all this almost
never happens when I'm around. Oh,

1231
01:14:59,151 --> 01:15:00,200
that's respectful,

1232
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:04,130
but she tells me at least a few times
a week about a creepy stranger who

1233
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:05,980
approaches her or cat calls,

1234
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:09,860
or I have to say it makes me pretty
uncomfortable but proud at the same time.

1235
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,490
The weird part of all this is
that why my girlfriend is Asian.

1236
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,700
It's only older black men that
hit on her. Wow, that's weird.

1237
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:22,720
She must have a fucking fat ass
or something. No disrespect.

1238
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:27,760
Now we're both in college and I just got
back from four months studying abroad

1239
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,100
in France while I was there.

1240
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:34,600
She told me about a guy in a parking
garage that came up behind her and groped

1241
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:36,550
her.
I told you she's got a fat ass,

1242
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:41,710
a guy who stopped traffic in the middle
of downtown Atlanta just to say what's

1243
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:42,220
up.

1244
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:47,220
And a tutor who flat out asked if she's
single and started to insult me without

1245
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:51,340
ever having met me.
Oh my God.

1246
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,700
That's fucking awesome. I'm
sorry, but that's hilarious.

1247
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:59,480
He's hitting on one of his students,
finds out he has a boyfriend. Yay. Go.

1248
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,410
Sounds like a dose.

1249
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,030
Yeah.

1250
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:05,390
How soon before that guy
gets fired? Um, anyways,

1251
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,210
the cashiers at Starbucks
drop comments too.

1252
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:10,640
When she says they
always stare at my chest.

1253
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:11,690
Yeah.

1254
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:15,540
Is she trying to make me jealous?
MMM.

1255
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,180
Well, have you conveyed to her
how that makes you feel? You know,

1256
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:24,510
just say not for nothing. You
are gorgeous. I understand
why people look at you.

1257
01:16:24,511 --> 01:16:28,290
I mean, I looked at you, I
didn't look at you like a creep.

1258
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:28,990
Yeah.

1259
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:29,321
You know,

1260
01:16:29,321 --> 01:16:32,530
I just thought you was stunningly
beautiful and I had to talk to you and now

1261
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:37,310
here we are in this relationship. But uh,
I dunno. I Dunno why she's doing that.

1262
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,490
Do you not tell her she's
beautiful all the time?

1263
01:16:40,491 --> 01:16:43,370
Are you not giving her something
that she needs? So she's saying,

1264
01:16:43,371 --> 01:16:47,330
look at all these other people who want
me or is she just out of her fucking

1265
01:16:47,331 --> 01:16:50,870
mind? I don't know. Let's keep
reading now for the summer.

1266
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:56,240
She's also in a study. She's also in a
study abroad program, but in Barcelona.

1267
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:57,940
Okay.

1268
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:58,930
Jesus Christ.

1269
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,050
Yeah.

1270
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:03,530
Who is this right now? Oh, and
even fucking, is this like a,

1271
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,080
you guys are live in
a hell of a life here.

1272
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:10,310
While they were out in a little group
exploring the city, one guy with her tried

1273
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:15,200
to hold her hand and tried to play
it off is just a joke. Uh, Jesus,

1274
01:17:15,201 --> 01:17:17,720
I can't get mad at that.
We've all had a big swing and a miss.

1275
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:24,560
What are you doing? Oh No, no, I'm just
kidding. I'm just kidding. Um, anyways,

1276
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:28,070
I don't know why she tells me about these
things, but she knows, oh, she knows.

1277
01:17:28,071 --> 01:17:31,770
It makes you feel uncomfortable.
If I was ever there with her,

1278
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:35,820
I doubt this would ever happen. But we're
unfortunately long distance until July.

1279
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:39,270
I'm kind of worried because she's
under 21 but now she's in Europe,

1280
01:17:39,271 --> 01:17:42,330
she's able to drink and I'm
scared someone's going to
try and take advantage of

1281
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:46,650
her and there's nothing I can do. Am I
crazy for having this bothered me so much?

1282
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:51,510
I don't know what I can
do to stop it or even if,

1283
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,340
or even if it would stop when I'm
with her, how do I keep them away?

1284
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:58,080
Okay.

1285
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,230
Let me ask you a question,
sir. Do you love this woman?

1286
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,010
You know, is this the woman that
you think you're going to be with?

1287
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:11,360
If you have a definite answer,
yes.

1288
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:16,480
Then you need to talk to her about
this. Okay. And just say, listen,

1289
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:19,180
you're a beautiful woman and I'm just
going to have to accept the fact that when

1290
01:18:19,181 --> 01:18:22,690
I'm not around, guys are going to
ask you out the same way I did. Okay.

1291
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:24,970
But for my own sanity,

1292
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:28,660
I would really appreciate it if
he didn't tell me about it. Okay.

1293
01:18:28,661 --> 01:18:30,100
Unless obviously somebody gropes you,

1294
01:18:30,101 --> 01:18:34,750
then I want to fucking find the guy
and kill him. Um, if your answer is no,

1295
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:37,960
um,
you are studying abroad in France.

1296
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,040
I just came back from there.

1297
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:45,990
The most beautiful women I've ever seen
in my life per capita are over there.

1298
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,920
You're going to be foreign. You're going
to have a fucking sexy accent to them.

1299
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,720
Cut Your fucking losses.

1300
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:57,320
Go down and buy some fucking
condoms and have at it all right.

1301
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:03,390
That's, that's my suggestion. I hope
I didn't go too quickly with that.

1302
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:05,580
But uh,
how do you keep them away?

1303
01:19:05,581 --> 01:19:08,010
You can't keep him away and when you
date a beautiful warm, when you're just,

1304
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,860
you have to accept on some level
that guys are going to hit on him.

1305
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:15,060
Ken on him hit her on her and you
can't get mad at that. That beautiful.

1306
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,590
You did the same fucking thing.

1307
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,800
You can't tell me before you
didn't get to know her as a person.

1308
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:22,690
If you really do love her, that when you
looked at her, you didn't shoot, went gat.

1309
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,330
Hey, you did something. You
didn't say something like that.

1310
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:31,670
So, um, yeah, you know,

1311
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:34,400
I don't know what to tell you.
You're going to have,

1312
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,530
you're going to have to
find a middle ground.

1313
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:41,210
If you're going to stay with this woman,
you either have to fuck in a, yeah,

1314
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:44,300
you've got to convey that it's bugging
you and then make peace with the fact

1315
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:48,440
that it's still going to fucking happen
on some level. All right? But, uh,

1316
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,110
she's really young and you
must be really young too,

1317
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:56,170
and you're both going to countries
where they fuck because you know,

1318
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,660
that's what's to do over
there. I'm such an idiot, but

1319
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:05,660
I'm just saying, you know, what are you
going to do Bob? It was awful. Sorry,

1320
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:09,900
I just got off a fucking
plane. I tried. I tried. Um,

1321
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,620
that's my advice. If you know what,
I'm jet lagged here. If I fucking,

1322
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:17,070
somebody has some better advice,
just write it into the,

1323
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:21,210
a bill@themmpodcast.com.

1324
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,330
And, uh, I'll try and maybe
do a better job next week.

1325
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:28,470
That's the podcast for this week.
Sorry. No, I got the hiccups. That's it.

1326
01:20:28,471 --> 01:20:31,980
Everybody got fuck yourself. Have
a wonderful, a wonderful week.

1327
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:36,540
And I'm going to go watch the fucking
ranges. Play the Canadian say it.
