You always try to bag, give it a
shot, right? Everybody else did.

16
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:05,970
You have to go to work on the 26th, the
27th year, right? Then you're right back.

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,140
It's the fucking worst.
Everybody should be off.

18
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,150
You shouldn't even be able to
buy food this time of year.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,220
Everything is fucking closed.
Everybody just sit down,

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,620

a week for you south week,

got to be more like Europe.

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,340
I don't know how they do it over there
with their fucking God damn skinny jeans

23
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:32,820
is, you know, they fucking legs are
skinny as their arms over there.

24
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,300
And those tall people, countries,

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
you know, down in the
Mediterranean, these motherfuckers,

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,560
they get like six weeks vacation a year.
It's fucking incredible.

27
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,490
Why don't we do that?

28
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,803
Huh?

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,130
President to be Donald Trump.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,060
Okay,

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,340
you want to make this country great?
You can make this country what?

32
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:56,960
It never fucking had six weeks
of vacation every, you know,

33
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:01,910
fucking ah, that would be
Gwen. How great would that be?

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,160
Every two months you just get a week off,
right?

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,300
Then you work for seven lucky seven.
You worked for seven fucking weeks.

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,510
Then you get a week off and just sit
there and fucking chill out and start,

37
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:21,860
you know, let all the stress of
your job go fucking start over.

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,300
Everybody is off at the same time.
Cops,

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,733

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,810
Yeah.

41
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,950
You know, people who watch the nuclear
fucking facilities, you just, you know,

42
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,570
it's not good. Nothing's going to happen.
Right. What's the Simpsons? It's you fine.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,020
Everybody just chill.
Even a war. That's it.

44
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,830
Every fucking seven weeks.
Boom.

45
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,493
Right.

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,230
Seven weeks you try to kill
each other and then, you know,

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,280
right when it hits the eighth
week, somebody stands up
out of that trench. Yeah.

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,493
Hi.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,520
Okay.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,830
Oh,
I

51
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,400
okay.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,930
Oh,

53
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,140
you just fucking chill up. This
is, this is basically the deal.

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,990
I am mom really trying to, uh,

55
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,670
I think I'm going to
fucking talk to somebody.

56
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,840
I got to fucking get my temper under
control cause I don't want to be an angry

57
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,050
dad. Uh, I want to break this cycle.

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,550
Um, so somebody told me
yesterday, they go, well,

59
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:32,140
why don't you try metta meditation?
And I go get the fuck out of here.

60
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,110
That works. And the person was like, yeah,

61
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:39,310
I do it twice a day for 20 minutes.
And uh,

62
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,940
like I'm gonna have the time to do
that when I have a fucking kid. Uh,

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,040
twice a day for 20 minutes.
And um,

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,230
he said like, if you just
meditate, shut your brain off,

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,000
your body just starts getting rid
of stress. And I asked him, I said,

66
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:59,580
this has made you less angry.
He said much less angry.

67
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,870
So I'm going to give that a shot and
I'm going to talk to somebody, you know,

68
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:05,550
I've been cleaning up all my shit,

69
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:09,450
trying to get rid of a bunch of stuff
and I found this empty notebook and I was

70
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:12,360
like, all right, this is going to be
like my fucking angry journal, you know,

71
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,100
figure out, oh my God.
Yesterday I got the, you know,

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,350
the amount of shit that I just,
I just completely,

73
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:22,800
I go from zero to 9,000 fucking degrees.

74
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
Um,
you know,

75
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:30,180
yesterday I pulled up and there was some
guy fucking parked in, in, you know,

76
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,740
the top of my driveway cause yet another
thing was fucked up with my house.

77
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,820
They tell you guys the awning
fucking broke. It's, it's just,

78
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,990
it just never fucking ends. It just
Nav this fucking house. It never rents.

79
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,890
I just find myself, I feel like I'm
running in a giant circle that I'm,

80
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,510
once I get everything fucking
fixed, you know, 360 degrees,

81
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,160
rotisserie fucking, uh, uh,

82
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,960
whatever the fuck rebuild
of this fucking house.

83
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,660
The second I do the last thing,

84
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,440
the first thing I fixed is going to break
and it's just going to start all over

85
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:09,270
again. So, um, anyways, I'm
going to try to do that.

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
And um,

87
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,800
okay.

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:11,981
You know,

89
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:16,660
it's fucking hilarious is like when
I actually am calm and I am relaxed,

90
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,860
it actually makes my wife nervous
in a way. Like not like nervous,

91
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,710
like she's afraid I'm going to do
something. She's just like, she's like,

92
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:27,380
are you a everything okay
with you? Uh, what's,

93
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,710
what's going on with you? And it's just
like nothing. I'm just quiet and relaxing.

94
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,160
She's this. Yeah. Are you okay?

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,770
So, um, I got to dial it way the fuck out.

96
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,630
You know, I think my
average energy, you know,

97
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:51,510
you ever played like pickup whatever sport
and there's always that person taking

98
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:54,450
it way too seriously.
And before the game even starts,

99
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,190
they skate up next to you or they
stand next post up or whatever.

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,090
You can just feel their fucking
energy and you're just like, Oh God,

101
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,720
not this fucking guy. I hate to
admit it, but I think I'm that guy,

102
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,020
except I'm not playing a sport.
I'm just fucking walking around my house.

103
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,563
MMM.

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,340
I Dunno what the fuck it is, but, uh,
I have to work on that shit. So, um,

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,430
as I've been mentioned, you guys have
been getting rid of a ton of shit.

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,353
MMM.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,390
You know, selling stuff, having
a buddy of sell it on craigslist,

108
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,120
trying to take as little as
I can to goodwill because
I really believe that they

109
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:36,320
just fill that fucking truck up with 90%
of the shit, just throw it in the ocean.

110
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,310
So I'm actually trying
to sell it to people. Um,

111
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,280
just the sheer amount of shit that
people bring down to goodwill.

112
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,870
Like people use goodwill,
you know what I mean?

113
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:51,590
Without ever addressing their fucking
consumerism. And I did it too,

114
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:56,180
like how much shit I bought and just
how every time you leave the house,

115
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:00,620
she come home with something else in a
bag and then it's just in your fucking

116
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,370
house. Like when me and Nia first moved
in with two people in a fucking house,

117
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,300
I mean, it was like echo, echo, and
all of a sudden, five years later,

118
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,910
it's fucking filled up. I'm
like, what? What happened?

119
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,860
How did we become these people?
So, Ooh, ow, Ooh. So, um,

120
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,060
I'm, I'm getting rid of
like all of this clutter.

121
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,100
Uh,

122
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,610
you know, like I have every fucking laptop
just about that I've ever fucking had.

123
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,090
I've always kept them because I dunno,
like I always hear that, you know,

124
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,020
they end up in junk yards and something
leaks out of him. And I'm like, well,

125
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,920
why don't I just leave it and my fucking
closet? It's not hurting anything.

126
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:40,370
It's just sitting there and then I
got to win there. Then I got three,

127
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,061
then I got four.

128
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,570
So I'm going to try to find a place
that recycles them responsibly.

129
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,010
Um, so anyways, throughout
all of this, people go,

130
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,520
you gotta check out this documentary,
these guys, the minimalists.

131
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,190
And um,
I started to watch it the other night and,

132
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:02,230
uh, I'm totally on board. It's what
I want. And I'm watching it with the,

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,300
and it's fucking hilarious is I can
feel her getting annoyed and I'm like,

134
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,160
yeah, you're watching this and shit. She
goes, yes. She goes, you know, I don't,

135
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,510
you know,
I liked my stuff.

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,530
Blahblahblahblahblah and I kept
poking at it to see what the deal was.

137
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,810
And she's finally just like,
yeah,

138
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:21,020
I just don't give a shit about a bunch
of white people that are all excited that

139
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:25,130
they're now living with like absolutely
nothing. You know, they, they, you know,

140
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,910
if they fucking, how the fuck
did she put it? She goes,

141
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:31,820
there's a lot of people live in like
that not out of there wasn't a choice.

142
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,840
Right. And I was like, Oh, Jesus Christ,
we're going to go down that fucking road.

143
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,140
We actually had a great conversation.
I was like, you know what,

144
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,060
there's a certain kind of white person
that have fucking annoys the shit out of

145
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,030
you. She goes, no, there
is like a, yeah, there is.

146
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,080
It's still white person that is not
happy in life and is trying to, to,

147
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:53,081
to figure out what true
happiness is because the
stereotype of a white person is

148
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:57,990
that they just show up in all
their dreams come true. All right.

149
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:01,920
These are just a group of people
that were living away certain way.

150
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,530
It wasn't making them happy.
They tried something new,

151
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,810
it made them happy and they
just want to share it with you.

152
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,400
And this is why my wife's a
shit. She goes, hi, now that
you put it that way, okay,

153
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,250
fair enough. I was being judgmental,
blah blah blah, blah. We came,

154
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,800
we came to a good place, but
it was fucking, she went,

155
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,410
I wish you guys could have heard it.
She went on one of her fucking epic rants.

156
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:23,550
I was dying laughing because I,
I heard the element of truth in it,

157
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,020
but um, I dunno know there is
all of that shit out there.

158
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:30,150
Is that that fucking thing,

159
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:34,900
how every group of people is like defined,
you know,

160
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,800
by a negative and a,

161
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,260
yeah.

162
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,930
You know, I guess with white
people is that, you know,

163
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,940
we have yachts and were raised by
the maid who's not white and uh,

164
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,910
whatever we want we get and then we screw
it up and then our parents come in and

165
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:53,690
save us cause they know the judge,
you know, and that's definitely,

166
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,970
that's an option as a white
person, but that's, you know,

167
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,250
you've really slicing off
the top of the ham there

168
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,440
anyways. Um, so,

169
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,203
okay,

170
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,130
this is going to be the new me,
you know, let's see how long,

171
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:15,540
who the fuck's kid and who, let's
see a long, I can sustain this. Okay.

172
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,690
Because the reality is is
you are who the fuck you are.

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,070
And I am a wound up son of a bitch and um,

174
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,340
I'm going to try to unwind as much as
I can for as long as I can before I go

175
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:34,131
back into that deep groove that I've
worn into how my brain is functioned.

176
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,060
Uh, I'm going to try to fucking
meditate. I'm going to get, yeah.

177
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,590
Rid of all of this fucking shit.

178
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,130
Then I have accumulated,

179
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,083
mmm.

180
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,040
You know,

181
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,210
for years already I've gone to like
comedy events and stuff and they're always

182
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:57,840
giving you this gift bag.
It's, and it's Shit Shit.

183
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,300
It just, you know, I don't know
what the fuck I have to shit.

184
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,650
I don't even know what the fuck it is.

185
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,900
Little things at Jelly beans with
the fucking festivals name on it,

186
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,220
some toiletries, some
travel bag shit, you know,

187
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:17,370
all in a little bag that has the logo,
the thing on it. And you're like,

188
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:20,910
I gotta keep this, you know, part of
my scrapbook that I don't fucking have.

189
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,260
And I just, when I started to
do as I just say no, I say no.

190
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:27,750
And then if it gets weird and
they had this vibe of like, Hey,

191
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,330
I'm trying to give you a gift
here and you're turning it down.

192
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:34,680
I kind of feel insulted me a little bit.
Kind of insulted me a little bit here.

193
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,740
I will take the bag and then when I
do is I come home and then I just,

194
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,670
I give it to somebody. Hey, no, I
just said to stay a techie show.

195
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,200
You don't want it. Yeah. Take it,
take it, get it the fuck outta here.

196
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,440
You know what's funny too is actually
now when you go out and you try and sell

197
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:57,580
your shit, you realize how little fucking
value it has. You know what I mean?

198
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,790
Um,
I dunno.

199
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,670
And I should tell you when as they
sell the shit have an element of guilt.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,530
And I always think of that movie.
What about Bob?

201
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,470
When that therapist past
Bob onto Richard Dreyfus,

202
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,920
that's what I feel like I'm doing with
my stuff is I'm selling to these people.

203
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:13,240
I'm just looking at him and say by it.
I'm like,

204
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:18,160
you're not going to fucking use that
your problem now buddy.

205
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,350
Um, so anyways, that's what I've
been, that's what I'm doing.

206
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:28,180
I got to a,
I have to chill way the fuck out.

207
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,920
Um,
for the next 18 to 22 years have a deadly.

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,500
And so I imagine I'll get some tweets.

209
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,740
Don't you think that's going to
hurt your comedy? No, I don't.

210
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,150
I've been fucking up my life
for almost half a century.

211
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,890
I have plenty to draw on.

212
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:49,891
And just the fact of someone being his
wound up as me trying to walk around and

213
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,550
act like,
you know,

214
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:55,360
wearing a sweater and laughing at small
talk is going to do it for me. Right,

215
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,300
right. There there'll be
something in that. Right.

216
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,580
Well maybe you weren't thinking that.

217
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,070
Maybe that's what I'm worried about and
I'm saying that you're saying it so I

218
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:07,870
don't look like I'm, um, I'm fucking
weak on some level. Um, so anyways.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,810
All right. Jesus Christ's, I've just
been fucking babbling like some chicken,

220
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,350
one of these fucking shows.
But bill,

221
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:17,250
maybe you got a little fucking reality
chicken. You, you have to think ahead.

222
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,990
Was fucking God. Damn cough ever go away.
I'm sorry. Let's do that again. You know,

223
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,640
I find it really irritating that I,
uh,

224
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,090
took some medication for
a cough a long time ago,

225
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,510
about a month ago and I haven't,
I'm not smoking cigars.

226
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,220
I am getting a good
night's sleep and I just,

227
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:37,010
for some reason in order
to do this is my wife, uh,

228
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,640
is so pregnant right now that
she doesn't remotely get cold.

229
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,340
So the fucking heat has
been off in the house.

230
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,150
All the ag, I walk around with like a
sweatshirt on. I just look at, I go,

231
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:54,760
you're not cold at all.
Like my feet are fucking free.

232
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:58,100
Like we literally in the house, it's
like a log cabin. There's like no,

233
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,140
okay,

234
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,940
no heat on whatsoever.
You be here.

235
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,660
It now I've got to run the background
cause she's fucking upstairs. Right. Um,

236
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,791
but like,
you know,

237
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,090
I got this old house and they got these
cool fucking old windows and I don't

238
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:13,040
want to get rid of them because they
don't make them like that anymore.

239
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,740
But the wind just fucking passes through.

240
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,260
Yeah.

241
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,290
Oh, the wind just goes right through
my fucking house. I swear to Christ.

242
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,124
It's unbelievable.

243
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,180
Only thing missing is just like leaves
just blowing by when I'm in the fucking

244
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:28,240
living room. So I'm always
cranking up the fucking heat.

245
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,570
She starts looking like she's under
like 20 blankets. So I have to,

246
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,890
she know what the deal is as a guy,

247
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:35,110
you're going to fucking
lose your fucking loose.

248
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,390
Why do I keep trying to
turn on my computer? Like,

249
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,770
like I actually have internet
connections down here. Um, all right.

250
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,840
It's getting to the point where
I got to read some of these, uh,

251
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,050
some of these fucking reads here.

252
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,210
We've got a doctor's
appointment with my wife today.

253
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,780
Stupid fucking things you got to go
to was a guy and when he to be there,

254
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,270
no one's going to fucking,
no one's going to talk to you at all.

255
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,620
But uh,
you know,

256
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,820
we still need you to be here cause
I haven't been to like the last two.

257
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,380
They weren't important ones.
You know,

258
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,710
they're just sort of check up things
and like she, she used to go on.

259
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,820
Everybody's saying, where's your
husband? Where's your husband?

260
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,580
We miss not talking to him when he's here.

261
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,930
All right, let's do some
reads here. Wink, wink.

341
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:38,180
like order a pizza and then

344
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,110
That's a true story. Um, all right,
where the fuck am I in this podcast?

345
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,270
20 fucking minutes.
And you know something,

346
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,660
some days it doesn't feel like
work and other days it does.

347
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,390
This is one of these days.
Um,

348
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,800
when you think Obama's thinking right now,
I always think like this time of year,

349
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,780
this time, like when a president is in
their second term, it's fucking December.

350
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,123
Okay,

351
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,480
you've got another couple of weeks before
the next fucking poor bastard comes in

352
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,140
there. You know, and I do meet bastard
cause it's always going to be a,

353
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:20,920
but it's always going to be a guide.
Ladies always going to be a guy.

354
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,520
All right?
That job is for a man.

355
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,290
There's certain things that men can't
do and there's certain things that women

356
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,990
can do and women can do a bunch of things.
But running the country is,

357
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,800
is just not one of those things.

358
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,240
I mean people are gonna just going to
take that clip and take all the fucking,

359
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,560
you know, I'm just fucking
around of it. Out of there. Yeah.

360
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,690
It's these thing that women say,

361
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,340
Hey, what do you call it?
Those Youtube fucking stars,

362
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,940
those fucking cunts you don't like when
like that guy punched the kangaroo in

363
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:59,941
the face and you want to see it and you
go to click on it and then this is just

364
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,560
this fucking high energy,

365
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:06,550
20 something Douche with the
Janet Jackson fucking microphone.

366
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,020
Can I take your order please? Going, okay.

367
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,990
See this caring.
Okay.

368
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,030
We're all familiar with the kangaroo
and then they cut to some shit about

369
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:20,840
Kangaroos and they just take this
fucking, this fucking clip. It's,

370
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,920
it's like, it's like, dude,
I don't fucking need you. I
know what's going to happen.

371
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:29,450
Just show me the original clip and these
fucking cunts insert themselves into it.

372
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,190
And then they,

373
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,920
they're making like 250 grand at God
damn fucking video assumption. You know,

374
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:41,010
they like the DJ's of
youtube in a waybill Doo,

375
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,980
Doo, Doo Doo Doo to do till, till to the
same fucking thing. They're doing that.

376
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,520
They're fucking remix in this
shit that taken other people's to,

377
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:51,880
I don't even know what deejaying
is. I have no fucking idea. Yeah.

378
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,800
I don't even know why I make fun of it.
Boy.

379
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:58,160
Yeah you do belly cause you got to
fucking a half hour to fill up here. Um,

380
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,250
anyway, so did I mention I was, I've
been trying to do the impossible.

381
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,260
I can't remember if I
already talked about this.

382
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:08,410
I'm trying to watch like every Bruin
game and every self that came this year

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,600
cause you got to choose you either a
basketball guy or a hockey guy and I've

384
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,330
been trying to watch the other night
I watched a Bruins game and then uh,

385
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:19,580
well then a fucking Celtic game.
I watched the uh,

386
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,520
I don't know if I already talked about
this cause I fucked up the podcast and

387
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:25,470
had to start it again.
I don't give a shit.

388
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,820
I watched the Bruins lose four to three
to the blue jackets and then I watched

389
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:33,840
the Celtics after that
beat the Memphis Grizzlies.

390
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:37,410
I believe I already talked about this.
I have no idea.

391
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,930
All I know is the fucking
NFL playoffs are coming up.

392
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,770
Does anything repeat anything go by faster

393
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,370
then the fucking
NFL regular season,

394
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,340
you know it goes by faster.
My fucking train of thought.

395
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,120
I was talking about
presidents this time of year.

396
00:23:56,121 --> 00:24:01,121
You know how fucking site that would
be after eight fucking years of being

397
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:05,660
president. The stress of that,
the fucking stress of that.

398
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,820
All the bodies, all the people that died
because of the decisions that you made.

399
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:13,880
It's fucking inevitable.
Okay. Cause you answer,

400
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,530
you answered to the, the, the
reptilian people at the top.

401
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,960
You know,
and I don't mean shape shifters,

402
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,990
I just mean people who do not give a
fuck about anything but themselves and

403
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:33,350
their money and power. That's all they
care about. They don't care who suffers.

404
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,260
They don't give a shit.
They don't believe in God.

405
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,160
They believe that their a god or
they believed that God is fucking,

406
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,013
you know,

407
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,790
bestowed them with this great
responsibility to run the fucking world.

408
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:51,770
I tried to take over it or whatever.
Right. I always just think like,

409
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,830
as much as Obama doesn't
want to see Trump,

410
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,880
he has to be so fucking site.
You know,

411
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,910
like if I was Obama right now,
I would just be like, dude,

412
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm getting all the
fucking sports packages.

413
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,440
I'll get myself a pair of silk
fucking pajamas, you know,

414
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,080
with sheepskin fucking slippers

415
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,240
and I'm not doing shit I am not going
to do. But they have to do shit.

416
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:20,030
You know why? Because the president
only makes 500 grand a fucking year.

417
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,840
So now what he has to do is now
for the rest of his fucking life,

418
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:27,590
he has to go out and give these
speeches. Okay. Which is, you know,

419
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,300
to the people that put them in office,

420
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,020
they pay him like six fucking figures
to get out there and tell his fucking

421
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,720
jokes into his little song and dance.
And the reality is,

422
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,110
is that just washing their
fucking bribe money, you know,

423
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:41,990
so he would push through all the shit
that they wanted or as much of it as they

424
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:46,710
could while he was in office. And
then they also get to see like, yeah,

425
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,200
see we own this guy.
You know,

426
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:51,770
is it bringing new lizards into their
fucking dent to be like, see this,

427
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,340
we actually have former presidents come
here and do a little song and dance for

428
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:58,130
us. You know why? Because
we own this fucking guy.

429
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,780
We owned them before even fucking went
in there. We own the fucking next guy.

430
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,550
You know, that's probably why, you know,

431
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,440
as much as the upper 1% probably did not
want to see Donald Trump get in there

432
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,460
because he's this fucking row guy and all
you fucking progressive lefties, he's,

433
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,830
oh, they got it. They
shut the fuck up. Uh,

434
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,120
they're actually gonna end up loving that
guy because it seems what he wants to

435
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:25,010
do is deregulate everything because
guys at his level of wealth,

436
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,520
this so fucking rich,
they find the government annoying.

437
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,310
I have to answer to Ho who is it that
the u s government,

438
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:41,630
I these fucking assholes. They
opened the door. What, what,

439
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,840
what now? Well, you
know, just uh, you know,

440
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:50,040
kind of appreciative for I where the
u s government talks to that level of

441
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,480
wealth because they need them to get
it to fucking office. Right. You know,

442
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,200
kind of appreciated if,
you know,

443
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,230
you wouldn't build that golf course over
that homeless shelter and those native

444
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,720
Americans, you know, you know, I
don't know. I'll think about it.

445
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,650
I'll think about it. All right.
Just fucking go fuck yourself.

446
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,700
I do what I want
are making money off opiates.

447
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,580
Shut the fuck up. I don't know. I Dunno.

448
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,280
I Dunno what to take,
but you know what?

449
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,410
I'm in fucking limbo right
now is where I am. Um,

450
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,460
I haven't been doing stand up. I can't
go out. I can't really leave the house.

451
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,010
I'm afraid to fucking leave
the house because you know, I,

452
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,760
I stay within like a
certain fucking radius.

453
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,680
So if my wife does not have our kid,
uh,

454
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,570
by January 2nd,

455
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,430
I am going to the rose bowl and I am
going to do the unspeakable at there.

456
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:52,100
I am going to be sober as a church mouse.

457
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,730
I won't even smoke a cigar because I have
to let those fucking things go because

458
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:02,330
I have to get life insurance and uh,
I don't want to pay the,

459
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:04,940
I'm a smoker and I don't want to
be a smoker. I, you know what,

460
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,780
I'll fucking smoke like for a year.
That's what I think.

461
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,160
Oh well I enjoy the fucking shit
out of those. Uh, yeah, dude,

462
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm getting to that point in my life. I'm
getting my affairs in order. You know,

463
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,940
it's actually,
it's like,

464
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,550
you know what I've actually found going
through the whole process of getting

465
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:26,630
life insurance and putting together a
trust and a will and all of that Shit,

466
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,660
I've actually found that to be just as
enjoyable is getting rid of all this shit

467
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:36,800
in my life. All the clutter. It's the
same thing. Like this, you know, is a guy,

468
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:41,801
I think there's something like how we
just don't deal with our mortality and uh,

469
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,920
so you don't want to think about it,

470
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:46,460
but I got to tell you once you just
like you thinking like, yeah, okay,

471
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:51,200
and something happens to me. You get this,
you get debt. And I'm fucking out, right.

472
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,610
And nobody is, you know, nobody
has to worry about anything.

473
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,130
And then they call and be like,
you know what, that son of a bitch,

474
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,020
I don't know what he was doing as
swimming with those sharks, but uh,

475
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,490
I've got to tell you, he'd say one
thing about that guy, you know,

476
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:08,440
he had his affairs in order.
You gotta be that guy.

477
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:11,350
If you have any sort of wife,
children, anything, you got it.

478
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:15,640
You got to get your fucking
affairs in order. And um,

479
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,410
I haven't done it like a lot of my
friends didn't and none of them had their

480
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:24,690
affairs in order and a
number of them died. And uh,

481
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,850
that is just a fucking thing.
I'm telling you right now.

482
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,550
You do not want to put your
fucking family through that.

483
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,820
And I'm not going to be that guy.
So hopefully I won't die before. Uh,

484
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,420
I get everything all fucking
straightened out here. But that is my,

485
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,040
that's my first thing I'm
going to do in the, in 17.

486
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,310
I'm going to prepare my affairs.

487
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:50,300
My affairs will be in order. Oh
God, this can be so weird. You know,

488
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,590
so weird about getting life insurance
as you then give your partner motive,

489
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,473
you know?

490
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,740
Yeah.

491
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,650
My wife doesn't have
fucking life insurance. She
doesn't even think about it.

492
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,860
They don't give a fuck about
us. Right. And you know what?

493
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,070
I don't want her to have life insurance
get off because then I got to deal with

494
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,150
the cops. If something came out. Well,

495
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:14,950
didn't you make fucking six figures when
she fell down that flight of stairs?

496
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,020
I swear to God,
I was by myself.

497
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,770
I was playing drums in a rehearsal space.
You know,

498
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:28,210
I spent so much time alone every day
that I would never have a fucking alibi.

499
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,710
God forbid if something ever
happened. Can Anybody, uh,

500
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,290
can anybody vouch for you
that that's where you were at?

501
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,940
And then I would have to go into my head.

502
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,450
Who did I yell at on the way?

503
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:44,120
There are the way back in a fucking car.

504
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:47,240
Did I get their license plate
so I can call them up and say,

505
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:51,740
do you remember that bald red
bearded asshole who screamed at you?

506
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,310
You know? Yeah. That you
remember that you, can you,

507
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,820
do you remember what time of day that was?
This is really critical for me.

508
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,770
Um, yeah, it's, it's a very
bizarre thing to go out and uh,

509
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,570
it's, it's, it's uh, makes you feel
at peace and then also, you know,

510
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,110
it makes you, you know, when your wife,
you know, brings over you like some food,

511
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:19,640
you kind of looking at her,
then you're looking at the
food, you know, she gets up,

512
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:20,570
you switch plates.

513
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,660
I think I've watched too many of
those first 48, you know what I mean?

514
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,750
I love those guys the way they fucking
their first two wives die mysteriously

515
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,920
and then someone else fucking Mary's.
It's just like,

516
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,290
this is the fucking thing. You can
marry somebody who had one person die.

517
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,460
Okay. That happens. Unfortunately
that fucking happened.

518
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,170
But once they're there, they're at to
get the fuck away from that person.

519
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,110
But what are the, what are the fucking
odds, you know, you got married in both.

520
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,760
Your husbands died, he married twice.
I'm a, I'm a two time widower. We have,

521
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:08,630
well you're not going to be a three time
the fuck away from me. Check please.

522
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,820
Right. He was that Hacky fucking out
to every comedy scene. I'll just,

523
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,620
I'll have what she's having. Um, yeah,
you gotta get the fuck out of there.

524
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,280
You know you can only have one spouse die.

525
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,570
Okay.

526
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,660
In after that,
if I was running shit,

527
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,770
if I was one of the Lizard people and I
was running shit, this would be the rule.

528
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:30,490
Anybody who had two
spouses die and you know,

529
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,290
we can't prove that you fucking did it.

530
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,570
You are only allowed to
date other people that had,

531
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,490
that are already had two people
die. Okay. And then, you know,

532
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,400
yeah,

533
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,910
whoever dies in that who gives a shit
cause then you just got rid of one murder

534
00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:48,540
and psycho and then you just keep having
them date each other and eventually

535
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:52,530
then there's only one and then you
stick that person in a giant like human,

536
00:32:52,531 --> 00:32:56,590
like parakeet cage and like this Gary,
it's, there's the winter or this.

537
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:57,660
She is right.

538
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,160
Okay.

539
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,480
All 48 of her husband's died
mysteriously can never prove it.

540
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,090
You know,
take it down and put it on Coney island.

541
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,450
Does that still exist?
That fucking rollercoaster.

542
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:13,740
You ever go to Coney island goal and
that one, that fucking rollercoaster.

543
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,400
It's one of the scariest fucking rides
I've ever been on. Not because it's,

544
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,560
it's like a scary ride.

545
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:22,820
It's because the ride is so fucking old
and there's no padding in this seat.

546
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:24,290
I swear to God,
I got off that ride.

547
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,600
I felt like I was in a
fucking three car accident.

548
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,120
Yeah.

549
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,210
You know, my fucking back was killing
me. My shoulder was fucked up.

550
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,933
MMM.

551
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:34,951
I don't know.
You don't.

552
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm probably fucking up my life right now
cause I'm trying to do too many things

553
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,820
at once as I always do. I'm going
to meditate. I'm going to do yoga.

554
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,840
I'm going to fucking eh, stop yelling.
I'm gonna. I'm gonna go to therapy and Ba,

555
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:48,750
ba Ba ba Ba. I think I'm freaking
out because I'm a fucking,

556
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:52,970
a volatile fucking lunatic
and I th I don't want a,

557
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,530
I don't want to be that person,
you know? You know, we want to be,

558
00:33:55,531 --> 00:33:58,890
I want to be like fucking Joe
Pesci in casino, you know,

559
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,590
minus watching my brother getting
beat to death in a cornfield.

560
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,490
Like not that part. The part where he's
making pancakes for his kid, you know,

561
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,030
despite the fact he squeezed somebody's
eyeball out in a vice like 20 minutes

562
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:11,010
earlier, then he could come
home, he could shut it off.

563
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,320
It's very inspirational and he wants more
syrup. I, you know, I love you. Right.

564
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,440
Kisses him on the head, you know,
and that's it. Then he goes out,

565
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,090
he fucking kneecap somebody's,
you know,

566
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,960
20 seconds after the bus drives away
with his kid. That's who I want to be.

567
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:32,130
All right, man. That's it.
That's the podcast. Uh,

568
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,750
and I got to admit, you know,
it's been hard for me to watch a

569
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,450
okay,

570
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,130
the Bruins this year, man. So I've
actually been watching more NBA hoop,

571
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:46,190
which I'm really fucking embarrassed to
say because I've always been a hockey

572
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:50,150
guy, but you know, I will always
be Aki. Got. But I, it's also,

573
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:53,540
I can't ignore watching what Danny
Ainge is doing. It's fucking great.

574
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,640
It's so much fun to watch. Um, so
you know what? Let's look up here.

575
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:03,320
Who Do we got next? I don't know who the
Celtics half next, but you guys here.

576
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:07,670
Aaron Kaufman is leaving fucking
gas monkey fast. Fast and loud.

577
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,440
It's fucking brutal.

578
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:10,780
Okay.

579
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,790
But the way our discovery talked about it,

580
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,250
it sounded like he was going to get
his own show, but it's just like,

581
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:19,690
what the fuck? I don't want to see
that. I want to see this spinoff,

582
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,893
you know?

583
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,830
Well, the Vernon surely were on
happy days. That was one of the,

584
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:28,830
one of the best times ever. Then they
got their own show wasn't as good.

585
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,580
It's like when a super group breaks up
and then the lead singer does their thing

586
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:34,740
and then the other bag gets a new sense,
like Van Halen,

587
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,390
David Lee Roth was never better
than when he was in Van Halen.

588
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,740
Van Halen was never better than
when David Lee Roth was there.

589
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,680
You know what I mean? Sammy Hagar
was better when he was by himself.

590
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,280
What are you talking about, Bill? I don't
know. Just fucking talking. Oh, you know,

591
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:52,560
I'm just listening. All right
bro. It's what do we got next?

592
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,130
Da Da da Da. That the toto
to Ah, we got a home and all,

593
00:35:57,131 --> 00:36:00,720
I'm against the fucking buffalo sabers.
I'd never understood that home at home.

594
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:01,860
It's a home in a way.

595
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,320
Who's his fucking Hitler youth
that they got number 55 on defense.

596
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,240
We're still Lania. We're
still laden. Jesus Christ.

597
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:14,940
Tell me his grandfather doesn't
live down in fucking South America.

598
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,800
Oh, that's an old Nazi fucking
hundred joke. All right,
we're going to end on that.

599
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,720
That's the podcast for this week.
Uh, um, just checking in on you.

600
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:32,500
That's all the fuck it was. And
if you guys want to, uh, you know,

601
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,370
keep listening to here.

602
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:35,770
We're going to play a little fucking
music and you're going to listen to some,

603
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:40,540
uh, some greatest hits from a podcast
gone by in a time. I can't remember.

604
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,660
All right. Have a great weekend. You
constant. I'll talk to you on Monday.

605
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,113
Alright.

606
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,540
Oh,

607
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,710
new years everybody. Here
we go. Dear Billy Ball drop.

608
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,130
Okay.

609
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,790
I'm not going to ask you what you're
doing on New Year's cause I already know

610
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,160
you and your Rosebowl crew will be tap
dancing at the Wilton over there. Uh,

611
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,610
I'm going to be there with
the girl. I'm 50% into. Okay,

612
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:53,320
well then that affects, uh,
what you should be buying
her that night. And he goes,

613
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:56,510
she's cool, she's hot and I don't
have any major complaints about her.

614
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,830
I'm also not in love with her and really
can't see anything beyond hooking up.

615
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,270
My plan is to laugh my ass off and see
what happens. All right, if we hook up,

616
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,680
that's great. If not, no big deal, dude.
You're in the zone. You're in the zone.

617
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:12,950
This is some demand shit. You don't
care if she comes, stays laser praise.

618
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:16,160
Now you've got the head dude. Um, I don't,

619
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,260
I told two friends and they boast,
advised against talking up with her.

620
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,770
All right, well I don't know your friends
and I don't know what their motive is.

621
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:26,990
Let's see if you explain this.
Here he goes,

622
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:30,680
I would never let that decide
whether or not I would.

623
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:34,250
But the interesting thing is that they
both said independent of each other,

624
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,390
that hooking with a girl
on New Year's Eve, Mike,

625
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:41,350
give her the wrong impression and that
she's going to be a leach afterwards.

626
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,580
Oh that's fucking, that's just
fear mongering. That's bullshit.

627
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,510
What? Cause your finger
Rah Rah. As the ball drops,

628
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:53,110
all of a sudden you have a relationship.
They had a good time. Had some laughs.

629
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,550
So like you don't want to go to
the farmer's market. No I don't.

630
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,900
Do you have something against
farmers markets? Not really clear.

631
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,590
Why don't you let it go?
Cause you know I,

632
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:10,830
I don't feel like going with you. I don't
feel like a spark your fucking ass off.

633
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,960
For what being honest. I
have. Fuck you there. It's,

634
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,300
it's the end of the
relationship. Anyway, so he goes,

635
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:21,301
I can't even fathom why New Year's Eve
would be be considered a special occasion

636
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:25,960
that would lead to her thinking that this
whole topic is ridiculous and I can't

637
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:29,410
even stand to waste time talking about it.
But I wanted to hear your opinion.

638
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,360
I think I just gave it to you. My
question to you is do you agree with that?

639
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,831
And also,

640
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:40,390
do you think there are any days on the
calendar that would make a girl think you

641
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,960
were into her? Oh yeah. If you
took around on Valentine's Day.

642
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,090
Yeah, it's about it. Valentine's Day,

643
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,210
Valentine's Day that that would be it.
What else?

644
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:59,330
What other day Saint Patrick's Day,
you know,

645
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,520
you sitting there eating a
fucking meat pie next door,

646
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,080
hammered Audi of mine with a green plastic
hat on. I think he really likes me.

647
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,590
Um,
the key and if I could,

648
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,850
if I could do my single life
over again is I would have been

649
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,340
okay

650
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,760
way less fearful to be honest.
You know,

651
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,210
when relationships were starting,
you know,

652
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,580
uh,
women are not as,

653
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,240
yeah,

654
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,230
psycho is, you think, I mean a lot of
times when you say that women are psycho,

655
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,310
it's because you were
being deceptive and a yeah.

656
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:39,740
Then they go fucking psycho.
Yeah, they definitely do.

657
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:43,790
But you a lot of times creative if you
just tell them straight up front when

658
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,290
they're like, so what is
this? And just be like, look,

659
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm not looking to get in a
relationship right now, or like, listen,

660
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:51,260
I enjoy your company,
but I'm not feeling like this spark.

661
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:53,180
Like there's something to that next level.

662
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:58,181
I just feel like you should know that
and you'll be surprised at how well they

663
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:02,210
take that. You know, they,
it's not that always, you know,

664
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,460
if you say that the second you feel it,
it's usually pretty early on.

665
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,890
So there's no really deep feelings and
that's all people just don't want to get

666
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:17,890
hurt. Okay. Believe me, I heard a lot
of fucking people believe me. And, um,

667
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,770
so that's what I learned.
I remember one, um,

668
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,110
Jesus Christ years ago

669
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,830
and I was just a lad living in New York.

670
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,550
Okay.

671
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,940
I remember I hooked up with this, this
woman, and she was just, you know,

672
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,210
so what is this? Where's this going? And
I was just like, uh, nowhere. I'm like,

673
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:42,860
fucking I 35, she was 23. I'm like,

674
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:46,970
I'm like 12 years older than you,
you know, by the time you turned 30,

675
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm going to be like 60.
What do you think it's going?

676
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:54,050
She actually laughed and I was
just like, you know, she goes,

677
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:55,730
so what are we doing? But
just hanging out, having fun.

678
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,950
So whatever crazy thing you want to try,

679
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,430
but you don't want to do it with
your husband, do it with make

680
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,880
and that was it. And she was
just like, all right, cool.

681
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,050
We had fun for a few weeks and then that
was fucking it. And nobody got hurt.

682
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:17,900
And uh, you know, I lost touch with
her and that was it. No harm, no foul.

683
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,400
Had a great fucking time. So
there's no like, but if you look,

684
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:26,450
you take them out on Valentine's Day
and you get them a rose and all of that

685
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:31,190
shit, you start leading them on. So what
you're really talking to, I feel he's,

686
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:35,180
you're talking to two younger guys like
me probably at that like meet like how I

687
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:37,670
was, I mean, how am I trying to say this?

688
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,200
You're talking to two guys who
had their age right now. I,

689
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,990
their skill level was
what my skill level was,

690
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:47,780
what they don't know how to set it
up. So this sitting there going, oh,

691
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:51,590
don't do this. Don't bring
them out on this day. Cause
that makes them think this.

692
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,083
Um,

693
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,080
all that says to me is that they don't
know how to communicate what's going on.

694
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,920
So they feel like they,

695
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:02,690
and they're also in that thing where
they feel like they have to fucking throw

696
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:07,370
their jacket over a mud puddle and let
them walk on it in order to get fucked

697
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:08,420
that night.
Which you don't,

698
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,660
you just have to be honest
because women enjoy sex too.

699
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,070
And they also enjoy you telling them
what the fucking deal is. All right,

700
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,070
so there you go. So you don't
have anything to worry about it.

701
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,170
Hey, what's going on? It is,

702
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,620
and this is the Monday
morning podcast. Um, welcome.

703
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,610
Welcome. If you're new to it. I do
one of these every single Monday.

704
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:11,390
I answer questions.
People email me questions that

705
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,090
people send me in there. A
underrated, overrated lists,

706
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:21,210
things that they feel are underrated,
things that they feel are overrated and,

707
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,390
uh, New Year's resolutions. That's
what we're doing this week, Huh?

708
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,780
That's what we're doing.

709
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,240
This is like the sixth time I've
tried to start doing this podcast.

710
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,110
I don't know what the fuck's going on
with me this week. It's 10 in the morning.

711
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:41,790
I think I started too early. I, I
don't know why I started so early.

712
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:46,791
I have the ability to hang up at
this point and I could just erase it,

713
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:50,610
but for some reason I'm just
plowing through on this one.

714
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,800
Holy Shit. This had a dog fight. I
think two dogs and fighting. He hit

715
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,420
that shit.
The fuck is with that dog.

716
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,740
The owner doesn't do shit about it.
Let's see what this dog looks like.

717
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:17,520
Let's describe both people as
they come up to street. Okay.

718
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,140
That's kind of a fat person.
Honest people who wears that,

719
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:23,940
that you know those hats, like it looks
like you're going to be playing tennis,

720
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:24,774
but you're not.

721
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,310
She hasn't one of those hats and she's
got one of those little fucking terriers,

722
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,740
miserable fucking dog and they're
getting into some sort of a,

723
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,660
a little Volkswagen Gulf.
Wow.

724
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,200
That's a picture for
you, Huh? What are the,

725
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:45,120
what the fuck did those
dreams go off the rails?

726
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,280
I hate dogs, man. I love him,
but I fucking hate him. I,

727
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,220
I've been talking about how I'm going to
get a bulldog and now I don't know if I

728
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:55,950
can do it. I think just
as a man, you just,

729
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,820
they just look awesome.

730
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:05,210
And then I'm watching youtube clips
of him and that they're just a genetic

731
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,080
fucking mess. They, I,

732
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,970
I'm watching these youtube
videos, the dog snoring, it's, I,

733
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,650
I can't deal with that.
That'd be like, you know,

734
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,790
my dad used to snore like
that and I wanted to kill him.

735
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,990
You're trying to watch the game and he
would like fall asleep and just start

736
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:30,200
snoring. And I literally would think
about taking off one of my, you know,

737
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,300
the eighties back when tube socks and
we're a lot longer. And I was like,

738
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:38,040
I could choke them with this, you
know, and, uh, that's my own dad.

739
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,080
Can I have a fucking dog with sleep apnea?
You know,

740
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,480
bulldogs when they sleep,

741
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:49,860
they sound like they used to
play offensive line in the NFL.

742
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,723
You know what I mean?
You have is

743
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:57,800
they got to sleep upright in a chair.
That's not a fucking dog. It's like a,

744
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,880
it's just a blob. You
know, I got like 18 stairs.

745
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:04,590
You've got to climb up into my apartment.

746
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,010
Things are going to have a fucking heart
attack. And then what do I gotta do?

747
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:10,380
I gotta give him doggy fucking CPR.

748
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,030
Jesus Christ.
I just loved the face.

749
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,420
Is there a fucking dog out there that
has that bulldog face debt can breathe

750
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,190
but can actually exist in an apartment?
I really liked boxers,

751
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:30,490
but they're just too big. I mean, why
don't just live with a pony at that?

752
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,700
Oh God, what a fucking week I
had, man. What a fucking week.

753
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,590
I had just stayed home for the holidays.

754
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:42,280
I had the best and the best time
it was calling everybody up,

755
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:43,870
wishing everybody merry Christmas.

756
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,130
I was in the best fucking
mood because I was home.

757
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,930
You know, I didn't have to fly anywhere.
And I'm telling you people out there,

758
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,820
don't let your parents guilt you any more
into the fact that you have to go home

759
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:01,600
for the holidays. You
don't, you don't visit them.

760
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,760
Visit them during different times of the
year when the whole world is in flying

761
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:10,510
back to the east coast or out to fucking
Wisconsin or wherever the fuck you

762
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:11,710
going.
I'm telling you,

763
00:48:11,711 --> 00:48:15,880
you don't have to put yourself through
it and then he can just sit there and

764
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:20,230
watch the news and you see those people
sleeping on the airport floor and you

765
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:25,231
can just laugh your ass off just knowing
that that could have been you and now

766
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:29,140
it isn't. And now someone
else is you and it's not you.

767
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:32,950
And you can laugh at you while not
feeling the pain. That makes sense.

768
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,813
I hope it did.

769
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,420
I'll tell you what doesn't make sense
as a fucking New England patriots or 11

770
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:42,230
and five and the San Diego
chargers are eight and eight,

771
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:48,640
that fucking eight games better than the
lions and they are in the playoffs. Oh,

772
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:53,440
that's sad. Sack fucking organization.
They just can't buy a break. You know,

773
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,080
even though they, they killed the
Broncos and then at the end of the game,

774
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,540
Damion Thomas and still
fucking injures himself.

775
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,880
You know, I dunno. I Dunno
where I'm at with the charges.

776
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:07,030
I hated them a few years ago when they
blew that game and then they started

777
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:11,380
calling the patriots a
classless organization. You
know what I mean? It's like, oh,

778
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,320
really? You guys with your
fucking convicted steroid user?

779
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:17,050
Who does is taunting dance
the entire fucking game.

780
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:22,410
Then he get mad because our players
taunt him back and Jesus Christ,

781
00:49:22,731 --> 00:49:24,520
he is just fucking babies,
you know,

782
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,520
and you fucking that poor excuse
for a football stadium. You have a,

783
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,530
that leftover concrete from the
highway that they molded into a stadium

784
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,140
back when Jimmy Carter was in office,
he just fucking annoying me.

785
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,500
They annoy me and uh, I don't know. Okay.

786
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:46,230
This is my big sleeper pick for
the, uh, for the NFL. I think, uh,

787
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,990
the Carolina Panthers are
going to surprise people.
I like Jake Delona member,

788
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,250
how that guy played in the Superbowl years
ago and gets the Patriots and I think

789
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:58,750
they got enough. I think they got
enough to go deep into the playoffs.

790
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,100
And, um, I dunno about the
giants. Giants look great,

791
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,090
but it's just so hard to repeat.
Um,

792
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,890
I dunno how you guys doing
in Dallas, Huh? Jesus Christ.

793
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,690
That was a raping. That really was no
lube either. That was just fucking,

794
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,370
I was, I was brutal and it was really
brutal. I Dunno, I dunno about that.

795
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:26,050
Tony Romo. Um, anyways,
let's plow ahead here.

796
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,620
You want to hear something?

797
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,560
I'm actually in a great mood
despite the fact that this happened,

798
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,260
I went to pink's hot dogs.

799
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,520
Now for those of you who don't live in
Los Angeles and he never been to Los

800
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,510
Angeles, they got this fucking, ah,
they got this hot dog stand, okay.

801
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:46,490
That evidently has the greatest hot dogs
that you'll ever taste in your life.

802
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,720
But every time you drive by there,
there's literally, I mean, I'm not joking.

803
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,430
There's like 80 people in line.

804
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,250
I went there when I first came out here
the first week and I literally stood in

805
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:02,600
line for like an hour for a hot dog. So
I was like, well that was fucking stupid.

806
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,240
I'm never doing that again.
And Lo and behold,

807
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,350
for some reason I went to go pick up my
lovely girlfriend from work and someone

808
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:12,230
at work had mentioned to
her about pink's hot dogs.

809
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:15,020
So she got a craving and she was like,
oh my God,

810
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,620
can you take me of pigs?
Hot Dog? I don't know.

811
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,170
Somebody mentioned I did for him.

812
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:24,140
You know when girls get like that and
it would just look adorable and they

813
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:27,050
deliberately act like they're
like a little kid and you just,

814
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,750
you just can't fucking resist it.
So I'm like, all right sweetie,

815
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,340
I'll take you over to get you a hot dog.

816
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:36,730
We pull up in the line is like two and
a half times longer than it usually is.

817
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:42,320
It's literally wrapped all the way around
this fucking tin shack, by the way.

818
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,470
It's a 10 check.
All right?

819
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,470
It's on the brand and Melrose and I'm
giving you guys some great advice.

820
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:52,640
Don't ever fucking go there. All right?
So I'm like, you know, I just laugh.

821
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,970
I'm like, this is ridiculous.
I'm bill. I'm like, you know
what? It's the holidays.

822
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,790
I didn't fly.
I'm not sitting in an airport.

823
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,360
I'll stand in this fucking
line just to continue to,

824
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:05,840
to the tradition of me standing in fucking
lines that I really don't need to be

825
00:52:05,841 --> 00:52:08,900
standing in around Christmas.
So I stand in this fucking line,

826
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,450
and this is the funny part.

827
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:15,200
We get their right standing in line and
as these four Asian dudes in front of me

828
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:19,730
and was standing there for 15 minutes,
the line may be moved like six feet.

829
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,390
So finally one of the
agents, dudes, you know,

830
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,730
mumble something and Cantonese or
whatever the hell he was talking and he

831
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:29,900
fucking walks up to the front of
line and he comes back. And you know,

832
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,870
I don't know if you know this about me,
but I'm not bilingual.

833
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,490
And I certainly don't speak Chinese,
but I know what this kid said in his honk,

834
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:41,930
honk at Chapin Hall fucking language. He
just said, dude, you gotta be shitting me.

835
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,640
Fuck this. This is just hot dogs. It's
not worth it. That's what he said.

836
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,880
What the Alcantara coupon and
his language and I, I, you know,

837
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,790
I told them and they, all, the
other three Asian dudes laughed,

838
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,880
looked at each other,
nodded and made the smart move.

839
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,470
They got the fuck out of the line.

840
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,880
They got out of the line and
my dumb ass was like, oh great.

841
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,570
I get to move up another
half foot stupid bay, right?

842
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,720
I stand in line for
like another half hour.

843
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,430
We're freezing our ass off to the point.
My girl has to go to the car.

844
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:18,431
She gets to the car and somebody writing
us $145 ticket because evidently it

845
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:24,791
became a toso after four o'clock
so she starts freaking out,

846
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,790
got the car. She's like, forget it,

847
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:33,870
forget it. We'll just leave.
And at this point I'm stubborn.
I'm like, no, fuck that.

848
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,520
I got $145 tickets,
got damn,

849
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:38,580
and I'm at least going to get
a fucking hot dog out of this.

850
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,770
So I had to pull the car into the lot.

851
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,470
I stand there for like another hour,
an hour and a half.

852
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,500
I'm finally turning the corner to get
to the front of the Tin Shack for a

853
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:57,150
fucking hot dog. I can't feel my
toes. I'm jumping up and down.

854
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,670
I'm doing a little ballistic
fucking movement here,

855
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,600
trying to keep the blood
in the extremities of my
body for fucking hot dog.

856
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,260
I'm already down 145 bucks,
but I'm going to see this thing through.

857
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:10,260
And just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse,

858
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,980
we were right at the corner of
[inaudible], Bria and Melrose.

859
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:18,981
So at every red light people are just
staring at us like warning an exhibit of

860
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:24,840
fucking idiots looking at us the exact
way they should be looking at us.

861
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:28,440
Like, why would you stand in line for
two hours? It's a fucking hot dog.

862
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,300
He can buy packs of eight of them at
the grocery store, take them home,

863
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:38,130
grill 'em up and you know, you
don't even have to stay on hold.

864
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,060
What are you doing?

865
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:44,390
So this lady basically rolls down the
window and it's alternative comedian

866
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:49,710
looking fucking twat sticks her head
out the window and starts dripping with

867
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:55,290
sarcasm goes you guys
standing in line for hot dogs,

868
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,720
right? Just dripping with
sarcasm. There's nothing else.

869
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:05,750
There's nothing else on that corner that
we could be doing dripping with sarcasm

870
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,950
and the fucking democratic demographic
of shitheads that were in the line.

871
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,130
Do not hear the sarcasm and actually
answer her question like she was being

872
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,980
serious. This, this one guy's like, yeah.

873
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,480
So then she goes,
are they good?

874
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,610
Just dripping with sarcasm and this
other guy answers the question.

875
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,330
It suits the number one hot,
don't chew the country.

876
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,070
And at that point I just hung my
head in defeat going, you know what?

877
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:41,910
I fucking deserve this. I really want
to get mad at that girl in the car,

878
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:45,300
but I can't. I can't.
She's absolutely right.

879
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:49,500
She's actually trying to help us right
now to let us know how fucking stupid is

880
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:51,300
what we're doing. And I, I just,

881
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:55,770
I just hung my head and I stood in
fucking line and I swear to God,

882
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,740
I ended up getting up there and I'm
looking at the hot dogs and you know what?

883
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,870
I have forgotten.
They don't even toast the Bun.

884
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,260
They don't even us the fucking Bun. And
you just, they just stick it on there.

885
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:10,290
And if you have cheese, they just
sprinkle some cheese on it. You Chile,

886
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:14,610
they just put Chili on it and then you
go into the shack and there's no heat.

887
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,990
See is still cold

888
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,890
and you eat basically a ballpark frank.

889
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,910
And you stood in line for two hours and
you know, I'm one of these fucking guys,

890
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:29,020
man. It just, I swear to God,
you know that fool me once.

891
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,620
Shame on you fool me
twice. Shame on me. I,

892
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:36,310
you literally fool me like nine times
before I finally start picking up on it.

893
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:40,540
And now I finally I finally realized it.
Okay.

894
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:45,100
If you come out here to Los Angeles and,
and you know, and you ask people, Hey,

895
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:48,520
what do you do out here? And
somebody suggests to you,
oh, you got to go to pinks.

896
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,560
He got to go to pinks
and get a hot dog man.

897
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:55,561
And the best fucking hot dogs know they
say that Shit just slowly draw your

898
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:58,840
right. Well, I mean maybe it's going
to be a lefty, maybe a lefthand,

899
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,800
I dunno what drawback. Overhand
right. Overhand left. Right,

900
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,730
right into their mouth.
Don't even hit that notes.

901
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:10,180
Just put it right in the fucking mouth
because this is what I'm trying to say.

902
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:14,530
It's overrated. Okay. And those of
you who aren't new to my podcast,

903
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,220
I do underrated. Overrated. That is my
big overrated thing of the fucking week.

904
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,790
Alright.
Pink's hot dogs and La Sucks.

905
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,950
A big bag of fucking elk dick.

906
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,060
I've walked into fucking four star
restaurants and they've been like, oh,

907
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,950
how long is the wait,

908
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,120
Deanna has an agent know how long is the
way it's going to be? About 45 minutes.

909
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,720
And I always look at the person I'm with
and we'd go, you know what? Fuck that.

910
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,920
Fuck that. I'm not doing that.
I don't give a shit if, if,

911
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,650
if Mario Batali is cooking the meal,

912
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,370
I'm not standing here for 40 I'll
go get a slice. I don't give a shit.

913
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,640
And I stood in line for two hours for
God damn hot dog and got $145 a ticket.

914
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,220
Okay. All right, I got that up.
All right, that's it. You know,

915
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,180
that's been my week and I'm still
actually in a decent mood despite the fact

916
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:07,270
that my 11 and five patriots are
not in the playoffs. All my God,

917
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:10,420
what a week of sports and then
the Celtics loss to the Lakers,

918
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,040
which was actually a great game.

919
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:16,180
Hopefully foreshadowing
another great NBA finals.

920
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,620
But I gotta tell you something.

921
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:22,650
I don't think I've ever laughed harder
in my life than watching Pau Gasol,

922
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,840
whatever his fucking name
is that Kenny Loggins look,

923
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Croatian Jackass fucking pump
hitting his fist off his chest.

924
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:37,780
Every time he hit a lay up, what the
fuck was he doing during that game?

925
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,650
I thought he's going to start
singing the theme of the titanic.

926
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,830
It's fucking running down
the court like Celine Dion.

927
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:47,800
Every time he hits the
shot. Oh, what the fuck?

928
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,740
But then he really thought he
proves something, didn't he? Yeah.

929
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:52,060
I guess you showed us,
you know,

930
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:55,920
you disappeared during the finals and
didn't get a championship ring, but Ooh,

931
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,010
watch out for Pau Gasol during a
regular season game in December.

932
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,940
You know that that's what's wrong
with sports. You know what I mean?

933
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,160
Act like you've been there.
Okay.

934
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:10,690
Act like you've been there and when you
fucking win a regular season game after

935
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:14,770
choking in the NBA finals,
don't fucking start pounding your chest.

936
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,470
You know when this 50 games left in
the season, what a fucking moron.

937
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:23,540
But I loved that he did it.
Him and that other guy with the,

938
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:27,770
with the hairdresser haircut, when he hit
that lay up and he just starts fucking

939
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,680
pounding his chest. Like he
said, Braveheart, you know,

940
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:38,681
like he just ran over a hill with blue
paint on his face and just defeated an

941
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:42,230
army twice the size of his dad.
A lay up,

942
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,620
get back on defense jackass.

943
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:50,090
I really hope that that pissed the
Celtics off. I know it did. I know it did.

944
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,170
And that's all. It's only going to help
us out. That fucking, who is that guy?

945
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:57,790
That guy with his hair cut.
They're talking about how oh you,

946
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,380
I don't even wear green on Christmas.
They totally j hate to show huge.

947
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,800
Oh yeah, I guess you showed
them, you know, green,

948
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:09,530
you know is also a part of nature.
It's a part of Christmas.

949
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:12,380
It doesn't have to mean Celtics,
but if you want to ruin your holiday

950
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,830
and wear blue man, um, but whatever
note, you know, my biggest thing is, uh,

951
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:22,610
I like, uh, what's his face there,
Andrew buying a man. That guy's the shit.

952
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,031
You know,

953
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:26,960
I didn't see any fucking chest pumping
from him and he could fucking put both of

954
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:30,650
those two other jackasses and fucking
snap 'em over his knee like a couple of

955
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:34,880
number two pencils and he wasn't
thumping his chest. He scared me.

956
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,040
He had a quiet confidence about him.
Those other guys look like a cop.

957
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,050
You know what they look like?

958
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,190
You ever see like when the spazz in
elementary school finally decides to fight

959
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:43,821
back,
you know,

960
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:47,030
you've been flicking them in the back
of the year for like three periods in a

961
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:50,750
row and he finally decides to
fight and you want to respect them,

962
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:54,340
but you can't cause he's making those
spazz noises as he throws punches, like,

963
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:00,410
and he's like half crying.
That's what those two jackasses look like.

964
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,010
Fucking pumping you goddamn fucking chest.

965
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,340
I really wish I could
remember the titanic song.

966
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,660
I'd fucking start singing it now,

967
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:13,280
even though I know I can't
sing as I proved a couple
of podcasts ago. All right,

968
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:18,590
let's get into the podcast here. Um,
the new year's resolutions. Okay.

969
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:22,010
Last week I talked about my new year's
resolution. If you new to my podcast,

970
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,780
my new year's resolution,
um,

971
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:28,790
for next year is I'm not going to
tip when I get bad service. Okay.

972
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,690
And, uh, at a, at a,
at a restaurant, I've,

973
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:35,330
I've been doing that religiously no
matter what the guilt that I always have,

974
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,860
I have to tip 20%,

975
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:41,510
no matter if you actually drop my piece
of cheesecake on the fucking floor,

976
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,900
you know, and spit on my
fork. I still give you 20,

977
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:49,880
20% and I'm not doing it anymore. All
right? If you suck, I'm not tipping you.

978
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:55,220
I can't just like not tip, but you know
mean you're not doing your fucking job.

979
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,820
You suck. All right? So that's
my new year's resolution.

980
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:01,550
If you give you give me bad
service, I'm not tipping. Um,

981
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:04,700
that's what I always hate to like in a,
like what's like celebrities?

982
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:09,140
Have you noticed that? Like in
like, um, and whatever, like, um,

983
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,300
like those, those, those celebrity blog
things or, or page six in New York,

984
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,780
there'll be a little goofy.

985
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,580
Ted Danson was at a diner and evidently
his finances aren't looking too good,

986
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:23,160
is he tip 4%.
You know,

987
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,820
at no point did they ever think
maybe that the service sucked.

988
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,700
Maybe asked for cheese and scrambled
eggs and they didn't give it to him.

989
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:35,490
And then he sent them back and then
they did what they did was took of cold

990
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:39,840
piece of cheese and just slapped it on
top and just gave it back to them that

991
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:43,440
way. And maybe he was a little bit
miffed and maybe that's why he didn't tip

992
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:48,420
immediately go, oh, he's famous and he
doesn't tip. He's a cheap fuck. You know,

993
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,640
cause I'm miserable with my own life. And,
um, so I'm going to tack the celebrity.

994
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,180
I don't know if ted Danson ever
got busted for not tipping,

995
01:02:57,181 --> 01:02:58,680
but you know what the fuck I'm saying.
So anyways,

996
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:03,300
here's people's New Year's resolutions.
All right. Um, New Year's resolutions.

997
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:07,290
I want to make a conscious effort to
connect with the people around me because

998
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:11,700
human relationships are vital and I've
been too quick to take them for granted

999
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,290
or dismiss them all together.

1000
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,520
When I stopped to think about what
of what I value most of my life,

1001
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,030
it's all the memories,
good and bad with my friends and families.

1002
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,960
That's what makes life worthwhile. You
know what? That was actually really nice,

1003
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:28,080
but because of my choppy
out loud reading skills,

1004
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,780
that's why I could never host the 700
club because that fucking big headed

1005
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:38,340
jackass could have read that email with
his eyes closed through the last third

1006
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:41,580
of it already getting ready to be
like, praise Jesus. Praise Jesus.

1007
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,200
Let me see if I can do that.

1008
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:47,370
Like the guy in the 700 club and this one
here comes from Chattanooga, Tennessee.

1009
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,680
Praise God,
praise God for Chattanooga,

1010
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:53,940
Tennessee and his new year's
resolution is this Lord.

1011
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,020
I want to make the conscious effort to
connect with the people around me because

1012
01:03:58,021 --> 01:04:02,280
human relationships, our GSO
so vital to me and I, Lord,

1013
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:03,150
I apologize,

1014
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,800
I've been too quick to take them for
granted or to dimiss dismiss then fuck,

1015
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,510
dismiss them altogether.

1016
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,650
And when I stopped to think about
what I value most of my life, Jesus,

1017
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,120
it's all the memories, good and bad. Even
when you challenged me, it's still good.

1018
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,180
All the memories,
good and bad with my friends and family,

1019
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:24,180
that's what makes my life worthwhile.
You know?

1020
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,550
I think he made a very good point there,

1021
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,710
I think a lot of times and laugh with you.

1022
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:32,700
Forget things that are most vital and
everybody's talking about getting a new

1023
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:37,050
guitar hero or the latest iPhone.
Those are just gadgets. People,

1024
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,130
if you really think about it,
did Jesus have any gadgets? Ham?

1025
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,520
He didn't even have any fucking shoes.
You didn't hear him bitching.

1026
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,940
He was too busy putting
his hands on a leper. Okay,

1027
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,730
so I want you all to put hands
on the TV screen right now.

1028
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:58,230
Pray with me privately, just pregnancy
right now. Please lower Jesus Christ.

1029
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,970
My Savior. Please help me to remember.
Lace shifts in my life are so,

1030
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,860
so very vital.
Okay.

1031
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:08,790
And how have a pot to piss in and even
though the bankers just still three cores,

1032
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:10,590
if $1 trillion,
I don't give a fuck.

1033
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:15,120
I'm just happy because someday when I
die and I'm in the ground and the worms

1034
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:16,440
are eating in my eye sockets,

1035
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,780
I'm going to have a couple of wings and
I'm gonna be flying around in the class.

1036
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,341
Praise Jesus.

1037
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:25,680
And please seem your contributions
to the 700 club so I can get the,

1038
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:29,840
the crow's feet taken off my face
cause I spent half the show squinting.

1039
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:35,290
All right. I can read out
loud. I can read out loud.

1040
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,800
I just have to get into praise Jesus. All
right. New Year's resolution number two.

1041
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,100
Um,
number two,

1042
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:46,510
I am going to stop dwelling on all the
garbage of the past and look forward to

1043
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:50,410
the garbage of the future.
All right, that's uplifting.

1044
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,140
Um, I really thought I was going
to get more new year's resolutions.

1045
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:59,590
I guess people didn't wait. I have
one other one in that I thought I did.

1046
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,470
Somebody saying that they weren't going
to do the hacky going to the gym thing,

1047
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:07,120
that's the worst. Oh look
at me, I'm clicking, I'm
clicking on the computer again.

1048
01:06:07,121 --> 01:06:11,350
We did find out what the clicking
noise was. That was me doing that.

1049
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,450
I'm going to stop doing
that because it bugs people.

1050
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,490
Although somebody was so miserable,

1051
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:18,830
told me to keep doing it because
he enjoys when I annoy people. Um,

1052
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:23,800
last week I talked about going to the
movie milk and saying I really enjoyed it,

1053
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:26,800
but I actually was avoiding the movie
because all my straight friends kept

1054
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:30,660
saying it's a great movie, but I got warn
you, there's a lot of male kissing and,

1055
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:33,790
and um, I was just talking
about how, you know,

1056
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,660
that was something that was actually
pushing me away from that movie.

1057
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,170
And I was like, does that make
me homophobic? I don't think so.

1058
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,660
I just think,
you know,

1059
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:47,200
I don't think it's anything wrong for
another man and another man to lock lips.

1060
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:51,970
I personally just don't want to look at
it and I certainly don't want to pay $10

1061
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:56,590
to see it. Um, so this guy says he's
this guy, I think put me straight here.

1062
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:57,011
He said,

1063
01:06:57,011 --> 01:07:00,820
I understand that the sight of two men
kissing makes you slightly uncomfortable.

1064
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:05,170
I feel the same way. The reason for
this is that you are heterosexual.

1065
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,520
That being said,

1066
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,630
I think you may be taking a bit far to
let it stand in your way of enjoying a

1067
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:14,650
movie. Just because something
is uncomfortable to watch
doesn't mean it ruins the

1068
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:18,700
movie. I find it marginally uncomfortable
to see someone get tortured,

1069
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:23,050
but I'm not going to write off a whole
movie because of that and the porn

1070
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:26,770
analogy. That's actually a
great point because yeah,

1071
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:29,380
I would never want to get tortured,
but I've seen a bunch of movies where,

1072
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:34,210
you know, guys get tortured and that type
of thing. But, uh, but you know something,

1073
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:36,160
I can actually argue that point because,
you know,

1074
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:39,770
when I watched lethal weapon and
I watched Mel Gibson, you know,

1075
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,670
dislocated shoulder,
I know that it's not real.

1076
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:46,660
He's not really dislocating
his is a shoulder.

1077
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,450
But when you go to see milk,
um,

1078
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,560
that guy's really kissing
that other guy really,

1079
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,240
really kissing that other guy.
All right?

1080
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,810
So, but I understand what he's saying.
He is right on a certain, I don't know,

1081
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,590
but I dunno. I Dunno if this
is the whole fucking Oprah.

1082
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,740
Let's turn guys into a puddle of Mush.

1083
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:13,300
You think John Wayne would go see milk?
You know,

1084
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:16,440
I'm not going to go see another
guy fucking another man say,

1085
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,990
Oh God. That was a terrible impression.
All right, here's the second half of his,

1086
01:08:22,991 --> 01:08:26,930
uh, his analogy and the porn
analogy you made while hilarious,

1087
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:29,870
was somewhat inaccurate.
Okay.

1088
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,130
Gotta to be open to this criticism.
I'm not going to lose my temper. I'm,

1089
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:37,190
he says when I watch
porn, I jack off. However,

1090
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:41,240
I do not check off every time a man
and a woman kisses on screen during a

1091
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:45,890
regular film. In fact, I
usually go boneless. God dammit.

1092
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,270
That's a good point.
Likewise,

1093
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:51,050
I imagined gay men jack off
while watching gay porn,

1094
01:08:51,051 --> 01:08:54,110
but not necessarily in the
middle of Brokeback mountain.

1095
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,950
Um,
I'm going to argue with you on that one.

1096
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,940
I'm going to argue with you on that one.
I bet.

1097
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,870
I bet a lot of gay guys did jerk off
to that even though I didn't watch that

1098
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:09,320
movie once again because I didn't
want to watch two guys fucking a 10th.

1099
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:14,510
Um, and not even that, even if it was
a man and a woman fucking intense,

1100
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:18,980
I wouldn't go see it because it's
basically a chick flick and I really don't

1101
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:21,980
care about watching two people
make a relationship work.

1102
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,171
Speaking of which,

1103
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:27,920
if you guys seen that new movie coming
out with Leonardo Dicaprio and that fat

1104
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:31,670
chick from the titanic,
that's so mean. Um,

1105
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:35,540
that little full back with the
big head from, uh, the titanic.

1106
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:39,260
I'm really being mean during
the holiday season. Um,

1107
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,350
have you seen that? The
thing like I guess, you know,

1108
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:46,700
they had two people with dreams and then
they moved out to the suburbs and then

1109
01:09:46,701 --> 01:09:50,720
they have a kid and then they just start
yelling at each other about how awful

1110
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:55,520
their life sucks and they have all this
dramatic music and that's another movie

1111
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:57,740
I'm not going to be able
to see because the entire,

1112
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,890
I can't go see it in public because I'm
going to ruin it for the people around

1113
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:05,540
me because the entire time I'm just
going to be yelling at the screen,

1114
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:09,950
you know, why don't you
just move, sell your house,

1115
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:14,210
go back to the city. It's free
country. You're able to do that. Hello?

1116
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,010
I mean I'm, what am I going to watch? 90
minutes of them yelling at each other.

1117
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:23,360
I even want Tupperware honey.
Okay.

1118
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:29,180
He wanted an Ottoman,
not me who wanted it

1119
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,500
and him fucking punching a
cupboard right near her head.

1120
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:39,910
And I just, you know, move,
get divorced. You know, I,

1121
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:41,570
I've really learned that about anger is,

1122
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:46,571
is that's when a lot of anger is when
you feel powerless in the situation and

1123
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:47,750
you're not powerless.

1124
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:52,160
You have the intelligence to make the
decision to get out of a bad. I mean,

1125
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:55,310
I know it's not that easy, but
you know, but anyways, you know,

1126
01:10:55,311 --> 01:10:57,200
I want to commend that guy
who sent in all that stuff.

1127
01:10:57,201 --> 01:11:00,980
He really made some great
points. Um, you know,

1128
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,630
I think you made some good
points, but like, uh, yeah,

1129
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:09,050
there's a big part of me while I still
feel like I'm right. I mean, I don't know.

1130
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:13,980
Do, do I want to get comfortable
watching two guys make out? We'll go,

1131
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:18,250
let's see. What am I afraid of? The
obvious. Then I'm going to watch Santa.

1132
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:22,860
It's going to turn me gay. Stupid.
All right. You know what Mike Flynn,

1133
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:27,060
you're fucking right. Okay. You're right.
You're God that you're absolutely right.

1134
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,910
And, uh, you said Ts. Fuck the Bruins.
Well, you can say that all you want, dude.

1135
01:11:31,911 --> 01:11:35,690
They're like fucking 27, five. All right.

1136
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:40,500
Which what's your team exactly? Let
me, you sit there and deal with that.

1137
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:45,960
All right. Um, what do we got next?

1138
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:50,640
Movie reviews. Movie reviews.
No, I did this last week.

1139
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,290
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

1140
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,710
This is why you always say the clicking
sound because I'm not organized.

1141
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,490
Okay, here we go.
Underrated. Overrated. Okay.

1142
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:04,440
I think you guys know not to go to
pink's hot dogs at Labrea and Melrose.

1143
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:09,390
Do not go there and feel free to make
fun of the people who stand in line at

1144
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:14,391
pink's hot dogs because evidently we
don't understand sarcasm so you know,

1145
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:16,590
do anything you want.

1146
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:20,250
Stick your head out the window and just
be as sarcastic as you want and they

1147
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,770
will just answer your questions.
You know what?

1148
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,130
That's the big thing that we should
just drive by and heckle the people at

1149
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:28,350
Pink's hot dogs.
I think I'm going to do that next time,

1150
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:31,260
which is very hypocritical
because I stood in line last week.

1151
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:36,180
I want to go down there and protest them.
Just have a sign and just be like,

1152
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:36,661
you know it's,

1153
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:41,160
they're not that good or it's not worth
it or maybe I'll just yell out obvious

1154
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:45,360
shit just to hear people answer it,
aren't you called?

1155
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:51,120
Yeah. As a matter of
fact, I am. I'm all right.

1156
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,990
Overrated. If we go over rated. This
person says this week overrated.

1157
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:59,600
Owen Wilson over 1 billion
in box office. But, but the,

1158
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:03,210
but Jesus Christ, I can't read
out loud. This is actually funny.

1159
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:07,620
Let me go back to the beginning to
restart the comedy momentum. Okay.

1160
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:11,400
Overrated.
Owen Wilson over 1 billion in box office,

1161
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:14,130
but does this douchebag
really make anyone laugh?

1162
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:18,030
This guy makes cute movies like
wedding crashers and Rushmore.

1163
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,280
Both cute but not funny.

1164
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:24,930
I will never bust a gut laughing
watching this crooked nose. No talent.

1165
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,690
And why do they always pucker
his lips in every promo shot?

1166
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,090
I'll leave that to your imagination.
Wow.

1167
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,320
He's going after Owen Wilson didn't that
guy just tried to kill himself a few

1168
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,070
months ago. You know, I think he tried
to kill himself because he keeps making,

1169
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:45,960
yeah, he makes these cute little movies.
Remember that you, me and dupree,

1170
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:51,060
I mean that the, the, the fucking
title of that movie alone, you know,

1171
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:55,570
it's going to suck. And you know, he's uh,

1172
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,350
and he's got another one of those.
I'm going out another one.

1173
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,260
Those kind of movies. You mean to
pre meet you and Magoo? He just,

1174
01:14:01,261 --> 01:14:02,730
he just know they're going to suck.

1175
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:07,200
You're going to Improv and the crew's
going to be laughing cause they're afraid

1176
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:11,960
not to laugh because you're famous after
each take. I think pockets his lip.

1177
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:14,590
So maybe you don't look at his nose.
I think that that's what he does.

1178
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,080
Or maybe he's like coming to the
realization that he's actually in a movie

1179
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,550
called you,
me and dupree.

1180
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:27,490
It rines that'll get them. You
know what? I Bet I, you know,

1181
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,610
I don't even know how to
look up box office numbers.
I bet. I bet it did. Great.

1182
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:34,090
You know I, this is, I know what I think,

1183
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:38,230
why I like guys like that ended up killing
themselves because I think you very

1184
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:42,870
subtly get taken off track
in this business and you've,

1185
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,080
you forget who you are and why you
ever even gotten this business.

1186
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:52,140
And I actually had that feeling last
night when I was watching one of those

1187
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,280
cooking shows.
I basically watched football all day,

1188
01:14:57,281 --> 01:15:02,281
watch my patriots do the what they had
to do and then I watched the fucking

1189
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:03,011
fumbling,

1190
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:07,450
bumbling stumbling jets
kill my fucking post season.

1191
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,790
Um, so yeah, I watched
eight hours of football,

1192
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:15,520
so at that point it my girls,
so like okay, it's my turn.

1193
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:20,521
So she puts on the cooking network and
I'm watching one of those iron chef

1194
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:25,660
shows, some sort of throw down, I
don't know what the fuck it was,

1195
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:30,430
but I'm watching Bobby flay and a,
you know,

1196
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:36,420
pretty famous Goddamn chef with his
own TV show already and all his own

1197
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:41,530
restaurants and he's standing there
getting judged by these jackasses.

1198
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:45,250
Just regular people going, you
know, I thought the falafel,

1199
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,280
the outside was a little too greasy while
the inside was a little too flaky and

1200
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:53,230
I'm just sitting there looking at the
expression on his face and he really,

1201
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:57,040
it really comes one of those moments like,
what the fuck am I doing?

1202
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,240
I don't need to do this.

1203
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,740
Why did I get into this business I got
in this business because I love to cook.

1204
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,260
I like to cook. I like
to make people, you know,

1205
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:08,230
make a little money off the
shit and make people happy.

1206
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:12,790
Just eat my food and shut the
fuck up. Why am I, what am I,

1207
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,120
why am I standing here is
just construction worker is
his fucking critiquing my

1208
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,210
falafel. You know what it was? It was uh,

1209
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,150
John Starks from the Knicks.

1210
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:28,130
We was critique and
actually he liked his full,

1211
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:30,250
I don't know who the fuck
wants some Queen Latifa.

1212
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,090
I don't know what the fuck it was,
but 80 influence deals like, dude,

1213
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:37,390
you didn't have to go through this
fucking humiliation. You already made it,

1214
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,290
you know, and you're standing
here on TV and that they're,

1215
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,330
they're filming your fucking humiliation.

1216
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:45,670
And I think that that's what
happens to guys like Owen Wilson.

1217
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:49,030
He got into this business.
No one gets in this business to be in me,

1218
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:51,580
you and dupree you want
to make on the waterfront.

1219
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:54,910
You want to be in the next
Godfather, whatever you want.
You want to do that shit.

1220
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,840
But what happens? You've got a mortgage
payment, he got shit you have to do,

1221
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:03,310
you know, all your relatives and
third cousins know you're famous.

1222
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:07,150
So the very least she got to buy them
all iPods to Christmas. That costs money.

1223
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:10,550
And next thing you know you're you and me,
you and Magoo.

1224
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,340
And that's still the only
book he can have on your face.

1225
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:17,630
Sort of put puckering up your
lips. Like it's not like, you know,

1226
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:19,780
do you want to kiss me? And so like, Ooh,

1227
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:25,460
Ooh I guess this one's going to suck.
Sorry about this one guys. I swear to God,

1228
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:29,120
the next one's going to be a
little more artistic, you know,

1229
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:30,711
and then you look,

1230
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:34,070
somebody asked for an hour and a half
and somehow that ends up in the paper and

1231
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:38,120
they call you the butterscotch stallion.
And the next thing you know, I dunno,

1232
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:42,110
I don't fucking know.
I don't even know what,

1233
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,430
I don't even know what any of
that even meant. But uh, yeah,

1234
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:51,290
I wouldn't say that that guy's overrated.
I think you know, he's a actually he is,

1235
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:54,230
cause it's, we'll just keep making
money. I think he's a good actor,

1236
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:58,310
but he doesn't make good
movies. All right. Underrated.
Um, this guy says the movie,

1237
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:02,630
the last dragon. Anything with two
lead characters, names Sho Nuff,

1238
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:07,640
the Shogun of Harlem.
And Bruce Leroy has my attempt,

1239
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:12,230
my ads or admiration. Once again, I
butcher what the fucking guy wrote.

1240
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,093
I mean,
you know what?

1241
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:16,040
You guys are going to have to start
getting like leaving me voicemail messages

1242
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,340
and then I'll just press play cause I
can not read out loud to save my life.

1243
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,500
All right, overrated. Um,

1244
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,760
find my space bitches sending you
invites to join them at clubs,

1245
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,950
record release parties or New Year's
events. I'm not really going to meet them.

1246
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:33,460
And what am I going to say if I
do meet him? Well good and boy,

1247
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:37,250
you from my mind space. DANCO
mango would you? Exactly.

1248
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,650
You might as well go stand in line for
a fucking hot dog at pinks. You don't.

1249
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,240
Half the time it's not even,
it's not even the person you know,

1250
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:50,240
it's usually some fucking fat bald guy
who just takes some random picture of a

1251
01:18:51,051 --> 01:18:54,800
girl with a bikini, you know? All
right. Here's another underrated guy.

1252
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:58,520
I liked this one. Somebody said,
Billy squire is underrated.

1253
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:03,140
It gets no Cli. His music gets no
classic rock radio play anymore.

1254
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,950
But tell me that, don't
say no. Doesn't kick ass.

1255
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:10,700
Uh,
I dunno.

1256
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,140
I Dunno about Billy Squire squire.
He's kind of like drew Bledsoe.

1257
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:19,430
You know, he sorta has hall
of fame numbers, but he
never, he never won a ring,

1258
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,690
you know, I dunno. Let's see. Let's see.

1259
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,210
Is he further defense and let's
see what else he has to say.

1260
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:30,740
Said admittedly it's not as in the
same league as back in black. Yes,

1261
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:31,693
exactly.

1262
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:36,740
But when lonely in the night or the
stroke or my kind of lover unexpectedly do

1263
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:40,340
get radio airplay,
you blast the car stereo.

1264
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:45,260
All right. I gotta tell you
something. When the stroke comes on,

1265
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,060
I actually turn it down a little bit.

1266
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:50,990
I'd have to be in the middle of the
Berkshires somewhere in the middle of

1267
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:54,500
nowhere to actually turn that
song. It's just, I dunno,

1268
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:59,360
that song. Uh, I think if
you're in seventh grade,

1269
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,600
that song holds up,
you know,

1270
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:06,140
and the added that day had you heard

1271
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:10,690
stroke mi stroke me. I mean
he guys, he's a rock star.

1272
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,880
He really still just getting hand
jobs and I don't get it. Um, I bought,

1273
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:18,960
I got to say the drummer in Billy
Scwarz band did the best John Bonham

1274
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,670
impersonation I ever heard.

1275
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:23,750
And I actually looked him
up one time on the Internet.

1276
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,340
I found out that he actually
passed away. So, uh,

1277
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:31,220
rest in peace drummer from Billy squire.
Alright,

1278
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,300
here's this, you know, hopefully
isn't that nice during the holidays.

1279
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:37,360
All right bill. No. What's really
underrated? I like this one. How do she,

1280
01:20:37,361 --> 01:20:40,380
someone comes off when they say
they liked the foreign film.

1281
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,580
All right,
here's his story.

1282
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:49,320
This guy I work with who likes to try
and sound cultured cause he sees these,

1283
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,280
these uh,

1284
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:55,310
these independent Philly's foreign movies
that won best picture at the Albanian

1285
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:58,020
film festival or some shit like that.

1286
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:01,230
And everyone he talks and
every time he talks up a movie,

1287
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,080
it just sounds like a moving,
only a douche bag would enjoy.

1288
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:07,830
But what makes it worse
is what he'll totally is.

1289
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:11,940
That'll totally dismiss any movie
that sounds that anyone else likes.

1290
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,740
I recently saw the wrestler with Mickey
work and I was telling someone at work

1291
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:18,120
that it was,
it was pretty good.

1292
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:21,750
And right away there's
deuce chimes in going.

1293
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:24,810
You went to see you movie about wrestling.

1294
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:28,860
This comment from a guy who watched the
three hour movie about some old man who

1295
01:21:28,861 --> 01:21:33,060
likes to make pottery and he had to
read the whole thing because it was,

1296
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:37,000
the dialogue was in Turkish by the way.
Go see wrestling.

1297
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:41,220
You don't have to like wrestling to
appreciate the story. Exactly. Um,

1298
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:45,450
all right. First of all, just because
it's a foreign film and you have to,

1299
01:21:45,451 --> 01:21:47,730
you know,
read subtitles doesn't mean it's sucks,

1300
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,680
but that also doesn't
mean that it's great.

1301
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:53,520
And just because of movies about wrestling
doesn't mean it's sucks because this

1302
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:55,830
guy is absolutely right.
I saw the wrestler to fuck.

1303
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,660
I think it's a really good
movie. And Mickey workers.
Great. And um, I don't know.

1304
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,140
Go see it back. Come
on. It's making Brooke.

1305
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:06,120
What do you get the guy put on
40 pounds of muscle? Wink, wink.

1306
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:12,270
You know anybody else out there? Work out.
How much protein do you have to ingest?

1307
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:16,080
Wink, wink to put on 40 pounds
of muscle. But then again,

1308
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:20,990
those wrestlers put on 40 pounds of muscle
muscle. Wink, wink. So he did the same.

1309
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,020
He was method acting.

1310
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,920
He did what he had to do to point
of 40 pounds of muscle and a,

1311
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,620
he looked pretty good and the
tights, they're all right. Uh,

1312
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:32,910
here's a questions or the weekend then
I'm going to wrap up this podcast just

1313
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:33,780
because,
um,

1314
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:37,650
I listened to last week's podcast as I
was fixing some things on my page and I

1315
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:39,390
thought it went a long way too long.

1316
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:44,390
I think somewhere around a half hours.
A good amount of time. All right.

1317
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,680
[inaudible] question number one.
So as a,

1318
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:51,681
a former member of planet fitness and
having a moral obligation a few weeks ago,

1319
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,530
I had no choice but to quit. Plan is, uh,

1320
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:59,850
what am I doing here is just overrated.
Underrated.

1321
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:05,920
See, I, I just, I'm just
disorganized. All right.

1322
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:08,020
I started reading. It's, and I
have to read it. What is this?

1323
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:12,400
Planet fitness disappoints me on several
levels. First off, all their franchises,

1324
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:16,900
brand branches, paint. Most if not
all the floor equipment. Uh, gay,

1325
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:19,660
purple and yellow color.
Oh,

1326
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,150
this is a guy trying to say
that all gyms are gay now.

1327
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,520
And I'm, is there a question
at the end of this all. Okay.

1328
01:23:27,521 --> 01:23:29,710
What ever happened to
real gyms? Okay. Yeah.

1329
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:34,630
The equipment is painted a gay
purple and yellow color. Yeah,

1330
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:35,650
just like the Lakers.

1331
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:40,830
Oh to comfort sensitive people that
are intimidated by muscle heads and or

1332
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:44,920
fitness clubs or reality in general.

1333
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,190
And that is gay.
I think by gay he means stupid.

1334
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:53,750
And what is even more gay is the fact
that you're not allowed to have a barbell

1335
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:57,430
on the floor.
That means no dead lifts.

1336
01:23:57,431 --> 01:23:59,560
Free standing squats and separate that.

1337
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,130
Doesn't that mean don't
leave the barbell there?

1338
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,050
Cause they don't want to be sued?
I Dunno.

1339
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:08,560
And it's not like when
others I work out with,

1340
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:11,140
we are intentionally trying
to intimidate people.

1341
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:16,630
We're not acting like how Cogan did back
in the day to excite a crowd before a

1342
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:19,870
match. I'm five eight, 160
pounds of scared white meat.

1343
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:24,340
I had to quit because I don't want to
be converted anymore into a pussy by

1344
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:27,280
conforming to their lame rules.
I didn't know what the fuck.

1345
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:30,160
You know what half of this is my
me not being able to read out loud

1346
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,140
as corporate America is comforting.
Most Mormons in this country,

1347
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:39,790
they are also eradicating conventional
wisdom in American culture to increase

1348
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,800
their revenue regardless of repercussion.

1349
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:46,360
La Fitness sucks balls to at GC,
I dunno what,

1350
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:49,000
what am I having to the real
gyms? There's this question, ah,

1351
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:54,010
there are real gyms and you go there
and you lay on the floor to do a fucking

1352
01:24:54,341 --> 01:24:58,840
set ups in the next day you have some
sort of rash like you're on the ultimate

1353
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:02,380
fighter and then they have to, they
don't mop down there fucking mats enough.

1354
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,220
I'm number two. I'm sorry I butchered
that whole thing. I apologize.

1355
01:25:06,221 --> 01:25:08,950
I'll send you a refrigerator magnet
or something. All right. Bill,

1356
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:13,330
you occasionally mention
having a girlfriend and you
recently went on a hockey

1357
01:25:13,331 --> 01:25:16,450
trip. Uh, yeah, I did. I
went on three day trip.

1358
01:25:16,451 --> 01:25:19,000
I went to a home game
of the Calgary flames,

1359
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:23,200
Edmonton Oilers and the Vancouver
Canucks. He, she, he goes,

1360
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,030
I assume she did not go along.

1361
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:28,120
What kind of obstacles did you
have to hurdle to avoid a hearing?

1362
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:30,610
A bunch of stupid girl
complaints about that trip.

1363
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:32,530
I didn't have to hurdle any of them.

1364
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,560
I have a great relationship because I
fought the battles I needed to fight so

1365
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:42,760
that when I say I'm going on a
hockey trip, they can't be like,

1366
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,700
oh,
you don't care about me.

1367
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,990
No, that's not what it means.
Is that what it means at all?

1368
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:54,010
It means I like hockey and I want to
go on a trip. That's all it means.

1369
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:59,440
See on Monday, yeah, no.
Earlier in my, my dating career,

1370
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:02,170
I used to have to go through shit
like that. But you know, you just,

1371
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,390
you just have to have the
battles and you don't get,

1372
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:10,250
don't scream and yell if you just
say in a very nice way. Listen,

1373
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,810
I worked very hard this
year. You know, I've, I've,

1374
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:16,930
uh, you know, done.

1375
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:20,180
I'm not going to get it until the intimate
details of shit that I've done. Okay.

1376
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:23,090
I've earned the right.
Okay. I'm coming back.

1377
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:28,580
I'm not going to go up there and fucking
bang an Eskimo. I'm just going up there,

1378
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:33,440
you know, with some friends to go on a
hockey trip, there's no problems. Okay.

1379
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,650
Stop making me feel guilty
for doing something fun

1380
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:41,420
and uh, that pretty much
ends it. In other words,

1381
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:45,530
grow a Dick and your fucking relationship
and a, yeah, don't, don't paint yourself.

1382
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,900
If you're in a relationship right
now where you're not allowed to go do

1383
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:50,540
something fun with somebody other
than the person you're dating,

1384
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:53,030
you're not in a relationship,
you are actually a hostage.

1385
01:26:53,031 --> 01:26:57,350
And you need to get out of that situation.
You know, make a youtube video, blink,

1386
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:59,390
SOS,
do whatever the fuck you have to do,

1387
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:03,800
but get out of that relationship because
just get out of it because it's not

1388
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,710
going to get better once you've given
up that territory. You know what I mean?

1389
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,710
It's like all these Mexicans you
see protesting about, you know,

1390
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:14,150
getting Texas back. You're not getting
it back. You're not. It's over.

1391
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,960
It's fucking done. You know, you
need to pick up a gun to get it back.

1392
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:22,160
So put down your signs cause it's fucking
over. All right. Question number three.

1393
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:24,940
Uh, Bill podcast. Quite
a fuck ass was okay.

1394
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:29,300
One of my favorite things to do every
month is flipped a flipped to the back of

1395
01:27:29,301 --> 01:27:33,800
vanity fair to see if an artist,
I like his answer,

1396
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:38,780
answering the Proust questionnaire.
Um,

1397
01:27:38,781 --> 01:27:41,120
whatever the fuck that is.
There are. Okay. Basically,

1398
01:27:41,121 --> 01:27:45,380
there are a slew of questions and I would
love to hear how you would answer all

1399
01:27:45,381 --> 01:27:49,700
of them. But for the purpose of this
email, I will only specifically ask,

1400
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,500
what are your favorite favorite qualities
in a man and what are your favorite

1401
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:58,520
qualities in a woman? Oh, okay. So this
is obviously a questionnaire where they,

1402
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,000
they asked celebrities what
they're looking for in a mate.

1403
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:06,650
What are my favorite qualities in a man?
Um,

1404
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:11,360
he's not a Douche.
Uh,

1405
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,010
he adheres to Guy Code,

1406
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,850
which I'm not going to tell you what
that is because only men should know what

1407
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:19,250
that is.
Um,

1408
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:23,210
has a strong jaw orders for
me when I go out to dinner,

1409
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:28,040
holds the door, act like a gentleman,
but isn't afraid of my opinions.

1410
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,550
Um, yeah, I dunno.

1411
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:36,800
What are my favorite qualities
in a man? Uh, I don't know.

1412
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:41,630
He eats with his mouth closed,
you know,

1413
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:45,860
I don't like those fucking a crow,
like fucking half a caveman guys.

1414
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:50,210
You know what I mean? Like those
guys, like, uh, like more on,

1415
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:55,010
I don't like hanging around with
dumb people, men or women and uh,

1416
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:57,440
yeah, I, you know,

1417
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:01,380
I like to be hanging out with a guy who's
in a relationship that he's happy to

1418
01:29:01,381 --> 01:29:01,830
be in,

1419
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:04,860
so I don't have to listen to them bitch
about it or pretend to be happy in it.

1420
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,030
Common sense stuff. And one of my
favorite qualities in a woman. Um,

1421
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:09,920
I like a woman who's,

1422
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:14,550
who's a neat one of my biggest
turnoff of women's are a women's,

1423
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:20,040
I don't know, I don't like about the
women's is when the pitch is be messy. No,

1424
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:23,280
seriously, a woman who is messy is
one of the biggest turnoffs ever.

1425
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,600
You know what I mean? That's like a
guy who can't pick up something heavy.

1426
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,330
You know, if you're like a
woman, you know, like, oh,

1427
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:33,360
can you give me a hand with this?
And he like breaks a nail.

1428
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:37,270
Like when that turn you off, that's
like ground zero of being a man as you,

1429
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:41,430
you should actually have some sort of
physical strength and what the woman is,

1430
01:29:41,431 --> 01:29:45,270
they should know how to keep
the house clean. That's right.

1431
01:29:45,271 --> 01:29:48,780
I just said that and I don't
think that is sexist. All right.

1432
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:51,690
I think that's one of the fucking
great things that a woman does,

1433
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:54,990
teaches you how not to
live like a fucking animal.

1434
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:58,500
It's one of the things that they're
allegedly naturally good at,

1435
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:03,960
although I find a lot of women to
be pretty fucking messy. And, um,

1436
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:04,291
yeah,

1437
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:09,180
I'm old school women who can cook
and clean and all that type of stuff,

1438
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:12,540
you know? Um, I'm not saying
that I'm going to walk,

1439
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:16,320
walk in like a caveman with mud on my
shoes and you should have to sweep up

1440
01:30:16,321 --> 01:30:16,801
behind me,

1441
01:30:16,801 --> 01:30:20,880
but like the same way women still want
guys to know how to be handy around the

1442
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:23,550
house. Yeah. Women who
can cook or the Shit,

1443
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,720
women with a sense of humor woman who
actually are into sports a little bit.

1444
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:32,010
I understand. Most of you
think it's retarded. Yeah.
That type of Shit, you know,

1445
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:36,990
and uh, I don't like
horse. I like classy women.

1446
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:41,850
Women who are, uh, yeah, classically
beautiful. Yeah. I Dunno.

1447
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:45,060
That type of shit and you know, it's
none of your fucking business. All right.

1448
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:47,941
After that was,

1449
01:30:47,941 --> 01:30:51,780
I just felt bad divulging all
that personally information
and I just felt like I

1450
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:55,410
was opening up too much and
I got a little scared. Okay.

1451
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,170
The very least in this podcast question,
you know,

1452
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,260
you've got to listening to them and my
impression of the 700 club. All right,

1453
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:05,280
question number four. Um, do
you believe in God? If so,

1454
01:31:05,281 --> 01:31:09,540
how can you be so fucking
stupid? Um, you know,

1455
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,730
I actually understand
what you're saying that,

1456
01:31:11,731 --> 01:31:13,800
but I definitely do
believe in a higher power,

1457
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:17,280
but I don't believe in it within
the context of organized religion.

1458
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:22,980
Um, if that makes any sense. I definitely
believe in a higher power something,

1459
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,390
whatever it is.

1460
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,910
Like how the fuck did
all this stuff get made?

1461
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,290
But it's just so crazy to think that
there's this, this big thing that,

1462
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,340
that made all of it.

1463
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:41,280
And where was he when he made it or it
didn't he have to be in something that

1464
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:43,590
had to be created.
I don't know what the fuck's going on,

1465
01:31:43,591 --> 01:31:46,170
but I know the answers are
not in organized religion.

1466
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,860
That is just basically
an updated version of,

1467
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:54,390
of cavemen paintings on the
walls. And, uh, you know,

1468
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,660
when people get really religious,
super, super religious,

1469
01:31:57,661 --> 01:32:02,470
they somehow get really angry and they
get violent and it leads to wars. And,

1470
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,930
uh, yeah, I don't believe in
it, but I definitely, you know,

1471
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:06,580
when I contemplate my own death,

1472
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:10,390
I do get scared that I'm not a member
of any organized religion, you know,

1473
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,500
so, uh, I dunno. I Dunno, you know,

1474
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:20,270
I don't fucking know. I believe in a
higher power, but I don't believe it.

1475
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,280
And it within organized religion.
Okay. The final question.
Here we go. Number five,

1476
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:28,900
Bill, is there any way to listen to
the uninformed show you do on Xm?

1477
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:32,680
I don't have an annex XM subscription,

1478
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:36,580
but I did enjoy the live version you
did on opiate Anthony a couple of weeks

1479
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:39,580
back while the one we did on opie
and Anthony was on Xm, wasn't it?

1480
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,040
Um,
no,

1481
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:45,640
there's no way to listen to it without
that and we don't have the money in the

1482
01:32:45,641 --> 01:32:49,380
budget to, uh, I don't,

1483
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,770
I don't know what we have to do with that.

1484
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:53,740
That's something that's one of my New
Year's resolutions to somehow get it up on

1485
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:55,690
the Internet.
For those of you new to the podcast,

1486
01:32:55,691 --> 01:32:59,140
I do this radio show uninformed.
It's on Xm. I do it with Joe to Rosa.

1487
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,660
We do a once a month or lately,

1488
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:05,020
once every other month because shit
has been fucking weird. But anyways,

1489
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,050
that is the end of the podcast.
Um,

1490
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,050
I appreciate you guys a all this year,
you know,

1491
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,490
I just want to say thanks to everybody
for everybody's sending in your questions

1492
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:18,500
and uh, you know your
contributions to the podcast.

1493
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:22,510
So the reasons why that it's now 50
minutes long as opposed to the back of the

1494
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:22,840
day.

1495
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,260
Remember back in the day when I used to
do it in a one room shack and I can only

1496
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:29,710
talk for eight minutes and then I'd
have to hang up. Well thanks to you,

1497
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:33,310
it works for all of us. The bill burn
Monday morning podcast. All right,

1498
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:37,360
you guys have a very happy new year
and um, oh there's one for you.

1499
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:42,240
That's what I think is fucking
overrated is new years. It's,

1500
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:44,380
it's,
it's the dumbest fucking thing ever.

1501
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:48,430
I'm actually going to walk out and make
a peanut butter sandwich while I talk

1502
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:52,630
about how overrated fucking new year's
this and this. This is bonus time.

1503
01:33:52,631 --> 01:33:53,830
You guys don't have to listen to this.

1504
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:56,200
This is like after the
game when you know who won

1505
01:33:57,850 --> 01:34:00,970
and you're listening to the postgame
analysis and there's really no reason to

1506
01:34:00,971 --> 01:34:01,804
fucking do that.

1507
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,770
This is what this part of the podcast
is seen on obligated to listen to any of

1508
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:10,720
that as I make a fucking peanut
butter sandwich. MMM. Look at that.

1509
01:34:10,721 --> 01:34:14,080
There's the parking tickets from
a tank sweat on my refrigerator,

1510
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:15,100
just mocking me,

1511
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:20,410
mocking me and the awful fucking
hot dog that I got. Yeah,

1512
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:24,370
you don't need to go out on new
years. You know, I've actually been,

1513
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,060
cause I'm finally taking new years off.
I'm looking at all these regular bars,

1514
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,330
you know, of course my girl
wants to go someplace fancy,

1515
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:34,960
so she has a place to where her new
year's stress, which I totally understand.

1516
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:38,680
Banalities regular bars that have
like a fucking $10 cover charge.

1517
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,420
It's all 40 bucks.

1518
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:45,780
50 75 someplaces are leaving
even like 150 bucks to do what?

1519
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,920
Go out and drink,
which you can do at home for free.

1520
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,180
And now he's standing next to fucking,
now it's jam packed. It's hot.

1521
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:00,470
People with plastic hats. Those stupid
fucking horns blowing in your ear.

1522
01:35:00,471 --> 01:35:02,090
That's how you really want
to bring in the new year,

1523
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:07,790
getting completely overcharged for some
shit to stand with a bunch of other

1524
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:08,624
douche bags.

1525
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:17,830
That's all overrated and all you fucking
scared whores out there whose dads

1526
01:35:17,931 --> 01:35:18,950
didn't stick around.

1527
01:35:18,951 --> 01:35:23,390
So you have low self esteem and your
drink too much and then you go into that

1528
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:28,160
panic way like, oh my God, I, it's
new years. I need someone to kiss.

1529
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:33,950
I have to have someone to kiss. You
don't, don't give into peer pressure.

1530
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:35,751
You know sweetheart,

1531
01:35:35,751 --> 01:35:39,440
if you want to wonder why you always
ended up in the bathroom on your knees and

1532
01:35:39,441 --> 01:35:44,120
the stall, it's because you given to herd
mentality. You don't have to do that.

1533
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:49,610
You don't, you don't need somebody to
kiss, but you need to do is contemplate,

1534
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:50,600
you know,

1535
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,010
the fact that you don't have someone to
kiss and that that's okay and that you

1536
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:58,910
should hold out for somebody who's going
to treat you good rather than drag you

1537
01:35:58,911 --> 01:35:59,744
in at,

1538
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:04,610
into the fucking bathroom at 1201
can make you fucking, you know,

1539
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:07,770
she can suck your first deck
of 2000 Oh nine you know,

1540
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:11,810
2000 oh nine 2009 you know what I mean?
You know,

1541
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:16,190
I dunno,
you don't actually put jelly on it.

1542
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:17,720
I've been trying to just do the protein,

1543
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:20,750
but I had to put jelly on a
sandwich because you know,

1544
01:36:20,751 --> 01:36:23,520
you try to eat a peanut
butter sandwich and you know,

1545
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:25,460
you dislocate your job
by the time get done,

1546
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:28,160
she went off and it's just a
fucking pain in the ass. So anyways,

1547
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,170
thanks for listening to
the podcast everybody.

1548
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:33,500
Please keep the questions coming in and
it's not too late to send in your New

1549
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,480
Year's resolutions. And
you know what? I liked it.

1550
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:37,580
A lot of people didn't send
any new year's resolutions.

1551
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:41,210
You didn't follow the
fucking pack and make one.

1552
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:45,590
You could make one anytime of
the year and uh, that's it.

1553
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:48,730
I'm in my little breasts, breakfast
Nook, and the sun is shining it.

1554
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,010
Then I feel special.
