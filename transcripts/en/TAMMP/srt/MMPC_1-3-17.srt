1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,460
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:05,880
It's Bill Barr and his time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,060
January 3rd, 2017 what's
going on out? Yeah.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,060
How's it going? Oh, Jesus.
What to talk about first?

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,690
Uh, no, I am not a father. That's not
why this is fucking late. All right.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,380
Now I just lost all my female
female listeners. I was at
the rose bowl yesterday.

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:26,420
That's why I did not record.
Okay.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,730
I watched a bunch of college
football this weekend.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,670
Wow,
man.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,070
Right. I watched a bunch of,
a bunch of college football.

11
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:41,430
Got into this huge debate with Jason Law
had before the Ohio state game going,

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,360
dude, I still don't get how the
fuck you guys are in the playoff.

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,650
And Penn state isn't, you know,
you guys lost to Penn State,

14
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:52,550
head to head and Penn State one
year conference championship.

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,200
That would be like if,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,240
if the Yankees won the American league
east and the Red Sox won the wildcard and

17
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:03,590
then the red sox got to compete in the
playoffs to possibly win a world series

18
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:06,680
and then the Yankees didn't,
that makes no fucking sense whatsoever.

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,010
And he starts going, well, I'll tell you
what I know we had our, we had three,

20
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,550
the most impressive road winds of any
tea but bubble just all of this shit.

21
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:16,130
And I just kept going,
you bleed scarlet and gray.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,150
If this was happening to your team, you
would say it was bullshit. And he said,

23
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:23,090
no I wouldn't.
I be asking why a Washington,

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,680
The Washington huskies were in it like
he would have no problem with a team that

25
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:31,520
his team beat. And when the fucking
camera give me a fucking break. Right.

26
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:33,920
And then what happens?
What happens?

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,180
Ohio state goes out and plays Clemson
and they go out and proceed to get their

28
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,830
asses
by a bunch of Goddamn nerds,

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,760
nerds,
31 to nothing.

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,310
Clemson just fucking
completely dominated them.

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,740
And in the end Bly had sends
me this fucking text, he said,

32
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,990
I can see blah blah blah blah blah.

33
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,650
And then I just sent him a picture
of Joe Paternal shrugging and said,

34
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:04,550
I didn't see nothing.

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,680
Maybe that's what part of it is.

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,310
Maybe that's why they still don't want
Penn state to be in there, you know?

37
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:17,210
Cause at the end of the fucking day,
the end of the day,

38
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,190
this guy kind of fucking,
you know,

39
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,060
it was a lot of shit going on in
the shower there. And the guy,

40
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,070
he fucking didn't say nothing.

41
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,880
It was so weird about being at the
game cause I was rooting for Penn state

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,800
yesterday at the amazing,
amazing fucking game by both teams.

43
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,780
The quarterbacks he bolts
set like tide or set,

44
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:39,830
I'm zillion fucking records is the
highest scoring rose bowl in history.

45
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,520
Uh, at one point both quarterbacks
had four touchdown passes,

46
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:46,400
which I don't think I think that tied
a record or not. I can't remember.

47
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:50,180
And then won the, uh, the red
headed kid there through his fifth,

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,430
I think it was ran and I was
fucking sitting way up there. Um,

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,920
he threw his fifth touchdown. So,
uh, final score was, what was it,

50
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:02,080
52 to nine.
The over under was 53 and a half.

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,980
So,
um,

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,380
Penn State score 28 points
in the third quarter.

53
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,900
It was just a fucking amazing game.

54
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:14,100
And two things bug me when I watched
when I was there though. Of course,

55
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:16,210
it's always something that
bugs me. Okay. Number one.

56
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,090
Okay.

57
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,400
The fucking, uh, at one
point they were showing all,

58
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,500
like the coaches were one
of the Roosevelt, whatever.

59
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,260
And Joe Paternal goes
up there and this is,

60
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,350
he gets a bigger operation
than anybody else.

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,720
Bigger ovation than anybody else.
How important are sports?

62
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,440
How important is fucking
winning of fucking Game Day?

63
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:41,730
These Penn state people?

64
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:46,731
Evidently that's more important than if
you look the other way is some poor kid

65
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:52,470
in a fucking shy. I'm, it's just fucking,
it's, it's unspeakable. All right.

66
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,470
I just fucking, I'm stepping
away from that fucking program.

67
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,520
I've always liked him. You know, I was
still kind of rooting for him. I was like,

68
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:02,340
wow, you know, these kids here in
the field, they didn't fucking do it.

69
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,970
These other people are, uh, they are
innocent of Alban and then they show,

70
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,580
you know, they show the fewer
up on the fucking there. Yeah.

71
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,730
Just like, all right,
fuck these people. Right.

72
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,620
But then USC and their fence,
you know,

73
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,040
USC fans of the classic,
you know,

74
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,140
all day Yolo Douche is,
you know what I mean? It's,

75
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,720
there's just so fucking hard to root
for it despite the fact, you know, um,

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,100
oh, Jay Marcus, Allen, Oj pre murders.

77
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,750
Like if they put Oj up on the screen,
you know, I wouldn't have fucking show.

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,460
I probably would've just to be a cunt.
All right. I'm a Penn state fan again.

79
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:49,410
I don't want to f I don't know. What, what
are you doing at situation anyways? Um,

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,870
so Penn state a USC, USC,
it looks at looking like
they're going to win the game.

81
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,240
Okay. And then Penn state comes
roaring back in the third quarter,

82
00:04:57,241 --> 00:05:00,300
which by the way,
took like an hour in like 10 minutes.

83
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,630
It was the longest quarter of my life.
The TV timeouts,

84
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:07,770
we're fucking ridiculous in
that game. Actually said to
my buddy, I was just like,

85
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,570
dude, you know what?
This is the most boring,

86
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:12,040
exciting game I've ever been to
in my life. It was like every,

87
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,510
it was like if you watch
watching Goodfellas and
every fucking three seconds,

88
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:18,660
somebody just hit pause
on it for two minutes.

89
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:22,100
That felt like 10 minutes
fucking referee standing around.

90
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,510
They fucking reviewed everything.
Everything.

91
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:28,620
But the fucking coin toss they reviewed,
they take game was like four hour,

92
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,750
well over four hours long. So anyways,
Penn state comes roaring back.

93
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,970
Fucking USC fans, few of them left,
most of them stayed. And anyways,

94
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,000
long story short, they end up coming,
you know that they were down by like a,

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,101
I can't even,

96
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:48,790
it was like 27 14 the
next thing it was 35 27

97
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,570
then I think it was (353) 053-0520
seven Penn state than 35 35 then two

98
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,340
whatever, 35 then 49 35 and
that's right. Then Penn state,

99
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,150
I mean USC came back and
score two touchdowns. Right.

100
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,980
And when they tied the
fucking USCW USC players,

101
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,870
just the way they act, their program
is the fucking worst. They're the,

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,620
they like that type of a program.
I can't stand like,

103
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,620
do you remember the first game of the
year when they played Alabama and when

104
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,730
they were coming out of the tunnel,

105
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,540
there's a bunch of them acting like
they were these crazy dogs at the end,

106
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,940
the leashes and they were lunging forward.
Somebody pulling it back.

107
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,790
Oh you guys all, you wait to see
what the fuck's going to happen here.

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,110
And then they go out there
and proceed to get their asses

109
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,300
by a bunch of God damn rednecks.

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
Red fucking Alabama kicked to shit.

111
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,660
It was like 52 to go fuck yourself,
whatever the final scores.

112
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,460
And then after all that fucking shit,
then they just kind of hit good game,

113
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,500
good game. They just scurry
off the fucking field. Right.

114
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,500
And then yesterday you see when they win,
right? They like, first of all, when they,

115
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,130
they, they tied the game up, you know.

116
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,820
And I would say on some ticky tack,
fucking a pass interference calls.

117
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:11,810
But like USC was getting
fucking screwed earlier.

118
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,250
They had a couple bullshit.

119
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,300
It was just sorta we fucked you guys
twice and then uh, we'll, we'll,

120
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,260
we'll fuck the other guys twice. Okay,
well balanced it out here somehow. Um,

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,350
couple of pass interference thing.

122
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:25,310
So when they scored the touchdown to tie
it up with like a fucking minute left

123
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,270
or something, dude, all the
scoring that Penn state did,

124
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,150
I mean they jumped up and down. That
was it. Two fucking USC, the guy,

125
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,150
they scored one in zone.
This guy with no helmet on,

126
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,840
runs down the sideline to
the entire other end zone.

127
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,460
Like Ah,
doing that 300 Yelp,

128
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,420
like he fucking scored. Even then I
would have been like, dude, relax.

129
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:50,330
It's a fucking tie game
all jumping up and down,

130
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,330
all up on the benches
with their fucking Jersey,

131
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,600
spinning them around over their fucking
heads and it's a Thai fucking game.

132
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,600
And then in the end, right, by the way,

133
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,930
Penn state totally played fucking
Marty Schottenheimer ball. Marty Ball.

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,100
I swear to God. Like every time they
had a first down towards the end,

135
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,440
they just written the first play was
running right up the middle. Right?

136
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:13,960
Nia centers fucking ass for no, no
yards. We're burning out though.

137
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,720
Where were you know were taking time off
the clock? They would do when that shit,

138
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,800
I said I'm actually star. I'm convinced
that the prevent defense, by the way,

139
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,320
is actually a,

140
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,350
it's a scam that was come up with by the
heads of the leagues that is executed

141
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:34,610
by the coaches to make sure every fuck
as many games as humanly possible can

142
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,720
come down to the wire so people will
continue to watch that fucking thing.

143
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,980
Once again, did not work. I can't
even begin to tell you. They just,

144
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,010
you just going to give them
the first fucking 80 yards.

145
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,730
Then you're going to play defense and
hope that you hold them to a field goal.

146
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
That's a philosophy and the we'll just,
we'll take away the sidelights.

147
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,760
I'll give him the middle of the,
everybody knows how it fucking works in.

148
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:00,540
All it does is ensure that on the
final fucking three, four plays,

149
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,870
the other team now has a chance to win.
You've been playing defense,

150
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,600
you've been shutting them down.
You've been throwing the fucking ball.

151
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,320
You've been kicking their ass and then
all of a sudden hand up off the middle

152
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,100
every fucking time. I Dunno. Drove
me up the fucking wall. So then you,

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,120
when USC finally wins it right after
letting up 49 fucking points and then they

154
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,661
score 52 the second day when at the
entire team runs down the field,

155
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,120
not towards the field
goal kicker to celebrate,

156
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,170
who by the way was doing that stupid
dap thing, the entire fucking thing.

157
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:36,960
Trying to get like a sneaker deals, like
what kind of kicker gets a sneaker deal?

158
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,900
They got like half a deal if they
just get it for their kicking foot.

159
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,640
Then the other thing they give
him like a fucking Sandal,

160
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,660
so they don't even go out and celebrate
with the fucking kid who kicked the

161
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,320
field goal.

162
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,790
They just run right down at Penn state's
band and the whole fan section and just

163
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,430
screamed all in their faces.

164
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,120
And what's fucking hilarious is that
game obviously could have gone either way

165
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,830
and if they didn't win, they
would have been like, well hey,

166
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,140
good game [inaudible]
Penn state wouldn't done.

167
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:07,620
That was just a completely classless
fucking move. But that's how they are,

168
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,110
you know, that's, it's one of
those schools were saying, well,

169
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:14,340
the coach just doesn't take
any responsibility. And he's
just like, well, uh, the,

170
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,650
uh,
cancer,

171
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,690
this is very emotional team and they
like to express themselves and have that,

172
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,310
yeah. Yeah. When they, when,
when they, when, when they don't,

173
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:24,660
they fucking scamper off the field.

174
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,740
It's like that Richard Sherman
guy, whenever the Seattle
world's you mad, you mad,

175
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,530
Bro, you met. Right. And then
all of a sudden he loses,

176
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:38,130
he tries to be mister tries
to be the mirror. Hey, good
game Tom Brady. Good game.

177
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,080
And it varies like that
showed class. No, it did.

178
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,710
Anybody can be classy when you
fucking lose, you can't talk shit.

179
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,630
You lost the class.

180
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,650
Act is when you win and you're
not a cunt about it. Um,

181
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,640
but anyways, having said that, it
was a fucking amazing, amazing game.

182
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,930
Great comeback by a USC.
And uh,

183
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,990
is as much as it came down to the wire
and there was all those points scored.

184
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,390
I have to be honest with you,
I,

185
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,730
if I could have fast forwarded through
the last 45 minutes of the fuck,

186
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,510
that's how long the fucking game was
and how long these fucking TV timeouts

187
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,880
where I can't imagine how much fucking
money they made. Game started at one 15.

188
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:21,860
It wasn't over until like,
I want to say like five 45,

189
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:25,930
five 40. It was just way too
far. It was over four hours long.

190
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,810
It was like a fucking baseball game.
It's like this is,

191
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,000
this is what happened in
the national pastime. Bill.

192
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:34,430
You know what was one must as long as
you bitching about the fucking game. Um,

193
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,140
anyways, so we went to the
tailgate. I brought that,

194
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,003
uh,

195
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,370
that flat top grill that I
got the campfire one. Um,

196
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,890
this is not a paid advertisement dude.
Fucking thing was unbelievable.

197
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,130
It was unfucking believable. Lie head
was at, I didn't want to go to the game.

198
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,440
He was having so much fun. He
cooked so much shit. I make,

199
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,430
we had so much fucking food.
We had too much food. And, um,

200
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,280
that's why I felt like I got hit by a
truck was I ate so fucking much. And um,

201
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,640
I made these hash browns.
He made this crazy egg sandwich.

202
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,380
Then we had chicken wings,

203
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:14,320
then we had fucking steak and cheese
and we still have burgers and dogs that

204
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,690
we're going to try to do at the end of
the game. But I was just too fucking full.

205
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,940
But a law head was fucking hilarious man.
He was so excited to cook.

206
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,740
Right.

207
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,930
I'm back in the truck and he's outside
of it and this guy comes walking by and

208
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:28,750
you know, when they, they sell those
ticket holders, I always get one right?

209
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,140
And he goes, hey, take it all you took it.
I go, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get four.

210
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:35,560
So these guys sort of walking up to the
truck and I'm not doing a good job back

211
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:39,490
in it in cause the grills blocking
my view. I'm trying to look around.

212
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,020
I don't want to fuck
this thing up. And, uh,

213
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,010
so I had to do get to make a couple of
temps and rather than blaming it on me,

214
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,320
chase starts yelling at the
ticket guy cause hey buddy, hey,

215
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,870
think he could get out of way,
let the kid fun party.

216
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,110
And then I didn't hear the guy going,
hey bro, you gotta, you gotta relax and,

217
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,030
and Jay just starts fucking John Adam.

218
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,620
Like he's fucking arguing when a call and
I just yelled out, I automatic, I said,

219
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:03,700
Jamie, just shut the fuck up. I got to it.
I'm sorry. Sorry about that guy. You know,

220
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
he's, he's a little wound up, right? So

221
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,150
we have fucking buy the
ticket holder things.

222
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:13,450
The guy leaves and then
Jay setting up his fucking,

223
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,000
his little a canopy thing and t's
just fucking, he's just locked in,

224
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,920
you know, Jay's a fucking athletes
so he just fucking gets his,

225
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,050
he's got that focus right.
And as he sat in the thing up,

226
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:29,680
like these four people we've barely even
establish our space are just passing

227
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,290
through. And then Jay
immediately it's like, Hey,

228
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,980
I want you to walk from the whole area.

229
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,030
It just walk along like
freaking the fuck out.

230
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,350
I said to him later, I said,
Jesus Christ, Jay, I go,

231
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:43,930
you fucking dropped the gloves
before the game even started.

232
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,450
What the fuck is with you when he's like,
not a lot of guys, the guys walking,

233
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,280
right, and he types, what are you tired
people come through the whole fucking kid.

234
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,780
And I just started laughing. I was
like, Jay, you're excited to cook.

235
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,470
Say the cookie. You got a little
excited. Then he finally just fine.

236
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,410
Just relax and goes, all
right. I got excited.

237
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,090
Um, I don't know. We don't
know where we are. Just, we
had a great fucking time and,

238
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:11,230
um, I dunno, I still nodded off a
little bit in the first quarter.

239
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,200
You know, I can't get to sleep
after all these years of doing,

240
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:19,201
stand up till like fucking
a 12 midnight and get up,

241
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:23,670
you know, four hours later,
I'm an old. Um, I really felt
my age, the sheer man, uh,

242
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,410
speaking of which there was someone at
the Tailgate, I'm not gonna say who,

243
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,820
who was fucking slumped over the truck
because they had to go the bathroom and

244
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,940
couldn't. So we're like, dude, we
got to take you to the hospital.

245
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,830
We got to take you to,
Nah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

246
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:39,300
And five fugly ends up coming back
like 20 minutes, slide it through.

247
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,380
And it felt great because I eat,

248
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,020
I think he passed a fucking
kidney stone or subs.

249
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,250
I don't know what the fuck it was.

250
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,950
I don't know what to tell you.
Oh yeah.

251
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,920
So we almost had a fatality lie.
It almost got a game misconduct.

252
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,730
Oh, that was a bullshit one
on USC. That fucking, uh,

253
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,330
targeting with that was setting
that, that wasn't, I don't know.

254
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,720
Guy Jumps in the air, he's aiming for
his chest and somebody else hits him.

255
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,990
Then all of a sudden the guy gets
knocked down. Where is his chest?

256
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:14,780
His head is now we're just chest wasn't,
and the guy was already in the air.

257
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,090
Right. Does anybody give a fuck? I, I'll,
I will plow, I will plow ahead here.

258
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,520
Um, I also watched the UFC, I know this
is like an old story at this point, but,

259
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:30,110
um, you know, everybody, like
everybody else, I watched the uh,

260
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:35,111
Amanda Nunez and the Ronda Rousey
Rowdy Ronda Rousey fight Ed A.

261
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,220
Yeah, that was tough to watch. That
was definitely tough to watch. And um,

262
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,730
it was even tougher to watch all the
fucking shit talk and assholes on like

263
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:45,710
Twitter and all the means.

264
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,920
[inaudible] you know,
I've taken naps slogan the note,

265
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,350
they went to get a drink
and then it was fucking okay

266
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,270
over. And it's just like, like
all of these people that have,

267
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,280
have fought and competed and won in the
octagon and they have the right to talk

268
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:04,210
shit like that. It's just a, I don't
know why people do stuff like that. Uh,

269
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:08,320
you know, if that happens to every
champion, if they, if they stay,

270
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:12,460
if they stick around eventually somebody
younger is going to see you're the

271
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:12,821
champ.

272
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:17,710
Everybody's breaking down what the fuck
it is you do over and over and over and

273
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,480
over again.
And then eventually you get run down.

274
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:24,400
It happens to everybody if it can happen
to Muhammad Ali, sugar ray, Leonard,

275
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,280
Marvin, Hagler, all these
fucking guys, they last fight.

276
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:32,070
I saw 'em loose Roy Jones,
Jr Matthews,

277
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,260
George Saint Pierre, right? I think George
Saint Pierre might've won his last one,

278
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,150
but he was all beat up and everything.
But um,

279
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,180
and said he didn't
remember part of the fight.

280
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,990
So that's what happens to everybody.
So of course I texted it to my buddy,

281
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:47,950
he goes, well, not rocky or fucking
Mayweather, meaning rocky Marciano.

282
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:51,280
And it's just like, dude, all right,
I'll rocky Marciano. Absolutely.

283
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,160
But like Mayweather,
I dunno,

284
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,590
maybe owes me like 300
bucks in paper view.

285
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,330
Think about that guy.
All right,

286
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,760
I'm really going out on a limb here
cause I don't watch that much boxing.

287
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:08,660
I think one, obviously one of the
greatest fighters of all fucking time,

288
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:13,661
but like he's just also understood
that final third of his career,

289
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,100
I feel better than anybody else.

290
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,690
How do you still continue fighting and
not take that big fucking knocked down?

291
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,320
Part of it,
our blog apart was his amazing defense.

292
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,830
But the other is to fucking opponents
that he picked. You know what I mean?

293
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,420
That fucking Pacquiao fight should have
happened at least eight years before I

294
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:36,680
was on his side where I was like, yeah,
he, maybe he's on drugs. He probably,

295
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,220
I don't know, maybe he is,
maybe fucking isn't. But, um,

296
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,340
I dunno. All the boxing
isn't the way it was. Um,

297
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,660
somewhere in the 80s at died like a,

298
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,950
that Hagler Hearns Duran Leonard,

299
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,910
they all lost and they all fucking lost
to each other and shit. It's just like,

300
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:02,170
he had unbelievable fighters
for unbelievable fighters
and they all fought each

301
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:07,150
other. It's impossible to stay
undefeated, but, um, you know,

302
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,410
when you fuck it, you know, it'd be
like, I've just fucking, Ali fought,

303
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:16,300
Joe finally fought Joe Frazier
in like 1981. I'm like,

304
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,430
what?
Ali's last fights.

305
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,740
I think it was against Larry Holmes who
then was the fucking champ for like the

306
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:25,510
next four years or whatever his rule
until I think Tyson came along and maybe

307
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:28,000
there was one guy in between. I can't
remember. It's been so long ago.

308
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,880
Hagglers last loss was
to sugar ray Leonard.

309
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,920
I mean these guys fought champions right
up until the end of their career as

310
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:39,040
opposed to a, you know, fighting some
guy from England with weight issues.

311
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,330
You know that one Ricky,
Ricky, Ricky Hatton.

312
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,770
I saw that fight.

313
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,180
I don't like talking shit about
fighters either because you know,

314
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,190
they cannot beat the fuck out of me.
I'm, I'm just saying that, you know,

315
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,710
I think it's going to hurt me whether
the level of guy that he fought the final

316
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:01,490
third of his career. Um, cause
I know for one like just,

317
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,810
I just, you know, you'd watch his fucking
fights. The other guy couldn't hit him.

318
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,130
Mayweather could knock them out and
he just kind of a poop poop poop poop.

319
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,730
The whole fucking fight with is those
white kitten gloves. I'm just like,

320
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:15,490
this is fucking boring as shit.

321
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,500
Um, fighting not to lose
playing, not playing,

322
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:24,460
not to lose like Penn state, like Penn
state didn't the fourth fucking quarter.

323
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,370
Um, so that's, I know,
that's my own dumb opinion.

324
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,720
I don't know what they don't
know shit about fighting,

325
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:32,140
but all I know this is you're a fucking
asshole if you go on Twitter and you

326
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:34,710
start trashing somebody cause they uh,

327
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,750
cause they got knocked out
like they're a pussy or you,

328
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:43,480
you are overrated or any of that type of
shit. I mean, some of you probably say,

329
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,580
I just did that to Mayweather.
I'm not,

330
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,380
I'm saying he's one of
the greatest of all time.

331
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,660
I would never say that the guy's
a pussy or anything like that.

332
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,290
I would have just liked to watch
him fight a better caliber fighter.

333
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,220
Um, I dunno. You know what I mean?

334
00:19:57,221 --> 00:20:00,130
I'd like to add that may whether patio
fight that should have fucking happened

335
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:04,120
at one oh five oh six something like that.

336
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,000
Bill. Shut the fuck up. All right,
I'll shut the fuck up anyways. Um,

337
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,350
you know what it really is, is the
adverse, he fucking said that may,

338
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,460
whether it would have fucking
beat Hagler Hearns Leonard Duran,

339
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,020
like he would have
fucking beat all of them.

340
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,400
It's like he would've beat all of them.

341
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,520
All of them couldn't beat all of each
other, you know, I don't know what he's,

342
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:29,080
I don't know what he's basing it on him.
You know what he's basing it on?

343
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,750
He's basing it on being born in the
late seventies. I just, you know,

344
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:36,700
I'm just an old fucking crabby men,
I'm speaking of, which, you know,

345
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,540
I've, I've been working on my anger. Um,

346
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,610
I got in the car today to return
the pickup truck and I, uh,

347
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,710
I fucking, uh, I don't know.

348
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:51,680
I made it down the street and around
the block before it got into an argument

349
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:55,580
with his fucking woman who just glided
through her stop sign in her white

350
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:58,310
Mercedes Benz.
I got to fucking,

351
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:02,690
I got to anybody who's got a white
Mercedes, a white, uh, people,

352
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:03,524
white cars,

353
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
high end white cars are
fucking entitled cuts.

354
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,220
I don't like, you know what I mean?
They think the car is a classy right.

355
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,200
I was confers he shit
like versus he loves,

356
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,670
you know,
it just,

357
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,140
it gets the class is fucking thing ever.

358
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,430
Mercedes and BMW, they've really fallen
the fuck off. You know what I mean?

359
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,430
They just went right down
to the bottom feeders.

360
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,960
Anybody with like Sukin afford 60 bucks
a month can lease one of those cars now

361
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,750
telling you when he used to see
a Mercedes drive down the street,

362
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,450
he used to be some fucking
guy like in his 50s,

363
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,880
who was wealthy or have a BMW. Even then
that was like more like the Yuppie guy.

364
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:51,790
Like I'm not having to fucking kids and
I'll pour shit in the drinking water

365
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,290
just to make another buck,
you know,

366
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,560
Cook the fucking stock market
and banker psycho, right?

367
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,810
We were just having rough sex, you
know, that fucking lunatic. Um,

368
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,260
now it's shit. It's like, it's
like fucking 21 year old kids. Um,

369
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,440
I think this podcast should just be
like a, some sort of theme of like,

370
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:15,850
things aren't the way they used to be
and I'm fucking upset about it. Um,

371
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,190
you know what it is, is I, I didn't have
a good breakfast today and at my age,

372
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:23,510
that's not a good thing.
You know, I woke up in the,

373
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:28,040
and we didn't have any fucking
real food. The fucking, my,

374
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,740
my frying pan was underneath all the
dirty shift from the fucking Rosebowl

375
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,200
that's in the sink. It's like, I'm
not going to fry up a fucking egg.

376
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,280
And a Nia has one of those fucking
little kid cereals in there.

377
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:41,960
And I was just like, all right, I'll
fucking eat this shit. And, uh, um,

378
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,430
I already had the fucking sugar high and
now I'm starting to crash saw and being,

379
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,820
uh, being a little harsh than
the millennials, you know,
in Floyd Mayweather and,

380
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:56,110
uh, people who drive white
cars. I can admit that in 2017,

381
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,190
I can admit that this is the new me,
the new bill.

382
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:05,020
I meditate now and by saying I meditate
means I tried it once last week

383
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,960
and I plan on doing it twice a day, but
I've only done it once so far, but uh,

384
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,490
but I've been thinking about
doing it, you know, and uh,

385
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,460
people have been sending me shit about
trying to get over my fucking anger

386
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,420
issues and uh, yeah, that lady like
gliding through the stop sign and I,

387
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,490
I stopped, I said, you gotta
Stop Sign, right? Then she
goes, you got one over there.

388
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:28,980
And I go, that's not it. It's
the other ones. It's just like,

389
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,320
you're just a fucking nother Douche
in a white Mercedes. I sweated. Got,

390
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,070
do you think if they stopped making
that car, people would drive better?

391
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:40,540
If there's something about people
when they get in a white Mercedes,

392
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,340
a white fucking car, like you
know, of, of, of that costs
a certain amount of money.

393
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:48,010
That's it. Look, I'm, I'm getting
upset again. Just relax, Bill.

394
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,430
Take a fucking breadth, you know,
go outside. Look at the birds.

395
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,440
We have a hell. It is, you're supposed to
do it. You know, somebody sent me this, I,

396
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,280
I should play it. No, somebody
sent me this fucking video on, uh,

397
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,290
you know how to get over my anger and the
risk of sounding like a hack comedian.

398
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,850
It actually, it didn't make me angry.
It fucking upset. Maybe though.

399
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,000
It really did.
Let me see this here.

400
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,000
See if I can click on this
fucking thing again. Oh,

401
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:16,590
how not to be angry all the time.

402
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:20,250
I wonder if I can play this and not
get in fucking trouble by some, uh,

403
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,960
some podcasting entity here. See if I
can turn this fucking thing up here.

404
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,170
So I look at this thing,
right? It's a cartoon.

405
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,580
So immediately it's on my intellect
level right? Here it is. This,

406
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:34,860
this is what they're trying to say to me.
I'll try to play this year,

407
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,630
my minimal fucking, um, abilities here.

408
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,110
Oh, for God's sakes. So you
gonna play it here or what?

409
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,140
I hit play.

410
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,500
Okay.

411
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,850
I refuse to get fucking angry during this.
Why won't this thing play? Oh, I know.

412
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:56,530
Because I'm in this room.
I'm in this room.

413
00:24:56,531 --> 00:25:00,040
So the fucking in the internet doesn't
work or there's a little spin wheel.

414
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,730
It's gradually fight spinning around.
What's going to happen?

415
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,900
All I want to do is play this fucking
all. I want to do room a zoom, zoom, zoom.

416
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,470
I just want to play this fucking video.
How does it know?

417
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:15,640
How does the universe know when you're
trying to fucking do something? All right.

418
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:18,160
You know what? Fuck it. I'm not
playing to, hey look at that.

419
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,820
I'm not angry anymore because I just
gave him cause that's basically what this

420
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:26,200
fucking video told you to do.
It was talking about so and so.

421
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,420
This is,
this is the name of the video.

422
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:33,310
It says how not to be angry all the time
and I would love to read the fucking

423
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:34,480
comments on this thing,
right?

424
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,470
He says how not to be angry all
the time and it shows this guy,

425
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:41,560
it's like a William or whatever.
I think you guys actually name was bill.

426
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,660
I can't remember.
You know,

427
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,400
he likes to read the newspaper and he
tells his wife not to interrupt him while

428
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:52,150
he's doing that. And then it goes,
his wife finds this very upsetting.

429
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,770
So one time he's reading the
newspaper and uh, she says, Hey,

430
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:59,050
when are you going to a,
you know, set the table,

431
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:02,470
the Blahblahblahblahblah
and William flips out.

432
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,680
He gets angry and it says William
gets angry because he has hope.

433
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,220
It was talking about how angry people,
as much as they come off as a negative,

434
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,990
they're actually really positive people.

435
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,970
And it was basically
saying that they have hope.

436
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,360
So they present all these different
scenarios and they're like,

437
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:20,590
at each one of these cell,
you know,

438
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:23,470
he goes to the airport
in his plane is delayed.

439
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,730
He's one of the premiere fucking flyers.
He gets mad, he goes up, he flips,

440
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:31,180
he screams at the fucking lady behind
the counter because he is hopeful.

441
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,500
And it was basically saying that he needed
to be a little more pessimistic. Oh,

442
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:36,910
here's the video,
here's a video.

443
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,710
It's basically saying you needed
to be a negative cont. Here we go.

444
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,510
Like Boomi times.

445
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,010
We certainly don't usually
think of them as well,

446
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,880
why is it so fucking quiet?

447
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,613
They treat me.

448
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,990
You know what? I can't deal
with this fucking guy's
accent. I can't deal with it.

449
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,770
Oh, I know I had no, I had the fucking
microphone turned round. There we go.

450
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,640
Can you be paypal? The actually, aw,

451
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,363
hold on one second.

452
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,550
Sound like Fumi Times.

453
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,630
We certainly don't usually
think of optimists yet.

454
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,950
They truly march to them.

455
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,640
I can't fuck it. Oh my God,
I can't fucking listen to it.

456
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,920
Can He, why is he going to fucking
over it? And that's everything.

457
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,230
And that's the get everything.

458
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,030
Give me paypal actually
ported the people on the left.

459
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,440
Yeah. So basically he goes through
all of this fucking Shit, right?

460
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,050
And he says in it,

461
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,970
to be more positive is what you
have to do is you have to accept

462
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,310
the world that the world is
actually a very dark, gloomy place.

463
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,690
And most things fail.
And most basically,

464
00:27:55,691 --> 00:28:00,610
most dreams don't come true. And, uh,
you know, be more of like a realist.

465
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:03,580
And like people who, you know, people
get upset. People who aren't angry,

466
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,810
people get upset, um,
when something happens,

467
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,230
but they get over it way quicker
and they don't get nearly as mad.

468
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,310
And it's basically because I guess they're
walking around going like, oh yeah,

469
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,340
why wouldn't this person in this white
Mercedes blow through the stop sign?

470
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,450
Of course they do.

471
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,890
I guess this part of me
that I understand that,

472
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,170
like I flip out about the moron drivers
out here and I literally say to myself

473
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,370
out loud after I flip out in
the car going like, yes, Bill,

474
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,880
you have established that
people out here suck at driving.

475
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,950
When are you going to stop
reacting to it? And um, you know,

476
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:46,690
I, I, I, I don't think ever,

477
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't think it's because
unlike an optimist I don't have,

478
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:56,330
I'm not hopeful that someone fucking,

479
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,150
you know, if they're going
to make a left, that they,

480
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,110
that they'll get all the way over to the
left instead of sitting in the middle

481
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:05,910
of the lane and now I
have to fucking wait.

482
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,610
Where if you just were over
by the double yellow line,

483
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:12,200
I could have gone around you.
You fucking cunt.

484
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,230
I'm not like hopeful that
they're going to do that.

485
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,440
I don't have hope that
they're going to do it.

486
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:22,790
I just can't understand why you wouldn't
because I know that person has been

487
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:25,630
sitting behind somebody doing that.
It's like when you're,

488
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:29,660
you're in a long line at fucking whatever
and it's moving slow and everybody's

489
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:32,630
Yammer with the person on the other
side of the fucking desk. It's like,

490
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:35,510
just get up there and say what
you want and shut the fuck up.

491
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,700
How hard is that?

492
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,440
And there'll be a person in front
of you look at you rolling eyes.

493
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,060
Like I can't believe how long this takes.

494
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,820
And then they get up
there and what do they do?

495
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,460
They just fucking launch into all of this
shit that has nothing to do with what

496
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,294
you're doing

497
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,670
and it just fucking ads timed.

498
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,980
So I'm not, I don't have any
hope that people are going to,

499
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,030
maybe I do. I have hope, you know?

500
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,180
I guess I would hope you'd be a fucking
not a moron and figure out why this

501
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:16,160
seems to be taking way longer
than it should. I Dunno.

502
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,800
I don't think it's because I have hope.

503
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:23,210
I think the reason why I get fucking
angry is because that is my default

504
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:26,390
emotion. I think that
that's what it is. You know,

505
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,930
I came from one of those families
are like, shut the fuck up.

506
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,290
You sit there and take it. Right.
One of those things, which, you know,

507
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,940
if you're not allowed to express yourself,

508
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,820
you immediately feel like you're not
going to get what you want in life.

509
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:41,360
And I think that that's what I think,
that's why I flip up. You know,

510
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,810
I flip out because of that. Like, you
know, if something starts to go away,

511
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:46,330
I don't want it to go,
um,

512
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,970
no one's going to listen to me and I
don't have any fucking options other than

513
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:54,520
just sit there and fucking take it.
So I think that's what he's,

514
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,500
I don't think it's, cause I'm hopeful.
I get maybe a little bit, baby.

515
00:30:57,501 --> 00:31:00,410
I'm such an angry cunt. I can't say
that there's some truth in this video,

516
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,160
but I don't think the solution
is, is to just walk around, um,

517
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,680
you know, just accepting that
people are the way that they are,

518
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,340
you know, that'd be like, if
you know, you're coaching a
team, it'd be like, yeah,

519
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,300
you know, we're eight and eight,
eight and eight next year,

520
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,490
you know, I will probably be eight
and eight again because, uh, I've,

521
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:28,790
I've accepted that this
is the way things are. Um,

522
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,710
I know a lot of positive driven
people and they're not angry people.

523
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,940
So I don't think being positive
as part of that. I think it's,

524
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,970
I think it's just how my fucking wires,

525
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:43,040
my mental wires had
been soldered together.

526
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,680
I think I probably came into the world.

527
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:47,720
Okay.

528
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,910
I Dunno.
Can you come into the world angry?

529
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,790
Okay.

530
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,700
I Dunno. I don't think he can. I don't
think you're born that fucking way.

531
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:58,100
I have no fucking idea, but I dunno
about this video where I got to now just,

532
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,470
I just, the solution is just to
be like, yeah, well you know,

533
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:07,410
people out here when they make lives,
that's how they're going to do it. I mean,

534
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:08,730
I guess if you just do that,

535
00:32:08,731 --> 00:32:13,650
then you don't get angry because all
these years in me getting angry has not

536
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:17,460
made people stop doing that. It never made
the person in front of me go like, Oh,

537
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:22,410
I'm sorry, let me get over. They
just sorta look at me weird as I,

538
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,200
as I drive by yelling at them,
looking at me like,

539
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:29,700
what the fuck is he yelling at me?
Am I doing something I have no,

540
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:32,850
I have a white car.
How could I possibly be in the wrong?

541
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,480
Um, I dunno. I have no idea. I think a,

542
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,590
I dunno,
I dunno what my deal is,

543
00:32:44,591 --> 00:32:46,690
but I plan on getting to the
bottom but at least understand it.

544
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,720
But I don't think a three minute fucking
youtube video with some guy with his

545
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,200
fucking,
you know,

546
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,070
I think in the United States
we like getting like people
with English accents to

547
00:32:57,071 --> 00:33:00,550
fucking narrates shit. Cause then it
just sounds like it's true for smart,

548
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,830
you know what I mean? Which
is why I think all these, uh,

549
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:06,460
these English guys have been
Scottish guys have done well. Um,

550
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,420
maybe it's just women like fucking that
accent or just like a different foreign

551
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,750
accent. I don't know, like these
talk show people, you know,

552
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,900
for some reason that slot that
used to be after David Letterman,

553
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:19,000
you have to get an
English or Scottish guy,

554
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,860
like that's become like that time slot,
like an American accent.

555
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:26,590
That guy can not do well
in that.

556
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,190
That is the Great Britain accent.

557
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:35,460
Time-Slot um,
I dunno,

558
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,160
I I, but I, I all I know is, I
can't, I can't listen to fucking,

559
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,840
I can't listen to this again.
Friend Fred furious.

560
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
He's been married to his,
he's often furious.

561
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:50,630
He sounds like he's in the
fucking clockwork orange. Uh,

562
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,300
but I am off often furious. His name
was Fred. I knew it was one of my names.

563
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:59,500
Right. Um, all right. What am
I doing here? Let's, let's,

564
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:04,180
let's read some fucking advertising here.
34 fucking minutes into this podcast.

565
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:06,760
And I don't think I'm a, I don't think
I'm even remotely a better person.

566
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,600
What about you guys? Um, all right. Oh,

567
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:15,040
it's our friends here. No,
wait, let's, let's, let's stay
on this point here. Maybe.

568
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,810
Maybe that's what I should do.
I'm going to try that today.

569
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:22,360
I'm going to just try walking around and
what am I do is have my eyebrows up a

570
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:26,230
little bit. I'm going to do that
thing that, uh, people do. You know,

571
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,950
where they make their lips disappear?
Their mouth looks like it's closed,

572
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:33,220
but their lips disappearing on the car.
Just going to do that. Walk around like,

573
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:37,300
Oh yeah, of course. This thing that
should take 90 seconds. Of course.

574
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:40,990
Now it's going to take
six minutes. Yep. Okay.

575
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,450
Take my car over to the dealership to get
the, uh, the brake light done. I mean,

576
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,890
I know that I could change out a
break lake, but of course you've, uh,

577
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,380
have the screws.
They are,

578
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,800
they're inside the car behind a plastic
thing and I know when I go to take that

579
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:58,450
thing off that they are the head on,

580
00:34:58,451 --> 00:35:02,710
the screw is going to be something
I've never seen before and requests and

581
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:04,810
requires a special screwdriver.

582
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,760
Then I could go down or maybe
order on Amazon, do you know?

583
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,470
And of course they won't
just sell me the one.

584
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:13,690
I'll have to buy the whole
set and then I'll be like,

585
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:18,691
well I guess I can pay fucking $35 for
a new set of screwdrivers and hope I

586
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:21,610
don't get a ticket over
the next few fucking days.

587
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,850
Or I could just drive down to this fucking
dealership and just pay 180 bucks for

588
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,320
a fucking like, boy, get
married, get mad again.

589
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,690
I'm just going to go down to the
dealership and just say, yes,

590
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,540
I have something that I could
totally repair on my car.

591
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,840
If you guys hadn't put those
aliens screws in there,

592
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,660
excuse me,

593
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,580
could I have the screwdriver that
I need to undo those four screws?

594
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,860
Could I,
could I have that please?

595
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:58,130
And could I then find the corporate guy
right as he's getting on his jet who

596
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:01,860
came up with this idea and could
I please just, I don't know,

597
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:06,510
just sort of stick it into the side of
his neck. I think that would be nice.

598
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,200
How does that work? If I say angry
shit, but I say it in a pleasant way,

599
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,421
ma'am.

600
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:18,421
Is there a reason why you're so not
focused as you work this cash register?

601
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:24,000
Is there a reason why you feel that
you were above a job that you stink at?

602
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,710
How does that work?

603
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,880
Shouldn't you be so good at this job that
I'm actually sitting there thinking to

604
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:33,780
myself, why are you working
here? You're way beyond this.

605
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,160
Why are you standing here reinforcing
that you're not even good enough to do

606
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,680
this job because you think
you're better than another job?

607
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,550
Is there any way you could open that cash
register door and I could grab you by

608
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:46,384
your ponytail,

609
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,920
shove your head into the drawer and then
see how far I could close it with your

610
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:53,800
head in it.
Is there a way I could do that?

611
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,431
Sorry guys,

612
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:58,800
you just know I have to
rehearse everything that I'm
going to go through today.

613
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,620
Okay.

614
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,120
Oh, hello. Staples. No, you cannot. You
cannot have my phone number. I mean,

615
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:09,920
I'll give you a phone number and I will
give you an alternate phone number. Yes,

616
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:11,300
I will.
None of these will be true.

617
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,630
Okay.

618
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,680
Oh, I'll, I'll give you
a, I'll give you a, uh,

619
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,650
you know my fake email addresses that
I give. It's, you know it at AOL,

620
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,760
aol.com.

621
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,100
You got to have a fake one.
You know it@aol.com.

622
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,690
Okay.

623
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,240
That's my fake. What? And that is a
reference to will Ferrell in old school.

624
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,480
Frank the tank when they go on frank
a tank, right? He's gone. You know it,

625
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,620
you know,
um,

626
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:47,040
the fake phone number I give out is a
series of area codes followed by the

627
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:51,580
number of five. That'd
be like, what's your,

628
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,650
what's your phone number? It's like,
Eh, three, two, three, two, one, two,

629
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:01,150
eight, one eight, five. That's what I do.

630
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,210
But they start to look at,
you have to two area codes,

631
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:07,960
you know when you go like three,
one oh two, one, two. They get that.

632
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,180
You get that little puppy look,
the gold cock of the head.

633
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,540
And then rather than saying
eight, one eight, cause
they're gonna know I go eight,

634
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,400
one, eight, five. So I
still get it in there.

635
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,060
A fake name I go with all the time.
Russell.

636
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,920
Russell, whenever I just need
a first name. What's your
name? Hey, what's your name?

637
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:29,590
Russell. Russell. What can I do
for you today? Well, you can, yeah,

638
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:32,740
you can start by not asking me
personal questions. All right.

639
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,900
That's what you can do.
And you can get some loafers.

640
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:40,040
Are that fit you fucking feet. How about
that? All right. Did tight shoes. Um,

641
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,920
I'm sorry. I don't want to
tell you. Oh by the way,

642
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:49,480
I, uh, you know, I got some video,

643
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,500
my old buddy cleo and um,

644
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,270
she seems happy as hell.
And this is unprecedented.

645
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,330
This person that I gave my dog
too is a dog trainer and um,

646
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,160
at like the fucking dog whisperer or
level. So, which is what my dog needed.

647
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,010
And he sent me video of
something I've never seen before.

648
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:16,150
My dog came in and wanted
to play with another dog,

649
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,390
which my dog never did.
My dog tried to kill other dogs.

650
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,310
My dog tried to kill another dog when
my dog was with the trainer that now has

651
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:27,840
it and he's slowly been working
with this fucking thing. And um,

652
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,140
what was amazing and the trainer said,
you know,

653
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:36,250
within a week to 10 days they will
probably be just like best of friends

654
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,080
sleeping together in the sun.

655
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,740
So that made me feel good cause
I think she's actually happier.

656
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:47,020
Um, and that environment then she
was with me even though, you know,

657
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,470
I miss her to death or what, but that
made me feel good. So there you go.

658
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,610
There you go. I'll tell you that
fucking dog has had an amazing life,

659
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,600
an amazing life.
Like a literally,

660
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:03,310
it should have been over like three
different times and it always survives and

661
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:06,490
its life has gotten
progressively better. So, uh,

662
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,390
they made me feel good as much as I,
uh, as much as I missed the thing.

663
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,350
That's cool. It's got a
Fred and I got nobody.

eyes. Dorm Room. Ryan, he was in

F is for family season too.
Thank you very much.

800
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:44,050
Last week on the Thursday podcast,
you talked about goodwill.

801
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,260
I worked goodwill for a little over a
year and you wouldn't believe the shit

802
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:51,230
that was donated there. Oh my God.
This fascinates the hell out of me.

803
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:55,890
I imagine they give you basically
everything short of a body. Um,

804
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,530
you are totally right.
They just throw all this shit and trucks,

805
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,030
but they, but instead of
throwing shit in the oceans,

806
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,290
yeah, wait a second. But they, instead
of throwing shit in the oceans,

807
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:14,291
put the trucks and warehouses and let
them set for at least three to 10 years so

808
00:49:14,931 --> 00:49:18,200
the shit can get a lovely
scent of mold over them.

809
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,310
When they get loaded. They literally
throw this shit on the truck.

810
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:26,720
Nine Times out of 10 breaking
whatever you are donating.

811
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,650
Yeah. No Way. You know what the Shit,

812
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,410
you know what the shit thing
is about donating to goodwill.

813
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,810
You can bring shit with mold,
Piss,

814
00:49:35,811 --> 00:49:39,320
shit or anything else disgusting
there and they have to take it.

815
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:40,970
Well then what are they
supposed to do with it?

816
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:45,971
I'd put it on a truck to nine times out
of 10 they will take anything but that

817
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:50,360
one time out of 10 if you bitch and
threatened to call corporate and complain,

818
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,840
they will take no matter they'll
take it no matter what. Okay. Oh God.

819
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:57,690
Someone's got to do a documentary
on goodwill. When I was there,

820
00:49:57,691 --> 00:50:02,130
people would donate trashed. They didn't
want to pay to get rid of couches,

821
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:05,010
torn to shit with piss stains all over it.

822
00:50:05,011 --> 00:50:10,011
Mattresses with literal shit on them
and a laundry lists of low of long gross

823
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:16,290
shit. Dude, this is like an expo as
a, and I'm taking this all is fact.

824
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,610
I have no idea if this is true or not.
They will literally sell anything.

825
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,110
I got to the point that when people would
donate things that were really nice,

826
00:50:25,111 --> 00:50:28,490
I would tell them they should keep it
or give it to someone because it would

827
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:29,840
just be thrown away.

828
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,920
But of course the mouth breathing assholes
that would donate trash that they,

829
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,420
that they have to what,

830
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,700
but of course the mouth breeding assholes
that would donate trash that they have

831
00:50:40,701 --> 00:50:43,330
to take. Dude, you're a bit of a
mouth breather here. You're, you're,

832
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,040
you're not speaking in full sentences.
Uh,

833
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:51,041
these people are hoarders that you can't
even open their car door without shit

834
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:53,750
falling all over the fucking place.
Fucking discussing.

835
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,960
The grossest thing that I ever saw gets
sold was either a mattress was shit and

836
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:04,511
piss stains on it or an anti dildo
that had white hair all over it.

837
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:10,470
Ah, come on. Come on. Come on people.
I can't believe this. This, this. I'm,

838
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:13,940
am I getting trolled here? Is this a
millennial? Is he giving me the business?

839
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,081
He says,

840
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:20,000
I know this is going to sound like I
am making myself in this situation.

841
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:25,001
What I know this is going to sound like
I am making myself in this situation.

842
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,980
The good guy,
this is a voice text,

843
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:33,080
but I seriously would look at them and be
like, why the fuck are we selling this?

844
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,420
This is really wrong.
They will respond with,

845
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:38,300
we have to sell everything
to try and make bonus.

846
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,120
The sad thing was we never made bonus.

847
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,270
I got to the point where I wouldn't
price shit because it was garbage.

848
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,630
And my last day I felt like grabbing
a trash bag from the office,

849
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:51,350
go around the building, picking
up trash than tying it, tie it up,

850
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:56,590
slap a dollar on it and write on the bag
mystery bag or some shit like that and

851
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,980
see if anybody would buy it.
But I didn't do, this is all,

852
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:04,640
that was all one sentence
on my last day.

853
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:07,790
I felt like grabbing a trash bag from
the office, go around the building,

854
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,070
picking up trash,
then tie it up,

855
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:15,071
slap a dollar on it and write on the bag
mystery bag or some shit like that and

856
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:20,150
see if someone would buy it.
But I didn't all one sentence.

857
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,680
Thanks bill for the labs and good luck
to you and Neil with the new baby. Um,

858
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,030
yeah, I kind of, I kind of get,

859
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,550
but people just use goodwill because
they want to feel like they're being

860
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:33,200
environmentally conscious. You
know, I'm not throwing this out.

861
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,380
It's going to end up in a landfill or
in the ocean and then you just bring it

862
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:41,270
down there and they just throw it up.
Yeah. Well it didn't take a genius.

863
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:41,971
She come down there,

864
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:45,800
there's a giant fucking 18
wheeler empty just park there now.

865
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:48,980
Like it's dropping off or picking up
shit. It's shit. It's there on its,

866
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,100
on its legs. There's no a tractor
trailer there and you know,

867
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,780
they just come over there like once a day
and just drive that thing away. Where,

868
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:59,510
where's it going? All
right. Drama Queen Dad.

869
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,770
Dear Billy, red nose. First off, I'd
like to say thanks Megan, but thank you.

870
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:05,750
Thank you. I'm a lady. Oh my God.

871
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:09,170
I have a female friend in high school
and lately I've been listening to your

872
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:13,490
podcast whenever I'm stressed out or
just looking for something to laugh at.

873
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,650
Okay.
Now onto the story.

874
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,680
My father is a middle aged man with
bipolar disorder and likes to blame

875
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:25,320
everything on his mental illness
as he calls it. I liked it.

876
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:26,640
You're already taking them to task here.

877
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:29,270
He's going to blame everything
on his mental illness. Yeah.

878
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,550
There's no reason to not do your dishes.
All right. All right. They'll loopy. Um,

879
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,560
he's very dramatic and claims that his
bipolar is the reason he hasn't been able

880
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:38,940
to hold a job lately,

881
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,810
even though he kept the same career for
about 10 years and is now working for a

882
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:44,730
new company by parents are divorced.

883
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,860
So whenever my father can't
have us over to visit,

884
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:50,490
he claims it's because of his
illness. Ah, man. That's the greatest.

885
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,800
That there's nothing like
a fucking builtin excuse.

886
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,330
That's gonna be great when I have a kid
here in a few fucking days, minutes,

887
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:02,130
weeks, whatever, uh, uh, you
know, I'd love to, but my
kid, my kid's a, yeah, I can,

888
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:03,660
I got a kid.
Um,

889
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,160
I don't want to tell them him that
bipolar disorder is not a mental illness

890
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:12,110
because he, he'd go ape shit on me. Um,

891
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,710
is bipolar? I don't know. I thought
it, anytime your brain was fucked up,

892
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:21,240
he had a mental illness. I haven't
met the limitless with my anger. Okay.

893
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,680
Bipolar,

894
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,400
bipolar, is it a disease?

895
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,630
Well, let's see here. Oh, just
give me the fucking answer.

896
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:44,040
Oh, Geez. Is uh,

897
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,810
fuck you.
I'm not reading all this shit.

898
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:46,920
Okay.

899
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,070
This is the Internet. I don't
want to expound. Expounded on,

900
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:54,690
just give me the yes or no. Is there
a yes or no.com? Can you just do that?

901
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,750
You just answer a fiasco. Fucking,
it's like, I don't want to know why.

902
00:54:59,360 --> 00:54:59,820
Yeah.

903
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,050
Is this blah blah blah, yes or
no? And then you have your answer.

904
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,130
So then when you go to the bar and
somebody says something like, no, it is.

905
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,260
Yes it is.
Yes it is.

906
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,530
Did you know that bipolar
disorder develops with during
a person's late teens or

907
00:55:14,531 --> 00:55:16,680
early adult years? Do you know?
I didn't ask that question.

908
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:22,620
Never trust a fucking doctor with
a goatee. Where the fuck is it?

909
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,510
You know? Oh my God. Jesus Christ.

910
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,990
Look at these fucking eggheads.
Y'All got nice full heads of hair though.

911
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:34,910
I've got to give him that.
All right. Anyways, um,

912
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:38,360
I don't want to tell him bipolar disorder
is not a mental illness because he'll

913
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:39,830
go ape shit on me for some reason.

914
00:55:39,831 --> 00:55:42,620
He seems to enjoy making me
and my sister feels like shit.

915
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,940
It makes mountains out of molehills
whenever we correct him or stand up for

916
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:48,740
ourselves when he bullies us.
Yeah.

917
00:55:48,741 --> 00:55:50,360
I don't take any shit for
you sound like an asshole.

918
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,050
What's even worse about this is
that his bullying always works.

919
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:58,400
He's very manipulative and I'm scared
to see him because of the things he said

920
00:55:58,401 --> 00:56:00,940
and done to me in the past.
Every time I'm,

921
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:05,330
I'm informed I'll have to
spend the weekend with him. Um,

922
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:08,300
I nearly piss myself with anxiety.
My question to you is,

923
00:56:08,301 --> 00:56:10,310
how the fuck do you deal
with someone like this?

924
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,520
I know my dad is ridiculous
and uses underhanded tactics,

925
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,470
tactics to make me feel like shit,

926
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,020
but for some reason I'm not
able to just get over it.

927
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,830
None of my friends seem to relate
to being so terrified of one person.

928
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:24,740
Like I am of my father.
I would like to hear your take on things.

929
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:27,950
Thanks for reading this
and go fuck yourself. Um,

930
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,120
all right. How would I get past?
Well, this is the hardest thing to do.

931
00:56:33,121 --> 00:56:38,121
You have to stop giving a shit about the
guy to a certain level at some point.

932
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:41,400
You know, when you, if you
have a parent like this,

933
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:46,430
you have to look at them and remove
mentally that they're a relative and you

934
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:51,660
have to just say to yourself like,
if this person was a complete stranger,

935
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:57,210
would I be friends with this person?
Would I interact with this person?

936
00:56:57,211 --> 00:57:01,980
What I waste another minute,
my fucking life dealing with this person?

937
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,520
You know? And when you got to ask
those questions, usually it's like,

938
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,480
absolutely not. This would have been
a fucking one and done situation.

939
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:12,480
But the thing is, is is your
dad, she can't write them off,

940
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:13,590
but you have to kind of,

941
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,700
that's the toughest thing when you got
to write off a parent but still interact

942
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,940
with them. You just gotta
be like, I don't know.

943
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,600
You kind of have to find the humor in it.
I think that's a tough one,

944
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,430
especially at your age.

945
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,060
MMM.

946
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,640
I Dunno. I would just, I dunno,

947
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,460
I would probably could do some passive
aggressive shit where I would just say,

948
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:39,210
oh yeah, is that how it is? Okay, I'll get
right on that. You know, Shit like that.

949
00:57:39,211 --> 00:57:41,430
I don't know what to tell you.
I would just basically, um,

950
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,103
okay.

951
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,590
I would still like, what is he going
to do other than get mad? He does.

952
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:50,150
It doesn't sound like
he hits you anything.

953
00:57:50,151 --> 00:57:55,151
So he just mad any flips out or whatever
and just I stop who gives a fuck?

954
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,870
That's what he's going to do. The
guy's out of his fucking mind. Right?

955
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:04,040
Maybe he's got bipolar, maybe it doesn't.
Maybe it's a disease. Maybe it isn't all,

956
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:05,090
you know,
they just,

957
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,773
okay,

958
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,350
oh man, this is Tom. This is fun.

959
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:11,810
This is a fucking rough
one because it should dad.

960
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,070
And the last thing you want to do is
then go out in the world and start dating

961
00:58:16,071 --> 00:58:18,410
somebody who then treats
you like ditch that,

962
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,810
the exact fucking thing you don't want.

963
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:24,080
And then you end up with that and then
you have that same nervousness in a

964
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:26,550
fucking relationship. That's all I
can say. You know, you got to do,

965
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,730
you're not going to be
able to fix this guy.

966
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,000
You got to deal with them
because he is your dad. Um,

967
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:37,390
but the big thing that you could do is
in your life is you create a life that

968
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,790
does not involve this.
All right?

969
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:43,120
You need to go out and
go marry a fucking story,

970
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,583
right?

971
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:50,390
And then your fucking house is great and
it's peaceful and it's what you want.

972
00:58:50,391 --> 00:58:55,190
And then every once in a while this
fucking tornado tornado blows through and

973
00:58:55,191 --> 00:59:00,191
you deal with it and then it leaves and
then you go back to your peaceful life.

974
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,750
Um, that's all you can
do. You really, as a kid,

975
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,210
you really can't do anything about
your parents. You can't pick them.

976
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,070
You just get the ones
that you get. But, uh,

977
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:10,280
the thing that you could do is create
a life that does not involve that.

978
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:13,160
And then you don't do that shit to your
kids. And then you break the cycle,

979
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,930
then that's it. You know? But the
weird fucking thing is, is that your,

980
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:20,960
your decks still always going
to be in your life, you know,

981
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,080
so that lunatic will then be around
your kids and it's just, it's a,

982
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:28,520
it's a motherfucker. It really
is. But fortunately they,

983
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:31,400
for the most part, die before
we do. And then, you know,

984
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,990
you don't have to deal with them anymore.

985
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,240
So I guess try to find
the fucking humor in it

986
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,780
while you're dealing with it and then
think of how exciting your life is going

987
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:45,500
to be. Um, by not having
that in it, you know,

988
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,560
you might want to just
Skype with them for awhile.

989
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:55,250
Get yourself in a situation would be
like, why? I think the screen froze hello.

990
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,120
And he just click. Uh,
but that's really a,

991
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:03,800
that's disappointing to hear that an
adult would manipulate a teenager.

992
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:08,330
Forget about his own fucking daughter.
That's sucks. So I don't try that,

993
01:00:08,331 --> 01:00:11,420
but just know that you can go out in the
world and have any life that you want

994
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:15,350
to have, uh, simply
by, you know, you know,

995
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:18,920
he's showing you what you don't want.
All right. There you go. Oh man,

996
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:19,754
that's brutal.

997
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,450
You fuck you fuck up so bad as a parent
that your daughter goes outgoing.

998
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:27,050
I want to marry a man who's the
exact opposite of my own dad. Oof.

999
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,250
That's game set. Match. You fucked up as
a father. All right. Sister's girlfriend,

1000
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,720
dear bill, the red bitch birth. Uh,

1001
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:40,721
my twin sister is a lesbian and
she's dating a lady who was bisexual.

1002
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:44,160
Okay.

1003
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,750
She was bisexual.
And then what,

1004
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,490
then what became totally homosexual and
went back to heterosexuality or it's

1005
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:54,930
just she asexual. At first we
didn't, we weren't close or anything,

1006
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:59,640
but we did get along with your twin
sister, not the bisexual woman. Right.

1007
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:03,930
Then about a year ago, we ran into
each other at a club in the end. Oh,

1008
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:05,400
I know you're talking
about the bisexually.

1009
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:09,150
My sister is a lesbian and she was
dating a lady who was bisexual first.

1010
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:11,660
We weren't close or anything,
but, but we got along. I mean,

1011
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,380
I'm assuming you're talking
about the bisexual lady.

1012
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:18,460
Then about a year ago we ran into each
other and a downtown club. Uh, we,

1013
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:21,360
we had a few draw. Jesus,
we have a few drinks.

1014
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:25,290
Just start talking about random
stuff. Uh, she came back,

1015
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:26,430
she's going to try to fucking,

1016
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,260
she can try to finger bang the whole
family here until a friend of mine invited

1017
01:01:31,261 --> 01:01:34,740
us to a party. At some guy's house.
We went and had a lot more to drink.

1018
01:01:34,741 --> 01:01:39,630
And then one thing led to one.
Now that w what it, what it does,

1019
01:01:39,631 --> 01:01:42,720
anything good ever come out it. And
then, you know, one thing led to another.

1020
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:46,290
That's when you're fast forwarding through
such a piece of shit thing you did or

1021
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:48,690
something you're embarrassed of, hey,
you know, one thing led to another.

1022
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,930
No one ever talks about fucking a hey,

1023
01:01:51,931 --> 01:01:53,970
how did you hit that when
they're winning game shot?

1024
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:58,200
Well the inbounded the ball and uh, one
thing led to another and uh, you know,

1025
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,910
I hit the, I hit the shot
the way the, and chip,

1026
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:05,930
you will tell every fucking detail I was
running down the court with every step.

1027
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:10,370
I can feel my IP. I knew somebody
had to step up, let to do this.

1028
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,650
I'm always going to be me. Right.
That's how you tell it when you fucking,

1029
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,270
when you did some good ship,
he did some bad shit. Yeah.

1030
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,600
One thing led to another and the guy was
on the ground and he wasn't breathing.

1031
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:26,460
So I dunno what happened.
Okay. One thing led to another.

1032
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:29,070
We ended up having sex.
The next day we came,

1033
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:33,060
we came to and both fell the
horrible about what happened.

1034
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:39,000
You both came to, I just
pictured that fucking, you know,

1035
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,960
take my picture.
Smack my bitch up.

1036
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,520
Remember that Madonna was
in the background going on.

1037
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,900
She was saying like the
fucking opening to star Trek.

1038
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,420
The next day we came to in both
felt horribly about what happened.

1039
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:58,350
She then told my sister
that she slept with a man,

1040
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:02,790
but didn't tell her it was
me. Oh, wait, you're a guy.

1041
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,700
I thought this was a lady.

1042
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:08,670
Yeah.

1043
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:13,620
Oh, okay. Okay. I'm bisexual. I
Dunno. All right. Wait a minute.

1044
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:16,170
Wait a minute. All right.
Your twin sister is a lesbian.

1045
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:20,880
She's dating the lady's bisexual, Yada.
Ya. At first we weren't close or anything,

1046
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:25,380
but we got along okay.
And then you ran into her and you fucked.

1047
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,740
You fucked your fucking sisters

1048
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,223
girlfriend.

1049
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,460
No wonder you went with
one thing led to another.

1050
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,620
Then we came to like, you
were both drugged. Oh,

1051
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:45,340
these are classic. You feel
horrible about this, sir.

1052
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,740
Or you don't. And, uh,

1053
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,410
but you want to get away with it so
you're blowing through the details.

1054
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,760
What is very, this is very underwritten
for what the fuck is just gone down here.

1055
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,430
Jesus Christ.
Uh,

1056
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:01,870
she then told my sister that she slept
with a man but didn't tell her it was me.

1057
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:05,350
Dude, this chick is a psycho, uh,

1058
01:04:05,351 --> 01:04:07,570
for the past year I've
been torn up about it.

1059
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,950
I need your unbiased style
of advice. Should I tell my
sister that was me or not?

1060
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:17,320
Thanks. Ps, come to blah, blah, blah. I
would love to see you again. Um, dude,

1061
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,200
no, don't say a few.
Die with that. Secret,

1062
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:25,300
that secret and hope that woman fades
away and then if it should ever comes back

1063
01:04:25,301 --> 01:04:26,134
around,

1064
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:30,340
she said it was you and just be like,

1065
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:35,040
it was the fire.
One time he had got with Drake's.

1066
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,170
Oh,
what they let you went down there?

1067
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:42,100
I wouldn't say a fucking word.

1068
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,160
Don't say a fucking word. Okay.
The fly in the ointment here,

1069
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,130
it's just bisexual lady. Okay.
She's jumping all over the fence.

1070
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:53,300
She's fucking sister. She's fucking
brothers and she's fucking white people.

1071
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:56,060
No Kid.
She's fucking two people that she's,

1072
01:04:56,570 --> 01:05:00,280
she's the flying the fucking
ointment. Okay. She said the shit. Um,

1073
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:03,440
I don't know why she's doing that. This
is like this and she's like Glenn Close,

1074
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,560
um, in, in, in fatal attraction.

1075
01:05:06,561 --> 01:05:10,250
If she fucked both Michael Douglas in
the Hottie who was married to and the

1076
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:15,050
rabbit. Okay. She just fucked this lady.
Just, you know, you just sit tight.

1077
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:20,650
Okay. This is like in a sub and you cut
the engines and you're just hoping that

1078
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:23,260
they're not going to start dropping
depth charges and you just hope you get

1079
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:26,920
through it sometimes in life. You just
shut the fuck up. I, this was one,

1080
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:29,200
I wouldn't say anything.
Okay.

1081
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,900
And if she brings it up, yeah, you
slept with her. I would just, I mean,

1082
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,890
what are you going to do?
This is the thing, you just,

1083
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,440
this lady's out of her fucking mind.

1084
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:44,410
There's no way your sister's
going to end up with her. Okay.

1085
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:45,790
Okay.

1086
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:49,200
There's no way she's going to
end up with her. All right.

1087
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:52,080
This one was out of her fucking mind,
so she's eventually going to fade away.

1088
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:56,760
Uh Oh. You have to do is just hope that
when it comes time for the breakup,

1089
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:00,690
that the crazy bitch is breaking up with
your sister because your sister goes to

1090
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:04,540
break up with her in that highly
emotional moment. She might drop the ball.

1091
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:10,560
Okay. And then you would just, you
just gotta play it. Like she said, what

1092
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:15,700
now had never have cheese,
just you've just breaking up dead.

1093
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:19,820
She said that's why she was saying it
because you broke her and that she walks

1094
01:06:19,821 --> 01:06:21,680
in the room and be like,
oh, I right. I did it

1095
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,670
because one thing led to another.

1096
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,990
All right, Carl, my pants
down a Billy blue lungs.

1097
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,360
I Dunno what that means.

1098
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:38,690
I'm 24 years old and I'm dating a woman
that was 34 years old. Uh, alright.

1099
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:42,150
See fucking and all the lady you're not
dating. Come on. What are you gonna do?

1100
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:46,050
Wow. What were you going
to have your first kid with
her when she's like 96 we've

1101
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:48,870
been dating for close to three
years now and I couldn't be happier.

1102
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:53,430
We recently bought a house.
Oh Geez. You, you're 24,

1103
01:06:53,431 --> 01:06:56,580
you're dating a 34 year old and you
bought a house with her recently bought a

1104
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:58,840
house.
I would be nervous if this was flipped in.

1105
01:06:58,841 --> 01:07:03,000
The guy was 34 and it was a 24 year old.
He's still a wild horse man.

1106
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:05,820
You've got to run out on the range.
Um,

1107
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,960
we recently bought a house and it finally
came time to put down the down payment

1108
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:11,580
on the house and all that extra stuff.

1109
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,360
I'm going to be honest and ego
issues on the down payment.

1110
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,540
She knows my financial status
and she was cool with it,

1111
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,170
but I just wanted to provide more
because she does so much for me.

1112
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:27,180
So I dropped my car insurance without
her knowing to give her the extra money,

1113
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:29,970
even though she said I didn't need to.
I felt like,

1114
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:34,800
what sort of man would I be if I didn't
contribute my part? So my luck has it.

1115
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,640
I got into a car accident literally two
weeks after I dropped my car insurance.

1116
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,120
I'm between a rock and a hard place.
Now we want to start a family,

1117
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,510
but I'm guessing my license
would be suspended for a year.

1118
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,770
A lot of burden will be
put upon her now that I'm,

1119
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,840
I'm assuming my license will be
suspended for some time. Bill, any,

1120
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,780
if you could do me a solid on
this one, that would be great. Ps,

1121
01:07:57,781 --> 01:08:01,710
longtime listener, first
time email. Oh Jesus. What do
you, what are you asking me?

1122
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:06,360
Like, yeah, you're fucked. You
are fucked. I agree with that.

1123
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:12,000
Um, well I, um,

1124
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:15,680
in life sometimes you learn a hard lesson,
sir, and you'll learn in right now.

1125
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:20,150
I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell
you. You with this woman, I mean,

1126
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:26,300
the solution, you, what you learned is
the solution is not doing what you did.

1127
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,010
You don't expose yourself
to that type of a liability.

1128
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,060
He didn't really ask me a question.

1129
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:38,910
Okay.

1130
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:42,060
Uh, all right. So you love this
person. You want to start a family,

1131
01:08:42,061 --> 01:08:46,380
that's all good and you fucked up. Uh, I
would, I guess if you haven't told her,

1132
01:08:46,381 --> 01:08:50,340
I would come clean. Tell her
what you did, why you did it.

1133
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,650
Say you're sorry. And, uh,

1134
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,420
and I don't know what
your, what's your fear? 24.

1135
01:08:56,421 --> 01:09:00,380
And you want to be able to provide,
she's 34 and you're going to get married.

1136
01:09:00,381 --> 01:09:02,840
You're going to start a family. I don't
know. How would you be able to provide,

1137
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:05,930
you've got to get your career going?
I would think so.

1138
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:10,370
That would be my biggest concern once I
find out what the judgment against me is

1139
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:15,350
going to be. But, uh, here's the
deal, dude. She's 34. You're 24.

1140
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,110
She should be making more money than
you should have more money than you.

1141
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:20,960
Her life should be further
down there. You know, uh,

1142
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:24,300
you can't try to catch up
to a 34 year old. All right.

1143
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,720
Cause the only way for you to do
it is to do what you just did.

1144
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,610
And you end up fucking yourself over and
in the long run, you fuck her over too.

1145
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:36,210
So, um, you have to respect the
fact that you're the age you're at,

1146
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,990
you're at. And, uh,

1147
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,590
I would try to figure out what the fuck
I wanted to do with my life and I'm

1148
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:43,790
gonna try and get that career going.

1149
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,390
And I would hope that there would be a
bus close by that I can take to get me to

1150
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,690
that because you're, I think you're going
to get fucked here. Sorry to say that.

1151
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:52,100
But um,
yeah,

1152
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:56,450
my advice would be stop trying
to measure up to a 34 year old,

1153
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,480
just be 24. All right. I
hope that helped you out. Um,

1154
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:07,190
but that's all I got. Sorry. Okay. All
right. That's the podcast for this week.

1155
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:08,930

you want to say there. All right.

1163
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,100
And they'd give me a little bit of
money. All right. That's it. That's it.

1164
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,460
Go fuck yourselves. And I'll
check in on you on a, on Thursday.

1165
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:39,390
Congratulations to USC. Congratulations
to Clemson, Alabama. Oh No,

1166
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:43,670
we're going to see who's going to
fucking win that one. And a NFL playoffs.

1167
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,020
Playoffs are coming. Bruins had a nice
two game win streak over the sabers.

1168
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:52,370
And then we fucking lost yesterday. I
missed that game. Got fucking smoke.

1169
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:55,410
Three to nothing.
But what do we play?

1170
01:10:55,411 --> 01:10:59,310
Played fucking the Carolina Hurricanes.
Um,

1171
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:03,320
that's it. Hey everybody, the holidays
are over. It's a brand new fucking year.

1172
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,960
Don't deal with bipolar people.
All right?

1173
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,430
If you've got to make a left to get
over towards the double line, uh,

1174
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,860
don't liquidate your
fucking insurance. So, uh,

1175
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:16,620
you try to fucking bang a 40 year old.
Uh,

1176
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:23,610
I think that's it. Yeah. And if you
bang your a lesbian sister's girlfriend,

1177
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:27,900
keep your fucking mouth shut. All
right. Talk to you on Thursday.
