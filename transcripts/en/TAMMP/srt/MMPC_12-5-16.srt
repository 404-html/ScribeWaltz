1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,490
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:05,700
It's bill burn his time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,670
December 5th,

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,960
2016 what's going on our why? Yeah. Um,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,750
you doing your holiday shopping? Is
that what you're doing? Oh my God.

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:23,640
What do I get this person? And it's
just not enough time. Slide of bullet.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,550
By the way. Slight Ebola is
still left. Um, yeah. You,

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,650
you guys are in the same
boat as me. Um, you know,

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,010
I handled some of the shit I
needed to handle. Uh, you know,

10
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:37,860
I got to fucking nieces and nephews and
all this shit I got to take care of,

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,330
so I don't know what to do.
You know what I'm going to do?

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm going to go on bill bird.com.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,360
Click on the podcast page and click on
the Amazon link and go straight to Amazon

14
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:50,340
and kicked me a little doe. Rape.
Huh? Oh No. Bill, you shouldn't have.

15
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,330
Hey, don't worry about it. I made a little
bit of fucking cash. She, Sean, this one.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,190
Oh, enjoy your remote control lab. Rookie.

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,540
Um, anyways, uh,

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,890
so I know the podcast is late. I was
going to try to do it last night, but, uh,

19
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:11,390
unfortunately I had to go to a memorial
service for my friend who died. And, uh,

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,460
it was a beautiful,
beautiful ceremony.

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,820
And also one of the saddest things I've
ever seen with these young kids and

22
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:22,350
everything. And, uh, didn't feel
too funny last night, but, um,

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,550
I learned a lot, man. I learned
a lot by going to that service.

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,150
I will tell you that because when they
did the collage of his life in the end of

25
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:32,970
it, um, the,

26
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,880
the photos and the videos and everything,

27
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:40,620
like 99% of it was about him
with his wife and being a dad.

28
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,510
So it made me feel lucky that I'm going
to become a father. Definitely. Because,

29
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,640
uh, I was thinking like, well,
what if I died right now?

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,200
What would the collage looked like for me?

31
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,690
And it would just be a picture of me
and a bunch of different comedy clubs

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,180
making weird faces. Um, obviously the
lovely dia, but you know what I mean?

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,880
I was kind of like a what
me playing drums. Like,

34
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,180
what the fuck did I do to keep,
you know,

35
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,060
not to say that you have
to have a fucking kid.

36
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,130
Cause definitely I think if you
don't have a kid at this point,

37
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,060
if you don't want to,

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,690
that's a great fucking thing considering
all the shit going on with the

39
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:16,440
environment to not just have another
person, just to have a person.

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,280
But um, you know, like
with all of these things,

41
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:23,610
the great thing was I got to see a bunch
of comics that I had not seen in awhile

42
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,901
and uh,

43
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:29,901
I will be seeing a bunch more this
Tuesday night at the laugh factory.

44
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,310
I believe the event is sold out.

45
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,440
So thank you to everybody that
came down and bought tickets.

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,770
I A or however the fuck you kids do
it nowadays. I really appreciate it.

47
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,720
It's going to be a, the money's going
to be going to a is a twin boys.

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,310
But um, anyway, so yeah, so I went, that
was a very, very heavy emotional nights.

49
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,980
So I did not feel remotely
funny cause that was the thing.

50
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,470
Oh typical fucking psycho comic.

51
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm going to go to a memorial service
for friend of mine that I've known for

52
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,950
almost 25 years and then I'll come home.
Then I'll do my podcast after that.

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,410
If you think some of my shit
is bleak and dark. Um, yeah,

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,790
I, I'm glad I did not record last night,
so I had some shit to do this morning.

55
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,860
I'm a little bit late.
Um,

56
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,070
we're editing the season two of f
is for family and all that shit.

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,540
Have I made you laugh yet?

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,320
All I'm doing is telling you what an Arab
laid in my bed and I fucked it. Blah,

59
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,930
blah, blah. You know,
fully clothed by the way,

60
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,150
fully clothed this episode. Um, the NC 17,

61
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,640
Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

62
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:35,290
Monday morning podcast did not do well
in the ratings as far as the feedback.

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,650
You know,
it was something that we hear it.

64
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,670
Monday morning podcast industries decided
was, you know, maybe a different flavor.

65
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:46,270
We could throw the podcast every once in
a while I could just be wearing a robe

66
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:50,980
with nothing underneath it that Nia
could then comment on. And, um, you know,

67
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,050
it was like new coke.
That's what all it would say.

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,850
I'm kidding actually with some of
the funniest fucking photoshops.

69
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,740
I don't know if you guys
saw them on Twitter. Uh,

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,190
this Sharon Stone was fucking f that was,
I don't know how you taught that one.

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,050
That was great. So anyways,
let's, let's talk about life.

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,870
Talk about the world.
Let's talk about uh, hey,

73
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:18,760
congratulations to everybody up there
and the Dakotas that was fighting against

74
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:22,930
the pipeline. Evidently they've been
able at least able to stop it for now.

75
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,210
You know.
Good Lord.

76
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,990
Some of the shit that they would say
in those corporations with doin man,

77
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,170
they were playing for keeps.

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,200
They were saying at nighttime they had
drones and they would come in and they

79
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:36,460
had this pepper spray water mixture.
They was spraying it, the protesters.

80
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,990
Um, that whole thing is so
fucked up cause I was just like,

81
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:45,010
why can't they just go down to home depot
and buy some of those fucking things

82
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,340
that makes the pipe make a 90 degree turn,

83
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,620
go up the street a little bit
and go around the shit. Um,

84
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,150
evidently all the white towns,
the cowboy side,

85
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:57,730
I guess they tried to go through other
people's towns and they were like, yeah,

86
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,290
you're not running that shit through here.

87
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,400
So even the white people didn't want it.
I Dunno.

88
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,730
I guess what I'm saying is I
should have bought a Tesla, um,

89
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,300
until they do the research and what those
fucking batteries do once they finally

90
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,200
take those out.
You know,

91
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,910
I remember Michael Jordan telling me
not to throw out my batteries, you know,

92
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,930
I believe he was standing next to the
children. That's so together. Sneakers,

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,720
there's so much, you know, you can never,

94
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,900
you can never not get mud on your
shoes no matter what you do. Like,

95
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,210
how the fuck do you just like,
no matter what you're doing,

96
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,480
I do this and I'm not hurting
anybody or the planet.

97
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,570
Just the mere fact that
you're fucking here, you know,

98
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,950
somebody is crying in a factory
somewhere, right? Or the inverse,

99
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,430
if you're the kid or the person
working in the sweatshop, right?

100
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,750
You gotta be doing something, you
probably taken it home with you, you know,

101
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,150
coming home,
screaming at your wife.

102
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,510
That's my part of the concrete flat
asleep on right. There's something.

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,410
Who the fuck knows?
Dunno.

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,740
Maybe I'm just an arrogant kind in a
first world country. I have no idea.

105
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,690
But let's talk about Formula
One racing here. Everybody.

106
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,790
Nico Rosberg do diffs
level of fucking drama.

107
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,270
Like ladies, if you ever wanted to get
into a sport, but you just find, you know,

108
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,440
the four major ones in the u s boring or
you're not into soccer or whatever the

109
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:21,530
fuck people watch around the
world. Cricket, you like drama.

110
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,030
You like all of that shit.

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I highly suggest watching formula one
racing this whole Nico Rosberg Lewis

112
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,530
Hamilton thing. Nico Rosberg, right?
He's the, he's the upstart guys.

113
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,270
I said he finally won his
first championship after
being a bridesmaid the last

114
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,510
couple of years.
This is my first year watching it.

115
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:42,230
So I'm sure a lot of this
shit I'll have wrong. Um,

116
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,980
he wins his first championship.
All right?

117
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,610
And then out of fucking nowhere
out of the fucking blue,

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,160
he retired. He just said,
that's it. I'm done.

119
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,320
And somebody tweeted that to me.

120
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:02,321
So I looked it up and I saw that it was
true and the only clip I saw was him

121
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:07,520
just standing there and his wife
was talking the entire fucking time.

122
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,380
So I'm just sitting there looking and
going like, wait a minute, is this guy,

123
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,520
was this her decision? You know, he's
got a kid on the way, just like, God,

124
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:21,770
I Need God. You really have to
drive again this weekend where

125
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,270
I, it's, it's just so silly. I mean,
you know, I drive a car to, you know,

126
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:33,500
I don't have to put a number on it
and drive around s turns. I just,

127
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:37,670
it's just such a male testosterone thing.

128
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,680
You're hurting the environment.
I don't know if he got an a rear,

129
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,180
like the whole fucking Yoko thing,

130
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,750
which people always says Yoko broke
up the Beatles, which I, I don't,

131
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,561
I don't believe that.

132
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:49,820
I think John and Paul kept
bringing their work home,

133
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,010
bitching about one another. And after
awhile, both Linda and Yoko were like,

134
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:59,360
Hey, well why don't you just quit?
I mean, you're not happy. Right?

135
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,410
And then they just threw that out there
and then the, their ego, you know,

136
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,650
like they were calling their bluff.
They couldn't be like, what, but here,

137
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:08,220
what would I do?
I work.

138
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,640
I didn't know if I could write
without him. Right. So they just, the,

139
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,520
they couldn't do that.
So they just fucking,

140
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,980
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. Let's get back to the,

141
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,540
let's get back to the race in here.

142
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,850
So I didn't know if it was that version
and then I read that. What's his face?

143
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,600
That was a Kiki Lotto or
whatever he was trashing.

144
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:34,370
Nico Rosberg said he made them look
silly and stupid and all of that.

145
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,120
And I'm just sitting there, why the
fuck would this guy quit 31 years old.

146
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:40,520
You just won your first one,
now you're going to walk away.

147
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,580
You know what? Why would you do that? And
then I was thinking maybe it's his wife,

148
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:51,410
he's got a kid coming along. He
just wanted, he was very emotional.

149
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,040
He had the come down
afterwards within this,

150
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,150
the little bit of a melancholy slash
depression. And then he like, fuck,

151
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:01,380
now I've got to do this again.

152
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,240
And you've got to climb back up the
mountain again. I don't think it's,

153
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,870
you know what I take?
It is, I think that, um,

154
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,980
Lewis Hamilton was the favorite son.

155
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,010
This is not just total
fucking guests at Mercedes.

156
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,520
He's sick of dealing with that dynamic,
you know,

157
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,960
and he wanted to get out of his fucking
contract and the only way out was to

158
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:28,820
retire. So he might leave for,
I don't know how long, you know,

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,760
and then he'll come back with a
different team. There's no fucking way.

160
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,500
He's not coming back 31 years old. There's
no fucking way he's not coming back.

161
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,940
He's going to take a year off, get
his kid up and running, you know,

162
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:45,620
get the kid to be able to
use the fucking shit. Right.

163
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,340
Mama Dada throttled
break. Right. You get it.

164
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,970
Say a few fucking words and then he's
going to be right back out there again.

165
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,590
You know,

166
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,990
I think he's going to be out there and
he's going to race for a different team.

167
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,010
But here's the thing though.

168
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,750
Okay.

169
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,130
Does Mercedes cars were so fucking good
that all they had to do was just get to

170
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:06,980
the first turn.
We haven't won the first turn right one,

171
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,350
the God damn race it seemed so,
I'm going to guess,

172
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,630
I'm going to guess he's going to go with
the red bull team because that was the

173
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:14,780
only a team that seemed to fucking win
anything this year as far as the shit

174
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,870
that I watched. But uh, Jesus Christ.

175
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:21,740
So Nico's get fucking trashed
people like what the fuck?

176
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,280
Five reasons why you would quit.
Um,

177
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,410
Kiki Rosberg calls him a contra
something leak. A Niki Lauda.

178
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:34,400
Sorry Kiki Nikki Colada.
I'm like combining the names here.

179
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:39,401
Slams Nico Rosberg for making
Mercedes look dumb dude.

180
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:45,011
In that last race with Lewis Hamilton
slowed down because if Nico Rosberg came

181
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:49,710
in fourth place or worse,
Lewis would have won the championship.

182
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:54,140
So he deliberately slow the fuck down
to let the third and fourth place guys

183
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,360
catch up and um,

184
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,920
and then he disobeyed a direct order
from his fucking pit crew. This is,

185
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm telling you,
it's fucking top gun.

186
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,820
Yeah.

187
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,790
You know, you do. Characters
are going to top gun, right?

188
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,480
They tell them to speed up and
Louis is like, Nah, yeah, I'm good.

189
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,220
I can still win this race.

190
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,970
Let's just fucking ad 40 years of
stress to this fucking guy. Maybe he'll,

191
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,880
he'll spin out now when,
and um,

192
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,600
Rosberg's also talked about sometimes
you know when they're out on the track,

193
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,430
he doesn't know how far
Lewis is going to go.

194
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,400
He's going to push me off the track,
but Rosberg's done the same shit.

195
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,690
He did that like twice.

196
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:30,970
He has this fucking move where he
goes into a turn and it's like,

197
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,960
it goes straight for way too long and
then oops at the last second turns away

198
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,020
and drive some guy into the gravel.
Oh Jesus.

199
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,770
You don't know anything
about this sport too. Yeah.

200
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,460
Okay.

201
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,350
I Dunno.
We'll see what the fuck happens,

202
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:48,220
but that's my call I think isn't stay
home for a year with this kid. Right.

203
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,290
He's going to go out of his fucking mind.

204
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,440
As much as he's going
to love his kid much.

205
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,650
He's going to love wife the entire time
that Kenny Loggins song is going to be

206
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,920
going on in the background.
Well, Yay. Well,

207
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,740
but did you,
did you do fucking stopped itself?

208
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,340
Did [inaudible] though

209
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,500
YG being, I mean Bernie. Nah.

210
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,080
Right. Um, what about John at JFK said
and then the guy in the fucking pumps,

211
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:19,790
Eddie said, I am a, I'm an egg
or a cookie or something. Yeah,

212
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,480
it's going to drive them up the fucking
wall and he's going to have to go back

213
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,250
out there again and uh,
you know,

214
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,410
and then I think he's going to drive
for the rest of his fucking career. Um,

215
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,520
that's my guess. All right, so there
you go. There's a whole bunch of shit.

216
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,180
How often you hear a bunch of Formula
One talk on a fucking American podcast,

217
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,610
you know, nothing. I go fuck yourself.
Hey, how about that Patriots Rams Game?

218
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,430
You know, that's tremendous. If
anybody ever had trouble sleeping,

219
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:47,510
that would have been a great game
to fucking watch Jesus Christ.

220
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,040
I actually did.
I actually watched the,

221
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,420
you got to watch the game live with me
on Facebook was something last second.

222
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:56,120
We decided to try and all things comedy.

223
00:12:56,121 --> 00:13:01,070
So thank you for the 1500 people or so
that tuned in and watched me a watch the

224
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,600
game. I'm sure they'll put together
some sort of clips from that.

225
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,463
MMM.

226
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,200
So if you guys like it enough, if it gets
enough hits, I might start doing that.

227
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:13,920
I want to do it for boring fucking
games cause if the game matters,

228
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,430
you're not going to want to listen to
me talking. But patriots first rams,

229
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,510
that's a good one. Right? And all
I do is I just do the first half.

230
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,163
MMM.

231
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,610
So anyways, I might do it with Joe
Bark, nick or somebody like that.

232
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:30,090
Maybe with Paul Versey at some point
we'll figure it out. So anyway,

233
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:33,270
so I have to go to this memorial service.

234
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,700
Okay.

235
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,430
Um, last night I was so proud
of my friend that, you know,

236
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,710
I could really see what a great
husband and father he was.

237
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,860
So I already knew the suit that I was
going to wear because you want to get to

238
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:45,140
my age, you know, it's fucking sucks man.

239
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:49,070
You start losing people and you
have your funeral suit. You know,

240
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,420
for a lot of people that was, I'm going
to a wedding suit and then that big,

241
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:56,660
as you get older that they come. So
I'm going to a funeral. Fucking sucks.

242
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,440
So you remember last year I got into
the best shape of my fucking life and I

243
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:07,010
went to put on the suit that I
fucking bought during that time.

244
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,390
Jesus Christ,

245
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,430
I could barely get the pants down and I
couldn't wear a tie to the event cause I

246
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:17,330
couldn't get the shirt closed and all
I did, I put on like 15 fucking pounds.

247
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
It's like how skinny was I?

248
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,500
And I was just sitting there screaming at
myself in the mirror. My mother, my, uh,

249
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,160
I know my mother always told me when I,
you know, I, she was always like fucking,

250
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,780
I dunno, she was always honest
about not being fat fuck kids,

251
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:36,660
which is hilarious to me because he
wants a fat fuck for a kid, right?

252
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,310
So I'm sitting there screaming at
myself in the mirror, right? And uh,

253
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,600
okay,

254
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,390
my wife is just sitting there fucking
laughing her ass off at me. I,

255
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,040
we'll go look at you. Look,
you're fucking disgusts me. Just,

256
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,460
just completely trashing myself. Cause
that's how I get myself back into shape.

257
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,290
So,
um,

258
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,600
I remember I mentioned last podcast that
I was going to do a half hour cardio

259
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,830
every fucking day this month because I'm
not putting on the pigs in the blanket.

260
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,210
Fucking apple strudel. What's a good
Christmas goes? What are you, yeah,

261
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,150
what do you, what do people have
Chinese food and Jewish people, right?

262
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,770
What's this shit that everybody
fucking eats this month makes you fat?

263
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:22,820
Fuck all of this stuff. The pies,
the cookies, the Christmas party,

264
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,790
the bows, all of that shit. You ended
up putting on all his fucking weight.

265
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,750
Then what happens?
Everybody joins a fucking gym.

266
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,270
Everybody joins the gym in January.
Right? And it's just fucking mobbed.

267
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,590
Right?

268
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,620
And all you gotta do is just hang in there
too about the second week of February

269
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:44,090
and everybody just starts dropping off
like the Bataan death march or some shit.

270
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:47,360
Right.
It was such a fucked up reference.

271
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,510
But I've been watching a lot of world
war two shit probably even said it wrong.

272
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,650
They said baton, like what your
twirl, the Bataan death march.

273
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:59,360
It was a bunch of high school bands that
had to walk to the prom that none of

274
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:03,740
them have dates too. Oh
Wow. And you know what?

275
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:08,630
I don't, but it's funny,
isn't it? Isn't it?

276
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,940
Um, anyways, so you know, it's great.

277
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:14,360
Why don't you beat the
fucking new person to the gym?

278
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,980
Rush on it.

279
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:20,810
You'd do yourself a favor and not
go into the new year, 1520, 30,

280
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,840
40, 50 pounds overweight. Let's
say you're not that dumb number.

281
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,760
What's that first number? Huh?
Unless you're in triple digits. I,

282
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,440
you know, I don't want to fucking
give it to him, but if he,

283
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:33,170
if he got a double digit
figure you're trying to lose,

284
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,610
let's say you're 20 pounds overweight,

285
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,970
why don't you try to get that
to down to a one, you know,

286
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,450
get that 18 down to a fucking nine.

287
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,260
Get that 20 down to a
10 just knock it down.

288
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,060
Run some fucking miles off.
You fucking know domino, right?

289
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,940
C'Mon admitted. Good. Nobody's looking.
Nobody's looking at cubicle. Reached down.

290
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,370
Reach down. Grab, grab a handful.
I look at you. Huh? That's so,

291
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,750
that's what you're going to
do. You're going to add to
that Jesus Christ. Come on.

292
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,700
Say it with me. I'm a fat
cunt, right? Just say it.

293
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,870
One, two, three. I'm
a fat cunt. All right?

294
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,200
Then the first thing you gotta do
is, is, is admitting it to yourself.

295
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,860
Once you've lost control over so many
of those fucking Christmas cookies.

296
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:24,140
But let's be honest,
they don't really taste that good.

297
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,210
A lot of them are bad shortbread with
some shitty frosting and some sprinkles on

298
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:33,680
it, right? You don't need
that shit, right. Half Hour,

299
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,260
half hour every day,
make a Goddamn playlist.

300
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,810
You know what's funny is I've actually,
because I'm so dreading doing cardio,

301
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,290
rather than listening to some
testosterone aggressive shit,

302
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,890
like I actually was
listening to like Paul Simon,

303
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,630
like my cardio thing starts off with
something. So right by Paul Simon,

304
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,470
which were you really listened to that
song? I should look up the fucking knife.

305
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,290
My Internet doesn't work down at the
fucking lyrics are really annoying.

306
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,630
He's like, when something goes
wrong, I'm the first to admit it.

307
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,650
Okay.

308
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,300
I'm the first to Ed made it, but
the last one to know, Whoa, whoa.

309
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,810
Right. So He's already said like, you
know, hey, if there's something wrong,

310
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:20,250
like I'm the first one to admit it.
I just never know what that is.

311
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,930
I don't know if it Yale, fuck
you Paul Simon, you can't.

312
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,010
I hate when people do that. You know
what I mean? They just, they know,

313
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,790
they fucking say that they're an asshole
and then they take no responsibility

314
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,450
for it because, hey man, I, I just
don't, I, it's hard for, for me,

315
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:41,070
it's just like hard for me to tell
when I'm being a total selfish Dosha.

316
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,750
My Paul, you know that. Okay.

317
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,680
Yeah.

318
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,750
If you could do a fucking sound check.
Okay.

319
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,390
And you can hear that the horns
are too far down in the mix.

320
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,900
You can't tell me that you can't be in
a car with somebody else and not hear

321
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:57,080
that you're being a fucking asshole,
you know?

322
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,000
And then the rest of it and
when something goes right, oh,

323
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:06,890
it's like you lose me. It's apt to confuse
me. Like he's just like, oh, I'll, I'll,

324
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:10,940
let's all stop and help Paul Simon,
you know,

325
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,630
that's why he married that Ed per cal,
I'm telling Ya. You know what I mean?

326
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,720
No fucking brought his age was
going to put up with his horse shit.

327
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,790
He had a good, he find some young chick
that was still fucking wide. I, you know,

328
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,930
slightly confused.

329
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,483
We are right.

330
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,790
She didn't know what the fuck she
don't know which way was up. All right.

331
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,340
God Damn oversized sweater walking,
walking around.

332
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,450
He fucking shows up. Like, you know,
I'm even happy if something goes wrong.

333
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:42,930
I'm the first to admit it. But
yeah, I never seem to know.

334
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,190
I'm like the last guy to know Paul,
you're a nice person.

335
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,350
I like see, you know he's
behind her just banging away.

336
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,400
It's fucking to pay. Slap it
off the back of his head. Right.

337
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,790
That's how the whole fucking thing
went down. And in the meantime,

338
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,750
he Brykelle the new Bohemians,
right? That you know, for a pop band.

339
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:08,650
I mean those guys could play great
guitars. State a great fucking drummer.

340
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,143
And what happened?

341
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,530
Vocat Paul Simon comes up with
his hat and hand showing up.

342
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,000
You know Paul Simon got, he got hair
plugs right after. I think Elton John.

343
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,220
Elton John got the original ones. So like,
you know, his head was so scarred up.

344
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,490
That's why when he was real coked up
in the 80s he was wearing like those

345
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:31,240
mannequin wigs because I didn't
know what I'm talking about.

346
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:36,100
I think it was I at the grocery store and
read a few too many uhs magazines. Um,

347
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,063
okay.

348
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,410
And it's all, how the fuck that again.
Oh, we're talking about working out. Okay.

349
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,190
Money had talk about Paul
Simon [inaudible] he's
fucking relationship I think

350
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:50,530
overstepped a few here, especially during
this holiday month. So I apologize.

351
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:56,290
All right. So I start with that.
Then I go into one trick pony.

352
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,980
Then I go 50 ways to to uh,

353
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,000
to leave you alone with
Steve Gadd on drums.

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,600
Um,
oh by the way,

355
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,030
he's coming to town with
the fucking Eric Clapton.

356
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,780
Somebody offered me a fucking ticket in,
I forgot to get back to him.

357
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:17,230
I got to see, I've seen Steve Gadd lied
before, but I never saw Eric Clapton.

358
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,960
But anyways, it goes to that and
then I go on, I listened to a,

359
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,120
what the fuck do I listen to?
A couple of pretenders songs.

360
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,800
Then I get into Aerosmith's first
fucking album and then I'm done.

361
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,980
Right. Just like that. I eased my way,

362
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,750
ease my way, you know,
we start off really easy.

363
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,250
Then I get to mid range and then I just
get to Aerosmith's first fucking one.

364
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,980
That's what I did because
what I was doing before I was,

365
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,600
I was like regretting, like not
regretting, hating doing cardio.

366
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:56,770
And I was starting off with like
fucking iron maiden or Dr feel good.

367
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,430
Do you know what I mean?
Like that's not like if you,

368
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,770
if you just waking up and you
get not a fucking elliptical

369
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,860
tall,
he's got the

370
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,320
just like Jesus, Vince,
Vince for fuck sakes.

371
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,320
Well he's got, at least I could
start with home sweet home Ryan.

372
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,040
He'd know allometry
um,

373
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,900
you know,
I just realized we have company upstairs.

374
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:22,970
Once I put the headphones on it,

375
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:24,420
I don't even fucking
realize I don't give a shit.

376
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,570
So I was listening to that and
like iron maiden, you know,

377
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,370
it's just like creeps you out.

378
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:33,630
Like you fucking getting on an elliptical
half groggy because I gotta go into

379
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:38,220
work and Shit. Right. Starting
your day off. We want information,

380
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,213
information,

381
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,960
information or why are you the new
number two? What was number one?

382
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,180
You are number six, right? How about
Vincent Price? I'll fucking work.

383
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:53,370
He got in the early eighties, man.
He was fucking crushing it, Huh?

384
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,713
Yeah.

385
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,171
Whoa.

386
00:22:56,171 --> 00:23:01,171
Do you earth and sea for the devil sends
the beef was Rad because he knows that

387
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,270
a shot let him a lot understanding
record the number of the beast.

388
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,250
40 is a human number.
It's number is 666.

389
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:14,570
A public [inaudible] right.

390
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,000
He get he and then he was on fucking
Michael Jackson's thriller. Right.

391
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,500
Ah,
fucking crazy laugh in the end.

392
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,670
I can't remember the funk of 40,000 years.

393
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:29,260
I never really listened
to Michael Jackson.

394
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:31,930
Like I was one of those people that have
way to like pretend to be sad when he

395
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:33,760
died.
You know what I mean?

396
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,610
I'm looking at the bed in the mirror,
you know,

397
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,550
more date.

398
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,460
Right. It just never spoke to me.
I like shit when he was a kid.

399
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,750
Oh baby.
Give me more and more chance.

400
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:54,280
I liked right up to off
the wall and somewhere.

401
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,070
Uh, I dunno. I guess I liked some,

402
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,520
I liked some of, uh, like
Billie Jean was okay.

403
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,800
Thriller I thought was stupid.
You know, you know what actually,

404
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:10,830
thrillers in stupid, you know what it
is. It's fucking, whenever it comes on,

405
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,320
everybody has to start
doing the thriller dance.

406
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,680
And they always start with the same
thing where it's the claws up in the air.

407
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:21,000
I need this side. Always, always,

408
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,830
always somebody doing a fucking
Michael Jackson impression. You know,

409
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,990
you know what's
interesting about that guy?

410
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:30,630
As great as he was the Balsam
beat to critique this man is like,

411
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:31,650
he was one of those guys,

412
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:36,651
he had the sickest fucking dance moves
and then he just stopped and he kept with

413
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:42,330
the loafers and he kept doing the leg
thing and he kept grabbing his dick and

414
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:45,630
then everybody kind of
caught up and went past him.

415
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:49,020
Even though he was still always the
greatest dancer of all time. He, she was,

416
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,160
it was like he was doing the Charleston,
his whole, his whole fucking life.

417
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:56,910
Bad Gat though. It comes
the Moonwalk, right?

418
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,860
Somebody can't even remotely
fucking debts. Um, oh,

419
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,700
the fucking balls I've shown on
this podcast. Oh, let's keep going.

420
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,950
What other fucking legend can we,
can we trashed next? Um, yeah,

421
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:14,740
I never got into a, I never
get them. Like when there was,

422
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,910
it was always like prince versus
Michael Jackson. Like to me it was,

423
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:21,510
it was always print.
It wasn't even close.

424
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,130
And um,

425
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,673
I don't know.

426
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,600
Prince is funny because it's bad.

427
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:32,550
Songs always sound like songs that Molly
Ringwald would have danced around too

428
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:33,940
in like 16 candles.

429
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,480
Okay.

430
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,830
Like he's got a couple of those.
We just like Jesus.

431
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,290
I guess everybody's got those right.
And if he has one of those jeans belt,

432
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:47,300
can you trash any more
dead geniuses? Yeah, I can.

433
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,590
Let's go.
Let's start talking.

434
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,710
Let's talk about Mark Twain
in fucking Albert Einstein.

435
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,650
Is it me or did they both
have this same fucking,

436
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,850
what was it about being
a genius back then or,

437
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,290
or someone who was changing the way
people were thinking that you just,

438
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:08,010
you had to have that fucking,
that same fucking do.

439
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,910
It was Sammy the Sammy
Hagar and Van Halen.

440
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:16,860
Fucking do except it was white.
Right? Mark Twain had it,

441
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,000
uh, fucking, uh, Albert Einstein had it.

442
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,900
Frederick Douglass had that
with that fucking itchy beard.

443
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,180
Everybody had that when, when you
fucking are just too goddamn smart.

444
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,270
You know what I mean?
Like shit in and out.

445
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,330
You just got too much shit to think about.

446
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,750
There's something about that hairdo
that just, it's just the perfect thing.

447
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,090
I bet he looks back. I was like, why?
Why did I cut my hair like that was,

448
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,470
you know what their haircut he
got was like when he was younger,

449
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,640
when he had the longer hair.

450
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:51,960
That's like the chick you marry and then
like after she has a couple of kids and

451
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:53,940
she just,
I just don't want to deal with it anymore.

452
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:57,150
He got like literally got that
fucking haircut, you know,

453
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,400
just short of are you said that you,
you know,

454
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,460
are you moving towards an
alternative lifestyle here?

455
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,360
It's like what is going on with that
thing? That was just a bad fucking period.

456
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,980
Huh?
They were wearing those,

457
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:14,940
those peach fucking
flashdance fucking overalls.

458
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,230
Um,
I dunno.

459
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,880
All right.
Sammy Hagar.

460
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,080
I think Sammy Hagar would have been
better if he didn't join van Halen. Oh,

461
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:28,890
I'm going after. I'm fucking, I'm
talking about everybody this week.

462
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:29,850
I don't know what I'm doing here.

463
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,850
I think I'm going for fucking
a reality show right now.

464
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,620
Heavy that song heavy
metal by Sammy Hagar.

465
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,060
I liked that better. And you watch
him performing with his own fucking,

466
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,830
I'm gonna fucking tweet that.
Uh,

467
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,210
yeah.

468
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,210
I'm going to tweet that fucking video
of this week. You know what I mean?

469
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:51,450
You tell me that. Anything he did
van Halen, not trashing van Halen,

470
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,040
cause I fucking love those guys.
But I'm just saying Sam,

471
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,480
he should've jumped in there. He should
have kept going. He was on a path.

472
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,820
The man could not drive 50

473
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,710
bye. All right. Tall is

474
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,140
heavy metal, right? It was fucking great.

475
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,330
I don't know what happened
then all of a sudden,

476
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,110
right? I don't know what happened. I
fucking voices cracking. All right.

477
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,590
I think I've trashed enough
people that are way, way,

478
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:26,070
way more talented than I'll ever be.
So now it's time.

479
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,720
Now it's time to say goodbye
to all you fucking counties.

480
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,510
I gotta I gotta read a little
bit of advertising. Oh,

481
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,130
and there's a lot to owe a lot this week.

482
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,800
Everybody piling on trying
to get your holiday money,

483
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,080
trying to get that holiday
money. Oh, look who's back.

484
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,010
Look who's back. Always nosing
around during the holidays, right?

485
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,280
Oh, see, oh, Sherry's berries. Oh,

486
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:54,750
these things are fucking delicious.
No matter who you're shopping for.

487
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:59,100
Sherry's berries, it's the one stop
shop for everyone on your list.

488
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,870
No matter who you're shopping for.
Shammies be. Aries is the one stop shop.

489
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,950
I read that twice.

490
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,570
You don't have to battle the crowds
to get the perfect gift shop with

491
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:14,310
convenience right from
your home. Christmas. Um,

492
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,490
and it says example, only one week
away. Now I have to do the math.

493
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:20,040
Christmas is only 20 days away,
man.

494
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,490
So that's uh, it's only also, I already
did the day she cuts. All right,

495
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:30,570
what do you want to hear? Okay, it's,
it's three weeks and four days away.

496
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:34,680
That's 25 days left to shop.
Rapid. Deliver your gifts.

497
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:37,920
Choose a gift from Sherry's berries,
incredible collection of gifts,

498
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,060
and go ahead and skip the crowds
and the hassle altogether.

499
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,950
Who the fuck it somebody? Chocolate
strawberries for Christmas. The,

500
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,570
don't get these for your wife unless
you've got a nice fucking backup,

501
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,180
unless you put that on the hood of
a fucking Toyota class at that. Um,

502
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,620
why I picked that one. I don't know. Um,

503
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,250
this is the perfect gift for someone that
you have to acknowledge that you're in

504
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:04,330
your life, but you didn't have time to
shop for them or spend any fucking money.

505
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:09,070
Let's get down to brass tacks or this
is a great Acouto mom for a really great

506
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:14,050
gift. Okay? And it's fucking easily as
easy as hell. What are Sherry's berries?

507
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,430
They're freshly dipped strawberries
from Sherry's Barry started just 1999.

508
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,280
That's over 30% sits
around a fucking drinks.

509
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,720
Unless you're in a shit hole
that's over 30% savings.

510
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:28,720
So double the berries for just $10 more.
You can double up 30 bucks,

511
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,050
get twice as many berries.

512
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:33,090
They still haven't told me how
many fucking Barry's again,

513
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,480
you just need my code to
take advantage of this deal.

514
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,840
Can I get Barry Manilow to sing in
the background for Sherry's berries?

515
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,270
I eat strawberries there.

516
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:47,110
Make the whole world sing
descriptive words for berries. Okay.

517
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,190
Evidently I'm supposed to use these words.
These strawberries are decadent, fresh,

518
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:55,460
juicy, sweet. I hate that word. Decadent.
It's always used by dumb people.

519
00:30:55,461 --> 00:31:00,461
Do is describe something you know is a
decadent like fucking something that's

520
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:05,260
like ornate. Another word I never fucking
use. They really use decking into disc.

521
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,680
Oh, have you tried these
chocolate covered pretzels?

522
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,380
Now they any good? Any
good dude? That decadent.

523
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,740
All right, there you go.
That's your challenge.

524
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:20,980
This weekend I want you to go to
a dive bar and I want you to you,

525
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,360
I want you to describe something as
decadent to a fucking bar flight with no

526
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:29,500
family to go home to this holidays and
I just want to please take a picture of

527
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,270
the look on the guy's
face. All right. She was,

528
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:35,620
Barry's dipped and tempting white milk
and dark chocolate. Goodness y'all.

529
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:39,220
Why the white come before the
docs on top with chocolate chips,

530
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:43,480
decorative swizzles and chopped nuts.
Any incredible unique gift that's perfect.

531
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,230
Oh, and incredible. Unique gifts. That's
perfect for sharing. Yati Yati do it.

532
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:49,810
I don't have time to read all this shit.

Thousands of people seeking home
security get ripped off every day.

591
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,710
And uh,

592
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,060
and the home security industry wants you
to believe it's your only option, man.

593
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,170
They got who?

594
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,560
Woods of salesmen out there trying to
scare the fuck out of you into signing one

595
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:16,050
of those longterm contracts.
You don't need that shit.

596
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,040

601
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,460
they could have been somebody at company.
They didn't say who said it,

602
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:41,910
they just put quotes around it.
A security professionals watching,

603
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:45,540

You know what I mean? They get to look
in, they get their little hard on,

608
00:35:56,641 --> 00:36:00,450
they rub it out into their fucking
awful fucking security guard pants,

609
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,970
but they're also making sure that
no one comes in the house. Right?

610
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,740
Would that work? I Dunno.

of the questions here for this week.

616
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,280
Hey did you guys see over in
England there? They got the fucking,

617
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,160
they got some shit that we would
even make snow and go, God damn,

618
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,150
I didn't even think of that.

619
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,710
They got some snooping thing over there
where they're just going to everybody.

620
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,200
Anything you do on your phone or on
the internet or anything like that,

621
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,220
any of that shit,
they can just look at it.

622
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,050
Okay?

623
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,340
It's fucking unbelievable.

624
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:50,790
Okay?

625
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,460
It's unbelievable how
presidential election goes by.

626
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,030
They never talk about any of that shit.
Why the fuck do you think that is? Oh,

627
00:36:57,031 --> 00:37:01,770
fucking Obama by he was in office when
all that Snowden Shit went through the

628
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:05,520
big fucking liberal. All you pussies
who cried when Hillary didn't get in.

629
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:07,800
You see what the fuck
happened when Obama was in?

630
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,230
Okay?

631
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,290
Bunch of baby stuff. So
disappointed. Anyways, let's,

632
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:16,050
let's read some fucking shit here.
Here we go. Advice on the future.

633
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:20,580
Dear Bill Murphy, first of all, congrats
on the kid. Knew Special Yada Yada.

634
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:24,810
Thank you. I'm an 18 year old guy out of
high school and need, need career advice.

635
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,160
I graduated with honors. Good for you.
Straight A's. Jesus and all that crap.

636
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:33,360
But I currently don't attend college
and I'm working some shit job in a pasta

637
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:37,990
factory. Sounds like you're burned
out on the academics there. Um,

638
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,821
these,
oh,

639
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:43,821
he said this is because what I really
want to do is sing parentheses classical

640
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:47,850
shit,
take piano lessons and be happy.

641
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,320
My dream isn't to be famous or anything,
but I love music and want to pursue it.

642
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:57,300
Problem is, I have zero background, can't
sing, can't play anything. Literally zero.

643
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,710
There's a great place nearby where I,

644
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:04,850
I live that gives vocal and piano lessons
and all I want to do is start training

645
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:06,090
my voice and start playing.

646
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,060
But I feel like there's no point
because I have no experience.

647
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,570
Jesus Christ. Do you know what
it is? You one of these people,

648
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:16,170
you get straight A's, you an
overachiever and you're so goddamn smart.

649
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,150
Every time you come up with the option.

650
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,020
You know when the f the
normal level of fear comes up,

651
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,880
smarties like you can come up with like
rather than just 10 reasons not to do it,

652
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:28,860
you'll come up with a thousand and you're,
you're,

653
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,030
you're paralyzed right now
is what's going on. He said,

654
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,710
I spent my free, you're
only 18 years old, dude.

655
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,550
You know, nobody has any experience so
they till they start experiencing it,

656
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,850
you're already being way too hard on
yourself. He goes, all right. He goes,

657
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:50,050
I spend my free time listening to
countless covers of the same song watching

658
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:54,040
videos on vocal exercises and
fantasizing about being a singer one day.

659
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,900
I feel I can really do it sometimes, but
other times I feel like not even trying.

660
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,670
Yeah, I do. Yeah. That's a okay.

661
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,430
Dead first emotion where you
feel like trying to do it.

662
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,760
You need to listen to that.
That second one that talks you out of it.

663
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,610
You need to stop listening to that voice.
You need to out loud.

664
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:15,070
Tell that voice to shut the fuck up.
That's what I did.

665
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,810
I literally would talking to the, you
got to beat the fuck out of that voice.

666
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,720
That one that goes Nah. Yeah. Yeah.
But when it does happen, you know,

667
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:28,780
nobody's going to like me sit down
and shut the fuck up. All right.

668
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,430
I don't need you on this one.

669
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,820
I need you when I'm thinking about doing
heroin then I need you to go in like

670
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,340
millennia. If you get it kicked in and you
die, you make everybody cry. Yeah, yeah.

671
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,950
Then I'll listen to you.
But not when you're going after a dream.

672
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,850
You don't listen to any of that negative
shit cause you'll talk yourself out of

673
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:49,550
it. Um, anyways, I know you always
preach about following your dream bone.

674
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,320
It actually comes to doing it. It's
very scary. Of course it is. However,

675
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,750
I don't want to be 40 years old and think,
man,

676
00:39:55,751 --> 00:40:00,040
what if my 99 year old aunt always tells
me to do what I want and forget about

677
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:03,220
money, but my parents say
that I need a real job. Well,

678
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:07,410
who has more life experience? You're 99
year old aunt and what is she saying? Huh?

679
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,550
Your parents that too close to you,

680
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,640
you know they're worried you're going
to be homeless and all that shit.

681
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:13,540
So they're always going to say,

682
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:17,790
just get a fucking job so you can have
enough money to put a roof over your head

683
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,030
and eat a sandwich. That's,
that's all they're thinking
of. Nobody dreams of that.

684
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,260
Nobody dreams about just having a roof
over their head and eating a sandwich.

685
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,430
Unless you're, I don't know, unless you
live in some fucking squalor. Right.

686
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,680
But even then after awhile I want
you have the roof over your head,

687
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,120
then you're going to at some
point be like, I want to do
something right. I Dunno.

688
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,240
Anyways,
I've been in between for a year.

689
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,300
I've been in between for
a year now and need help.

690
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,660
I don't want to get massively in debt
for something I don't really want.

691
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,520
That is so fucking smart.

692
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,880
All these poor kids coming
out of fucking college,

693
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,640
hundreds of thousands of dollars
in debt at this fucking point,

694
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,160
or at least the high
10 thousands you know,

695
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,140
that's what you love being
a fucking moron. You know?

696
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:01,210
Cause then you go to community
college doesn't cost shit.

697
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,950
You work at Dunkin donuts,

698
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,370
throw a couple of coffees of people and
all of a sudden you've got money for

699
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:07,740
your next semester.
Um,

700
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,130
maybe pursuing music will open doors to
majoring in music in the future. I Dunno.

701
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:17,320
What should I do? You Pale bitch a
PS. Give Cleo a head scratch for me.

702
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,060
Pimples are awesome. Um, and he says
Asian need advice from bill birth. Oh,

703
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:26,490
that's the next person. Is that
it? Oh, all right. Yeah. You know,

704
00:41:26,491 --> 00:41:29,080
it's fucked up. I was going
to say, Oh, you're Asian dude,

705
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:32,980
you're going to crush the piano. It's
one of those stereotypes that I guess is,

706
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,170
but it's like positive racism.
You know what I mean?

707
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,750
Don't take up the cello. You'll be
playing for you fucking major cities.

708
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:45,440
Philharmonic. All right.
This is what I would do.

709
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,110
I would just start taking lessons
immediately. I would sign up immediately.

710
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:55,940
I would not listen to the rest of this
podcast. Hit Stop, walk over to the phone,

711
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,140
call the number and get a lesson as
soon as you can go to the lesson.

712
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,510
Okay. And then keep going and,
and just see what that feels like.

713
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,030
Don't stop after one. It'd be like, well,

714
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,710
we would do one and I can't even play
chubs to get, fuck this. Fuck that voice.

715
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,610
Keep going.
All right.

716
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,760
Just say I'm going to stick with
this for three months. All right?

717
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:21,590
That's the big thing
with, with, with anything.

718
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,250
You got to stick with it for three
months in really work at it. Working out,

719
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,970
learning an instrument,
learning a language. God knows
I always end up quitting.

720
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,290
I can't even get fucking a
hundred days together. Um,

721
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,510
just stick with it and see how
you feel after three months.

722
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,660
If you feel like this isn't for me, you're
not going to have that. Well, what if,

723
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:45,710
what if? Bullshit because
you tried it so this isn't,

724
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,920
you're not making a decision that's
going to affect the rest of your life.

725
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:53,570
Don't look at it like that.
You just looking at the next three months,

726
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,820
the next three months are going to happen.

727
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:00,710
Do you want to after 90 days
still be sitting there going,

728
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,750
I have no experience.
I don't know what to do.

729
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,470
Working in a pasta place and you want to
be in this fucking pasta place and you

730
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:10,000
know how to play a couple of songs,
dude, you be fucking excited man. If you,

731
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,470
if you actually,
if this is what you really want to do,

732
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,060
you'll be at work thinking about it.

733
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,720
Can't wait to get home and
play the fucking piano or or,

734
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,100
or try my singing some songs, so
whatever. And then once you get that,

735
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:26,990
then that gets in your DNA and when you
have stuff to look forward to in life,

736
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,270
all of a sudden shit that
you don't look forward to,

737
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,860
you start looking at it like, why
the fuck am I doing this? This sucks,

738
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,200
you know,
I don't want to do this.

739
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:39,500
And then that gets you out of that and
you start going down a path of what the

740
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:40,550
fuck you want to do.

741
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:46,280
Then the other side of that is then your
whole fucking life is nothing but fun

742
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:49,400
shit. Then when you actually have to
do shit that you don't want to do,

743
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:52,970
like go down to the fucking DMV and
find the title for your Goddamn Prius,

744
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,720
right then you can be a big fucking
baby about it. So there, there,

745
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:59,120
there's always a price to pay. But
do, that's what I would do. I would,

746
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:03,350
I would stop listening right now and
sign up for those lessons and go in there

747
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,950
and just tell your teacher said, this
is something I've always wanted to do.

748
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,270
I'm just nervous about it.

749
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:12,230
Just fucking just say what you said to
me and they'll be like, hi. All right,

750
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,860
well let's, let's get you on that
dude. You'd be fucking playing piano.

751
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,170
That's how easy it is to
make a change in your life.

752
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:23,330
Just fucking pick up the phone,

753
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:27,860
say what you want to do and then when
it's time you show up and you do it and

754
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:29,090
then you're doing it.
You know,

755
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,370
you just got to get around all
those mental blocks. So, uh,

756
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,520
I hope you listen to me man,
cause you're only 18 years old,

757
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:38,850
so it's not like you're
50, 60. And even then,

758
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:41,880
I would still tell you to do it because
who gives a fuck whether you get

759
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,690
anywhere with it. But if you want to
do that, you know, you should do it.

760
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,110
All right. That's it for that. Okay.

761
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,320
Asian needs advice from bill bar.
Bill,

762
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:56,730
I love your podcast and your
really awesome, um, Asian male, uh,

763
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,540
Chinese with squinty fucking eyes and
can't drive for shit, dude. You know,

764
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:05,220
kind of shit on yourself. Um,
anyways, I need your advice.

765
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:10,050
I came to America, I guess I always
do. I'm a fall pasty con. Um, anyways,

766
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:14,100
I need your advice. I came to America
a year ago and I really love tall,

767
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,850
slim Irish German girls with red hair.
Jesus Christ.

768
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:21,780
I just miss, I just Miss B
and you're fucking dreamboat.

769
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:26,550
I think they're beautiful. Well, I'm,
I told him a blonde is beautiful too.

770
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,420
Never seen such beauty where I'm from.
Holy Moly.

771
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:35,370
The problem is I'm not like tall and
confident like white guys and I live in

772
00:45:35,371 --> 00:45:39,870
Texas. Jesus Christ. Dude, this is a
fucking reality show waiting to happen.

773
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:45,540
I tried to ask this redhead at the gym
out and she won't take me seriously.

774
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,171
All right.

775
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:51,171
Time the fuck out dude hat off to
you for the fucking balls you got.

776
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,850
You came here from China. You've
learned the fucking language, right?

777
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,660
You're in Texas, you're at the
gym, you're talking Shit, right.

778
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,790
Gives a fuck. He went up to the plate.
He didn't get on base. Who gives a shit?

779
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,630
Talk to another redhead,
talk to a blonde,

780
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:10,380
talk to whatever the fuck you
want to keep talking to him.

781
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,880
So what do I need to do
to date a redhead now?

782
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:17,760
Jesus Christ or anything?
Cause I'm a red head.

783
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,070
Like I know like there's some
secret fucking handshake.

784
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,570
He said they want me to be their agent
friend, but I really want to marry him,

785
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:28,110
Bang them and have cute kids.
This is driving me nuts. I mean,

786
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:29,580
am I going against nature?

787
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,840
Is an Asian guy dating white girls
frowned upon and not accepted in America?

788
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,770
Thanks in advance. I don't really cuss
that much and don't mean to offend you,

789
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:43,140
but uh, wanting to talk and
act like you, Jimmy Chow out.

790
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,580
Um, yeah. Uh, okay.

791
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:50,200
Is his Asian guys dating?
White guys found upon it?

792
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:53,520
Like everything is frowned upon in every
fucking country. Generally speaking,

793
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:57,150
people are afraid of anything
fucking knew who gives a shit.

794
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,780
Literally like that guy before me
who said he wanted to play piano,

795
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,950
if he told somebody he wanted
to do that, you know? Um,

796
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,620
I think initially people be encouraging
or whatever. They'll always be,

797
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,470
there's always gonna be people
telling you not to do shit.

798
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,600
Is this what you want to do sir? Yes.
Then I would go out and do it. All right.

799
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,710
So it sounds like to me from
your email that you've, uh,

800
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,720
you know, I dunno. It's like, it's like
you just got into the majors. Okay.

801
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:26,940
It's the first week you haven't
gotten your first hit yet.

802
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,980
What are you going to do?
You're just going to quit baseball.

803
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,010
Go back down to the minors. Fuck
that. Keep, I would keep talking.

804
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,200
Every time you hit on a woman, you get
better at it. All right. And I would just,

805
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:41,470
uh, I would just continue, like,
you're doing everything you need to do.

806
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:46,360
You go into the gym, you're staying in
shape and you're talking shit. I mean,

807
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:50,380
I don't, I don't, I don't see anything
wrong with your game plan other than,

808
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:55,750
you know, it hasn't happened for you
yet. And um, this is something, uh,

809
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,170
okay.

810
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:59,870
You know it's going to take a minute.
You know,

811
00:47:59,871 --> 00:48:02,930
if you can just walk up and talk to some
chickens, a gym, and get laid, I mean,

812
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:04,670
then everybody would be fucking doing it.

813
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:10,190
The reason why most people don't do it
is because they know that 99.9% of the

814
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:13,520
time you're going to get
the fucking Heisman, aZ , z.

815
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:18,410
This is my elliptical over here. The GGR
elliptical over there. Right? Fuck off.

816
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,180
Right?
And for all the women there going like,

817
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:24,710
can you just like not hit on us at
the gym? Can you just fucking, Nah,

818
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,250
can I just have this fucking place?
Hey, they make gyms for that.

819
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,580
They make the all ladies fucking gems.
All right,

820
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,600
the fuck you going to go?
They're working out looking good.

821
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:40,010
And then you're upset that a guy's
coming up and hitting on you someday.

822
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:44,750
Ladies some days they're not going to want
to talk to you. Take it from somebody.

823
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,050
Okay. Who the women, they don't
even, they don't even like,

824
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,810
you don't even like register.
Like I'm, I'm like, I'm a fuck.

825
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,673
I'm a sir.

826
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,980
I became a sir or mister like fucking
15 years ago and it's all fun.

827
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,180
All right.
Okay.

828
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,410
Boyfriend's obsessed with video games and
I know somebody just sent me an email.

829
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,530
Who is fucking Nigga talking about
some borderline sexual [inaudible].

830
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,940
Obviously that's not
what I'm talking about.

831
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,380
I'm just talking about a little playful
flirtation of someone who wants to fuck

832
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:18,380
you.
Boyfriend's obsessed with video games.

833
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,980
How far into this podcast am I?
All right.

834
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,560
This one was going to
be a little bit shorter.

835
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,390
I usually go a little
over an hour, but, uh,

836
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,800
that's what I'm going to
have to stop today because a,

837
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:32,240
I get to go into fucking
why gotta go to work. Um,

838
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,540
boyfriend's obsessed with video games,
a buffalo bill.

839
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:40,580
I love your podcast and I'm a huge fan.
My boyfriend and I love both.

840
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:44,450
Love to listen to your rants about
whatever bullshit comes to mind. Uh,

841
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:48,740
I myself have add and can find myself
rambling about something completely

842
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:52,520
different than whatever it was I
started to ramble about. Anyway.

843
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:56,210
My boyfriend has always been a huge fan
of video games and he can play them all

844
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,590
day if he could.
Uh,

845
00:49:57,591 --> 00:50:01,910
more recently he has been obsessed with
one game in particular for the last

846
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:05,030
eight plus months and has really
put a strain on our relationship.

847
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,770
He will turn on is x block from the
second he gets home until about four hours

848
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:13,070
before he has worked the next morning.
Jesus.

849
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,930
So we pretty much spend no time together
and let some it unless it's me watching

850
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:21,950
him play with his friends. He talks
to his friends while he plays online,

851
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,310
in which case even if I
do say something to him,

852
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:27,500
he either doesn't hear me or just me.

853
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:31,820
I've tried talking to him about it and
he refuses to change or compromise.

854
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,230
It's even started to
affect our sex life by,

855
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,610
I imagine it would because
he has no time for sexy time.

856
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,920
We were both still young
and in our late twenties.

857
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:44,090
And I hate that I'm practically begging
him to turn off the game so we can cut

858
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:45,350
noodle in the sheets.

859
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,030
I've been contemplating just breaking
off our relationship of five plus years

860
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:53,360
because it's been this way for
months and it has only gotten worse.

861
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:56,870
I'd love to hear what the
y's Nia has to say as well.

862
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,370
Thanks for all the good laughs and
congratulations on both of use on the new

863
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:05,840
baby birth. Thank you. Um,
unfortunately Nias not here.

864
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:10,370
Let me see if I can get
her, hold on one sec. Okay.

865
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,980
She's on her way down. Um,
I would say first of all,

866
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:15,080
you've been together for five plus years.

867
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:16,960
Yeah.

868
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,140
Uh, initially my first thought when you
were doing this is what I would do if, if,

869
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,850
what would get make me pay attention is
I would just start going out with your

870
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:30,680
friends and just start wearing fucking
sexy outfits and shit and he'll get the

871
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:32,030
message immediately.

872
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:37,280
If you walk out the door looking good
and he's sitting there fucking playing

873
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:41,660
video games and stuff and he, if he
doesn't get that hint, then yeah,

874
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,560
you gotta be thinking like,
what the eff this guy,

875
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,990
this guy is more interested
in this shit that they,

876
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,280
what I'm doing over here with my fucking
Christmas leggings going out to a

877
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:55,870
Christmas party dress like a fucking
hot piece ash over here. That's,

878
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,480
that's what the fuck I would do. You've
already tried to talk to him. Um,

879
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:00,320
I gotta be honest with you.

880
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,780
I understand people becoming
obsessed with video games.

881
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,780
It's why I don't play them.
But to me this, I, I'm a,

882
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,920
I'm a bit of a cut when it comes to video
games. To me they'd say child activity,

883
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,420
you know what I mean? It's like,
what is this person working towards?

884
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,380
What do they have for a fucking job that
come home from their job and they just

885
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:21,710
play a video game for the
whole fucking rest of the day.

886
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:26,570
It does not sound like a driven man.
Um, that's another fucking red flag.

887
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,040
Um, so that's what I would, I
would just start building a life.

888
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,980
Initially I would start building a life
without him to see if he notices and

889
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:40,610
maybe you guys can get back to where
you were or if he doesn't notice,

890
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:43,730
then you already have a head start on
getting the fuck away from this guy.

891
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,510
So the lovely knee is here. I'm going to
hit pause and let her read this email.

892
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,330
Um, or I want you, if you just want to,

893
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:54,480
you can just read this while
I continue to ramble here. Uh,

894
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:59,480
it starts right here. My boyfriend's been
a fan of the video games, Yadda, Yadda,

895
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:04,030
Yadda and all that shit. So that's, that's
basically, uh, that's what I was doing.

896
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,180
As I mentioned a long time ago,

897
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:10,181
the last video game that I played was
grand theft auto three and it literally

898
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,880
consumed my life.
I would be walking

899
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,890
to the comedy clubs,
getting on a bus,

900
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:20,330
and I would be thinking about
the game when I wasn't even a,

901
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,960
I wasn't even at home. I'd be waiting
to go on stage thinking about,

902
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,070
you know, I'll finish this
set and I'll go home and I'll,

903
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,470
I'll use the cheats and I'll just go
on a fucking rampage and all that shit.

904
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,760
And it just kind of took over my life.
So here's the lovely Nia with her advice.

905
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,073
Oh

906
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,690
mmm.

907
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:45,040
First of all, can I just say that
this problem really sucks and um,

908
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:49,710
it's really annoying and that you're both
in your 20s and he's like addicted to

909
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:52,230
playing video games.
I'm sorry,

910
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,580
but that's a lame ass and you
need to move on. Seriously.

911
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,240
Five years,
five plus years.

912
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,990
It's been this way for a month
and it's only gotten worse. Yeah.

913
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,100
And you said you tried to talk to him
about it and he refuses to change or

914
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:12,490
compromise? Well it's just, yeah.
And he obviously has priorities her,

915
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:14,670
this video game.
I don't know if he,

916
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:18,990
is there something else going on and your
relationship or did he have some kind

917
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:19,824
of,

918
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:20,770
okay.

919
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,400
Something bad happened recently that he
doesn't want to deal with or something.

920
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,280
And that's why he's so
consumed by the video games.

921
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,400
Cause I'm just trying to think
like what normal healthy,

922
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:34,630
happy person and just all of a sudden
don't want to bang. It's broad. Yeah.

923
00:54:34,631 --> 00:54:36,670
And hands over his live to a video game.

924
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:41,560
Like I feel like something happens and
he's not able to like well you talked to

925
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:43,750
quietly. Okay. Cause it's sticking to them

926
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,860
my face like well cause you do this,
he started talking.

927
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,530
All we all be hand that people can't
hear you. Oh okay. I'm going the levels.

928
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,910
All right, I'm so sorry. That's all right.

929
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,060
Um, yeah I I would not
necessarily say let's listen,

930
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:00,350
it's the video games or May,

931
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,250
but you can just say something
along those lines of like, listen,

932
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:07,100
I feel like I'm not a
priority in your life.

933
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:10,100
And if that's the case then we really
need to talk about this relationship

934
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:14,540
because if you're not into it and then
just let me go so I can find somebody who

935
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:18,330
was into me and it's going to pay
attention to me and not their x box.

936
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,210
This is what I was saying she should do.

937
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:24,110
She should just fucking dress like a whore
and go out that night and it just see

938
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:26,630
if he notices like just to
have like fucking, you know,

939
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,660
fucking STI highs on and all that shit.
If he doesn't get it then by highest.

940
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:35,480
Yeah, just dress like a
fucking whore. Their stockings,

941
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:39,950
they go up to your thighs and then they
stop and there's this glorious little

942
00:55:39,951 --> 00:55:41,750
fucking hands of leg.

943
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:46,310
You're so old that you feel like women
are calling out and like thigh high.

944
00:55:46,311 --> 00:55:51,110
It's like they're like saloon
mistresses like on Westworld. Why?

945
00:55:51,111 --> 00:55:53,930
Cause I came of age in the
18 hundreds why you ain't?

946
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:56,540
Why you acting like you guys don't
always whore it up every fucking holiday.

947
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,930
You'll hoard up on your birthday,
your hoard up on Halloween.

948
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:04,790
You'll hoard up on Christmas. Sex it
up. It's called being sexy sex in it up.

949
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:10,040
Send it up. Lamb on the fucking
bladder. That's what you guys do.

950
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,090
It's different to be titties out.
Clam peeking out from it.

951
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,680
No, cause I don't know. I don't believe
in that passive aggressive shit.

952
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,700
It's just like, listen, why the fuck are
you answer this or not because if not,

953
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:26,320
then I need to move on. The thing is
though, honey, he has made his choice.

954
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:31,090
That's what I think that you don't
necessarily want to fully admit to.

955
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,500
He's made his choice.

956
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,340
He's more interested in the video game
for whatever reason he won't talk about

957
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:39,280
it. He won't compromise.
He's made his choice.

958
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:42,790
Maybe he's not into the
relationship anymore.

959
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,740
Is that a possibility?

960
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:48,910
Is it a possibility that he
or she needs to or it up?

961
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,320
She's saying she's like trying and she
was trying to like beg him to even have

962
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:57,640
sex,
which is ridiculous.

963
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,410
It could be that he is just not ended
the relationship anymore and he's such a

964
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:07,411
fucking pussy ass pussy that he's
waiting for you to be the one to dump him

965
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:12,730
because a lot of people do that. A
pussy ass bus, I don't even know.

966
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,530
But you know,
some people are,

967
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:18,520
they don't want to be the bad guy or
they're just immature and cowardly.

968
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,990
So they don't want to say,
listen,

969
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:22,750
I think we should break up because they
feel guilty because it's been five plus

970
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:23,230
years.

971
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:28,180
So they do shit like this to like make
you be the one to break up with them

972
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:32,350
because they're cowards. You know what I
mean? So it is possible. So in conclusion,

973
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:35,320
what are you saying? I'd
say dump his ass. Bye.

974
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,830
There you go. It's all right.
See you there. All right. Yeah.

975
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,520
You want to listen to me read
out loud. Oh God. I know.

976
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:49,070
Hilarious is a fucking baby.
Realizes that I'm not good at reading.

977
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,790
What age do you think they're
going to be fucking turnaround?

978
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,180
Kind of look up at me like mom doesn't
sound like this and you'll be good at

979
00:57:56,181 --> 00:58:00,830
reading like children's stories,
right?

980
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:05,660
I walked into that one. All right,
here's some adult advertising. Ladies.

981
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:09,110
It's the holiday season. And you know
what that means. It's time to horror.

982
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,240
Kidding. MVMT watches movement. We get it.

983
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,590
Holiday shopping can be tough.
I don't like to sell.

984
00:58:16,591 --> 00:58:20,450
We get it like I'm already bitching,
I'm not, or I think it's the readers.

985
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:25,460
We can't it. Holiday shopping
can be tough. It's more sympathy.

986
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,110
It's not hostility,

987
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,720
which that's your default
emotion is hostility.

988
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,230
This is more of a we, yeah, we understand.
Okay. Any excuse to trash bill.

989
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:39,560
I see how it works now. I played
the victim just like Paul Simon was.

990
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:44,560
Something goes wrong. I'm the first to
admit it because the last one didn't know.

991
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:49,490
Oh Paul, let's work on
your problems. Paulie.

992
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,030
Paulie, what do you got going on there?
There was hair plugs. Is that a wig?

993
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:58,430
Is that a comb over movement watches
all that give gift giving anxiety can

994
00:58:58,971 --> 00:59:00,440
disappear with the press of a button.

shampoo and body wash called the wanderer.
Well,

1017
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:20,000
I'm the type of guy who
likes to wash his nuts.

1018
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:25,230
The fragrances are unlike anything
on the market. Is that mango? Yeah.

1019
01:00:25,231 --> 01:00:30,110
Suck it. There's subtle and actually
smell like real natural ingredients.

There are a lot of body washes out there

What does a teenager smell like? Hope. Um,

1022
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,050

Cedar Wood Bodywash is amazing and makes
you smell incredible meant in a cedar

1024
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:51,470
wood. That's like it dropped ice
cream and like a fucking sauna.

Why don't you sit on those little cedar
wood things are before the naked Asian

guy comes in.
That American Asian,

Is it meant and Cedar Wood like
they're two different fragrances.

1037
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:40,240
That's right.
It is Cedar Wood and Cedar Wa.

1038
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:43,140
It was like peanut butter and Jelly.
Just to be clear,

1039
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,370
one sentence meant in one sentence,
Cedar Wood.

1040
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:51,630
I thought it was like peanut butter
and jelly or Turks and Caicos. Yes.

1041
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:56,340
Building know that Turks and Caicos was
an actual place that was the worst name

1042
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:56,820
ever.

1043
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,820
He said Turks and Caicos as if you can
believe Turks or can't goes but not Turks

1044
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:08,511
and it's the word and that you have and
