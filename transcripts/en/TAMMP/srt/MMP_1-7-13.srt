1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,190
Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:08,850
January 7th,
2013 the first Monday.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,260
Have a wonderful new year. We're
in our, we're in our teens.

4
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:18,210
Everybody in this century.
Has Anybody said basically what the uh,

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,330
this decade is called, by
the way, is this the teens?

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,820
I guess you can officially say that,
right?

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,180
I mean they say that about the 19
hundreds, right? They say that. Well,

8
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:31,830
it was the roaring twenties. They always
blow off the first tooth, the arts,

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,090
the teams, the 30s to forties
out of fucking though. Anyways,

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,250
yeah, I can believe this shit.
I'm sitting here, right? Wake up.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,810
I don't have anything to talk about
today. Um, so I was like, I know,

12
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,890
I know what I'll do. I'll go check out
the fucking egg heads over@ted.com.

13
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,140
See what the fuck they are
up to and what do I see?

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,570
This is why we're going to be extinct
quicker than global warming or click

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,640
quicker than anything else
you could ever come up with.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,050
One of the things right on the front
page is this guy, Hayden Perry,

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,240
and you know what he's
talking about everybody,

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,190
he's talking about reengineering
mosquitoes to fight disease.

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,510
How can these people be so smart and
so fucking stupid all at the same time?

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,840
Did you really think that you're just
going to reengineer like I don't know what

21
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:28,321
they're going to do.

22
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,770
Like take the old engine
out and put something better
in there that works for us.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,130
The guy starts it off, of
course is always with, you know,

24
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:39,660
something really ominous. He's
like, and forgive my awful whatever,

25
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,910
British accent here,
but he comes out and he's just like,

26
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,260
today we're going to talk about,

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,473
okay,

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,200
the most dangerous animal
on the planet for humans.

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,700
Now most of you probably think that
that's Togare. Maybe it's a lie,

30
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,270
and I'm actually talking
about the mosquito.

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,470
The mosquito has killed more people than
plagues war aids and he goes on this

32
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,620
whole fucking thing.
Okay?

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,610
And he's going on and on about how
mosquitoes have killed a bunch of fucking

34
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,130
people, you know, throughout
the course of history,

35
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,680
which if you fucking think about it
is it's really not that mind blowing.

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
You know, plagues come and
go, wars begin and end,

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,440
but mosquitoes,
they never quit every fucking day.

38
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,020
Their bite and people,
you know what I mean?

39
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,210
They liked that dude that
always goes to the gym.

40
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,970
He doesn't take six months off and eating
fucking moon pies and then come back

41
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:43,350
with this big doughy stomach like me,
the fucking mosquito.

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,790
Okay.

43
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,410
Is relentless. All right? So then he's
just sitting there going, now you know,

44
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,430
the mosquito,

45
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,100
it only travels only 200 yards and its
entire fucking life and blah, blah, blah,

46
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:58,230
blah, blah. But basically it
lays eggs and shit, you know,

47
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,540
water and that type of crap. And
then, you know, we're assholes.

48
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,970
We go all over the fucking world and
we've got the eggs with us and exceed all

49
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:08,971
the mosquitoes are all over the fucking
planet as they should be biting people,

50
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,500
killing people,
giving us some fucking elbow room.

51
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,940
This fucking jackass in his
fucking egg head friends.

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,160
Once a re-engineer,

53
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:24,780
one of the few things that is keeping
the human population just vaguely in

54
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,070
check,
which it isn't.

55
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,870
We're up to 7 billion people in this
fucking asshole wants to reengineer

56
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,810
mosquitoes to fight disease
rather than to spread it.

57
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,830
Do you understand how fucked up this guy
is? Like it's like a form of terrorism.

58
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,730
I don't know. I know you
guys sick. I'm a moron,

59
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:50,090
but like there's a reason
why mosquitoes kill people.

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,080
You know there's a reason.
There's a reason.

61
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:57,470
Everything kind of kills everybody
into it. He keeps it balanced.

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,180
This fucking jerk off.

63
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,780
Do you really think you just going to
rewire these fucking mosquitoes and then

64
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:05,110
that's going to, that's not going
to have a domino effect thing.

65
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,843
Okay.

66
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,440
You know what it's like.
Listen to these fucking guys.

67
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:14,000
It's like listening to some
weekend warrior who decides
he's going to rewire his

68
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:15,560
house and you know,

69
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:18,920
within three years he's going to fucking
burn it down because he doesn't have,

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,310
he's, he's not a licensed electrician.
That's what these guys are.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,220
Okay. This is so fucking smart.
They're going to reengineer a mosquito,

72
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,410
but like how, how's that going to
affect the fucking God give me up.

73
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,480
Giving me an animal, a bird. I don't
fucking, it's going to affect something.

74
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,420
I'm so in over my head over this, but
I know I'm right. I know I'm right.

75
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:44,110
You can't just, you can't just, if
you fucking re-engineer that thing

76
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,330
to help us, okay. It won't,
not now it can't kill us.

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,760
Let's talk about this.
This uh,

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,410
the fuck did he call it Dang gay disease
[inaudible] disease or some shit that

79
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:01,240
evidently is killing a bunch of people.
First Time you get it,

80
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:04,090
you feel like you have a fever and you
could actually have the feeling like your

81
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:07,780
bones are going to break the ECC,
call it breakbone fever and a,

82
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,220
you develop like antibodies,

83
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,770
but there's three strains and then when
you get the next one, I mean it just,

84
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,040
it's, it's like a horror
movie, but a necessary one.

85
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,413
You know,

86
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,050
these fucking nerds every
think that there's a reason

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,500
that mosquitoes kill people.
That's what I,

88
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,150
I love about nature is it all makes sense.
You know,

89
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,320
if you just remove your emotions from it
and you just look at the whole thing is

90
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:41,730
like, uh, I dunno like a math problem. No,

91
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,170
G Asia, right? Where where
we have you got way too much.

92
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,870
It's like you'd be open the cupboard,
you know what I mean?

93
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,430
You'd get half like fucking

94
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,530
like one fig Newton and then
7 billion pounds of flour.

95
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,800
I think that they should not,
not re-engineered.

96
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,820
They just let the fucking mosquitoes
kill people. And if you get killed,

97
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,800
I'm sorry, you know, but you're dead.
It's over. You're out of the way.

98
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,140
And we continue on and his
apples for everybody, you know,

99
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,970
we're already growing salmon and dishes.

100
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:19,960
Manmade fucking salmon were literally
fucking with the food supply,

101
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,030
another form of terrorism. So he just
comes in and poisons the food supply.

102
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,680
You know, if you have like
a fucking mask on, you know,

103
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:33,070
in some sort of a bath towel on you,
on your head or whatever,

104
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:35,140
then it's all, yeah, it's a
terrorist, that's a terrorist.

105
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,940
But if you've got a fucking lab coat on,

106
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,090
okay?

107
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,810
You know, you putting all these pesticides
in there and that type item. Fuck it.

108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,980
I'm on, I'm on. I'm on my
soapbox is sweet people.

109
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,300
Yeah.

110
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,660
Standing up on that box. Letting
everybody here. My ignorance.

111
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,370
Hayden Perry,
if for some reason,

112
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,900
I don't know why you felt like being dumb
this week and you're listening to this

113
00:06:58,901 --> 00:06:59,441
podcast,

114
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:03,010
can you please not [inaudible] can you
and your friends please not reengineer

115
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:06,030
mosquitoes? Can you just let
them do their fucking yeah

116
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,090
job yet.
Oh,

117
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,040
why don't you do the world a favor and
stick your head in a mosquito nests.

118
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,770
Why don't you fucking do that?
This is like mad scientist shit.

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,490
ted.com is the scariest fucking website
out there. These fucking assholes,

120
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,121
you know,

121
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:27,080
on the reengineering
mosquitoes and they're building
robots that know everything

122
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,570
that can run like Barry
Sanders, you know, and like,

123
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,740
like that's not going to be a bad thing.
Hayden Perry.

124
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,273
Okay.

125
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,090
You know what is his heart is in
the right place. He sees death,

126
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,190
he sees suffering, he sees pain
and he wants to fucking stop it.

127
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,153
All right?

128
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,670
Because what he's doing is he's chasing

129
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,000
the myth of a utopia.

130
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,950
The myth of Utopia is that
if you lived in a utopia,

131
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,820
everybody would be happy all the time
and nothing bad would ever happen.

132
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,520
And that's just not the case
because of the emotion of boredom.

133
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,700
If everything was awesome
all the fucking time,

134
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,720
you would go out of your fucking mind
because every day would be the exact same.

135
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,030
It would just be awesome. Hey, it's
lunch time. You have a Turkey sandwich.

136
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,670
Isn't this the greatest Dirk?
He said, yeah, it's every day.

137
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:29,260
It's the greatest fucking sandwich ever.
Every fucking day.

138
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,720
Exhausted with happiness.
It would be exhausting.

139
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,873
You know what I mean?

140
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,830
You gotta have people getting
bit by mosquitoes dying.

141
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,390
If that doesn't happen, you can't
enjoy the Superbowl at the same level.

142
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,183
You know what I mean?

143
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,420
You can't enjoy just sitting there
having a Turkey sandwich cause you can't,

144
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:55,950
you don't have the thing to be like, well
at least you know I a Turkey Sandwich,

145
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,240
the meat's a little dry.
But Hey,

146
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,020
at least I didn't get beat bit by
fucking mosquito and die, you know,

147
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,090
laid face down in a puddle.
Eggs.

148
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,830
Yeah.

149
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,770
Do you eliminate all of
that? I mean, I don't, well,

150
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,190
what did what he's supposed to fucking do.

151
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,910
Yeah.

152
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,140
There's all these, these, all these,

153
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,070
there's all these myths that if we
just did this, people would get along.

154
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,490
If we just did that, people get
along. I don't think we would.

155
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,320
I think boredom.

156
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,870
Boredom is at the basis of, of, I
don't know that that's what drives us.

157
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,070
I Dunno. We just want to do something
else. Can Be in competitive and all it is.

158
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,090
You wouldn't get rid of that.

159
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,200
Just imagine that if you
lived in a fucking utopia,
everybody had the best car.

160
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,800
Everybody drives a fucking
Bentley. Everybody's got
the greatest fucking stereo.

161
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:49,540
Everybody's got up Victoria secret
fucking model. Everybody's got, you know,

162
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't an infinity pool.
Everybody's got it.

163
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,740
Okay. Now that if he could just snap
your fingers and make that happen,

164
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,980
that would be probably the most insane
five days straight party the world has

165
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,314
ever seen.

166
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,100
Yeah.

167
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,890
But after five fucking days you,
you'd get, you'd get sick of it.

168
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,333
I think you would.

169
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,910
Nobody ever stubs their toe. There'll
be ever falls down. You just, you know,

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,033
I don't know.

171
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,520
Re-Engineering fucker mosquitoes.

172
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,740
Okay.

173
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Do you know I saw a transvestite do a
fucking face plant this week and it coming

174
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,520
out of a doughnut shop.

175
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,960
First of all, in La there's
doughnut shops. I swear to God,

176
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,950
there's like 19 chains of, of,
of doughnut shops out here.

177
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,700
They're on like every other block.
I don't get it.

178
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,200
Everybody out here that I know is in
this business and you're trying to stay

179
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:56,400
remotely and shaped so you,
you limit your fucking Twitter bashing.

180
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,190
Although the,
the level that you get bashed on Twitter.

181
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,990
I Dunno who's eaten all
the fucking donors who, um,

182
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,220
but they were everywhere.

183
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,963
So

184
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,010
I'm fucking cutting down. Uh, oh
man. I was on, I was on Fountain Nav.

185
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,990
I really shouldn't give the straight up,
but fountain have is,

186
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:21,610
is the one for you tourists out here when
you want to go east to west or west to

187
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:25,630
east and it's during rush hour. Don't
take, don't take fucking sunset.

188
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:28,120
Don't take Santa Monica. Take
Fountain. It's right in the middle,

189
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,980
but I'm one of those strips there.
There's this place, uh, yum,

190
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:37,130
yum donuts I believe is what it's called.
Or is that Santa Maria?

191
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:37,964
I can't remember.

192
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,280
Okay.

193
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,400
So anyways, so fucking doughnut shop
and they got this stupid little like,

194
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,680
okay,

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,690
you don't like those j you don't
like to put like Paul's down.

196
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,310
And then they tie a chain to it,

197
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,480
those little things and kind of droops
down and goes over to this fucking dude

198
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:52,260
woman.
Right.

199
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,950
Was stepping over it and it had a thing
of donuts and just fell down on the

200
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:00,320
ground.
Now normally I would laugh.

201
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,170
The guy in a dress fell face first
with a fucking handful of donuts.

202
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:06,351
I mean,

203
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:10,490
that's pretty much you're going right
down the checklist of a home run when it

204
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:14,420
comes to comedy. But the
dude fell, so a femininely,

205
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,640
I felt bad. The gentleman
in me was like, oh,

206
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:22,070
that lady guy,
the lady just fell.

207
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,370
And the way the dude put his hand up,
it was just,

208
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,260
it ended up just being really sad.
You know, but I, I pride myself.

209
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:31,850
I'll pat myself on the back here,

210
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,010
me and my ego that I resisted
the urge of taking out my phone,

211
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,230
phone and filming it. You know, I
don't, I don't like that shit. Now,

212
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:42,050
how every fucking moment becomes this.
Uh,

213
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,600
I don't know what to call it.

214
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,580
I don't like how a humiliation never ends.
Now,

215
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,740
you know,
these poor kids coming up,

216
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:55,070
it's just like somebody gets kicked in
the balls that get shot with a fucking BB

217
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,400
gun in his dick.
Somebody films it.

218
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,680
O m g epic failed Dick BB fucking video
and then it's just on the internet

219
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:06,980
forever.
And the guy's 35 years old.

220
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:09,680
He's got a drinking problem
and he's looking at this girl.

221
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:12,050
He feels sparks for the
first time in years.

222
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,440
He goes to talk to her and right as things
that go and good, somebody yells at,

223
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:19,180
hey, did that fucking epic
fail Dick BB Guy? Yay.

224
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,000
He's like, oh my God. Is
that you? I remember that.

225
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,550
Okay.

226
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,580
Then a chunk of your helmet get
taken off. What the fuck? Right?

227
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,540
It just never know. Humiliation,
humiliation never ends. Never fucking has,

228
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,970
I don't even know what I'm
talking about this week.

229
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,260
Okay.

230
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,720
Does it matter?
I don't think it matters this week.

231
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,340
Cause Hayden Perry is going to reinjure
mosquitoes to fight disease. Okay?

232
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,980
You're going to rewire them and you're
going to rewire everything else on the

233
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:47,860
fucking planet.
So it's all compatible.

234
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,960
Are you just going to
fuck with that Hayden?

235
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,213
[inaudible]

236
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,270
I don't get it. You know
what it is? This guy,

237
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I don't even think he fucking believes
in it. He is, he, I bet corporate owned,

238
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,250
he's corporate owned.
This is what they're gonna do.

239
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,060
They're gonna own the
re-engineered mosquitoes. Okay.

240
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,470
And then when they bite you, they make
you stronger. And uh, then they also,

241
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,080
they go out and they choke out
all the other bits. Mosquitoes.

242
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,760
But you can only get them from them.

243
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,690
And then what they do on the backside is
they make the regular ones that aren't

244
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,840
re-engineered. They re-injured near them
to make them even more lethal. Alright?

245
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,640
Cause that way either the
way mosquitoes reproduce,

246
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,540
it's just like this Endress
and everybody's going to
want to buy your mosquitoes.

247
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,973
You know,

248
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,660
and I'll be this endless supply and an
endless demand for the supply that you

249
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,220
could just fucking there.
They're like rabbits,

250
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,553
right?

251
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,310
It's a salt.
Makes sense to me.

252
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,000
The fuck my 15 minutes and Jesus
is getting deep this week. Um, all

253
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,370
still a little advertising
here and they'll tell you
about story about a rabbit.

254
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,200
I think it's going to be all animals
this week. Um, the fuck is it?

255
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,860
[inaudible] all right.
Um,

256
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,640
stamps.com everybody a one great
resolution you can make for this new year.

257
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,360
Maximize every minute and every
dollar for your small business.

258
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,970
I know an easy way to
do that with stamps.com.

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,560
Think about how much time you've wasted.

260
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:21,070
Go into the post office or how much
money you've wasted leasing and expensive

261
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:24,550
postage meter a stamps.com is the,

262
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,240
is the better way to get postage.
Just use what you already have,

263
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:32,380
your own computer and your printer to
buy and print official US postage for any

264
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:36,280
letter or package with
stamps.com everything you
would do at the post office you

265
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:37,570
can do right from your own desk.

266
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,350
And at a fraction of the
cost of a postage meter. Um,

267
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:46,010
I've used stamps.com for the last, I
dunno, when did I start reading these?

268
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,830
About a year ago,
about a year ago,

269
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,950
I sent all my DVDs out to the clubs.
It's phenomenal.

270
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,340
I used to have to go down to the post
office or go to one of those mailboxes

271
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,210
cetera. Standing there with
these two big stupid boxes.

272
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,050
Actually three wondering if I
was going to come home with one,

273
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:07,460
trying to do the math, standing
in line behind some lady, right?

274
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,230
I don't have to do that anymore. I just
grab a box, bing, bang, boom. Put It on,

275
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,700
put it on the scale and I'm done.

281
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,940
birth. All right, back to the podcast. So
last night I'm doing this standup show.

282
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,540
I'm doing a show where I stand up and um,

283
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,030
you know, I'm trying to find
a parking spot and I do,

284
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,350
I'm going to take to through every like
minute fucking painful detail of this.

285
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,750
You know,
I put it in reverse.

286
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:57,180
I look in the camera and I realize
I'm a little bit in the red,

287
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,680
so I pull it up a little bit,

288
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:02,340
but then there's a Mustang in front of
me and old one looks like a 67 or 68.

289
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:05,670
And I'm like, wow, I want this guy
to feel like I don't respect his car.

290
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,840
So I backed up a little bit more realizing
that I'm mostly in the unpainted area,

291
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,550
so I guess legally I'm okay.

292
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,590
So then I decided to get out
the driver's side door. Okay.

293
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:20,370
I lead with my left leg rather than
swinging my right over. I'm sorry.

294
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,700
I get out of the fucking car
and I'm walking up the street.

295
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,300
You don't trying to think what I'm going
to talk about when I go on stage and I

296
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,310
look over and there's this fucking
rabbit sitting outside this apartment,

297
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,960
a rabbit. And this isn't a wild
rabbit. This is a domesticated rabbit.

298
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,620
What do I know?
Because it's not afraid of me.

299
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,830
It's just sitting there looking at me
like, you know, hey, what's going on?

300
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Like it's just chilling on the porch
and it's fat to fat fucking rabbit.

301
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,850
Like, you know, it's eating human food
rather than, uh, the held rabbits eat.

302
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,460
What are these eight carrots?
Least the cartoon wants to do the carrots,

303
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,720
carrots in the wild
lettuce grass.

304
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,640
I don't know what the fuck they eat.
Squirrels.

305
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,060
I bet they'll find that out
one day that they actually,

306
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,860
every once in a while eat
squirrels. Like, you know,

307
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:17,190
for the longest time when they thought
like chimpanzees were vegetarians and

308
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:20,910
then they found out that every once in a
while they go on a hunt and they kill a

309
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:25,140
monkey fucking chimpanzees. I hate him.

310
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,020
I hate those motherfuckers.
Okay,

311
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,760
fuck mosquitoes or you bite me and I
get a fever and I get a rash and I feel

312
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:36,690
like my bones are going to break. And then
I, you know, I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hot,

313
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,220
I'm dead. It's over. All right.

314
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,900
I would much rather have that than
to have some fucking roided out.

315
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Fireplug jump on me. Rip My face off,
pulled my nuts off and twist my foot off.

316
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,640
I would much rather, even though
I'm going to bleed out quicker,

317
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,750
they're going through the hell of the
Denki death. Whatever the fuck it is.

318
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:58,050
I would rather go through that.
Oh my God.

319
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:01,140
Those fucking creepy long chimp fingers.

320
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,780
Okay.

321
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,480
You know,
fucking grab and right under your chin,

322
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,290
like you're some mass wrestler and
he's going to reveal your identity.

323
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,410
Just fucking rip shit.
God damn face back.

324
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,390
Oh my God. Oh Shit. I forgot this.

325
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,490
I forgot this. I got to look
this up right now. You know what?

326
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,370
I was in New Mexico recently,
um,

327
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:35,120
visiting a high school friend and uh,
hang on a second.

328
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,350
The fuck was her name and I was in this,

329
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,770
okay.

330
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,760
This restaurant.

331
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,400
Okay.

332
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,990
What is it?
Bronco boozer.

333
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,090
I can't remember a fucking name.
God dammit. Bill, you stank.

334
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,350
I'm in this Italian restaurant, right?
And they've got all these fucking, uh,

335
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,570
there it is.
Gina Bronco Boozer.

336
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,170
So they've got all these Italians
on the wall, like the old ones.

337
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,950
You've always heard Frank Sinatra and
all the old Tito point day, you know,

338
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,850
all the big Italian Theda plant.
He's Latino. I don't give a fuck. Um,

339
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,030
all the classic ones you've heard of.
Um,

340
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,580
it was a girl there was
staring at the other girl.

341
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,670
She was trying to be the hot whore and
then the other girls whore tits were

342
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:24,790
hanging out even more. And she's
giving them a Seigel Sophia Loren.

343
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:26,800
Yeah.

344
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,490
So feel a rant, you know, all these
Italians, right. Beautiful people. Right.

345
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,690
And then they just had
some, uh, uh, obscure ones.

346
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,260
Yeah.

347
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,030
So I see one,
and it's,

348
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,580
it's this woman in tight inner her knee,

349
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,130
her name is Gina Bronco,
a boozer.

350
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,960
And I start reading the story

351
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,340
and basically she was a female wrestler,

352
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,330
hugely fucking popular.
And uh,

353
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,350
her big thing was how she got into
wrestling. She was like five foot five,

354
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:07,000
like 210 pounds. Okay, we're
talking fourth and goal here.

355
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,280
Low Center of gravity.

356
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,810
She puts that show Ironhead
Heyward with the pussy. Okay.

357
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,230
It's disgusting, but
it's true. So anyways,

358
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,030
her big claim to fame was that she choked
a fucking cow to death with the thighs.

359
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,950
Now to me that just sounds like
some Vaudeville likes step right up.

360
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,730
Step right up. So you know
what, back to jump that,

361
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,840
that with the ties and you've got to buy.

362
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,260
But one minute we will give you this
Advil or whatever the fuck you one back

363
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:40,210
then. Um, but anyways, that was
her claim to fame to get into, uh,

364
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,230
into wrestling.

365
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,460
So she went around barnstorming around
the country and she won all these matches.

366
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:48,100
If she became hugely popular,
big time fan favorite,

367
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,760
and she would do all these
benefits for charity and whatnot.

368
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,880
So one day, this is how little
we knew about animals back then,

369
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,910
they decide to raise money for charity
that they would have Gino Bronco Booza

370
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,150
wrestle in,

371
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:10,720
old baboons from the zoo
to old toothless backbone.

372
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,120
If this didn't have its teeth. And if
you haven't seen anything on baboons,

373
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,980
like baboons,
have teeth like a fucking lion.

374
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,620
There were ever one Jaan.

375
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,020
You can just stop staring at their
rainbow book club ass and just look at it.

376
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,900
It's fucking teeth. I mean,
this thing could literally
bite your fucking head off,

377
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:36,280
but the Babel was old and it didn't
have any teeth. What could go wrong?

378
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,250
So they bring the fucking baboons down.

379
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,720
I don't know if that had little silk
wardrobe or we're in a robe like fucking

380
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,410
Greg the Hammer Valentine. Who knows?
I don't know what had happened.

381
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:50,530
Maybe it had his monkey hair all
fucking slicked back and died. Platinum.

382
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,000
I Dunno what, what? It's gonna but
gene is going to wrestle this sinks.

383
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:55,750
A gene is already in the fucking ring.

384
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,180
This whole stories is on
the wall at the restaurant.

385
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,290
I can't believe I didn't take a picture
of it because it's really very little

386
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,050
about this on the Internet.
So

387
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,380
she's fucking waiting.
They'd take a banana.

388
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:13,000
They put her on the stool in the rink.
Okay. Now the month, the baboons,

389
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,730
old toothless baboons in the ring with
this gene of Bronco Boozer Bouz A,

390
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,480
if you're trying to look it up and I
don't know what happened. She starts,

391
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:26,110
I don't know, made some sort of aggressive
move towards the fucking baboons.

392
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:31,060
The baboons jumps on her and just snaps
her neck and she's dead within the first

393
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:36,060
fucking five seconds of the match.
And the promoter was like, Oh hey god,

394
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:40,960
he freak it out saying
something ridiculous like, um,

395
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,110
basically how would I know
that that would have happened?

396
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,530
How would you know that that
would have happened? Well, well,

397
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,440
baboons have the strength of
like, what five men, you know,

398
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,940
and I don't know if you've noticed
baboons don't really like, you know,

399
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,180
you don't ring a bell and then they stop.
That's the end of the round.

400
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,780
Bafo you know, they, if you
start tapping out like, oh yeah,

401
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,733
all right.

402
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,740
You know, cause it's turning
your head around. Huh?

403
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,030
You know, it does not stop it. You
can't tap out with the baboons.

404
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,770
Baboons do not have a fucking where
that 10 minute time limit dose.

405
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,990
They don't fight like that. They
have a fight to the death. All right?

406
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,260
You're coming in there trying
to raise money for emphysema.

407
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,410
That things coming in. They're like,
all right, fucking blood sport here.

408
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,600
I don't have any teeth.
What's the next thing I'm doing?

409
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm going to fucking turn your
head around like the extra seats,

410
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,890
even though I never saw the movie.
And even if I did,

411
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:39,590
I don't even know if it would register,
you know?

412
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,370
Okay.

413
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,400
Do Bet Cheetahs are afraid
or afraid of baboons.

414
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,600
The baboons comes over like,
get the fuck out of my territory.

415
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,510
Cheetahs for the most part I like,
or leopards,

416
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:53,610
maybe it's even a leopard
and even bigger cat.

417
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,270
I Dunno what I dunno,
but um,

418
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,330
I will tell you to look up the
story of Gina Bronco Boozer,

419
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,870
but there's really nothing on here
other than in that restaurant.

420
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,760
And they kind of had
the whole fucking story.

421
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:08,820
If I ever go out to New Mexico again,
I'm going to go to,

422
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,530
it's an Italian restaurant or is if
somebody lives out there, Jesus Christ,

423
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:16,590
why don't you use technology?
Please take a picture of the story.

424
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:20,610
It's on the wall and please send it to
me and we'll put it up on the podcast

425
00:25:20,611 --> 00:25:24,300
page because it's fucking unreal. You
know what's funny? It was one, I read it.

426
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:27,270
All I thought about was this is like,

427
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,170
this is something like fucking Joe Rogan.
You know,

428
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,360
I should have sent the story to him.

429
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,080
He could have done a
fucking hour of this on,

430
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:40,081
on his podcast with all his knowledge
of animals and ultimate fighting.

431
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,150
Who the fuck we're
getting to a goddamn rig.

432
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,640
Who the fuck would get into a ring with
a, with a baboons and like, I guess,

433
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:53,430
you know, they're really,
there was no discovery channel.

434
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,890
Okay.

435
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,050
And that's the honest thing.
Like I wouldn't know anything about,

436
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,950
I would know anything about baboons if
it wasn't for basic cable, you know?

437
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,210
And I wouldn't have known that that woman
got her face fucking ripped off if it

438
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:09,470
wasn't for, you know, the instant
new shit. I wouldn't know anything.

439
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,090
All I would know about would be the guy
up the street with fucking seven toes.

440
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,290
I would just know that country shit. But
anyways, if you get a chance, you know,

441
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:24,270
look it up, there isn't much information
on it. But um, so there you go.

442
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,440
It's been all about animals so far hasn't
it? The animal podcasts. Oh. Anyway,

443
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,640
so I'm sitting there looking at this
fat fucking rabbit and it's just sitting

444
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:36,870
there and it was nighttime.
I,

445
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,050
it really disturbed me the
way it was just sitting there,

446
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,620
not looking out for coyotes,
not looking out for a cath.

447
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,390
I actually played out in my head this
awful scenario of a cat slowly coming up

448
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:50,970
to it's stocking it.
You know,

449
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,690
when the rabbit looking right at the cat
and the cat having this weird sort of,

450
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,820
this motherfucker sees me, doesn't he?
You know, the lovely Nia, everybody.

451
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,250
So I'm telling this story.

452
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:07,251
I saw this rabbit sitting outside a
house last night or house rabbit of fat.

453
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,780
I've been eating fruit loops at
the dining room table, house wrap.

454
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:15,090
And it just really disturbed me
because it didn't know any better.

455
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,360
It didn't know to be scared.
It wasn't scared of me.

456
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,730
It wasn't looking to Reno fucking yes,
that's what I'm saying.

457
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,600
It's domestic. And what'd you come
down here to get on the podcast? Maybe,

458
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,590
but grab yourself a microphone there,
lady. You got to plug yourself in.

459
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,290
So anyways, I uh, the chords are
over there. We've been through this.

460
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,340
I'd hit pause in this thing,
but I don't know how to do it.

461
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,290
And it always ends up shutting off and
then I have to splice it together and

462
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:47,910
then something happens where, uh, I dunno.

463
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,670
So anyways, hey, you
guys, have you ever, uh,

464
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:55,320
you ever go to make a pot roast in a Dutch
oven and in the middle of it you just

465
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:59,580
start drinking beers and you're about
four beers in and you can't remember what

466
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:02,010
time you put the pot roast dinner.
That's what the fuck I did yesterday.

467
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,800
So embarrassed I made it. I made
a tough pot roast. Here we go,

468
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:12,030
and she's putting on the windscreen.
Everybody a head. Bam. She's in.

469
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,600
She's in. Hello. Hey.

470
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,420
Did you try any of the pot roast
or are you still on your diet?

471
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,340
I did try some pot rose,

472
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:24,270
but I am still on my diet even though
Paul Ross wasn't a fall off a little bit

473
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:27,720
and back on it for the next,
well for a while, but yeah,

474
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,970
in the middle of the pot roast,
it tasted our right. Right.

475
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,270
The outside got a little tough.

476
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,480
Yeah.
Well that's what you get for and you know,

477
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:40,481
I don't understand why people want people
cook these beautiful meals that you've

478
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:44,840
been cooking lately and they have been
beautiful meals. My Ngo, you know? Yeah.

479
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:47,570
You have a nice glass of wine.
It's like the whole process.

480
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,780
Nobody's slams for Budweiser's in a row
while making these beautiful restaurant

481
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:55,670
quality meals. That's a
whole, yeah. You know what?

482
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,110
It was stumbling around the kitchen
like, Ooh, done. Do they put it in? Oh,

483
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:04,610
I fucked it up. Oh, it turned the wrong
burner. I did that. I was supposed to

484
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,800
turn up the heat for the
potatoes and I had the, uh,

485
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,460
the roast on simmer and I turned up the,

486
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:14,440
the roast one high.
And I'm sitting there like,

487
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:16,300
why isn't this these fucking potatoes?

488
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:17,800
It's doesn't even look
like it's getting hot.

489
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:20,170
And then all of a sudden I
heard my, uh, my au jus sauce.

490
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,440
Huge bubbling over there. Yeah.

491
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,150
The whole thing. Well, you know
what, it was my OCD kicked in.

492
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,060
I had all those Budweiser's leftover
from the Rose Bowl and uh, I,

493
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,830
they're just taking up space.

494
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,910
You don't have OCD, you have
add. I like that. You're like,

495
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,070
oh, I have OCD. Why I had to drink all

496
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,280
those beans. Well, let me
explain it. A compulsive,

497
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,750
this is why a sense of in Santa
Barbara sets of compulsive drinking.

498
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,890
Now listen stands for
a disorder. Let's, hey,

499
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,863
whoa.

500
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,760
No, I, I had the, uh, I
just, we had like fucking 12.

501
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:03,410
We brought so much beer. I had
like 15 Budweiser's in there. Okay.

502
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,950
It's taken up all that space. So I'm
thinking if I drink one a day, you know,

503
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,640
I'll knock this out in half a
month. Then I go, what if I have to?

504
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:14,610
I knock it out [inaudible] seven
and then I was just like, you know,

505
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:17,340
I had them in stacks or two
and I was just like, you know,

506
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:19,620
I knocked out two and then I
had my third one and I'm like,

507
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,080
well the other one's still sitting
there taking up that space.

508
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,500
So knock that one out. You could
have put them on the bottom shelf.

509
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:28,950
Like way in the back though. There's,
there's ways you could have, I could've,

510
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,350
I could've bought a bigger fridge.
We could've bought a bigger fridge.

511
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,810
Rosebowl was awesome to share.
We did have a tragedy though,

512
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:40,290
and I can't name the name,
but somebody got a little too drunk,

513
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,830
was walking towards the street.
I don't have,

514
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,960
what always happens every year is
we get absolutely fucking hammered.

515
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,940
And then we all just,

516
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:50,700
all of a sudden we just notice where
the only ones in the parking lot,

517
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:54,300
and then that's when it clicks that the
game's about ready to start. So then we,

518
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:57,060
or the golf course, which is
the parking lot, and we, um,

519
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,300
we just walk into the stadium sort of
together and then get separated and then

520
00:31:03,301 --> 00:31:07,310
come back together again, like a band
that worked out its differences, you know?

521
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,320
And when we got to our seats,

522
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,600
only three of us made it and
there was some other guy, no,

523
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,780
I remember what's his face was saying,
yes, someone's so lost his ticket.

524
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,510
I like get the fuck Outta here.
And they didn't get in.

525
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,960
And then some other Douche bag comes
up and sits in my buddy seat where like

526
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:28,140
three drunk Agri guys. What the fuck do
you get that Dick? And he's like, oh,

527
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,063
I bought it.

528
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,163
Yeah.

529
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,130
But at first he said he
bought it for 25 bucks.

530
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:36,080
Then they told somebody
else he bought it for 50.

531
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,110
Either pickpocket that thing or
he founded on the fucking ground.

532
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:42,260
But at the end of the day it's um, you
know, it's all my buddy got too hammered.

533
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,790
That's why I always buy the ticket
holder every year. It's like,

534
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:50,340
you know when you put a toddler on a
leash, so can't run away from you. That's,

535
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,570
that's what I do. I put the ticket
in there, put it around my neck,

536
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,720
and then I commence drinking like I'm
still in college so it just stays there.

537
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,030
Stays there. You don't have a problem.
Feel your neck. Get and tugged,

538
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:04,430
you know somebody trying to
steal it. Right. You know,

539
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,520
you can even put it like underneath your
shirt if you're worried about people

540
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:11,840
you know, getting funny ideas. Yeah, but
I'd get so drunk I would think I lost it.

541
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,703
I'd be like,
where is it?

542
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,820
I can't breathe.

543
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,710
It's the way we know.
We had a great time though.

544
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,810
You were getting jealous when you saw
all that food that we were cooking.

545
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,680
Fucking lie ahead. Did the, did
the ribs up throw down like it's,

546
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:31,080
it's some sort of like food
tailgating, competition, you know,

547
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,940
it's like this.
Did you tell them,

548
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:35,520
did you tell your podcast
listeners what was on the menu?

549
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,400
This extensive tailgating menu? Oh,
we had a short ribs. Wait, wait,

550
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:43,200
start at the beginning. What
is the beginning? Right?

551
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,290
9,000 fucking Budweiser's. Oh, we
had breakfast with a lamb sausage.

552
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,670
We got this great what
Ya and my neighborhood.

553
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:53,810
So we went over there and literally put
in an order that we had to pick up two

554
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:56,870
days later. A lot of animals
died on this day. People,

555
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,170
we had lamb.
You are very organized about it.

556
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:03,320
It's not like you just went to Ralph's
and just grabbed a bunch of sheep meat.

557
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,480
Like you went to the butcher,
the basket.

558
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:09,740
Pretty much the only butcher and our
neighborhood and put an order as he had

559
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,670
lamb sausage, goat cheese
and rose fat bar. Yeah.

560
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,800
Um, all right. So that
was breakfast. Okay.

561
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:22,600
And that's the greatest Omelet I
have every year. Yeah. Sitting there,

562
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,530
I got a rose bowl ticket around
my neck and on my beer in my hand.

563
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,330
Exactly.
An omelet in my mouth.

564
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,400
I know all that guy shit that it's
just lampooned now it gets just fucking

565
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:38,960
considered silly. If you enjoy
that, like this is America. It is.

566
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,310
It's fucking great.

567
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,830
And until you've had a fucking omelet on
New Year's Day on a golf course outside

568
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:49,700
the Rosebowl go fuck yourself. It was
a tremendous, and then what's his face?

569
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:54,680
We had a, we had Coby beef, hot dogs.
What's, I just found out Coby beef.

570
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,930
The reason why it's so soft
as they treat it like veal.

571
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,500
So I've gotta be done with that shit
now. Oh, so now you're not gonna,

572
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,580
you're not going eat that anymore cause
you're very, you're anti veal. So yeah,

573
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:08,450
I don't mind fucking just walking up
to a cow and blown his brains out.

574
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:14,060
That's, I don't, that's part
of nature. Somebody got ya.

575
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,903
That's all right.

576
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,950
But to stick him in a fucking
cage and so they can't move.

577
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:26,120
So the meats more tender to just
torture it like that, you know?

578
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,880
Okay. Yeah. I mean that's,
it's, it's, it's unnecessary.
It already tastes delicious.

579
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,100
It's doing the fucking job. It's filling
up my belly, you know, let it walk around.

580
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,770
Can you let her walk around? Um, whatever.

581
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,260
And then we had the ribs, we had the
ribs and a, with his fucking, his,

582
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,530
his rub in the mop. And it
was just, it was the shit.

583
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:56,531
And then what had the mini apple pies
baked by you and then they my little pie

584
00:34:57,241 --> 00:35:02,060
face and then uh,
we got the best compliment.

585
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,650
We heard people next to us were
sprint. Go and see, look at it.

586
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,640
They're doing it right. They got pies. And
you're like, that's right motherfucker.

587
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,320
I know who brings individual Pi.
We used to read that whole game.

588
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,930
I used to back in the day when I
used to go to the Patriots Games,

589
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,240
when I had season tickets in 1989,

590
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,290
we used to fucking show up with a keg
of beer and a bag of chips and we'd be

591
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:21,801
sitting there.

592
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:24,500
I don't know those people that are doing
it right and we just get absolutely

593
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,370
annihilate every year that I
swear to God that's, that's,

594
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,670
that's accurate. We would,
we would have a half barrel.

595
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,920
We had a half barrel beer and we would
be doing keg stands because we were

596
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,250
morons. Literally like counting,
why do I ain't doing that shit?

597
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,230
Is All these adults were looking
at us like summer were repulsed.

598
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,630
And then there was other people who
did that when they were our age.

599
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:50,340
So they would just sitting
there with half a smirk,

600
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:53,310
probably betting which one of us
was going to puke first. Yeah,

601
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,730
I did one time puking after a keg.

602
00:35:56,731 --> 00:36:00,650
Stan is the most refreshing way
ever to puke. I've never done it.

603
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:04,380
Kegs stand before. It's so it's
so cold when it comes back out.

604
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:05,260
Usually when you heal.

605
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,840
Well I guess a keg stand usually is
you're supposed to do like somebody holds

606
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:13,500
you up upside down drinking. Okay.
And what, so we weren't doing that.

607
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:14,310
We weren't doing that.

608
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,830
What's the point of being upside down
is that you get more fucked up that way?

609
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:18,310
Cause they're all disoriented.
No,

610
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,100
it's one of those things where you're
young and you think, if I'm drinking beer,

611
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:27,090
I'm crazy. I'm away from my parents.
What could make this crazier?

612
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,660
What if I did it upside
down? Yeah, it's stupid.

613
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,150
It's just suburban. Do Sheree. So I
actually, I actually never did that. Uh,

614
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,520
we, we did a more adult
version of cake cake Stan,

615
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:42,600
which is basically you just fucking,
you turn the tap on and you just,

616
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,580
and we were timing it. It was like the
Olympic trials of beer drinking and,

617
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,210
and as you puked you are out or if he
just tapped out like I can't do it,

618
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,360
seed start off with 10 seconds
and it was completely inaccurate.

619
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,930
If you would just be going
one, two, three, four,

620
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,550
five right all the way up to 10 and if
you made it to 10 you in the next round

621
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,810
and then went up to 20 then it went up
to 30 then we're up to 40 and you've got

622
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:08,970
to think, you've already
drank for 10 seconds. St Drank
for 20, that's 30 seconds.

623
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,630
Now you drink for 39 he drinks 60 and
it just keeps going and going and going.

624
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,990
And we got all the way up. One time where
I was trying to beat this guy and I,

625
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,070
and I didn't have a reputation for being
able to drink and I just went into this

626
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:25,071
fucking zone and I went head to head
with this guy and I just kept making,

627
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,570
it was like the Cinderella team going
through March madness and somehow I made

628
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:32,850
it,
I made it to the championship game.

629
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,180
It was me against this other guy
who had like a fucking iron stomach.

630
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,590
And um,
I ended up,

631
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,660
I ended up losing is what I did,

632
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,510
but it was one of the great pukes in
my life because it was just ice cold.

633
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,150
It was like reverse drinking a glass
of water, ice cold glass, you know, ed,

634
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:55,380
a Puke, it's like acidy and it
tears up your throat. It wasn't,

635
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,030
it was just like, it just came
out. Was this in high school?

636
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,010
I know I was, well, I would think I was
in my fifth year of college by then.

637
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,970
Now I'll leave it out of college.
I was 21 when I did that.

638
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,530
So I should have been a junior, but I
was still a freshman. Yeah. And I tried,

639
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,540
I drank beer and high school only
because I don't drink beer now as you now

640
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,680
cause I don't like the taste of it,

641
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,660
but I drank it in high school because
you know that's what you're trying. Oh,

642
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:23,980
that's my running joke with you.
I school,

643
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,820
I think you'd like this one and I
always make sure it's the most hoppy

644
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,710
discussing it. So rude. You
know how much I don't like
beer. I just, but yeah, I use,

645
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,800
I would drink it in high school because
that's what people were when you would

646
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:40,320
drink in high school. But then I got onto
the, uh, the Boone's farm there, you know,

647
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:44,380
that cheap little strawberry wine
and wine coolers. What is it called?

648
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,670
Boone's farm. It's a kind of um,
wine. It's like really sweet.

649
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,120
Really cheap. Yeah. You get it.
I like the gas station. We would,

650
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,360
we would send them hang over. We,
we, yeah, we would send it, you know,

651
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:58,460
like one of the cuter girls,
um,

652
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,060
to go in there and just kind of like
smile and just walk up with a couple of

653
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,840
bottles of the Boone's Barb.
And you know,

654
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,800
the 19 year old or whatever kid behind
or just let her buy it and not check your

655
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:13,020
Id. Cause she's hot. She's cute,
right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

656
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,190
Why fuck everybody. I mean I'm
not, I'm not condoning that.

657
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,560
I'm jealous, but I
would, I always hated it,

658
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,300
but I just did it because
that's what you did.

659
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,980
You know I'm jealous of that is what it
is guys. You know, on a certain level,

660
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:30,940
you're fucking resent that.

661
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,430
Yeah.

662
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,890
Because we don't have the option of
being hot and cute and just getting

663
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,450
something just coming like hat tea.

664
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:41,451
He had like a case of beer playing
with your nonexistent pigtail or maybe

665
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:44,850
you're, you're a Steven Seagal
ponytail. Just sort of twisting around.

666
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,090
It is a weird visual. Let's read
some fucking emails for the week. Um,

667
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,800
Pakistani cricket fan. He said,
all right man, this isn't,

668
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,030
this is important. First
podcast of 2003. Right.

669
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,610
All right, sorry about that. I fucked the
thing up. I didn't delete last week's,

670
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:09,450
I gotta get a memory card that has
a little more memory on it anyways.

671
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,910
Oh Jesus. What is this now? All right.

672
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,360
It's just gone off the rails here.
Alright.

673
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:22,110
Pakistani cricket fan starting over
again. All right, man. This is important.

674
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:25,920
First podcast of 2013. Right?
This is about cricket, the sport.

675
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:31,470
Don't you stop here now come
on and bear with me. Okay,

676
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:35,670
so Pakistan and India just had a
cricket series. Now these two guys,

677
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:39,840
they don't like each other, right? Why
don't they like each other? I don't know.

678
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,830
I'll be completely honest. You just
got fuck. You were like, right.

679
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,570
I thought you like you knew the answer.
Now I don't lay down and I'm not, uh,

680
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,420
not well versed in that I had made.
All right. It's not my students,

681
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:55,080
the usual shit. They live
near each other. All right.

682
00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:00,110
Familiarity breeds contempt and
they fight over cashmere much.

683
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,620
You have a few years ago they will like,

684
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:05,310
I'm gonna fucking Nokia and the
other guys like, go ahead and tow it.

685
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,540
We got the bomb toe. You
don't remember that? No.

686
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,230
Maybe that was a movie I saw anyways.
So Pakistan,

687
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,250
India just had a cricket series.
We, our arch rivals and shit.

688
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,900
Not only in cricket button,
everything.

689
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:23,160
I mean we had the biggest
tank wars in Shit did you?

690
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,970
They should make a movie about that and
have like Tan white people play you guys

691
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,680
and then you guys can get
offended. Um, so had this,

692
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:38,681
these fucking commercials in which the
voice said Pakistan is coming to India

693
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,850
and they're faggot cricket
player. Ooh. We're like,

694
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,590
oh, he's saying, I
thought they were saying,

695
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:51,780
I thought they were saying that in the
commercial. I was like, wow, no, this,

696
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:55,540
this gentleman is, he's using it
all right. Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

697
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,900
And which the voice said Pakistan is
coming to India and then they're a cricket

698
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:03,440
player.
We're like,

699
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,800
let them come now these Indian cons are
the last World Cup champions and we're

700
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:14,660
ready to fuck Pakistan in the ass. Get
what happened. Guess what happened?

701
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:19,400
They got fucked big time now everything
else in Pakistan is shit as you must

702
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:23,900
know. Just do this man.
Wow. This guy, you know,

703
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:25,310

704
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,210
Just do this man and be on
my fucking side. All right.

705
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,720
As I approach you first.
All right. Come on man.

706
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,020
Just tell these Indian read these things
first before you just start reading.

707
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,990
That's what makes it good.

708
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,310
Just tell these Indian cons how
bad their cricket team sucks. Oh,

709
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,380
and they can eat a dick.
Oh,

710
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,390
some other clever shit that he say he
wants you to trash Indian way cause he's

711
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:55,280
back as Danny and they have a cricket
feud as well. Please rape them.

712
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,380
Woo. Please rape them. Yeah Sir.
Don't use that word like that.

713
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,630
Oh, you know what? You don't understand
sports. How'd you like? Dang God.

714
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,150
You thought you were going
to beat Pakistan Woo.

715
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:13,151
Where the defendant fucking champions
with our fraternity paddles hitting that

716
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:17,690
racket ball around the circular field.
Well guess what? You fucking lost.

717
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,230
You would think considering all
you guys have 18 fucking kids,

718
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,280
you could find a couple of Jordans in
there. Right? And you could repeat,

719
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,000
oh well you know what? I
think next year, Pakistan,

720
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:33,800
you guys should play again and
winner takes all of cashmere.

721
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,120
What do you think about that? And you
get all the other side's tanks go.

722
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:43,150
How was that? Was that all right? Like,
all right, cool. Thank you for that.

723
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,480
Let me go.
This is Belper.

724
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,510
This was bill burr trashing anybody else?

725
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:52,020
If you watch obscure sports
aisle and you guys win a game,

726
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:55,200
I'll talk trash about the other fucking
person not knowing anything about,

727
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:57,850
I don't even know.
I don't even get the game I liked for it.

728
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:00,870
You know what I like about
cricket though is how long it is.

729
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,250
You know when you drink this, this certain
sports that you just going to love,

730
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,110
you just the, there's a cricket game
that people like drink out like that.

731
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:14,940
It doesn't seem like, it seems more
civilized in that for some reason. Why?

732
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,770
I don't know why because it's foreign.

733
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,190
Wow. Cause it's nowhere like all white.
They just looked like spiffier. I Dunno.

734
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,030
They just looks like there's
some sort of class element.

735
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:31,980
Do you think it about Polo? No. Don't
they were all way. I don't know.

736
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,440
Pull up. Pull up an image
of people playing cricket.

737
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:37,620
I'm pretty sure everyone gets secretary.
Everyone wears white.

738
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:41,670
Well you have the laptop in front of you.
I got, I got nothing. Oh listen, this,

739
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:45,230
this is, this is why, of course
they drink. They probably have,

740
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,230
they probably have hooligans.
You sit in the same,

741
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,780
you think it's sophisticated after
what this guy wrote, faggot. Cont rape.

742
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,700
That's all. That's one. That's all
in there. It isn't. That's crickets.

743
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:57,910
Vance for you. Oh, that's not
cricket fans. You know what that is?

744
00:44:57,911 --> 00:45:02,680
That sports fifth, that sports fans. We're
morons. Yeah, but I think that more like,

745
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:03,820
like something like a rugby,

746
00:45:03,821 --> 00:45:06,610
I feel like has more of a
hooliganism attached to it.

747
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,500
I feel like cricket is more like, hello.
You know what? We're going into the creek.

748
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,160
Have you ever met a professional boxer
or aura or one of those UFC guys?

749
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,290
I guess so. If you meet them.
Most of them, yeah. Most of them.

750
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,050
They're really just mellow. Sure.
They don't need to prove anything.

751
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,410
Right. You know what I mean? Maybe
it's the fan. So you're aware.

752
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:34,040
We are not talking about
the rugby players. Maybe the
fans are more, I don't know.

753
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,430
I, you know, I have no idea.
I can tell you right now,

754
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,200
I would keep my fucking mouth shut if I
ever went to any sort of sporting event

755
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,680
in another country. Unless, you know
when I go to Canada it's hockey.

756
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:50,060
I know hockey's backed by the way.
I'm really excited that it's back great.

757
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,650
All is forgiven.
I don't give a fuck.

758
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,340
I've accepted it that it's a part of
hockey every fucking five, six years.

759
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,570
I have no idea what you're talking about.

760
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,860
I know you don't usually eat it all is
forgiven. What's forgiven the strike?

761
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,670
They went on strike.

762
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,670
Oh you noticed you've been able to watch
way more real housewives this time this

763
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,010
year.

764
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:12,560
You notice I'm watching way more hoop and
then if somehow in a fucking secretive

765
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,220
way become a Knicks fan because they
never show the Celtics cause we stink.

766
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,270
So they're always showing the Knicks and
I, I just, I'd love their team. Okay.

767
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:24,080
I fucking love their team.
Did you see that? Jr Smith's,

768
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,740
that donkey had on that alleyoop with
the guy threw a too low and he caught it

769
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:30,650
down by his nuts and just with
one hand just fucking threw it.

770
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:32,540
There was one of the most
vicious things I've ever seen,

771
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:37,610
even probably as vicious is that baboons
snapping that restless neck back in the

772
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:41,990
fifties. Um, alright.
Innocent deer in headlights.

773
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,310
Hey Bill. Loved the show. I'll start
from the beginning but I'll be quick.

774
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,171
I know people,

775
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:52,410
you know I can't read so let's just
get right to the fucking point. Yeah.

776
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:57,310
Did you had, did you ever read aloud
in class? I hated it. I hated it.

777
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,530
I would be like trying to count ahead
how many people and then try to guess

778
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:05,160
which paragraph and I would always start
looking over it before he got to it.

779
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,780
Do you know when I was
in the fourth grade,

780
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:11,480
one time I had to read out loud and I
got in my head and I was like going like,

781
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,520
I'll just read the first couple
sentences too. I did it. I was like,

782
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,660
love the show.
I'll start from the,

783
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,290
and I finished it, I finished it.
I wasn't baby, I wasn't a bit,

784
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:30,430
I was in fourth grade, I should have
been able to read shit had bill.

785
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,440
So when I finished reading the paragraph,
the teacher went like before, you know,

786
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,230
I was like,

787
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,650
I was so fucking relieved that it was
over and I was just waiting for her to

788
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:40,630
call and the girl sitting
behind me for her, you know,

789
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:45,870
Jennifer read the next paragraph and when
I finished there was this silence and

790
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:51,130
then the teacher said, I didn't
understand one word. He said,

791
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,570
oh, anybody else understand
what he saw? No, nobody said.

792
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,330
She made me go back and
reread it. I love the show.

793
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:05,160
I'm like choking back tears
hoes though from the beginning.

794
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,360
Cause back in the 70s when you could
be mean to people. Oh that's terrible.

795
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,290
Or is he too fucking stupid?
Be in this grade.

796
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,890
You poor thing. That's not nice. It's
not nice. It's fucking hilarious.

797
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,530
I stunk at it and she called
me out on it and I deserved it.

798
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:26,300
What I should've done was viewed as a
challenge and gone home and just walked

799
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:29,180
around the house reading out loud.
Well, you're in fourth grade,

800
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:32,060
your brain doesn't work like that.
Listen,

801
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,550
you're never too young
to start manning up.

802
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,670
Instead.
I accepted defeat and I,

803
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,560
I dunno,
I know I never got that.

804
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:45,870
Two things happen to me that
year that were fucking brutal.

805
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,110
They had the reading out loud
and getting trashed for it

806
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,010
and then they did this thing called,

807
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,900
was it called a sound spelling.
Okay.

808
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,290
You know, you learn how to
read in fourth grade. Yeah.

809
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,260
You progress in the second grade.
You learn how to spell and all that,

810
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,030
all that shit first, second, third.
Okay. It's still fresh in your head.

811
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,260
Don't take it out of the oven.
It's still all doughy.

812
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,520
So you know what these fucking idiots do.

813
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:20,090
They introduce sound spelling in
the fourth grade and it's basically,

814
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,910
uh, I guess phonetic spelling
is what it properly proper name.

815
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,220
Will you spell cat k a t.

816
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,610
And they started going through all of
these words that I just learned how to

817
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:32,970
spell within the last couple
of months to couple of years.

818
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,480
And they started putting case where
there was cs and all this shit.

819
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:41,460
And I never recovered. Never recovered.
Why would they do that though?

820
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:44,340
Why would they? Because
somebody's, I don't get to,

821
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,970
they thought that it would help
with something. Why would they,

822
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:50,820
why would they do that?
Why would they put fluoride in toothpaste?

823
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,840
Why would they do that when it slows your
brain down and it makes you just kind

824
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:58,140
of, you know, hey man,
dreams aren't coming true.

825
00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:01,420
But however I look at these
white teeth, you know, uh,

826
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,310
I don't know what I'm talking about ever.
Just know that.

827
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,970
Know that about this podcast. I don't
know what I'm talking about. Ever.

828
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:11,030
The Monday morning podcast, that's
your tag. That's it. Alright.

829
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,720
Innocent deer in the headlights. All
right. Push away that fourth grade.

830
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,180
Do you want me to read it for you?
Hey,

831
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:22,060
if that guy who played Darth Vader's
voice can get over stuttering,

832
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,190
I can do this. All right. Hey, bill loved
the show. I'll start from the beginning.

833
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,780
I'll be quick.
I'm about to graduate college.

834
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,730
I met a lady in one of my classes.
We talked throughout the semester.

835
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,331
Ah,
dude.

836
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:38,690
How many times was the moment to get a
number coming and going and you were like,

837
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:43,610
fuck. Um, and on the last day of
class she offered me or number.

838
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,210
There it is. She was, why we
rolling her eyes the whole semester,

839
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:51,140
like for the love of God.
Do I gotta drop to my knees?

840
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,040
Um,
where the hell am I?

841
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,680
She came up to,
I know.

842
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:02,710
Oh. Oh Billy. Oh, Villi. Amanda Class.

843
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,660
We talked.
What the fuck was I?

844
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,160
I thought she was having
a flashback right now.

845
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,510
Did I just make that part
of it if I can't find it,

846
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,930
I met a girl, one of my class we talked
throughout this semester. Last Day class.

847
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:21,060
She asked me a number.
I thought she was pretty cool and when,

848
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:25,230
and went out with her later that week.
She came up. No, she came and met me.

849
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,530
She came in right.

850
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,040
Met Up with me on, this is
fucking torture. Just read.

851
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,350
Oh my God.
They met up with me and my friends is

852
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:41,750
that a bar brings went well and we
ended up going back to my place.

853
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,860
Oh Gee,
here's,

854
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:47,240
we start fooling around on the couch and
then she gets up and guides me into my

855
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:52,040
room and I was getting nervous because
I haven't been with many girls and not

856
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:56,200
entirely sure what to do
in this situation. Um,

857
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:00,980
she strips naked and while
we are sitting on my bed,

858
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:05,630
she opens her legs to reveal a
white string coming out of her lady.

859
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:08,900
Enos guys with the gross details here.

860
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:14,270
I wasn't really sure what it was at the
time. Oh, this guy's, he's a fucking,

861
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:17,630
he's like that. He's like that little
fat rabbit sitting outside the, uh,

862
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:20,960
the apartment complex. He
didn't know what it was. Well,

863
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:25,070
maybe he was just so disoriented that he
just was like, what is good? There's no,

864
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:29,840
there's nothing in a guy's
upbringing that says, uh, you know,

865
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,590
tells you about the rip cord. You know,
that's just something you just learned.

866
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,970
It's one of the few things like,
you know,

867
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:38,120
back in the day on his toes to learn
about like the whole reproductive system.

868
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,030
It's literally like half an hour,
not even half an hour.

869
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:45,080
Maybe it's a 10 minute part of your
lesson about the reproductive system when

870
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:47,150
they, if they, if they didn't have that,

871
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,320
they didn't have that
when I was growing up.

872
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:51,230
But I can guarantee you in those
classes, they never say, hey,

873
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:55,400
and if you ever time to bang some chick
who's on the rag, right, right. Of course,

874
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,580
if you see that little string coming out,
uh,

875
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,350
that means you've trying to bang
girl and turns out she's on the rag.

876
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,190
You know why? But the thing is she knows
she's having her period. So why is,

877
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:07,430
she won't read the, we know what she's
gonna do. She's gonna want to eat,

878
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,230
she's going to want a bang and say it's
not a heavy flow day or she's going to

879
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,800
take it in there. Oh yeah. That's that.

880
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:19,040
That could be alright. Let's
just, this is getting gross.

881
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,020
This is like really graphic,

882
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:26,290
very graphic because I wasn't
really sure what it was at the time.

883
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,360
I would have loved if you said
what you thought it might be.

884
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,630
Ah, she flossing down there. Um,

885
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,970
I told her exactly what I
was thinking and he said,

886
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,490
this is what he said.
This is classic. He sees,

887
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,260
she said that naked with the legs spread
and he goes, there's a white thing.

888
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,053
Dot Dot.
Dot.

889
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,033
There.

890
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,040
She told me that it was a Tan Tampon.
Yeah.

891
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:02,890
And that she was on her period. She said
it was fine in still wanted to have sex.

892
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,510
I got really weirded out, not grossed
out. I got really weirded out.

893
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:10,600
So I told her that maybe we should wait.

894
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:16,390
She told me there are
other ways I called it a,

895
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:20,890
I was still, or maybe even
further freaked out by this girl.

896
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:25,540
So we just went to sleep.
Keep in mind that this,

897
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,260
this is the first night we ever hung out.
Yeah. Why did you let her stay there?

898
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,570
Did I do the right thing? Should I
meet up with her again or is she crazy?

899
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,920
I don't, I don't understand.
It's a lot. And Go fuck
yourself. What? Ha, I'm confused.

900
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:41,640
Did I do the right thing by
not sleeping with her? Yeah.

901
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,830
By not having anal sex
with her or whatever,

902
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:47,320
or just plowing through the fucking storm.

903
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,040
If you didn't feel comfortable fetus,
it'd be, didn't feel comfortable with it,

904
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:55,940
then you shouldn't have such thing.
A captain on a ship.

905
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:00,980
I just going through the wave
captain,

906
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:03,680
you're crazy. Well, I
got him back a Jeff Fag.

907
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,070
I'm sorry you put that word in my head.

908
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:09,840
Who did that fucking guy over there?
Yeah.

909
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:14,090
Never say the f word. I say,
fuck, I don't say faggot.

910
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,490
I've tried to take it out. They
took, they told me to knock it off.

911
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:26,690
I respect it. You, you do knock it
off. So I said, right. Yeah. You know,

912
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,310
I'm not trying to be a dick here,

913
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,890
but for the longest time you called
somebody effect. It had nothing to do.

914
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,560
It just meant you were a pussy.
We didn't know what he was saying.

915
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:40,730
I know that you fucking faggot.
We get it. I'm just saying.

916
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,673
So anyways,

917
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,950
Bill bird trying to knock it off.
I'm trying,

918
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,370
the thing is you're so
sometimes you're so,

919
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,130
I don't know of innocence,
the right word,

920
00:55:57,131 --> 00:55:59,420
but sometimes you are you going
to say hope you're still, yeah.

921
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:03,420
You're so dumb about the, like you'd
be offensiveness that you grew up with.

922
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,540
You're always like what everybody says,

923
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,990
you're so defensive about it
for so long. Yeah. But you know,

924
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,010
cause it's like you honestly don't
know any better cause you're, yeah,

925
00:56:15,011 --> 00:56:15,641
you're dumb.

926
00:56:15,641 --> 00:56:19,990
And then finally enough people explain
it to you that you are a human being.

927
00:56:19,991 --> 00:56:23,590
You have a heart and you're a sensitive.
So you're like, oh, okay. Right.

928
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:25,900
I won't say it anymore.
Jesus fucking Christ.

929
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,880
Like the attitude you have about it.

930
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:32,300
It's like you want to be a good person,
but you're like,

931
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,460
you're angry that you have to like,

932
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,130
let go of this part of your past where
people just said Sag to each other.

933
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:42,820
And it was like, hey, that's what
we say. It's Boston and go fucking,

934
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,980
well, you know, Jimmy Dore,

935
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,740
the great Jimmy Dore actually
did his show, uh, um,

936
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,520
Friday night and he's so God damn funny,

937
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:59,260
he has the funniest fucking
bit on that on knock it off.

938
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:04,000
Why that's a dumb ad campaign
because it really is like,

939
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:09,180
you know, hey, knock it us really like
this parental, I don't know. I don't,

940
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:12,440
we'll saying, oh that's gay
or stuff like that. Yeah.

941
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,330
He's not saying that that's wrong to
try and get people to stop doing it,

942
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:21,250
but is that the best way to get people
to stop doing it by saying, hey,

943
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,020
knock it off. Like you're driving
the car and you're their parent,

944
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:28,030
you're swinging it. They're like, I
don't want to step on his bid. Here. Go,

945
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:30,370
go see Jimmy Dor and request that bit.

946
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,920
Um,
so anyway,

947
00:57:31,921 --> 00:57:36,030
this young man is things that I do the
right thing by not sleeping with her.

948
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:37,990
And should I see her
again because he knows

949
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,170
so loose free 100%.

950
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,350
If she wanted to have
straight up vaginal sex,

951
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,700
there was not a condom thick enough or
all encompassing that would have to take

952
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:50,040
up. Like you'd have to
put it on like underwear,

953
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,000
that condom and boxer underwear
and then have to all be rubber.

954
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:58,350
You'd have to put on basically a wetsuit
that had like a little flappy thing,

955
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,750
therefore your deck.
So you did the right thing.

956
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,230
And he was talking about he would not
have felt comfortable having sex with this

957
00:58:06,231 --> 00:58:07,040
girl while she said he,

958
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,290
if he already was thrown off by
the fact that she had a Tampon.

959
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:14,390
And if you know this girl is a pig,
why is she a pig?

960
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,780
Because you don't defend her
just because she's a woman. Um,

961
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:21,080
and I'm asking a question.
I'm, I'm defending the a pig.

962
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:25,610
What she's paying from her private
parts. Yeah. And just, it's just like,

963
00:58:25,611 --> 00:58:27,010
let's fucking have at it.

964
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:31,790
That is some fucking truck stop
large Marge shit. All right,

965
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:34,460
give me a fucking break.
I'm not trashing all woman women.

966
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,790
Woman here is a pig.

967
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,510
He probably no protection.

968
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,450
Oh Ko k could have gone in the back
door with this girl first fucking day.

969
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,340
She's a pig.

970
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,490
So what use are you feel like she wasn't
ladylike and respecting herself enough

971
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:52,240
or something?
This is what I'm thinking.

972
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,290
You ever see the club everybody wants to
go to when there's that long line down

973
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:59,860
the street? Yeah. That's what
has been lining up to her.

974
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,760
Her fucking private parts ever
heard of the term slut shaming?

975
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,820
Have you heard this term that people,
is it something else?

976
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:10,840
Well that's one I've never used so I
don't need to knock that off. I've never

977
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,460
knock it off. But have you heard of slut
shaming? Which is no, but I can, I can.

978
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,970
I can guess what it is.
How

979
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,220
good of a woman does it.
She's a whore. Right?

980
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:26,210
Exactly. And that's the truest thing
you'll ever fucking read. Okay.

981
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,630
What is the truest thing that if
a woman does it, she is a whore.

982
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,230
So you believe in that whole double
standard abso-fucking-lutely why is that

983
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:35,270
exactly? Because you, there's,

984
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:39,880
there's no skill involved with you guys
getting laid. All you have to do, hey,

985
00:59:39,881 --> 00:59:43,250
is this is a skill based
thing and what defines skill?

986
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:47,270
The skills that you feel
like you're presenting it.
You're getting laid as a guy.

987
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:52,040
Tell me all about your amazing skills
that are you done? Are you done?

988
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:56,460
Oh yeah. For now. Then we've
already had this argument. Yes.

989
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,590
We talked about it in a bar one time
and I said, okay, let's turn the tables.

990
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,880
All right,

991
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,020
let's pretend that I'm holding the
fucking bag of gold and you're calming and

992
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:09,920
trying to get it. Okay. Hit on me.
Come, come, go do it right now. Right?

993
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:14,590
Right now I give good. Thank you. Oh No,
I'm not good at it. I'm not coaching.

994
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:19,460
You know why? Why? Because it's a
skill. When women sit there and they go,

995
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:22,590
oh my God, guys come up to me and they
say that Donald stuff and it's all,

996
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,130
that's all you have to say as a guy.
Oh yeah. What would you say? Go ahead.

997
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,750
Dazzle me. Come up me with your, hey
baby, what's your sign fucking line?

998
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:34,070
What do you got convinced
me? Hey, uh, exactly.

999
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:38,410
Exactly. We have to convince
people on stage late at night.

1000
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,650
And I thought you were pretty funny.

1001
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,193
Oh thanks

1002
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:46,070
sue. Yeah, and I'll be, I'll be,

1003
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,580
I'll be the girl who's going to
deliberately make it difficult. I'm not,

1004
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:52,100
and I'm not good at it. You know I'm not
good at hitting on people. That's not my,

1005
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,670
and you know why that is nice because
you didn't have to do is put on a

1006
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:58,790
spaghetti strap dress. It'd be
like, Ooh, did I drop a Napkin?

1007
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,090
And you're in the game flirting.
I can do. But that's different.

1008
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,830
That's more like conversational.
But no,

1009
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:06,470
I'm not going to just walk up
to understand that as a guy,

1010
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,070
you have to convince a woman to have
sex with you with after you've convinced

1011
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:14,810
her, you have to continue convincing her.
It's all the way back to the apartment.

1012
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:18,560
You got to keep the plates spinning and
any little fucking thing can throw it

1013
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,720
off. Okay. So because of,

1014
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,070
because of that whole struggle that you
pour men have to do in order to get a

1015
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:27,520
woman to sleep with you,
I feel bad for you. Okay.

1016
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,560
So because there is that difference,
then just no respect.

1017
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,810
And then I suppose that makes it
okay to say, if a girl is like, hey,

1018
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,540
let's just, you know, I want to have
fun with you. Let's let's have sex.

1019
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:42,830
All of a sudden she's a
slut or a pig and all that,

1020
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:46,550
and the guy is like, what the hero or
the more skilled of the two of them.

1021
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:47,660
It doesn't make any sense.

1022
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,160
I get done Nia

1023
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,310
[inaudible] fucking date. She's sitting
there, okay, she wants to have sex,

1024
01:01:56,311 --> 01:01:56,820
whatever.

1025
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,080
But you're sitting there with a fucking
bloody rag hanging out of you and you

1026
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:04,920
don't even know this guy and you just
fucking spread your fucking legs.

1027
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,630
And he's like, ah, yeah, there's a thing
hanging out of there. And she says,

1028
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,500
there's other ways. I guarantee you, you
know what that girl is? That's the girl.

1029
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:17,490
When you take out the condom, who
goes, ah, God, I hate condoms.

1030
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:22,650
That fucking girl you ever girl ever says,
God,

1031
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:27,250
I hate condoms. Immediately run the
other direction. Go in the bathroom,

1032
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:32,190
rub one out. Get that dumb idea
out of your fucking head. God,

1033
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:37,050
I hate condoms. Run the other way too
to keep it fair. No, you're right.

1034
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,480
You're so into women's issues right now.

1035
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,720
You can't see the trees through the
forest and this guy was a fucking pig. No,

1036
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,550
I mean I know I definitely,
you're right.

1037
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:48,990
A girl who has got a Tampon and who's
spreading her legs and being like, Hey,

1038
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:52,800
and the guy was like, ah, are you one your
what's going on there? And she's like,

1039
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:56,580
hey, there's other ways to do it. Ways.
I mean, I haven't got any friends.

1040
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:02,180
I guess there's like smoother ways to,
I don't have this guy.

1041
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,100
I would never do that.
I admit that.

1042
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:08,820
But I'm not necessarily throwing all bad
judgment behind this girl because maybe

1043
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:10,980
she was just drunk and she
was probably like, Oh shit,

1044
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,260
I'm on my period is a babe in the woods.

1045
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,960
He could've been at this point with
her after his first class. Okay.

1046
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,400
He hasn't been with a lot of girls.
He basically is like,

1047
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:27,010
do you ever see that video of
those guys who put put a goat in a,

1048
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,890
in a fucking cage with a python and
it doesn't even know it was horrible.

1049
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,580
They didn't think that it,
the goat didn't even know what it was.

1050
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,900
The fucking snakes like Oh shit.

1051
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:42,510
Literally and like lick the fucking
pythons face kind of freak the thing out.

1052
01:03:42,511 --> 01:03:45,180
Like Whoa, what was that?
And then all of a sudden,

1053
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:48,600
by the time it realizes what it's
in the cage with, it's fucking over.

1054
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:54,210
So terrible. So this guy is the goat
and this girl is pot. It's a snake.

1055
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,550
And he doesn't realize what he's saying.
And just by the doubt and the snake,

1056
01:03:58,551 --> 01:04:01,260
by dumb luck,
by dumb luck,

1057
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:05,370
she went to strike and he fucking shook
it like the fucking head was turning

1058
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:09,570
into a parable. The goat in the
snake. Well, all right. So basically,

1059
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,860
clearly this girl has a little too,
is on a different level than this guy.

1060
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:18,861
And perhaps he should maybe find a girl
that's probably is at some point of life

1061
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:22,290
is going to have the STD
fun pack. You know, what's,

1062
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:27,270
what's included in that front
pack? A little, well, gonorrhea,

1063
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,840
probably some crabs. The starter
kit, the starter kit, you know,

1064
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:35,010
before you move on to the more serious
shit like Bola herps is forever.

1065
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:37,520
So that's pretty interesting.
I would think.

1066
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,550
That sounds like an advertising campaign
for herpes forever. It's forever.

1067
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:45,510
Herps purpose forever.
But don't they have like a,

1068
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:49,200
they have like that medicine you can
take and keep it at bay. Uh, yeah.

1069
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:52,620
That's what they say in the commercials
I like. And if you have an outbreak,

1070
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,710
take more or whatever. I Dunno. I
Dunno what they tell you to do that.

1071
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,280
That coke commercial. It
just scary. It's just like,

1072
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:02,640
you know that just because you've taken
this and you don't have an outbreak

1073
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:04,670
doesn't mean you can't spread it.
Right.

1074
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:07,170
Do you know how happy that
makes me feel to be with you?

1075
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,700
That we don't have the herb but we don't
have the Herp I don't have to worry

1076
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:15,390
about that. It's forever. Right.
Those things. What I was single,

1077
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:19,630
they scared the fucking shit out of me
and I remember then I hear stuff like,

1078
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:23,500
even if you wear a condom, that's
not 100% I was just, Oh my God,

1079
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:24,280
okay.

1080
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,860
Yeah. I go, yes, she's on
my fingers. She's, she's a,

1081
01:05:28,861 --> 01:05:31,090
and this is not, it doesn't seem
like this is the girl for you.

1082
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:35,620
She might be a little too advanced.
Will you stop alligator Armand it,

1083
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,280
this might not be the girl for you.
She's a little too advanced.

1084
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:42,540
This woman is a fucking war pig.
Your House eight arm and not,

1085
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:45,160
I'm trying to be like tender and you know,
Nice.

1086
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,070
You know what alligator arms means?
You don't watch sports. Now I don't.

1087
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,211
You know what?

1088
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,600
I really don't appreciate when I come
down here and having this conversation

1089
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:55,450
with you and you want to
throw these little sports
things that me and you always,

1090
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:58,300
you always say, oh, you don't want sports.
Oh, you didn't get the sports they like,

1091
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:01,930
you'd have to like remind me that I'm
not on the same level as you like,

1092
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:06,700
so I'm not going to get all your amazing
sports references and terms and phrases

1093
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:10,750
and I don't appreciate that.
Can you guys believe that?

1094
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:15,751
Went in 10 minutes of just going on
this rant about how dumb I am and how

1095
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:18,040
innocent I am with using
the word fag and I,

1096
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:21,950
I don't mean you have like an innocent
heart, but you're dumb and you're,

1097
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,370
you just respond with rage the whole way.

1098
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:28,780
You made me this fucking like simpleton.
You'd be doing everything but fucking,

1099
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:32,230
you know, being in a big goof
like, hey, what are you doing?

1100
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:34,870
Look walking on the street like you don't
want accidentally crushed somebody to

1101
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:38,220
death trying to hug them. That's how
you just painted me. You're like, yeah,

1102
01:06:38,221 --> 01:06:41,730
you're like of a, of mice and men.
That's how you're painting me.

1103
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:45,790
Within 10 minutes of this, you're Lenny
and of mice and men. That's how you do.

1104
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,640
Yeah,
that's exactly how you described me.

1105
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:52,370
I'm too dumb to know that
fucking reference cause I,

1106
01:06:52,371 --> 01:06:56,980
I see alligator arm is okay. You've
seen an alligator, right? Yeah.

1107
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:00,700
Do they have long arms now?
They do not. They do not. And
it's basically it's a, uh,

1108
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,740
it's a sports term.

1109
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,533
MMM.

1110
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:07,080
Somebody throws you the ball and you
could actually reach out and get it,

1111
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,290
but you don't totally reach out cause
you're worried about getting hit. Okay.

1112
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,830
Sort of Alex. So you
alligator arms. It's like Ah,

1113
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:17,130
so and if you don't catch the ball, the
guy can't hit you. Oh okay. I thought so.

1114
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:20,190
I'm saying so your alligator arm
and this and that, you're going,

1115
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,620
this girl isn't the girl for
you, but blah blah blah. He's,

1116
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:27,530
he's in there with the fucking pit viper.
Right.

1117
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,670
He's the goat and she's the PS.

1118
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:35,590
He is the STD free goat and he is
walking into a fucking Beta of just,

1119
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,493
I mean,

1120
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:43,430
I mean this girl probably I want to get
it to is just fucking just off for you.

1121
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:48,650
She's not the girl for you. That's bad
advice. Why this girl, I'm telling you,

1122
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,080
you fucking pig.
And you'd have to suppose to do about it.

1123
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:55,050
Tell the whole fucking school
she's not the girl for you.

1124
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:58,440
Move on to somebody else's more
your speed. Why is that bad advice?

1125
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:02,640
Because you're acting like, you
know, she's not into sports,

1126
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,220
likes to eat and as a morning person,

1127
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:11,250
he likes sports and staying up. You know
what? This person isn't like, you know,

1128
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:15,040
this person isn't for you. I
meant as like a foodie. It's like,

1129
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:19,140
it's a simple way of saying that
you know you should move on. That's,

1130
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,370
that's all it is.
No,

1131
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:24,620
it's like you're sitting there with the
toddler and he's about ready to touch a

1132
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:29,090
hot stove. You got to be like, there
has to be a sense of urgency here. Like,

1133
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:33,570
like, no, no, no, no, no. This, this
will hurt you as well. Hope you know,

1134
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,570
you make that little fucking can.
They don't even speak English.

1135
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:38,840
You're trying to fucking, and
they can't, they can't speak yet.

1136
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:41,000
You're trying to fucking fuck.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1137
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,700
You're sitting there talking
to this person like, um, hey,

1138
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:49,190
try some of this sandwich. Yeah, I
didn't really like that bread. Well,

1139
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,100
maybe you'll like this bread like it,
like it's just like this whimsical.

1140
01:08:52,101 --> 01:08:54,170
There's too many Daisy's and
what you're saying, this is,

1141
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,780
this is a very dangerous situation.

1142
01:08:56,781 --> 01:09:00,800
This guy should stay away from this girl
on all fucking and all girls like this.

1143
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:06,620
She's got a, she's on her period and
she has no fucking like, like class.

1144
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:10,480
She has opened so leg,
like what was he supposed to do?

1145
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:15,500
Pull it out and just go off on it.
There's other ways she suggesting anal.

1146
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:19,130
This girl is like up. She's a fucking
mess. Stay away from this girl.

1147
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:22,070
This girl get pregnant.
This girl will give you a fucking disease.

1148
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,340
This girl was steal your laptop
girls a fucking nightmare.

1149
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:31,270
Knock it off. All right. All
right. Advice for a lady.

1150
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,560
Dear Bill, I've been with my
boyfriend for two years now.

1151
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:40,420
We're in college together
and he's currently taking a
semester abroad. Oh Jesus.

1152
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:44,050
Where in Brazil.
Before he left,

1153
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:48,340
we had a running joke that I was going
to need a vibrator when he left as a

1154
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:51,130
surprise party gift.
He got me one.

1155
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:55,810
I have a couple of friends whose
boyfriends bought them sex toys.

1156
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:59,410
So while I was a little surprised,
he actually got me a vibrator.

1157
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,920
I also happen to know that
it's a relatively normal,

1158
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,260
it's relatively normal for a
boyfriend and do that. Yeah.

1159
01:10:05,261 --> 01:10:08,860
That's basically like this
era's chastity belt. You know,

1160
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,230
you're trying to lock down the
pussy. That's disgusting. Yeah. That,

1161
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:16,480
but that's what he's doing now anyway.
Yeah.

1162
01:10:16,481 --> 01:10:18,190
But it's done because those
things are used them too much.

1163
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:21,190
They numb up your area there and then
the guy can't even remotely try and,

1164
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:25,230
you know,
do something for it.

1165
01:10:25,231 --> 01:10:26,690
And then you gotta be
sitting there banging,

1166
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,450
banging them as their user are
using the thing. As, you know,

1167
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,790
it's like you want an alien,
a fucking this girl

1168
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:40,350
that's just all dick has no
body. All right, whatever.

1169
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:43,500
Let's move on one of the base.
Pay Some of my fucking life.

1170
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,540
I did live a little bit of a life before
I met you. I realize that any way,

1171
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,050
fast forward to about a week
ago, we were on Skype. Uh,

1172
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:57,180
he asks you to take this thing out. Um,
no, we don't have sex chats. Thank God.

1173
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:01,620
And he casually asked me how
his gift for me was working out.

1174
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:03,660
I told them it was
working out pretty well.

1175
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:07,320
He then mentioned that he had
bought something for himself,

1176
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,690
a fleshlight

1177
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,990
Joe Rogan experience is brought to
you by the fleshlight every week.

1178
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,480
He does a very weird,
those are very rare.

1179
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,520
Weird fucking okay.
They look like that thing.

1180
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:28,330
Boba Fett I fell into when he died
and one of those space movies. Okay.

1181
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:33,480
Wow. Um, I knew how to be faithful
to right. That's nice. Okay.

1182
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:34,410
He said,
she goes,

1183
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:38,880
I knew what this was because I am an
avid listener of Joe Rogan's podcast.

1184
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,893
How you doing?

1185
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,490
Joe Rogan's come up three times in this
podcast who raves about it constantly.

1186
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:49,230
My boyfriend had never mentioned to me
that he was interested in anything like

1187
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:52,830
that and I always thought the
idea of it was totally creepy.

1188
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:56,220
I acted like it was totally cool,
but in all honesty,

1189
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:01,550
I really don't want him to be
fucking a perfect fake wait,

1190
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,050
I got lost in that.

1191
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,380
I actually was thinking as Joe going
to get mad that I'm saying that this is

1192
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:11,730
weird. Okay. I acted like it was
totally cool, but in all honesty,

1193
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:16,080
I really don't want him to be fucking
of perfect fake vagina whenever he wants

1194
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:16,560
to.

1195
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,560
I'm finding myself getting crazy jealous
and angry whenever I think about it.

1196
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:26,100
I know, I know I'm jealous of an
inanimate object, which seems insane.

1197
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:26,934
Let me finish.

1198
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:31,110
I'm really struggling with this because
part of me wants to be completely okay

1199
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:34,380
with it since it's sort of a hypocrite.

1200
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:37,260
It's sort of hypocritical to get
angry when he got me a vibrator.

1201
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:42,870
But now I'm starting to think that maybe
he only bought me a Dildo so I wouldn't

1202
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:45,720
be able to complete when he
got himself a proxy pussy,

1203
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,920
Pussy.
So what do you think?

1204
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:54,180
Do I need to suck it up and get over
this or is my jealousy legitimate?

1205
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:56,220
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

1206
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:01,120
Um, go fuck is fake pussy. As long
as he's not faking a real pussy.

1207
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:05,650
I mean fucking a real policy and
then you know, it's all good.

1208
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:10,450
Plus you, you, it's not just
like the, the pussy that it's,

1209
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:13,210
that he's missing. He's
also missing like, you know,

1210
01:13:13,211 --> 01:13:16,270
you're touching and kissing and
the whole other part of it too.

1211
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:19,480
And that fake pussy cat low.
Am I there? No, he isn't.

1212
01:13:19,481 --> 01:13:20,770
He's getting right to the dessert.

1213
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:26,000
Don't be jealous. Tried these
Brussels sprouts. Don't need them.

1214
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,080
Don't be jealous.
I bring over the trace late shea,

1215
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:32,860
when he comes back it will be even better
because you both have been like doing

1216
01:13:32,861 --> 01:13:36,940
it with inanimate objects and so I don't
to be rediscovering each other all over

1217
01:13:36,941 --> 01:13:38,980
again. I'll be even better. I
don't think. They don't even worry.

1218
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:39,850
I don't think it's a good thing.

1219
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:43,240
Why?
Because uh,

1220
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:48,010
once you start down a path sexually,
you know,

1221
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:52,180
in order to get off that path, you
don't just jump over onto another path.

1222
01:13:52,181 --> 01:13:54,790
You got to walk all the way
back up the path you went down,

1223
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,210
get to the fork where you fucked up
and then head down the other one.

1224
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:05,580
What I'm saying is he might get used to
just doing that and this sensation of

1225
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:11,740
that is what gets him off. And then when
her pussy doesn't feel like fleshlight,

1226
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,660
he'll, he'll, he'll
build bang her and then,

1227
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:20,080
and then when he needs to
finish, he'll be like, all right,

1228
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,510
and now for me and what that fucking thing

1229
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,130
better. If anything,
he'll be like, oh my God,

1230
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:30,880
I forgot what a real woman feels like
and he'll be done in like two minutes.

1231
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,660
What's your hope?
Um,

1232
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:36,700
I don't think she should be
jealous of it though. They're both,

1233
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:40,180
they're both doing the right thing when
you're in a relationship and you're that

1234
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:45,160
far apart from each other because he did
bang all sorts of Harry European girls,

1235
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:48,410
no offense to hear European girls,
but I'm just saying, you know, well

1236
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:53,420
listen, I watched this thing one time
or listen to it on the radio, uh,

1237
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:58,421
one of those call sex shows
and this guy had a pull away.

1238
01:14:58,731 --> 01:15:01,370
He jerked off cause he dry hump the rug.

1239
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:05,060
It was causing like chafing on
his dick and it, but it, it,

1240
01:15:05,061 --> 01:15:08,350
it was the only way he could get off
because he wasn't in a relationship for a

1241
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:11,210
while and he kept doing that and I dunno.

1242
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,300
So I'm just saying like I would go
easy on those. It's like anything,

1243
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:15,290
anything in moderation.

1244
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:19,220
How often is he using this and
how often is she using that?

1245
01:15:19,221 --> 01:15:21,710
If you use a vibrating too much,
you numb yourself up down there.

1246
01:15:21,711 --> 01:15:24,320
And then when you guys down there
that he can't feel anything.

1247
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:29,570
It's so disgusting. Um, overrated.
Underrated for the week.

1248
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,580
Overrated.
The Superbowl,

1249
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:35,260
underrated rounds one and two
of the NFL playoffs build.

1250
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,220
This may be sacrilegious
to say in America,

1251
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:41,540
but I actually enjoy rounds one and
two of the NFL playoffs more than the

1252
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:42,410
Superbowl.

1253
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:46,700
That is a sector religious because at no
point is beyond say or Brittany Spears

1254
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:52,430
sing before and in the
halftime show there's not a
bunch of douchebags who don't

1255
01:15:52,431 --> 01:15:56,600
like football showing up feeling
like they have to be there. You know,

1256
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,140
all the broads. Why did you look?
Yeah, why are you looking at me?

1257
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:04,160
Cause you go to super bowl parties
every year and you hate football. Yeah.

1258
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:08,390
Well they're fun. They're nice
gatherings. Talk when the game's on. No,

1259
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:13,370
I don't run. Yap. When the
most important game is on,

1260
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,780
it's disgusting.

1261
01:16:14,781 --> 01:16:19,781
If you do it again this
year we're breaking up each
week you get two games both

1262
01:16:19,821 --> 01:16:23,870
on Saturday and Sunday. There seems
to be that we can win this thing,

1263
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:27,590
excitement in the air and I can relax
and watch the games and the comfort of my

1264
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:32,120
home or at a local bar without dozens
of non-fans in the room as is typically

1265
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:35,600
the case of the Superbowl party Superbowl
and the other hand has become so

1266
01:16:35,601 --> 01:16:36,980
pretentious in recent years.

1267
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,670
I don't even really want to get
worked up for it as much as I used to.

1268
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,290
The game takes forever.

1269
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:47,090
85% of the commercial sucks and we're
forced to stare at Madonna's beat up face

1270
01:16:47,091 --> 01:16:51,140
for 30 minutes during a halftime show
plus the two week gap in between the

1271
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:54,950
Superbowl and the conference champion
really takes the air out of the sales.

1272
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,140
What are your thoughts?
I think this is what you do.

1273
01:16:57,141 --> 01:17:02,141
You watch the Superbowl alone and you
tape it and you start watching it,

1274
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:05,390
you DVR it and you watch,

1275
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:08,480
you let you let you give the
game a 90 minute headstart

1276
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,540
and then then you just sit down,

1277
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:16,541
you watch it by yourself and you plow
through the pregame and you just watch the

1278
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:19,520
fucking game and when
the halftime show comes,

1279
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:24,140
you fast forward through that and now
you're under the third quarter and third

1280
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,540
quarter and fourth quarter it's
going to be regular time football.

1281
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,120
That's the way to watch the Superbowl
and you watch it by yourself.

1282
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:33,050
Maybe with another buddy of
yours who that enjoys the game.

1283
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:36,020
That's how I would do it.
You know?

1284
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,620
No thoughts on that? No. But
what about the social aspects?

1285
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:46,660
You're going to have brownies
during the oak cheese doodles.

1286
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:48,641
Oh my God.

1287
01:17:48,641 --> 01:17:51,600
The way the broads talked to her and
that fucking game and then and then and

1288
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,770
it's true. Shuts up to watch
the commercials and then,

1289
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,950
and then the game comes back on. The
third one was late. What did you think?

1290
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:04,440
Well that's definitely the best one
so far. How much did that cost? Well,

1291
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:07,860
why don't you stop going to the
Superbowl parties, Matt and bill,

1292
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,830
why don't you stop if you don't like
the game. I don't do any of that.

1293
01:18:11,831 --> 01:18:13,910
So that you're talking about,
I don't, I don't like needles.

1294
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:17,330
I don't go to your fucking
metapoint party book. Two needles.

1295
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,740
They don't do anything. What
do you do? Arts and crafts.

1296
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:24,520
I don't crash the Superbowl or those
things and come there and talk when you're

1297
01:18:24,521 --> 01:18:27,970
trying to glue the popsicle sticks
together and then shut the fuck up.

1298
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,740
When a talk throughout the game,

1299
01:18:29,741 --> 01:18:33,660
I go in the other room or I hang out
with other people if they're lies. Lies,

1300
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:38,770
lies. Yeah. That's the
Monday morning podcast.

1301
01:18:38,771 --> 01:18:42,580
Oh, before I get outta here.
Oh, that's it. That's it.
Where he did a nice long one.

1302
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,570
All right. No. Okay.

1303
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:48,990
Um, amazon.com everybody,

1306
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:00,960
Um, what would it be called? The little
box. A little window thing. The little,

1307
01:19:00,961 --> 01:19:04,050
a little icon. You Click on that thing.

1308

Banner ad.

1310
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:12,140

it to the wounded warriors project. You,

1311
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:16,350

warriors. See that's it. Everybody.

1312
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:20,640
That's the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves. And uh, yeah.

1313
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,710
You ever get with a girl?
And she spreads her leg with the,

1314
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:25,270
the rip cord there. All right. You're the,

1315
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,790
she's a snake. Get the fuck
out of the cage. See you.
