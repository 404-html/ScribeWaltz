1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,520
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:06,000
It's bill burn his time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:10,920
December 21st, 2050. What's going on?

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:15,270
How are you? Hey, it's
almost the end of the year.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,890
Did I take time out to say thanks.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,580
Thank you for being, you
know, bringing your vibe.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,420
Um, seriously, I want to thank everybody
who's been watching. F is for family.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,070
All right. Now, Netflix doesn't give
out any ratings, you know, lonely.

9
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,160
They keep them, they keep
them to themselves. You know,

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,840
like a fat kid with cookies.
You know, they don't,

11
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,920
they don't tell anybody what's going on.
So I have no idea.

12
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,870
All I can judge by is the,
uh,

13
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:46,200
the feedback you guys have been
giving me on Twitter, Facebook,

14
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:49,070
and wherever the hell else you guys are.
Right?

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,640
And now you guys seem to be liking it.

16
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,490
So thank you so much for
watching the God damn show.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,470
Please tell your friends about it. I'm
very happy that people are enjoying it.

18
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:03,210
We worked our asses off on it. So with
that, let's get on with the podcast.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,120
Um, as you know, it's really late today.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
You no later than it usually is.
Um, I just have family in town and,

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,870
um,
I dunno.

22
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,230
They're like regular people
so they sleep and um,

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,420
you know, they sleep and they sleep
and they sleep. And I am, I don't,

24
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,221
I don't get it.
I mean,

25
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:28,221
I go to bed after I go to bed after
regular people and I wake up before them,

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,800
you know, it's probably
because they're like, I dunno,

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,900
more just at peace with themselves
so they could just keep sleeping.

28
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,590
But my brain keeps going on how's
the whole fucking night? So I mean,

29
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:44,910
I can get about six hours and then I got
to get up and start doing something or

30
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,660
I go absolutely fucking insane. So, um,

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,530
I wasn't able to record this morning
because everybody was still sleeping and I

32
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,630
do walk around and be on eggshells.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,380
So of course I'm on the phone with
Versie and we yelling about sports and,

34
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:04,980
uh, my wife came out and
let me know, you know,

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,900
you got to stop walking around
screaming at the top of your lungs,

36
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:13,410
into your phone,
having sports arguments with people.

37
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:17,010
You do it at all hours of the day.
You have people on,

38
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,360
on speaker and you're screaming about
sports and it's really affecting the

39
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:25,530
environment in the house. Now, if I was a
mature adult, I'd be like, you know what?

40
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:27,990
You're absolutely right.
I should be considerate.

41
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,100
I can only imagine if you were walking
around screaming about all the Shit you

42
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:36,990
watch on Bravo TV,
that unbelievably fucking,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,620
I don't just do void of any sort of
intellect than that fucking cunt of a

44
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,860
channel. I swear to God,
if I knew somebody in,

45
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:48,870
in the CIA,

46
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,940
I bet it goes Isis and then Bravo TV
and then whoever's the fight or no,

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,760
I don't know who would be the next
person that's going to go after.

48
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,000
It's just as far as
like, you know, fucking

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,400
up this country. Isis, Bravo TV, Eh,

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,470
uh, I don't know. Bravo TV's.

51
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,710
That's a broad brush that gets rid
of a lot of people. But anyways,

52
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,250
so if I was a mature adult, I would
have just been like, you know what?

53
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:18,000
You're absolutely right. But instead,
what did I say? I said, well, you know,

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
you fucking sleep all day. You
sleep. They'll like, you know,

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,370
all hours of the day and I
get to walk around tippy toe.

56
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,400
And she was just like talking about that.

57
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,580
It's like, yeah, well I am. I'm talking
about that. Why are you talking about it?

58
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,630
Because I know you're right in the
other area that the of the debate.

59
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,240
So I already have a new year's resolution,

60
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:42,410
no more screaming on my phone
in the house about sports TV.

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,270
And there you go.
Once again,

62
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:47,900
I'll work on myself as a human being and
slowly stopped being the bill that you

63
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:51,280
know and love and I'll become
that thing they want you to be.

64
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:55,730
And one day they wake up, they
go, oh, work's done. I'm bored.

65
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,360
I think I'll go blow somebody else.
And you know what? That's, you know,

66
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,050
that's the trajectory of most marriages.
You know,

67
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,780
everything they liked about you,
they start to fucking hate.

68
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,160
Then they fix it and then they deal.

69
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:10,700
You're somebody different than they
walked down the street just given handies

70
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:14,240
who wants one,
who gets jobs?

71
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,440
The married woman coming down

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,473
street

73
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,370
took my dog for a walk today all the
way around the block and it didn't ship

74
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:29,080
once. It's just, you know, it
usually shits like two, three times.

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,700
So I got all paranoid and I was looking
around the house trying to find dog shit.

76
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:34,810
I couldn't find it anywhere.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,910
Then I was thinking like did it shit his
braids out the day before. So they just,

78
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,030
it's got nothing left. I don't
know. You know something.

79
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,560
This might be one for veterinarian.

80
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,670
Maybe I should call him my brother and
just talking the fuck in the empty space

81
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:52,390
of podcasting. That's
right. Podcast. I did that.

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,110
A fighter and the kid
Brian Collins podcast.

83
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,130
I did that earlier today.
So look for that.

84
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,280
You probably wonder what Jesus belt,
why are you so fucking lethargic?

85
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,880
Cause because you only get six hours
sleep now because me and a buddy of mine

86
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:13,600
went to a burger place that
somebody suggested down in watts.

87
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,410
La is in the watts riots.
That's your reason why people,

88
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,800
white people know about watch.

89
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:23,020
They got a hamburger place down there
called Hawkins and we went down there,

90
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,210
there was three of us. Why does fuck,
why does fuck a new show on Bravo?

91
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,400
Um, and we drove down there and uh, we
were all laughing, just going, all right,

92
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:37,510
three of the whities people ever
going to go down to watch, you know,

93
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,450
are we going to get mugged his
second we get out of the car?

94
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,970
Are they going to think we're cops? You
know, all the scared white guy thinks.

95
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:46,640
And then we showed up and was staring
at the fucking menu and this guy just,

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,900
hey, is this your first
time here? Or we go, yeah.

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,450
Then they go first timers and everything.
Kitchen yelled at, well, I don't know.

98
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,500
Kids came look at after school special.
It was hilarious.

99
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,960
And then as a white person you're like,
Oh really? Isn't that down? I get it. No,

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,560
almost in my thoughts are just fear based.
Right?

101
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,400
And then there's always that one dude's
just got to fuck it up for everybody.

102
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,530
Right. It's guy showed up.
Fucking weird, weird vibe.

103
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,680
Had a US air force bag.

104
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,160
He just sort of left it in the middle
of the area where we eating and then

105
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,780
walked away from it.
Sat in the corner,

106
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,410
was sort of staring at us and he was
eating peanuts. He wasn't eating a burger.

107
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,550
And then he walked outside and walked
around to the open window area where we

108
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:33,050
were at. And then he offered us peanuts.
We were like, no thank you. We would,

109
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,430
we don't want any of your peanuts.

110
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,330
And then we sort of finished up and we
went to leave and he was staring at us

111
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,890
and he wrote down our
license plate number.

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,860
Ah, it's awful. It's awful
what go into war does to you.

113
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:52,190
But I think he was super
fucking paranoid already. Um,

114
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm bummed piecing it together.

115
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:56,180
I certainly wasn't gonna
have a conversation with
the guy was judging by the,

116
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:00,950
the, the US air force bag
and then, uh, you know,

117
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,780
the paranoid behavior

118
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,640
and he had something on his fucking risks.

119
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:09,770
Like he get fucked up his
wrist or something like
that. I have no fucking idea.

120
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,470
But all I can tell you is I'm going to
go back there again because it was the

121
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,680
best guy, Dan Berger. I think I might
be the best Burger I've ever had,

122
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,690
but Jesus fucking Christ, it's
the size of a football. Um,

123
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,430
and you know, if you're a goal
oriented person, you know,

124
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,580
you're going to get about three bites
and going, holy fuck, this is delicious.

125
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,120
You're going to get halfway through
and you're going to be like, dude,

126
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,430
do I win a tee shirt if I
finish this thing? And then
finally just like, you know,

127
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:38,570
I, I can't, I got to finish this
thing. Ah, fries are delicious.

128
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,080
I got the,
uh,

129
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,420
the fat burger with egg
and it was outstanding.

130
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,250
Um, it's called Hawkins. It's right
off of south central I believe.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,860
And uh, it was fucking
delicious. And I was like, thank
God, because I was bringing,

132
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,371
you know,

133
00:07:55,371 --> 00:08:00,230
it was a recommendation from a couple
of people I met when I did yet another

134
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:04,790
failed pilot. And, uh, you know,

135
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,870
I love meeting people that are actually
from Los Angeles because they love Los

136
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,290
Angeles. And then they know all
the cool places to go. So, um,

137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,700
most people who are transplants like me
stay basically in the Hollywood valley

138
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,820
area. So I asked these guys, I'm like,
give me something. What do you got?

139
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:22,220
What do you guys say you want to,
you want to fucking, you know,

140
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,490
you want to try something? Go and go
down to watts. We went down there,

141
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,160
it was absolutely fucking delicious,
but I'll tell you this right now,

142
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:32,360
I am paying for it. Uh, there's no
way you won't fit. If you're smart,

143
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:35,390
you'll go down, then you'll split one. Um,

144
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,610
but if you listening to this podcast,

145
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:41,300
you're probably not smart and you're
going to order one yourself and you're

146
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:45,530
going to, you're going to
do what I just did. And, uh,

147
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,700
but it's a wonderful experience until
you get right to the end and your body

148
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:53,630
keeps saying, stop it. Stop it. What are
you doing? Stop it. And you just can't,

149
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,060
you just keep fucking shovel
and in your face and then

150
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,690
you just lean in on something,
you and on something. You're like,

151
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,550
why did I just do that? Uh, I got,

152
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,190
I got to be on the fucking
elliptical for nine years,

153
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,510
and then all of a sudden a fucking air
force veterans off and your peanuts and

154
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:10,880
you want to stay and say, no,
you want to stand up straight.

155
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,220
Like you're somebody that
can't be fucked with, you know,

156
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,580
and you just can't do it.

157
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:19,780
And you just lean in there and then maybe
it comes off as confidence and maybe

158
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:22,390
that's why it leaves you alone.
I have no fucking idea. But, um,

159
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,150
oh my God, my mouth is dry. There was
so much fucking salt and me right now,

160
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,930
you know, Jesus Christ. But you know what?
It was worth it. I was actually site,

161
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:36,930
they went down there and watch this
great documentary, which of course,

162
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:41,160
I can't remember the name of it,
but forest, where did the, uh,

163
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,840
the, uh, the narration on it
and it was all about, mmm,

164
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,840
the history of Los Angeles and the
gangs and all of that stuff and police

165
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:50,320
violence and everything.
And um,

166
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,650
it actually broke down all those different
areas that you always hear about it,

167
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,770
you know? Oh, you able saw straight
outta Compton and actually know where,

168
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,230
where Compton is. You know
what I mean? It's ridiculous.

169
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,880
It's one of the great
groups of all fucking time.

170
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:08,510
He should know where it is and it's
La is just so fucking weird like that.

171
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,380
They pave over their history. Then I'll
fucking tell you where anything is.

172
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,070
It's all about the highways.

173
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,970
Take the four oh five to the 10
you guys have watched, said SNL,

174
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:21,380
sketch the cow for onions.
Right. And they'd be like, Devin,

175
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,190
like that sketch was so fucking accurate
as far as like everybody's obsessed

176
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:33,170
with like, uh, when did you come
from and where do you live in?

177
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:36,800
It's always, ah, I took the one
oh five to the one 10 to the 60,

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,950
you know,
got off at fucking Mulholland.

179
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,890
It's all obsession about how to get it.
Uh,

180
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,840
I know how you got somewhere because
of this fucking Alicia's traffic.

181
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:50,200
So anyways,
I am a,

182
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,910
I am full of salt right now and I am not
going to eat again until breakfast time.

183
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,580
Morrow. Ah, fuck. Ah, but it was worth it.

184
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,140
It was fucking worth it.
I had like one bite of that and I'm like,

185
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,940
I am bringing Nia here tomorrow.

186
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,460
And then I got halfway through
the Burger and I was like,

187
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:10,970
I am bringing Nia here in about a month.

188
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,760
And then I finished it and I was just
like, in six months when I'm not full,

189
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,690
what am I full again?
I'm so fucking full right now.

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,720
I can't even finish my sentences.
Oh,

191
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:27,170
it was Gloria said it's really a feeling
that so few people in the world. No,

192
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,620
most people are starving, you know? So
I'm trying to feel privileged right now,

193
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:33,710
even though it's a big part
of me wants to kill myself.

194
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh,
it hurts to laugh.

195
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,100
Jesus Christ now was Thanksgiving between
two bucks. It was fucking my buddy.

196
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:46,280
One of my buddies had a pastrami
sandwich. He said, I'm three bites in.

197
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:47,600
I still haven't made it to the bud.

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,530
He was smart enough to stop
me and my other friend just,

199
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,100
we just kept going and he had to fucking

200
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,730
drive.
I wanted real client ran,

201
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:01,330
wanted to recline the seat so fucking bad.
But I was afraid that if I were Clyde,

202
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,450
it was all going to come
up. All right, Bill enough,

203
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:08,200
you talked about dog shitting
in overeating. Is this
supposed to be exciting?

204
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,610
Well,
it's that time of year.

205
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,150
It's that time of year when you can say
come on and eat a man hole size fucking

206
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,400
burger. It was incredible.
Um, so anyways, what's,

207
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:22,630
why don't we,
uh,

208
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,070
why don't we talk about some shit
other than dog shitting in a meeting,

209
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:31,720
an oversized burger.
Um, AH, stupid password.

210
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:35,950
I can never reopen thing.
Still fucked it up.

211
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,810
Uh, how about the, uh,

212
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,920
how about those New England
patriots sort of limping along?

213
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,510
Um, I don't think we're going to
do any damage this year. I really,

214
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:48,130
I just don't think it's our fucking year,
man.

215
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,810
We just got too many injuries and uh,
I watched the giants panthers,

216
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,820
as I mentioned, I, when I was promoting
the F is for family. Last week,

217
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,860
I got to do rich eyes and show.

218
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,180
I called in and I was talking about how
I thought the giants panthers game was

219
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:09,181
going to be the game of the week is far
as either the giants turned the fucking

220
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:09,911
corner,

221
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:13,420
like they always seem to in December and
make one of those great playoff runs to

222
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:16,250
spite their record.
Um,

223
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,800
or the panthers are going to basically
go into feed it and win the super bowl.

224
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,040
That's what the fuck I was saying. Of
course. Who and what do, what do I know?

225
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,741
Just a comedian.

226
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:27,280
But I watched the game was a great game
and of course everybody was freaking out

227
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:31,060
about Odell Beckham in.
I was a guy, Norman, um,

228
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,500
I can't believe back of didn't get
fucking injected, you know what I mean?

229
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,270
I swear to God that was
fucking unbelievable. But
however though a lot of me,

230
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:43,310
I really enjoyed it. I loved them
getting each other's fate. I didn't,

231
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,440
I didn't like him launching him helmet
to helmet, that type of hit. But, uh,

232
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,140
I was talking to another friend of mine,

233
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:54,310
I said it reminded me of Mel Blunt and
Golden Richards back in the day except

234
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:57,280
golden. Richard's fought back. Um,

235
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,260
but it's interesting cause Beckham kind
of acted like a big fucking baby cause

236
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,640
he wasn't getting any catches just cause
he got roughed up a little bit. And uh,

237
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,900
I kind of agree with a w I hope
I'm saying his name right. Becca.

238
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:15,410
Was it not a pack of, I mean a
Norman, right. Ah Fuck there.

239
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:20,190
Why don't you look up shit before you
fucking start talking about it then you've

240
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:24,520
got to type with one index finger and
that's not fun for anybody. Right.

241
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,450
Um, yeah. Josh Norman, he said he
kind of cracked the code on him.

242
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,210
You get under his skin a little bit.
So I think,

243
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:34,750
I think more people are going to try to
fuck with back home cause God knows if

244
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,480
he just tried to cover him.
You can't, you can't do it.

245
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,230
The, once again, the football
gods love the giants.

246
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,130
They love him.
How to fuck do you get away?

247
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:52,500
This guy ran like fucking 30
and just jumped in the air,

248
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,930
headfirst into another guy's fucking help,

249
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:58,730
I guess because it was away from
the play. They didn't see it. Um,

250
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,270
three personal files.
I Dunno.

251
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,220
You know what it really comes down to
you as you know much as all you can. Oh,

252
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,520
the fucking Brady rule.
There really is the superstar rule.

253
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:13,080
If you're a fucking superstar Rican,
throw that guy out of that game. You know,

254
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,483
you couldn't do it.

255
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,180
He's one of the superstars saying they
need to make their money first and then

256
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:20,970
about 50 other things and then
they try to protect the players.

257
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:23,160
Cause even now that the fact that
they're trying to protect players,

258
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:27,150
why are they protect him? Flip protecting
their wallets now that everybody there.

259
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
What's that from?
No,

260
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,060
you are looking at a man that doesn't
judge another man by the size of his

261
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,360
go on what movie?
Fucking Wall Street doe.

262
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,840
Charlie's Shay doing that
scene with his fucking fuck

263
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,830
with Martin Sheen. Right. Oh, Bud Fox. Um,

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,391
anyways,

265
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:59,391
but I was texting back and forth
between Versie and Yannis Pappas and uh,

266
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,130
you know, they kept doing this,
you know, this isn't, you know,

267
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:06,450
what did giants are coming back and this
is New York, this is what New York does.

268
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:09,060
And I was just writing.
Eli is from Louisiana.

269
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,710
You know that state met part of the
country that all New Yorkers looked down

270
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:18,630
upon. You know, he's, he
just country walk Louisiana.

271
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,610
That's who the fuck he is.
All right.

272
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,260
He's yet another Non New Yorker
who came to New York and took over.

273
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,860
Because when you look at the
competition, come on man. You know,

274
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,990
I'm just talking about white people here.
Okay?

275
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,810
I'm not talking about other fucking
ethnicities because I don't know what you

276
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:36,030
guys are bringing to the table.
I don't pretend to know.

277
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,860
Every once in a while
listen to your music.

278
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,470
I tapped my toes and that's
about the extent of it. Well,

279
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:43,410
maybe I'd come down and eat your food.
That's about it. But other than that,

280
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:44,340
I'm pretty fucking white.

281
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,780
So all I know is the white people in
New York at generally speaking you it,

282
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,460
it's not reason not real deep.

283
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:54,890
Most of those cuts down Wall Street and
not from New York. The jerk off finance,

284
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,250
finance majors from all around the country
go down there and start knocking on

285
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,100
the bone. And what does New York do
about it? They don't do a fucking thing.

286
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,730
They went from gangs in New York when
people just walking around with hatchets

287
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,130
and shit to, to now, it's
just, it's a fucking cake walk.

288
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,600
It's like when a Pachino said this is
like one big pole. Wait, no, they'll fuck.

289
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,070
That's what New York is.
And then if you go there and you succeed,

290
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:21,090
then they say you're a New Yorker.
You know what I mean? Pad It.

291
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,770
New York is such pds.
It's fucking ridiculous nowadays.

292
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:27,360
At least with white people, I'm
telling, you know what I mean?

293
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,890
All of great rappers obviously,

294
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,130
and basketball stars and that
type of shift come from New York.

295
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:34,050
But other than that,
white people are generally speaking,

296
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,590
the average white New York. I'm telling
you, it's just, and he's not bringing it.

297
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,470
He's standing outside of a tad stakes.
You know,

298
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:45,471
when his sweatpants got his little fucking
Sony Walkman on listening to Alicia

299
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:46,674
keys.

300
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,860
Oh,
do woo.

301
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,890
You know, thinking you're a part of
it. You're not a part of it. You just,

302
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,740
you just one of the ants running around

303
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,670
Frank Sinatra's from Hoboken,
New Jersey.

304
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:04,180
He's bridge and fucking tunnel and he
came in and took over your fucking city.

305
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,710
All right.

306
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Eli Manning breathes through
his fucking mouth and he looks,

307
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,880
he looks like a five year old in a
football uniform. He died. Just does,

308
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,390
it's got no style of the man
wears dockers for Christ's sake.

309
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,100
And he comes in there and look at them.

310
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,420
He's lining up under center.
Um,

311
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,360
anyways, why am I shitting all over
them? I actually fucking love the giants.

312
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,270
I do have to tell you though, a
Jew Jpp that fucking, you know,

313
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,090
that wrap that he now has on his hand.

314
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,910
It looks like he's holding a
fucking frying pan. I swear to God.

315
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,260
If somebody on the Patriots deflected
one pass with that fucking thing,

316
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:46,650
it would be illegal and we
would lose draft picks and I'm,

317
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,740
I'm doing that every week from now on.
That's going to be my new fucking thing.

318
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:51,640
I'll tell you right now.

319
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,830
Did you see when he knocked down that
passed with the fucking bulk of that,

320
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:00,070
that bandage on his wrist?

321
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,470
I'm telling you that's his
new move rather than second.

322
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,700
That wasting his energy,
sacking the quarterback.

323
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,000
You just hold up that
giant fucking stop sign.

324
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,620
It's an incredible,
you know,

325
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:16,820
obviously it's fucking tragic and I am
trying to make light of it because I,

326
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,470
I honestly feel,
you know,

327
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,340
it's just a fucking horrible that that
accident had to happen. But you know,

328
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,790
then all of a sudden the team you want
to win throws a ball and he fucking puts

329
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,780
his hand up in, you know, all the sympathy
goes out the one do you like, dude,

330
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:31,850
what the fuck is that legal?

331
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,140
He's like holding up one of those
giant light bulbs, you know,

332
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,850
that using science experiments.

333
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,853
MMM.

334
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,900
Anyways, I mean it's almost as
big as my head. I'll tell you,

335
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:48,350
if you could somehow wrap my head
around your fucking hand, you know,

336
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,070
and stuck it up, you, you wouldn't, you
would lead the league in a past defenses.

337
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,940
Is that what they call them?
I Dunno what they call them.

338
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:01,010
All I know is I really enjoyed that war
between a Norman and a Odell Beckham and

339
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:01,531
I loved it.

340
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:04,260
Norman called him a bitch at the end of
the game and I don't think he should be

341
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,500
fine. Obviously Odell should, you know,

342
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,740
you can't jump off you fucking feed
like that doing a sailor's dive into the

343
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:15,180
side of somebody's fucking ear hole.
What are you thinking?

344
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,900
You know what I mean? But I swear
to God, it reminds me of Mel Blunt,

345
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,190
Golden Richards. Golden
Richards had blonde hair just
like a Dell Becca, you know?

346
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,990
No, you don't know that. Well, you
know something. I do something.

347
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:28,890
I like to think about it.

348
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,873
MMM.

349
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,090
Oh fuck. I'm so God damn full.
This is so stupid though. Why? Why,

350
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:36,650
why did I do this by the way?
I always,

351
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:39,540
I always forget to do the c out of the
podcast. Email, ladies and gentleman,

352
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,550
the podcast email is bill at
the [inaudible] podcast.com
bill@themmpodcast.com.

353
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,850
Um, oh my God, I'm sorry guys, I
got to keep fucking drinking water.

354
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm so full of fucking salt right now.
I'm just talking to a buddy of mine.

355
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,910
He thought he had a tapeworm

356
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,580
swear to God they should be. You know
what you know like, you know what?

357
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,950
Sell like fucking hotcakes
right around this time of year

358
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,040
tapeworms that we're almost at the end
of their lives and if he could just

359
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,920
somehow force it down,
you know,

360
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,660
and just during the holiday season you
eat like a fucking animal and it eats 90%

361
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,860
of the nutrition and then it just fucking
keels over and dies like Marlon Brando

362
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,240
when he's out in the garden with his son
or his grandson.

363
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,290
Wouldn't it be great? Then you can just
eat and drink like a fucking maniac.

364
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:44,291
And this tape warm just takes it all
and then it dies and then you know,

365
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,810
for the next couple of weeks
when you have to go to the potty,

366
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:48,110
he just don't turn around and look

367
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,830
the most disgusting fucking
podcast I've ever done. I'm sorry.

368
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:59,510
I started off with dog shit and I mean,
where do I go? He can't make a comeback.

369
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:03,530
He might as well borrow a
little further into it. Right.

370
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,421
Um,

371
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:08,360
is there anything worse than when you go
out to take your dog on a fucking hour

372
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,110
and a half hike and you realize you
only have one shitbag left, you know,

373
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,770
then you've got to make that decision.
I'm either going to leave some stuff,

374
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:19,910
I'm going to leave some behind like
Willem defoe and platoon or I'm going to

375
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:23,810
have to get, try to get creative
and that shit in the bag.

376
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,900
And then he got dropped the shit out onto
the new shit and then you just fucking

377
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:31,340
did it as just, it's a, it's
a fucking nightmare. Oh God.

378
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,390
How gross can this become? I just,
is there any women's still listening?

379
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,410
This is disgusting. Are you like this
guy? You think it's guides? Funny.

380
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,470
Shut up Margaret. Shut
up. All right. Anyway,

381
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,060
a woman right now yelling you
husband or boyfriend right now.

382
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:51,830
You need to stand the fuck
down. Okay? You know what?

383
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:54,140
You're going to make them do
this fucking holiday season.

384
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,910
Let them man listen to a fucking
podcast for Christ's sake. Look at him.

385
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,550
He's going to die eight
years before you can.

386
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:04,050
Can you have a heart and
be nice to him on average,

387
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,860
she's going to die eight years before you.
That's the deal.

388
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:11,780
I should like Dick Van Dyke,
90 years old and he's still dancing.

389
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,350
Still got the light and his iron man.
It fucking guy was sharp as hell.

390
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:20,180
I think that's the key to it
is dancing. Is it? I Dunno.

391
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,440
Maybe figuratively dance
thing in your heart.

392
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,810
Walking down the street. Just still
hearing the birds Chirp. Sorry.

393
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,690
Oh my God. Oh fuck.
I'm going to take a on.

394
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:34,911
You know what?

395
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:39,020
I may walk down to the comedy store
tonight and then I'm going to get all the

396
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:41,240
way down. They bill. You want to
go on stage? I can't. I can't.

397
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,030
I'm just going to turn around and
walk back. You know what a great idea.

398
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,290
What do I care? Nobody fucking new ideas
right now, do I? I don't think I did.

399
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,530
I think I had that. Then we've got a
couple, two or three. I have no idea. Hey,

400
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,840
how about I reach a little bit
of advertising for you guys? Huh?

401
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,380
You think I read bad one
a fucking regular day?

402
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:02,230
Forget about when I got a whole giant
Burger in me. Oh my God. It was good.

403
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,340
Holy fucking shit. Was it
delicious? I can't wait to go back.

404
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,320
Yeah. Is it alright to just be
bulimic every once in a while?

405
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,220
That would've been a great time.

406
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,680
Do it. Oh my God. That
was delicious, right?

407
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,260

You gotta be one thing. If they did that
almost sound like an old man right now.

540
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:28,883
MMM.

541
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,150
Anyways, I did a, uh,

542
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,900
mentioned,
oh fuck.

543
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,060
It's really is not a good feeling,
man. It was people. But, you

544
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,950
know,
I just,

545
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,230
I recommend not doing a podcast right
after you fucking eat one of these goddamn

546
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:50,160
things. Um, oh my God.

547
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:54,960
So anyways, like I mentioned, I did, uh,
I did fighter and the kid podcast today,

548
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,460
and when Brian Callen wasn't talking
about his amazing athletic physique,

549
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,860
I was talking, trying to talk
to a professional fighter. Uh,

550
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,930
Brendan Shab always said
his last name correctly. Um,

551
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,520
and I was just fascinated with the
ability to slip a punch and how they just

552
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,260
stare at the center of your chest and
look for some movement in your shoulders

553
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:20,670
and they're able to somehow slipped the
fucking punch. It was amazing to me.

554
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:24,120
We talked about cauliflower ears
and at what points you're not,

555
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:28,410
you can't drain them anymore because I
guess initially it's blood and then it

556
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:33,150
turns all fucking had. Um, I dunno,

557
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,640
that's probably more interesting than
anything that I fucking talked about.

558
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,670
But in everybody fights for a living man,
I wanted to talk more about that.

559
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:43,010
I hope I get to do the podcast again cause
if it's just a way to get Brian Count

560
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:47,730
is stop talking about himself,
there's somehow a way to do that.

561
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,970
Um, I had a lot of interesting
questions but you know,

562
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,160
Brian's somehow gets himself in between
you and the interesting thing that could

563
00:33:56,161 --> 00:34:01,161
actually happen and he just has to
talk about is a geometric shape,

564
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:07,470
which I believe he described as an
upside down triangle being screwed into

565
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,510
something else. I don't
know. Manly an old TV tube.

566
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,650
I forgot what he described as lower
portion of his body, but you know,

567
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,890
it's just one description after
another about his amazing physique.

568
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,420
I'm fucking with the OCL. See
Brown county. Um, so listen
to that this week. And uh,

569
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:24,841
with that,

570
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:27,660
why don't I get into the fucking
questions before I literally fall asleep.

571
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,810
Alright. Uh, Terry Reed, everybody,
I don't know who that is.

572
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:36,630
I know Tara Reid, Rita's
Terry Reid. Hey there,

573
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,510
Billy Bilbo Baggins.

574
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,130
Just wondering if you ever
heard of Terry Reed. Uh,

575
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:46,730
he was offered by Jimmy page to be
the front man to his new yard birds.

576
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,770
Yeah.
Birds Band

577
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,640
and said that he had a couple of guys
that would be better for the job.

578
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,950
Robert Plant and John Bonham.

579
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,540
I love this story and I love Terry's
music. If you hadn't heard his stuff,

580
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:05,160
checkout seed of memory,
uh, to be treated right.

581
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,600
And Dean are my favorites.
I guess there's a documentary.

582
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:12,960
Super lungs is coming out soon anyways,

583
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:16,500
I've never heard you mentioned it before
and thought it'd be right up your alley.

584
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,270
Oh, well that's amazing. You know,

585
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:20,370
there's a bunch of those
kinds of fucking stories.

586
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,930
Like somebody sent me one recently,
I think I might've talked about it,

587
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:29,931
about a guy who filled in for Ringo
Starr for like two weeks at the height of

588
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,150
Beatle Mania.
Ringo had like tonsillitis or something.

589
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,110
And of course it was the early 60
[inaudible] so it was damn near fatal.

590
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,450
You know what I mean?
He had it yet.

591
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:43,870
I like fucking go to some witch
doctor Assam Shit to get cured.

592
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:48,871
So they had this other guy sit in and
he went from complete nobody to being

593
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:51,190
totally famous in every chicken,

594
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:56,191
the world that couldn't fuck
Lennon McCartney or fucking
Harrison was jumping on

595
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:01,840
his dick and then the whole fucking thing
ended two weeks later and no one knew

596
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:06,510
who he was. And he was just
like, what the fuck was that? Um,

597
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,300
and I guess, you know, he didn't
want to make a documentary out of it,

598
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,260
but I recently,
I was,

599
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:16,660
I was going through Twitter and they
showed a picture of them is great picture.

600
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,100
It's great for me looking at it to get
a sense of what it was like after he was

601
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:27,250
in the Beatles, probably crushing
for him. He was sitting in a,

602
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:31,030
I'm at an airport waiting for a flight.

603
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:32,710
And he was like the only guy there,

604
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:35,290
just sitting there by himself
with his Beatles haircut.

605
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,440
They made him get a Beatles haircut and
wear like a fucking Ringo style suit.

606
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,740
And uh, then he was just like, why,
what the, what the fuck happened?

607
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:46,110
Within two years he was broke and
out of the music business, um,

608
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,300
they just kind of lifted him up and
gave him all right there for it,

609
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,350
right back down. Uh, kind of incredible.

610
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:56,680
So I always find that amazing when
there was like people that were, uh,

611
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,730
you know, in bands. In fact,

612
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:02,590
I remember a long time ago I was
trying to develop this script,

613
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,490
but of course I've just,

614
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,060
I have too much add to try and get
these fucking ideas off the ground,

615
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:08,800
but had an idea for a,

616
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,230
for a movie and then they ended up kind
of doing the movie already with, uh,

617
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,160
just one of those guys from the
office. But my idea was, you know,

618
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:19,480
I used to watch those,
um,

619
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,290
those behind the musics and
there was always somebody,

620
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,810
oh fuck her cubs. The um, oh,

621
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:33,200
that burger is taking me
down. Um, there's, um,

622
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,510
there's always that person early on,
you know,

623
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,690
they're like in AC DC and they decide
to quit and go to school or they get

624
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:44,170
married and then the band goes on to
make it. And I always thought like,

625
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:48,520
what am it happened at that fucking
guy got to spend the rest of his life.

626
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:51,850
I don't give a shit what he does.
It can be a fucking brain surgeon.

627
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:52,470
People still like,

628
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,800
dude, you quit ac DC. Oh my God,

629
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,780
what a fucking loser.

630
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,870
Well, the rest of your life. So I
had this idea for movies of booze.

631
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:07,871
Basically it was about a guy that
quit a band and went on to make it.

632
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,160
And it was all about is I think I wrote
it for Adam Sandler cause it was the

633
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,890
late nineties when I was writing this
thing and it just, it was a fucking mess.

634
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:17,560
I was never able to land it.
And it basic,

635
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,570
what happened was he ends up meeting the
devil in a bar and he sells his soul to

636
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:25,520
go back in time to not quit the band.

637
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,560
So he stays in the band, he ends up
not meeting the love of his life.

638
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,510
And then he ends up discovering that the
reason why the band made it was because

639
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:36,344
he quit

640
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,120
and the right person got into the band.
So he lost his, the love of his life.

641
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,150
And the band didn't make it.
He fucked them all up and a,

642
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:47,900
and he was going to go to hell.
And, uh, interestingly enough,

643
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:50,720
that's where my script
went to hell because I,

644
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,950
the way I got out of it was then he
didn't give a shit. He was going to hell.

645
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,990
He fucking went out of his way to find
the fucking guy who should have been in

646
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:04,490
the band. So then the band makes it and
uh, because he did that selfless thing,

647
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:07,640
there was a loophole and selling your
soul, real Disney fucking ending.

648
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:09,390
And he gets beat,
doesn't have to sell his soul.

649
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:13,250
He gets back with his wife and then
they go to the concert in the end, oh,

650
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,560
this is how I should have done.
And he's like, you know what man,

651
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,970
I wouldn't trade being with you,

652
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,470
Sweden for all the fucking free
pussy in the world. The end.

653
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,320
Right. And they kind of
made a movie like that. Um,

654
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,080
or enough of it. Either way, I don't
give a fuck. Right. So anyways,

655
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:34,850
getting back to this Terry
Reid Guy, uh, was, I gonna say,

656
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,860
um, that sounds very interesting.
I'm actually, you know,

657
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,820
I'm going to fucking put this guy in
right now to look them up. Cherry re, man,

658
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:43,760
it sounds like a country guy.
Was that Jerry Reed?

659
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:48,460
I each of dad loaded
up, ain't fucking, um,

660
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,061
wife's.
You know,

661
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:53,000
we said that one night when he was just
sick of singing that song in front of

662
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:57,770
those fucking church going racing
racist fucking country music fans.

663
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,810
Ah, God. They love talking
about family. I'll tell you
right now, if I wasn't white,

664
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,680
I would not hang around with any white
people that talked about the family

665
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:10,190
values. The second white people
start talking about that shit.

666
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,480
You just know is she, you know what's
underneath that good family values,

667
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,010
you know,
founding fathers.

668
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,790
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's not
get too political here, Bill. All right.

669
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,300
The wife's brother found
picture I posted online.

670
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,620
My wife's brother found a
picture. I posted it online. Okay.

671
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:34,070
Obviously it's not gonna
be good. First off, go fuck
yourself. All right. Thank you.

672
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,260
Very nice to see you too. Um, oh wait,

673
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:39,260
I forgot to read what this person
wrote it again. Just a binge drinking,

674
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:42,020
watching afters for family
right now. So far, I love it.

675
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,860
It mirrors the anger I have inside the
can't let out in a modern day society.

676
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,830
Thanks for all the free content and as
always, go fuck yourself. All right.

677
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:50,390
Just another guy watching
after his family.

678
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,220
Um, all right, this next guy,

679
00:40:56,221 --> 00:41:00,990
my wife's brother found a picture I
posted online. All right. First off,

680
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:05,400
go fuck yourself. Hey, stop
B and me. Oh, by the way,

681
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:10,401
did anybody see will Ferrell on Jimmy
Fallon the tonight show this week doing

682
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:10,951
that?
Uh,

683
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:14,280
I got to give you a link to this even
though it already has 12 million fucking

684
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:16,410
views.
Um,

685
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,530
will Farrell is the new Santa Claus
and he's like, uh, like a Santa Brow.

686
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,710
Um, I, I can't do it justice. I can't
do, he's Kinda got a high pitch.

687
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:32,910
Hey Jamie. And he's got this
fucking blonde wig on with the soul.

688
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,750
I watched that.
It's like a fucking 10 minute video.

689
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:38,630
I've already watched it like four times.
I hate to say this.

690
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,720
I was actually watching it while driving
the other day. Just laughing. You know,

691
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,560
it's fucking traffic out here, you
know, but, uh, you gotta see it.

692
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,820
It's the fact that it's just a one off
character and that he came out and crush

693
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:54,200
that hard with it. The guy's an
absolute genius. And by the way,

694
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:58,880
he has a movie coming out called
Daddy's home star and Mark Walberg,

695
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,390
Boston's old Mark Walberg
and a yours truly has it.

696
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:09,050
Quick scene in there. I got a quick
seat, don't blanket, you'll miss me.

697
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,500
But that comes out on Christmas Day.
So if you already saw star wars,

698
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,860
which is hilarious, I heard it's fucking
awesome and now I want to go see it.

699
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,010
You have to meet trashing it.
Um,

700
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,980
versus he was fucking defended.

701
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:24,740
It was trying to say star
wars is not a nerd movie,

702
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,960
which is like me saying the New York
Yankees aren't a baseball team. Like it's,

703
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,500
it's not only a nerd movie, it's like a
nerd, nerd movie. You know what I mean?

704
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,260
That's like saying Goodfellas
is not a gangster movie.

705
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:41,200
It's more about interpersonal
relationships. Um, yeah,

706
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,800
it's the total fucking nerd movie,
but it's, it's fine. It's okay to be.

707
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,890
And he's defending it,

708
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:49,730
going like talking about what a great
jump shot he has and how he can throw a

709
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:50,960
football like an animal.

710
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,850
I love versa. He's always talking
trash man is always talking trash.

711
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,540
Um, so of course I gotta be a cunt
and I wrote them back on Facebook.

712
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,830
I'm going Paul,
not for nothing,

713
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,250
but when there's this full grown adults
dressing like the characters in the

714
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,860
movies that Gee, you got to expect
you're going to get a little bit of Shit.

715
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,560
Right. Cause he's trying to, he shouldn't
be negative KT when she has good Chai.

716
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:19,310
Me. Um, I think it's the
fact that the first four,

717
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:24,311
like three out of four
were either mediocre are
absolutely horrific and people

718
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:28,220
would rather line up and watch that shit.
And it's all truly amazing movies.

719
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:31,280
Truly amazing cinema out there.
All right.

720
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,790
A wise brother found picked that I posted
online. First off, got fucking on here.

721
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,740
I'll cut to the chase.
Be Nice if I did.

722
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:38,300
I've started this letter like three times.

723
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,660
I'm 22 and married Maddie
g's with two children.

724
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,810
One is biological data with that
word always reminds me of shacks.

725
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:50,710
Rep Cause is biological.
Didn't bother.

726
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,510
Remember that he was bobbing his head.

727
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,440
Of course he got him a convertible
cause he's like nine feet tall. Uh,

728
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:58,370
I got a little,

729
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,120
I got a little too shit faced the other
night and I shared skimpy pictures of my

730
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:04,910
wife's awesome ass.

731
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,150
Okay

732
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,040
on.
I can't tell where

733
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,850
you've got a little shit faced.
You've got a little too shit faced.

734
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,310
Long story short,

735
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:22,080
my wife's brother was also on there
and it came across these pictures.

736
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,490
My wife was passed out drunk and I drew
a monster eating a hot dog coming out of

737
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:33,060
her ass before taking the do.
This isn't real.

738
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,820
I don't want this to be real.

739
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,403
Okay.

740
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,490
So then you posted it on a porn site and
it turned out your brother in law was

741
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:42,324
on there.

742
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,580
Okay.

743
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,570
Oh your girlfriend's brother was on that.
What the fuck?

744
00:44:46,571 --> 00:44:48,380
What the fuck is going
on with brother-in-law?

745
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,520
Yeah,

746
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:50,950
this is,

747
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,750
that's actually a happy ending that the
circle of you three ended right there

748
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:59,010
and you guys just swirl around in
an eddy of that fucking nonsense.

749
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,740
Thank God that didn't go out and to
humanity like, like a virus. He goes,

750
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:06,660
my wife was pimp passed.
How he read this again.

751
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:10,230
My wife was passed out drunk and I drew
a monster eating a hot dog coming out of

752
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:13,020
her ass before taking the pictures.

753
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,650
Uh,

754
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:20,270
her brother is coming to town for the
holidays and I'm curious what you would do

755
00:45:20,271 --> 00:45:24,470
in this situation. Why the fuck do
you know it was his sister's ass?

756
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,620
He was scrolling through a
look@thatass.com and then
all of a sudden he's just

757
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:29,454
like,

758
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,400
or do you have your own
name on this porno site?

759
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,650
What would you do it on Facebook?

760
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,430
Okay,

761
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,940
this is really weird.
You know what this is?

762
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:45,690
This might be one of the few law and
order episodes that were never made.

763
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,380
Don't Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh. And then
he shows up. You're like, hey man,

764
00:45:49,381 --> 00:45:51,900
I was just a joke. And then he
fucking Daddy. Did he kill you?

765
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,980
Did the wife kill you? Who knows? Um,

766
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,640
her brother is coming to town
into town for the holidays.

767
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:05,720
I'm curious what you would do in this
situation. Uh, you mean? I don't know,

768
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,070
but aside from kill
myself, uh, I don't know.

769
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:13,750
Her brother already doesn't care for
me and I'm expecting an ass beating.

770
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,700
If he starts hitting me,

771
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:21,050
can I hit him back or just become
a punching bag for the evening?

772
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,920
Okay.

773
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,360
Uh, how old are you? You got keys? 22.

774
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,983
Okay.

775
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,440
Wait, you sir,

776
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,370
you've made a series of bad decisions
in life and it's ended with this and I

777
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:39,710
think it's,
it's great that the year is ending,

778
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:43,820
that you're in this situation and I would
try to do something to get out of it.

779
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,340
Eh,
the first thing I'd do,

780
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:50,030
I'd stopped drawing pictures on my wife's
ass and putting them on the Internet.

781
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,250
Secondly, I would take some
self defense classes and, uh,

782
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,730
put my wife's brother and his place,
but he's going to be right on this one.

783
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,733
Okay.

784
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,550
The only way he knows it's your wife's
ass as if somehow your name is connected

785
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:06,181
to that account.

786
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:10,080
So I'm guessing you went on Facebook
for friends and family and your fucking

787
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:12,480
wife's ass with the hot dog coming
out of it. That's really weird.

788
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:14,070
Probably those was like fucking Shit,
didn't it?

789
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,020
You were to a fucking turd
coming out of our ass. Um,

790
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,500
yeah. For brother, if anybody starts
hitting, you can always hit back.

791
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:23,790
I just try to tie him up.

792
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,600
Just get him in a bear hug and just
get your mouth in his ear going,

793
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:31,840
I'm sorry dude. I'm sorry. I'm Joe.
I'm sorry. Just keep doing that.

794
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,500
Maybe that'll work. I have no idea.
That's a hell of a predicament. Anyways,

795
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,850
he goes,
thank you for absence from family.

796
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:40,270
It's the only show that is funnier
than South Park Day. Easy, easy. No,

797
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,720
it isn't a South Park for king. I love
the podcast and of course the advice.

798
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:47,500
Go Fuck yourself as much as I f I fucked
myself. Well, good luck with that one.

799
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,830
Um,
and final.

800
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,480
Okay.

801
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,730
Uh,
Dear William Claus,

802
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:57,520
I'm buying a couple of
friends slash relatives,

803
00:47:57,521 --> 00:48:00,070
some vinyl this year for Christmas.
Needs some help.

804
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,130
I want to get a couple of
classic rock and jazz albums.

805
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:06,460
So you are near or the dude
who does your podcasts.

806
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,730
Okay.

807
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,520
Or even your mailman have any suggestions?

808
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:11,480
Yeah,

809
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,780
well I think bill burr live at
Andrew's house is a hell of a,

810
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,170
that's a hell of a record
to own personally speaking.

811
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:22,740
I think it's phenomenal
if I do say so myself. Um,

812
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,430
uh, what, what, what, what kind of a

813
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,050
what kind of, what kind of judge
you want to listen to? I mean,

814
00:48:30,051 --> 00:48:32,540
you could go with the classics if
you just didn't come out. You know,

815
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,970
you have the ones that
everybody gets to try it.

816
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,320
Even though people try to pretend like
they're into jazz, like me know, you know,

817
00:48:39,321 --> 00:48:42,860
like, uh, God, what are those
miles Davis one Bertha. Cool.

818
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,420
The one with my funny Valentine
on it might be that one. Yeah.

819
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,880
Well, well, well,

820
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:58,140
well,
right

821
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,420
John Coltrane, a love supreme.
That's deaths. Fuck him up that day.

822
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,910
Sounds like a baby playing the
fucking saxophone to me, if,

823
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:11,140
if it actually knew what it was doing,

824
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,550
but didn't understand how
to make sentences yet. Um,

825
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,650
I always like miles Davis in a silent way.

826
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,230
A classic rock albums.
Quantum man Zeplin too.

827
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,440
Uh, ACDC back in black. I
Dunno. I Dunno what to tell you.

828
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,680
I Dunno. I got a giant Burger sitting in
me and it's slowly, you notice you don't,

829
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:37,001
I feel like,

830
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:40,840
I feel like this must be what it's like
after you get bit by a poisonous snake.

831
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:42,840
After the pain is gone
and the horror is gone,

832
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:46,870
the serpent has left the area and you
just given into the fact like, hey man,

833
00:49:46,871 --> 00:49:48,310
I'm just going to ride this up.

834
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:53,550
I'm going to start hallucinating and I
might wake up dead and some of the place

835
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,220
or I might just die right here right now.
Um,

836
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,060
saw [inaudible] self,
I can't even talk about it.

837
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:02,680
Like I saw something so
fucked up the other day.

838
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,240
I was watching those animal clips,

839
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,170
eight animals that don't have the decency
to kill another animal before they

840
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,170
start eating it. You know,
reptiles are big on that.

841
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,870
So reptile, one time, you
know, it was giant bowls at
fucking routinely kill lions.

842
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,080
Komodo dragon fucking bid in it leg.

843
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:25,590
And it's got such bacteria and its teeth
in his mouth that it knows it's going

844
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,070
to get into the bowls fucking
blood system and it's going

845
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,020
to collapse.
But it takes like three days.

846
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,650
So there's a lizard just keeps following
this thing around and waiting for it to

847
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:35,720
collapse, not die, collapsed.

848
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,470
And then it comes up and just starts
eating its guts as the fucking cows.

849
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,950
It's just horrific. I don't know why
I'm bringing that up. You know what?

850
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:45,890
I brought that up. Let's see if I can make
you laugh after that. Fucking immature.

851
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,260
All right. TV show, TV
show recommendations.

852
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:56,570
Um, number one, a Billy Bob read.

853
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:58,560
Fuck a Billy Bob read.
Fuck. How's it going?

854
00:50:58,561 --> 00:50:59,900
And that's actually a good
one and I fucked it up.

855
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,520
I have a show you need to watch. It's
called Ray Donovan, starring, uh,

856
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,850
Liev Schreiber. It's about a Boston
family that moves to La and the,

857
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,650
why are you acting like this
isn't a massive fucking, uh,

858
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,050
a massive hit plays a fixer
for celebrities and high
profile people in the city.

859
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,810
It's fucking amazing.
I know you'd like it.

860
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:24,650
It's got Busan and bang and
tits and death. The four
components of his sick show.

861
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:28,520
Take a watch. You won't be disappointed.
Thanks for all the podcasts.

862
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:33,080
Always gets me through the day.
Go Fuck Yourself. I'm actually,

863
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:37,400
I want to start watching that show
because I'm a good friend of mine,

864
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:40,020
Mike by,
um,

865
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:45,130
who directed black or white who's become
one of my really good friends and uh,

866
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,780
he's actually signed on to start
writing on that show and uh,

867
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,350
I was talking to him the other day.
He says he wakes up early,

868
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,730
excited to go to work.

869
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:59,840
He's loving working on the show and he
was telling me how sick some of the shows

870
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:01,520
are that they're making right now.
So I'm definitely,

871
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,960
I'm going to try to get
caught up on that one.

872
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:06,500
So thank you for the recommendation. Do
you have any more? I'll look at that.

873
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:11,390
Recommendation number two.
All right.

874
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,420
Uh,
dear Billy sloops,

875
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,780
the 2009 BBC Sherlock Holmes t v show,

876
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:22,570
starring Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome.
The acting is great.

877
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,500
Great. It's shot well. There are only
four seasons, four episodes per season.

878
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:30,860
Very well done. It's on Netflix and
there were a couple of seasons, you know,

879
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:32,030
I'm going to give that a shot.

880
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:36,440
Sherlock Holmes was always really
dry cause he's so fucking cerebral.

881
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:40,370
I liked those cops that, you know, they
smack people around, you know what I mean?

882
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:44,600
And then drink and shit. They solve shit
the way, you know, the way people want.

883
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,070
Smart.
Do you know,

884
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,740
they get themselves liquored
up and they use violence.

885
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,580
I like watching that shit, so
I'll, I'll sit with that. You know,

886
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,880
I always feel like Sherlock Holmes
is like Europe's doctor who,

887
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,800
but if it's only four episodes per
season, hey, I think I could do that.

888
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,850
But Oh, this Burger Burger's taking me
down. I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

889
00:53:09,851 --> 00:53:11,810
Guys, this might be my last
Monday morning podcast.

890
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:14,840
I want to thank all you guys for
listening over the last decade. Hey,

891
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:17,960
bill speeches.
Slowly gonna become slurred.

892
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,870
Vision is beginning to double
o be able to go on what the others.

893
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,470
This is how it ends. All right. Hey Bill.
Not sure if you've seen the nick yet,

894
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,170
but it's a great show.
Clive Owen is great.

895
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:38,560
He's a heroin slash coke addict doctor
who does experimental surgeries in 1901

896
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,250
AH, Jesus Christ. I'm on board
every time my wife and I watch it,

897
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:46,780
we always say Jesus Christ.
Oh,

898
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,900
oh Jesus Christ. The way you do because
of the crazy shit that goes down.

899
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,830
Give it a watch and allow yourself to say
the same thing. Thanks for the laughs.

900
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:58,550
All right,
I'll try that number four dear bell,

901
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,960
have you heard of this new show? F is for
family. Why? No, I have not. Wink, wink.

902
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,610
Let me read. Let me read the description.
It's voiced by the redheaded,

903
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,130
the redhead from,
I love the 80 strikes back.

904
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,620
Bruce Stern's daughter does a voice too.

905
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,670
It's an accurate portrayal of life from
the 70s filled with all types of humor.

906
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,140
The language is a bit salty,
so make sure not to watch it on Sundays.

907
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,200
I heard they signed for four
and a half more seasons,

908
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,700
so don't expect to see the red head
on VH one anytime soon. Love you man.

909
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,540
Thanks for the laughs. Ah, wasn't that
sweet? That was a nice little gift there,

910
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:35,390
wasn't it? All right. Winding down here.

911
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:37,520
Oh yeah.

912
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:37,670
You know,

913
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,130
I told myself the other day I was going
to wrap the Christmas gifts and just

914
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:43,490
fucking just put this whole
Christmas thing to bed, you know,

915
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:46,490
cause the next few nights I'm going
to a bunch of Christmas parties

916
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:51,300
and uh, you know what I mean? Oh God.

917
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:55,770
Why did I do that Burger today? And then
I go, he's Christmas parties. You know,

918
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,220
I,
you know what I'm gonna do.

919
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,510
I'm gonna fucking the second I'm done with
this shit. I'm, I upload this podcast,

920
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:05,850
I'm shoving my giant head under some water

921
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,420
and I'm waking the fuck up and
I'm going to go to the gym.

922
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,030
I'm going to go to the gym every day.
Gotcha.

923
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,540
Just become pop me life fed.

924
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:20,510
If you don't what I be faith or you go
to the gym every day, you can't. Um,

925
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,290
all right, dilemma. Here is
a dilemma for you, dear bill,

926
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,910
their billion, uh, my girlfriend
said no gifts for Christmas.

927
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,870
She looked me dead in the eye and said,
please no gifts

928
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,360
this year. Wow, that's great.

929
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,740
To give you the backstory,

930
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:42,580
we got engaged a month ago and they're
also going to London in February.

931
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,760
She's not the type of girl to bullshit
about this or test me like some psycho.

932
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:52,390
She really meant it. Oh, oh
this, this is a tough one.

933
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,400
I was thinking about making her a card
or something laying slash awesome like

934
00:55:57,401 --> 00:55:58,234
that.

935
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,560
What can I do that doesn't count as a
gift but still says I needed to give you

936
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:04,330
something.
Um,

937
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:07,690
all your listeners are probably
going to suggest giving her the Dick

938
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:13,480
and there you go. I think that's a
great idea. This is what should do.

939
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:19,510
You go out and you buy a little thread
that you can tie into a bow, your wrapper,

940
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:24,511
you tied around your fucking Dick and
then you on some Christmas music go,

941
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,590
we comes Santa Claus,

942
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,380
here comes Santa Claus right
down Santa Claus Lane and he is,

943
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:31,800
you just run in like high
kicking with your junk.

944
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:35,430
Just flapping in the wind with,
with the ball around it. Right.

945
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,991
If you do that,

946
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:40,020
I bet you'll never have to buy or anything
else for Christmas again cause she'll

947
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:44,190
probably leave you and then you go,
all your problems will be solved.

948
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:45,920
Okay.

949
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,530
I Dunno if, do you think she
really means it? You know,

950
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,850
don't buy me anything for Christmas.
Oh God.

951
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,110
Do they ever say what they mean? It's
always a game. It's always a test.

952
00:57:00,111 --> 00:57:02,810
They're, they're higher thinkers.
They're a higher level big,

953
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,330
they speak in metaphors wrapped up in an
enigma with a rental and something else

954
00:57:08,331 --> 00:57:11,900
from fucking JFK strikes
back with the empire,

955
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,940
whatever it is.
Um,

956
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,583
okay.

957
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,170
Which, what could you get her? Why
don't you just make a breakfast?

958
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,230
We were in a Santa Hat.
Something simple like that.

959
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,360
Okay.

960
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,240
You know why? You know why I don't
buy this? Because it's never enough.

961
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:29,900
Even if you go onto,
yeah,

962
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,100
get him some shit. It's not going to
be an, and there's always something we,

963
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,870
something needs to be worked on.
Something needs to happen.

964
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,850
What are we doing here? Um, oh fuck.

965
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,630
That was me sitting up. I just
made that noise. You know,

966
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:49,500
somebody sent me a fucking video of this
drummer I never heard of and I'm going

967
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:51,920
to fucking send you will.
His name is Charles something or other.

968
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:56,921
He's a jazz drummer and he is an absolute
fucking monster and he's really fun to

969
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:01,010
watch for any drummers who listen to this.

970
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,340
I don't think drummers listened to this
for anybody happens to be a drummer,

971
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:08,780
but you fucking listen to this. Uh, let
me see if I can get the fucking name here.

972
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,120
What is the name of this motherfucker?

973
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,660
What is the name of this mother fucker?

974
00:58:15,661 --> 00:58:18,960
It guy's name is Charlie Antolini.

975
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:20,310
Okay.

976
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,900
Charlie Antolini.
Um,

977
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:23,580
okay.

978
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:28,490
I actually got this, uh,
I got it this morning.

979
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:32,360
Somebody sent it to me. Might or might
not have been. I want to drop a name here,

980
00:58:32,361 --> 00:58:36,030
but he may or not may not be the
drummer from truths and salvage company.

981
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:39,230
He sent it to me and he was like,

982
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,470
check this fucking guy out and
he's a monster. So I'm going to,

983
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:44,890
I'm going to have this clip up on the
podcast to get you a little drummer,

984
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,110
shit going on. But uh, I'm going
to dunk my fucking giant head

985
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,500
underneath the fucking the water right

986
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,990
now that this is, this is it guys. I
can't, I'm trying to get to an hour.

987
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,150
I get another fucking three minutes.
I mean,

988
00:58:58,151 --> 00:59:01,360
technically I work for myself
so I can take off early. Right?

989
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:06,010
It's the fucking holidays. I've been
sticking with that Mike Johnston, um,

990
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,860
bass drum workout workout.
And by sticking with it,

991
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:10,510
I mean I've done it two days in a row.

992
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:15,280
He recommends at least five days a
week for three months for 15 minutes.

993
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:17,230
You do is based drum fucking workout.

994
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,890
And then you two will
have a faster bass drum.

995
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:26,300
What did anyone want to
say? Doing the workout too.

996
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:27,890
So I really want to stick with it.

997
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:29,783
Um,

998
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,100
and I feel like if I don't go today,

999
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:38,660
I'm going to fuck the whole thing
up. I got to do it. I have to do it.

1000
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,700
And that's what I'm going to go to.

take some of that money.

1013
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:27,990
I throw in something
like Saint Jude Hospital

1014

charity in the world that goes all,

1015
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:34,710
we got a live one, we got a live,
one of the next thing you know,

1016
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:38,400
I get a bunch of fucking junk mail and
I have to say the whole fucking planet

1017
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,020
and I'm sitting, they go,
well why did I do that?

1018
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,540
I just helped out some kid with
cancer and, and then, then, then,

1019
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:45,330
then they fucking chop down 50
trees selling me more shittier.

1020
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,130
So that is going to get cured.

1021
01:00:47,131 --> 01:00:49,260
He's not going to have a fucking
treated hang his swing on,

1022
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:54,080
you know what I mean? Did you
just, it just doesn't work.
It doesn't work. You know,

1023
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,500
I had a fucked up conversation with
somebody today about, you know,

1024
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,540
I was watching one of those space
and it was fucking scientists guys.

1025
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:05,290
And we're talking about how there's
like 30,000 earths out there in space.

1026
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,990
You don't want it habitable places
like this with water and all that shit,

1027
01:01:07,991 --> 01:01:11,470
but you know, they just don't have an
Epcot center. So you know it's not earth,

1028
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,510
right. And everybody always thinks, well,

1029
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:15,820
maybe there's a bunch of human beings run
around there. And I was thinking, well,

1030
01:01:15,821 --> 01:01:19,150
maybe there's some dinosaurs up there.
Maybe the asteroid never heard it,

1031
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,880
you know, and have a hit. And
maybe human beings, you know,

1032
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:26,410
crawled out of the fucking,
out of the trees, a mud or
whatever the fuck they did.

1033
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:31,000
And uh, the Getty, you know,
but it turns source rhexis

1034
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:36,460
right then. Then they're up there fucking
eat and all the fucking trees and shit.

1035
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,360
You ever think stuff like that?
Well, you know something. I do. Fuck.

1036
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:43,750
20 more seconds. 19 seconds.
18 more seconds. All right.

1037
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,770
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

1038
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,710
Even if you're not Christian.

1039
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,120
I hope you had a happy
Hanukkah or Kwanzaa.

1040
01:01:55,121 --> 01:01:59,410
And if you're a Muslim, I don't
know what it is. You celebrate.

1041
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:02,800
All right then that's it. Ah,
I'm in an hour. There you go.

1042
