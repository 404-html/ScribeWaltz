1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,050
Okay.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,010
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:05,220
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,230
November 19th, 2012. Uh,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,290
what's going on?
How I am my,

6
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,470
in my apartment in New York
City and I think I am as well.

7
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:20,910
Mike as I've ever been. I bought
some new device. The one that I, uh,

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,940
actually Ari Shaffir showed me when I
did his skeptic tank podcast and um,

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,380
I don't know how to shut off the external
microphone. So I'm using a microphone.

10
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:35,220
Like I'm fucking Michael Douglas.
I got on my headphones,

11
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,370
I got two more stereo. Like if you
can't fucking hear me this week,

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,380
if somebody says, Ooh, pool kiss was
too quiet. All right, maybe you need to

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,890
go get miracle ear.
Do they still sell that miracle ear?

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,020
Ketia like fucking grow an ear outside
of the body at this point yet they like

15
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:56,460
grow one in a petri dish. There's not
what they're working on right now.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,300
I mean, if they can grow the outside at
this point. Yeah, that was years ago,

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,340
years ago. They showed that on like the
local news right after some old lady.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,330
You know who's made jam for the
last 70 years just fucking died.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,740
Or they usually do that in the end.
No, they wouldn't. No, she died.

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,870
They do it earlier,
but if she was still alive,

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,820
just be like a jab for 70
years while she's still going.

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,860
Wow. Mike. I bet that was some wonderful
jam. The offset was we'll fuck later.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,293
Um,

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,240
anyways, um, if this is too
loud, if this is fucked up,

25
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:37,480
it's just going to be this one week.
I just got to go find some tech person.

26
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:41,350
I'm probably tomorrow morning. By the
time you're listening to this, um,

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,150
I'm going to be doing the
opie and Anthony Show, uh, uh,

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,650
tomorrow morning and I'm going
to talk to dog. Oh, Danny boy,

29
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,680
the lights are calling or
whatever. I'm going to, no,

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,220
I really should know the words to that,
you know,

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,810
does anybody know the fucking
words to that? You know,

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,050
doesn't everybody just
know, oh, Danny boy. Whoa.

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,730
Right. That's like knowing the second
verse to like, God bless America. No,

34
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:14,050
not that one. It's one of those songs, one
of those songs. Everybody's just saying,

35
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,720
sings the first,
first one of those patriotic songs,

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,990
and then you never hear the second
verse. So now we're, and we're,

37
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:23,240
it looks at the lyrics to the second verse
and then when they finally look at it,

38
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:27,700
that's the most sexist,
racist shit ever. You know,

39
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,350
and then they do something about
it on TV. Should we get, uh,

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,380
the racial slur out of the second verse
or is it part of the American fabric?

41
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,680
You know, and then everybody on CNBC
and Msl the liberal sit there. Go ahead.

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,410
Definitely have to get rid of it.
We should trash white people in the first,

43
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:52,740
first to make up for what, seven second
verse. And then everybody on Fox News just

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,440
goes, you know, I don't see what
the problem is. They relate.

45
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,830
They say that we're doing each other.
I have a red tie on,

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,001
you know,

47
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:05,140
who watches since who still fucking
watches that shit and just thinks that any

48
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,750
of those people have a fucking flying,

49
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,080
I didn't know what the expression is to
have any idea what they're talking about.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,180
Do you realize how much is going on in
the world and then what are you doing?

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,170
What are those guys do other than just
sit there and just wait for the fucking,

52
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:27,100
the teleprompter thing to
come on or the incoming news.

53
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,130
They still have that old technology with
that thing types forward and backward.

54
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,390
It's coming in,
you know,

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,200
incoming news over an England according
to this computer that some fucking

56
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,460
person wrote into 6,000 fucking
miles away. Evidently this happened.

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,720
I don't believe any of it.
I mean I believe it.

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,830
I believe a lot more of
it now that I travel.

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,440
That's one of the greatest
things about traveling.

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,110
When you actually see big band,
you're like, wow, it really exists.

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,690
This wasn't just meet up.

62
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,480
You don't have to like that paranoid
thought that maybe your town or maybe like

63
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:04,120
just state,
depending on how much you've traveled,

64
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:07,480
like that's all there is and
then you'd be just kept going.

65
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,620
You would actually run into that,

66
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,550
like that fucking atmosphere
that you can't like walk through.

67
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,200
Do you ever have thoughts about that?
Well I have and I'm not going to be,

68
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm not going to may be made to feel
that I'm less than you cause you didn't.

69
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,850
Okay. Before you start judging
me during this holiday week,

70
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,300
what are you guys doing for the holidays?
You haven't some Turkey,

71
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,080
some fucking beef Jerky,
white people with the mashed potatoes,

72
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:36,490
black plague people with the
fucking sweet potatoes, right?

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,090
Jewish people. Do you guys sit
with you? Don't sit this one out.

74
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:43,180
You guys set out Christmas. You
guys have Chinese food, right?

75
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,720
So at least we could do
give you that one holiday.

76
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,280
Jewish people hook you up in September.

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,320
You barely even have to work in that
fucking month. Thanks to those people. Um,

78
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,790
I should have given them a shout out.

79
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,950
Shout a late shout out to
Jewish people in September.

80
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:03,130
Thank you for those two or three Mondays.
I always forget if it's two, three.

81
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,210
I know it's one that the month, right?

82
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,580
Labor, Labor, Labor Day. I miss this day,

83
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:18,380
flag day and then there's a Horatio
Sanz Day. What the fuck is it called?

84
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,840
Yom Kippor Yom Kippur.
I don't know what it is,

85
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,060
but thank you for all those Mondays
I've had off or is it a Tuesday?

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,570
I don't know. I don't, what the fuck is,
I don't know what it is, but this might,

87
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:33,770
at least my world. My business
shuts the fuck down on those days.

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,540
And I've never said thanks.

89
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,390
So during the week of
thanksgiving, thank God, um,

90
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,020
I kept getting, giving thanks to
Jewish people in those two, three,

91
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:49,820
one seven Mondays that I have off.
And uh, you know, there's only fork.

92
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:54,320
Go Fuck Yourself. I'm in
September. All right. So anyways,

93
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,080
I worked at the germline and
center for the performing

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,490
on Saturday night and uh,
had a great time.

95
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,440
Paul Versey went up and fucking
leveled the place. It fucking asshole.

96
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,030
I'm going to lose another opener.
Already lost Joe to Rosa. You know,

97
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,970
he took off to the, the richer
fields of headlining. Right?

98
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,430
I can't get that bachelor to open for me
anymore. He sees too big of a superstar.

99
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:23,060
But you know, I caught him in
the dip, the teenagers sensation,

100
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,250
I call him between his, his, um,

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,680
his initial success when he was a,
and I think he first broke on dance fever.

102
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,800
I can't remember what.
And then when disco was out,

103
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,070
he had a rough time and a lot
of people don't know this, uh,

104
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,120
to Rosa was actually offered
John Travolta's part in
pulp fiction and he turned

105
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:46,940
it down cause uh, you know, he
was still, um, what are we saying?

106
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,660
The business Joe was suffering
from exhaustion during
that period and he had to

107
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,494
go away.

108
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,690
So whatever.
Now he's back to headline and add a,

109
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,510
so now first he's opening for me.
So I'm like, all right, you know,

110
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:06,170
I can get some miles out of this kid.
This fucking assholes killing so hard.

111
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,530
They're not doing just the
regular clapping in the end of it,

112
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:14,420
they will like whistling the links to
the next level of, of, of, of killing.

113
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,180
If someone takes the effort to
just not sit there and you know,

114
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,320
clapping that fucking hammer,

115
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,990
they got to actually bring their
dirty fingers to their mouth.

116
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,890
They probably went to the bathroom.
They don't give a shit about the bacteria.

117
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,813
Right.

118
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,890
Okay.

119
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,650
And they actually, what's so for
you, when I hear that I, I got,

120
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:32,230
I got maybe another eight months.

121
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,370
So if you want to see the legendary
tandem of Paul Versey and myself on the

122
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:43,780
road, you better come soon because it's
fucking assholes killing. So anyways,

123
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,600
we were at, at uh, what does it
southern Connecticut University.

124
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
Did I say it right? I don't know why. Um,

125
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,350
it was open to the public.
So it was a college Gig,

126
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,460
but it wasn't really a college kid.

127
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:56,580
We were actually at the John Lennon and
center for the performing arts that was

128
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:59,730
on that campus. And it
was mainly, you know, uh,

129
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,680
people who had already graduated college,
uh,

130
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,300
which made me feel comfortable
actually means for us.

131
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,210
We were both nervous cause you know,

132
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:09,330
he's 10 years younger than I am and I'm
actually sitting there going like, okay.

133
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:13,560
And then incoming freshmen
was born in 1994. Fuck me,

134
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,520
I was already doing comedy two years,
two fucking years.

135
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,560
What am I going to talk to this
person about? You know what, what,

136
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,330
what I, I haven't done a college
gig in years. I don't know.

137
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:27,370
People say you should do
them to keep you at your,

138
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,450
yeah. I was actually talking to
someone about this the other day,

139
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,410
like how you stay relevant as
a performer. As you, you can't,

140
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,490
once you start selling tickets
and you have a fan base,

141
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,590
you can't just do those shows.

142
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,130
You have to keep going down to the comedy
club where it's a 100 people who just

143
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:48,610
showed up that night and could give a
flying fuck who you are and whether you're

144
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,800
funny or not,
and then you can stay current,

145
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,770
but if you just get your crowd and you
just keep performing to them as you get

146
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,131
older,

147
00:08:56,131 --> 00:09:01,131
they get older and then one day they
start fucking dying or something and then

148
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:01,830
that's it.

149
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,490
You're standing out there and this old
fucking guy in a wrinkled brown suit.

150
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:08,790
It's terrible. There's fucking
business that the back nine is brutal.

151
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,320
The back now, he was brutal. That's
why I'm fucking, I got to do something.

152
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,620
Yeah.

153
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,220
I got to get my two pistols and learn
how to hunt and freeze and elk. Okay.

154
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,490
Come see my act. I'll explain
the rest of that. But anyways,

155
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,500
what was really interesting was this,
um,

156
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,890
the John and center for the
performing arts was, um,

157
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,850
a stone's throw from Yale University.

158
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,280
No, I've never been
there. I've been to have,

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,120
I've done a show at Princeton Dat myth
and I've walked by the one here that's in

160
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,250
New York.
I forget what it's called,

161
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,400
on the way to some lady's apartment back
in the day when I was a stud back in

162
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:56,330
the day,
way back in the late nineties,

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,830
when all Billy red face first
came to the fucking city,

164
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,500
right. Look, and like Richie Cunningham,

165
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,830
how I ever got laid
back then was just fine.

166
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,560
I had to get on a stage and
fucking jumped around. I had to,

167
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,440
what else was I going to do? Sit there
and looking like a fucking puppet.

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,750
Um, anyways, but I've never,

169
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,140
I never been to Yale. I know I drove
by, I had no idea where it was at.

170
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,100
Every dental he gets in new haven,
Connecticut. And, uh, believe me,

171
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:33,520
I've heard some shit about Connecticut.
You know what I mean? I definitely have,

172
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:35,320
I know there's a lot
of a blue blood money.

173
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:39,790
They're blue blood but blood
money and I know that there's a,

174
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,470
Oh fuck.
You don't have to just reminded me of,

175
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:48,390
I finally figured out a way to work in
the so called white man into my act.

176
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,770
I was walking my dog. God Damn
it. Somebody send me a tweet.

177
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,230
Just write the so called
white man and let me,

178
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:59,870
I'll just have to think about that
way. The fucker would go in. God Damn.

179
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,260
And I was going to do it last
night. Fuck. Um, anyways,

180
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,730
so I've heard a lot of shit about
Connecticut. That's, you know, there's a,

181
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,800
you know, I'll let JP Morgan money, the
blue bloods, the guys, you know who,

182
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:15,540
who like they, their kids haven't
worked for fucking generations,

183
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,700
haven't worked since like
their, their, their initial, uh,

184
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,440
since that meeting on Devil's island.

185
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,770
They haven't fucking work is
some Klan members higher level,

186
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,420
no southern accents, you know, pushing
the ponds around. I've heard about that.

187
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,540
I've heard that there's a mix
of patriots and giants fans.

188
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,590
And then I heard that there was,
uh, some rough areas of high Flynn.

189
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,530
I definitely heard that,
but I never heard about new haven,

190
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,340
so I dunno,
I figured it's,

191
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,230
it's an ivy league campus.

192
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,150
I figure it's got to be cool to walk
around or whatever. So anyways, I'm like,

193
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:51,984
you know what,

194
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,800
I know that the Yale bulldogs play
in an old stadium just like, yeah,

195
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,060
I want to go look at it.

196
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,870
So I looked it up on Wikipedia and
said the Yale Bowl they're claiming is

197
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,710
actually the original bowl in this country
and that all the other bowls looked

198
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,150
at that ball and said, wow,
we want to build one to one.

199
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,460
That's how you got the Rose Bowl,

200
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,310
the fucking cotton bowl and all
those other bolts. And that's,

201
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,820
and then from that they took the name
bowl for the bowl games cause they all

202
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:17,350
played in those fucking stadiums.

203
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,500
And then from there the Superbowl
took the bull name from that.

204
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,740
So it all goes back to this. So I'm like,
well, fuck me, I got to go see this thing.

205
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,720
So I look on my map.

206
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,090
Okay,

207
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,400
my little Google maps.
I see it's a mile and a half away.

208
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,750
I hate going to the fucking gym, right?
I had my banana and apple for breakfast.

209
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:38,550
I'll go fucking full of fiber.
I'll go take a walk down to the Yale Bowl,

210
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,990
go check this motherfuck around.
It's a mile and a half away.

211
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,540
I'm in an Ivy League, I'm on an Ivy League
campus. This, this, how can I go wrong?

212
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,270
Right.
I got about two blocks in.

213
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,140
This is an amazing thing where
you suddenly as a white person,

214
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,680
realize that you're walking into the hood.
There's those subtle signs,

215
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,170
you know that make you nervous.

216
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,760
First thing you see is a probably a check
cashing place. You know what I mean?

217
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:09,960
A funeral home, Baptist church,
you know, less white people.

218
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,470
You start going fuck. And I'm thinking,
well, it's only a mile and a half away.

219
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,350
How bad can it fucking get
plus this during the day?

220
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,710
Okay,

221
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,600
do I never had a problem during the
day? During the day? The regular people.

222
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,760
It's at night right around seven o'clock.

223
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,490
I've always said when that second
shift comes out, the hustlers,

224
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:28,730
the zombies and all that fucking shit,
that's what you don't want to be there.

225
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,850
But uh, you know, you might catch a
couple of those guys coming home late,

226
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,390
you know what I mean?
So I'm fucking walking through their Ed a,

227
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,360
I've got to admit, I got about
six blocks in and I was waiting.

228
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,490
I felt like I was in
an episode of the wire.

229
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,960
Like I was waiting for Omar a hill to
come walking by with his fucking gun.

230
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,853
It was crazy.

231
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,460
I also figured out why
black people walk so slow

232
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,340
when they were walking down the street.
I get it because when you walk slow,

233
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,720
you look like you're not nervous. Okay.
If you're walking fast like I was,

234
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:04,310
you look like either a,
a narc or a fucking victim.

235
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,780
He love, he, he's scared.

236
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:06,960
Okay.

237
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,850
People just was staring. I don't know,
just my fucking red face. I think I'm,

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,360
I really freaked out a lot of
people cause there was nothing,

239
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:13,830
nobody down there that looked like me.

240
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,210
So I finally got through all this fucking
shit and I get down to the Yale bowl

241
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:20,780
cause I want to look at this thing they
get is going to look like the one at

242
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,440
[inaudible]. Right. That's
basically a rip off of uh,

243
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,860
what does that place over there in Italy?

244
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,270
Yeah.

245
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:30,470
Yeah.

246
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,500
The place where they threw
all the Christians to the
lions and that fat guy who

247
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:37,920
was balding and he'd do the thumbs up,
thumbs down,

248
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,140
wasn't punches pilot. He took out the
Hippie Julius Caesar. Who the fuck was it?

249
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:45,570
The Roman Colosseum. So I thought
it was going to look like that.

250
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,750
So I show up to this thing.
It's dug into the fucking ground.

251
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,780
All I can see as these entrances and
that have gates in front of him and above

252
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:56,360
them is just grasp.
I couldn't see a fucking thing.

253
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,770
So then I had to turn around and I had
to walk right back from the hood and I

254
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:05,510
was way less nervous the
second time because I knew
with each step I was getting

255
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,320
closer to my hotel.
It's weird how that works.

256
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,710
Then I started looking around and people
looked a lot more friendlier cause that

257
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,400
was a lot less nervous. And you know
what? I think that's one to grow on.

258
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,570
And you know what's funny is I
actually want to go to war, uh,

259
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,730
Harvard Yale game in a,
at the Yale Bowl.

260
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,200
I want to do that because I started
thinking about how many future presidents

261
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,970
sat in the Yale bowl or at least
candidates. You know what I mean?

262
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,620
George W.

263
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,030
Bush was in there as was that other
fucking guy that ran against him in 2004

264
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:44,660
John Kerry. You know what I mean? They
might've done keg stands together.

265
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,730
So I just want to look at drunk
kids out there and be like,

266
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:51,650
maybe someday that's going to be my guy
who was allegedly my leader, you know?

267
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,110
Then maybe then the Harvard Yale game,

268
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,900
when they're not giving each other shit
and throwing their hankies at each other.

269
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,930
I can actually hear you know, about
the next, the Illuminati meeting.

270
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,431
Hey,
you know,

271
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:05,520
I'm always bitching about the population
problem and how they never fucking

272
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:08,130
bring it up in the presidential campaigns.
You know what?

273
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:10,170
I think they bring it up.
I think they bring it up on that.

274
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:13,830
That Bilderberg group gets together.
I think they talk about the real problems,

275
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,660
you know, when they all get together
and be like, hi, what is the most,

276
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,050
what is the easiest way to get
7 billion down to 500 million?

277
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,160
You know what I mean? Is I sit there
like fucking lobsters and shit.

278
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,190
Then who fucking serves him?
I bet that, I bet when you,

279
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:39,370
when you're a waiter for them, when
you come walking into that, that group,

280
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:42,820
when you bring in whatever their
fucking escargo and all that shit,

281
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,470
I bet they all just shut the fuck up the
second you come in or they pulled down

282
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:48,580
some different map

283
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,400
and if you accidentally see something
like that you're never heard from again.

284
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,390
Okay.

285
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,760
Am I slowly losing my mind? I
don't fucking know. Anyways,

286
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:03,210
this is the Monday morning podcast
everybody. And uh, as you know,

287
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,830
as I stated numerous times, um,
I've started a podcast network.

288
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:09,840
We're just a mom and pop store
at this point. Like I said,

289
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:11,640
eventually we're going to be blogging,
putting up video,

290
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:16,290
but it's called all things, comedy.com.
And uh, it's sort of a co op like what?

291
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,140
I live here in New York,
uh,

292
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,960
live in here in New York and um,

293
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,160
okay.

294
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,690
You know, we kind of, it's, you know,
by Adis for artists. So we're trying to,

295
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:28,630
we're trying to do,
uh,

296
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,310
you know what's funny about this whole
all things comedy is I was just going to

297
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:32,701
say like,

298
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:35,490
we're going to try and have like this
whole hippie commune thing and I just saw

299
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:36,900
this whole thing on Jones town,

300
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:39,240
so hopefully we don't all like
fucking drink the Koolaid,

301
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,180
but, um, anyways, we've
got it to new podcasts. Um,

302
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:47,450
we're adding the naughty room
and the, uh, the bone zone,

303
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,090
um, which are absolutely fucking, yeah,

304
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,640
hilarious podcasts and we'll probably
take away listenership from mine,

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,050
but I'm okay with that. You know
what I mean? Fuck, I'm actually,

306
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:00,540
Brendan Walsh is one of my favorite.
Uh,

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,790
can I even say up and coming
will probably, cause you
guys don't know who he is,

308
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,860
but he's been around for awhile.

309
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,130
I shot a failed pilot pilot
with him a long time ago.

310
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,810
We improv'd so this whole,
uh,

311
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,140
this whole scene to get and just had
a great time, you know what I mean?

312
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,610
Just to fucking,

313
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,190
there's nothing better than when you're
with somebody who knows their fucking

314
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:21,610
funny cause then they don't jump all of
your shit and then you can relax and he

315
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:22,750
can actually play off each other.

316
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:26,980
It's when you fucking get into scene and
there's some content that just tries to

317
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,400
fucking box you out.

318
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,540
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me. And
you start treating it like a lamp.

319
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,350
That's when it's not
fun. All right. Anyways,

320
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,500
so let's get on with this. What the fuck
am I going to talk about this week? How,

321
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,370
how far into this thing am I,
what am I, what am I, what am I,

322
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,120
18 minutes in my fucking
hot ass God damn apartment.

323
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,340
I told you guys a long time ago when my
apartment is so hot and it's not cause

324
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:53,530
I'm in it. Hey, uh,

325
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,310
it's because somebody in this building,

326
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,960
either their kid got sick or they got
sick. I don't know if there's still sick,

327
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,350
but evidently,
unless it's fucking 90 degrees in here,

328
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,840
they're going to get sick again.

329
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:15,160
So everybody in the building has stuff
fucking suffer instead of these fucking

330
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:17,670
dickheads just buying
a God damn space here.

331
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,820
They just cranked it.
I saw what is dragging up my floors.

332
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,420
I swear to God. I could see I could
catch fucking malaria in my apartment.

333
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,150
Just disgusting.
So anyways,

334
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,410
the fuck was I going to talk about,
did you guys watch any football this week?

335
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,690
Did you watch you watch the
Patriots scored 59 fucking
points against the colts,

336
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:44,590
but I got to tell you something. How
great does Andrew Luck Look? You know,

337
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,590
I knew we throw, I know we throw a
couple of pics sixes, but whatever.

338
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:50,140
He's a rookie that's going to happen.
And he didn't have this,

339
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,900
this freaked out look on his face.

340
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:58,260
He threw a pick six things like fuck, you
know, like that guys is going to be a,

341
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,840
I'm not saying anything you
don't already know. And uh,

342
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,510
Kudos to the Indianapolis Colts.
Huh?

343
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,370
Did they play that at the end of Peyton
manning? They played that out perfectly.

344
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,490
You know, they probably knew we
had another two, three years.

345
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:14,320
But what are the odds you're going to,

346
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:17,920
you're going to go from Peyton manning
to a guy. He's good. As Andrew Luck.

347
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,830
Do you realize how, what a,
what a smart move that was.

348
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,450
That's like in those cartoons
when someone's fallen down
the cliff and the phone

349
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:29,200
booth and right before it crashes, they
step out. That's basically what they did,

350
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,090
you know, in the short run. Yeah, they
fucked themselves, I guess. You know,

351
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,190
Peyton starting to click with the Broncos.

352
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,230
I like the Broncos to possibly go to the
Superbowl going out on a fucking Lynn.

353
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:44,120
There is every other team is
injured. Um, not really. I'm,

354
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:48,730
I'm joking about going out on a limb, but
um, you know, I know it was, what was it,

355
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:53,731
59 to 24 gives a fuck that kid that
kid could throw in that kick in play.

356
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:57,160
And, uh, I really hope the Patriots,

357
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,150
I can't even get myself to say this
cause it's my quarterback so I won't even

358
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:01,931
say it out loud,

359
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:05,710
but at some point the person with
that cute little dimple in his chin,

360
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,870
it's not going to be quarterback
anymore for the Patriots.

361
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,350
And I hope we're lucky enough
to go from that jewel guys.

362
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:20,530
Good as Andrew Luck. That is the shit
that's, it's very rare that that happens.

363
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:25,090
I would probably say the greatest one
that I ever saw was the 40 niners going

364
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:29,920
from Joe Montana to Steve
Young. Other than that, uh,

365
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,670
not even the dolphins,

366
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:37,650
they went from Bob Greasy to like dawn
struck before Dan Marino came in and then

367
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:41,970
Dan Marino, his career ended and
then they haven't had anybody,

368
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,280
Joey Harrington from the
lions will fuck have they had,

369
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,350
okay.

370
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,790
Chad Pennington from the jets.

371
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,340
I always thought that that guy could
play and just could never stay healthy.

372
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,540
I mean the fucking jets went
from Joe Nemeth to nobody.

373
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,050
This still waiting for
the next Joe Nemeth.

374
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,860
That's how amazing it is and how
much you fucking freak out when you,

375
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,280
when you get the real deal.

376
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:12,210
I guess the Patriots went from drew
Bledsoe to Tom Brady, you know,

377
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,570
and I know Bledsoe gets a lot of shit,
but I mean that guy was a,

378
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
he was up there, right?
He's got the fucking yeah,

379
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,160
to prove it.
No,

380
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:29,161
it's fights fucking unreal because the
cowboys cowboys went Roger Stolle back

381
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,200
then they had that long low. Then Troy
Aikman came in and now they're in another,

382
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:38,260
they're in like a fucking 20 year.
Well now wait, how long did it trade?

383
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:42,910
Mentally he played the like a 2000 maybe.
And there's still waiting.

384
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,770
Although Tony Romo was not as bad.
He's not as bad as people say. Bill,

385
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:49,320
you're going to make any
of this fucking funny.

386
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,970
You just going to sit here and talk about
how you remember quarterbacks I write.

387
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,350
I write already. Um, could you hear that?

388
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,160
Could you fucking hit up Jesus Christ,

389
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,710
another person telling me they
lost the house in a storm.

390
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,310
Holy fucking shit. All right. There's
another thing to give. Thanks for that.

391
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:11,340
That didn't happen to me. God dammit. Um,

392
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,280
okay.

393
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,620
You know what the great thing about being
a comedian is all you can actually do

394
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:18,010
a bunch of benefits and,
uh,

395
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:20,800
I've actually gotten some offers out
on the west coast to do some, I gotta,

396
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,050
I gotta jump on one of those.
I got to jump on one of those.

397
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:25,600
But the funding or what the
fuck's going on? You don't,

398
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,730
you realize I don't even watch the news
anymore. I'm just so fed up with it.

399
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,550
I don't know if I'm fed up with it
or I'm so out of my fucking mind.

400
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,890
They can't even relate to it anymore.
I just sit there,

401
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:38,810
y'all on TV and that's fucking Paul
shared. You know, I don't fucking know.

402
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:43,730
You know, let, let's get, let's get to
a, God damn. I'm just get to a fucking,

403
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,190
oh, how about a big shout out to
the, they're actually thinking

404
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,870
about taking a couple of weeks off.

405
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,100
It just can't come to a fucking agreement.

406
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:54,710
So they're going to take a couple of weeks
off. You know what I'm going to do? I,

407
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,370
I've, I'm, I'm done with them. I'm
fucking done with them. You know,

408
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,130
every sports fan says that and then they
get all excited when they come back to

409
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,500
fuck them. I'm bi, I'm
getting the NBA League pass.

410
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:07,400
I've actually been watching the Celtics
for the first time in forever were

411
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:10,910
actually younger and a,
I liked the way we're playing.

412
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,400
I liked the way we're playing and I
like every fucking team in the league,

413
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,350
including the neck. Just as long
as they beat the Lakers. That's it.

414
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,800
I'm old school. I don't give a shit.
I don't give a fuck about the heat.

415
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:28,670
There's still an expansion team to me.
Oh good for you.

416
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:31,700
With your two little banners,
you know,

417
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,330
I hope you get some more banners when
the air conditioner is turned on and it

418
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:39,970
starts waving. It dries out all the
fucking botox around court side.

419
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,660
How about that?
How do you like that?

420
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,100
That's fucking creepy ass town that
Miami is, I'll tell you for as much shit.

421
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,240
It's Hollywood gets for the
old guy with the trophy wife.

422
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,380
You've never seen it until you go
down to Miami beach and you see these

423
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,760
motherfuckers 60 fucking 65 years old,

424
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,570
58 maybe at the youngest with their
linen on linen matching outfit and those

425
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:05,830
Brown fucking loafers,

426
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,220
no sandals that look like that face mask
or that guy in the giants whose just

427
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:13,480
sick of having people
poke them in the face.

428
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:17,320
So he basically has a durable cage on
his face though. Those kinds of sandals,

429
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:21,940
those rich guys sandals probably
made an Evana kind of sandals.

430
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,811
Those guys,

431
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:27,811
65 fucking years old balls hanging down
the side of their linen pants inside

432
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:31,980
leg. Of course it's not
get disgusting, right? And,

433
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:35,260
and they're sitting there with
like some fucking 19 year old.

434
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,770
Okay.

435
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,280
Was unreal. Just fucking
unreal. It's just disgusting,

436
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,470
disgusting thing that's going
on down there. You know what?

437
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:48,730
They got enough money to cover it up.
How was that legal?

438
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,790
Once you're of legal age that you can
be 58 with a fucking 19 year old climate

439
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,630
on a fucking 19 year old,
right?

440
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,990
She's into all this new music.
You don't know.

441
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,570
You're sitting there putting
on fucking a Glenn Miller

442
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,090
Moonlight serenade, anything.
What the fuck it is? It's,

443
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:14,910
they feel like they're in the little
rascals movie. Extras, disgusting

444
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,540
and awesome.
All at the same time.

445
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:22,950
Just depending on what side of the ball
you're wrong. Let's be honest. So anyways,

446
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:24,240
yeah,
I'm becoming a big hoop fan.

447
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:26,890
I actually watched some of the Knicks
game today with the Paul Versey.

448
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:28,620
And what about the fucking
next seven and one?

449
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,270
Go listen to Paul's fucking podcast.
He's going to be freaking out about that.

450
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,120
Tell you the next kid. Um,
he still says kid and Yab.

451
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:42,810
Boy when he fucking text,
he's really starting to show his age,

452
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,560
but only in this texting. All
right, here we go. Some, uh,

453
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,180
some questions for the week. Hey Bill,
how do I tell my wife I'm an atheist bill.

454
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:55,380
I have the greatest wife in the world
and we have two wonderful daughters.

455
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,040
This is starting off like a horror movie.
You know what I mean?

456
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:02,190
How it's always like nice. There's
always like leaves falling in a Gazebo,

457
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,470
but there's just that
hint of creepy music.

458
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,600
I at least to do that back in the 80s,

459
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,700
when they couldn't just
depend on special effects,

460
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:12,240
they actually had to build suspense.
That's how this is looking at this guy.

461
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,620
He has a great, here's a great, he has
the greatest wife in the world. Everybody,

462
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,990
and he has two wonderful daughters.
Uh, there's a problem though,

463
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:25,080
Don Don, uh, she is a devout Christian.

464
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,120
All right, do you, why are you
acting like you just met her,

465
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,200
you fucking married her.

466
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,250
And he goes and I finally decided
that I don't believe in any of it. Oh,

467
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:39,390
that's why. Oh, we'll do
welcome to enlightenment.

468
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,950
You know, you can't throw it all
out the window, but you know,

469
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:47,370
the seven deadly sins,
the 10 commandments,

470
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,940
all that shit makes sense. But all that
other stuff, you know, burning Bush,

471
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:54,660
talking to a bath, it's walking on a
fucking lake. I mean, come on. I mean,

472
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:57,450
how are we adults here or what,
you know,

473
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,230
you have to throw your first baby
over a cliff to show that you love me.

474
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:06,330
Hey, I was just fucking with you. You
passed to tell what the, what is that?

475
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,750
Okay.

476
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,280
Booming voice coming
from the clouds ghetto.

477
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,900
I just don't buy it. Something's coming
back like for the love of God. What, what,

478
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:19,600
what is it waiting for?
You know what I mean?

479
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,250
Is Jesus like Thurman Thomas Trying
to find his fucking helmet during the

480
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,280
Superbowl? Is that, what's
that? What's going on here? Um,

481
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,450
that's too Thurman Thomas references two
weeks in a row you find another fucking

482
00:28:31,451 --> 00:28:33,880
podcast that does it. Three
weeks in a row of God. It,

483
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:38,500
you should stop listening to
this one. Um, anyways, he says,

484
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,480
I finally decided that I
don't believe in any of it.

485
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,110
I thought about telling her the old joke.
We're both atheists.

486
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,380
I just believe in one less God.
Then you do a,

487
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:51,220
but she wouldn't find that funny
at all. She is okay. She, she's,

488
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,090
she is okay for now going to church
without me because I work nights,

489
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,620
but I have a feeling that when the kids
get a little older that I will have to

490
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,150
become more involved.

491
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:06,100
Should I tell her now or just let it
be and hope that it never comes up.

492
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,770
Well, I have to tell you, sir,

493
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,640
if you do in fact have the
greatest wife in the world,

494
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:14,590
she'll accept you for who you are.

495
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,950
And if you're an atheist and you don't
believe in the stuff that she believes

496
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:22,534
in,

497
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,730
yeah,

498
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,660
then you know, there you go.
This is what I would do. Let her,

499
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,650
let her take him to church.
I Dunno what to do.

500
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,060
You don't be funny. What if
you took up needlepoint? Okay.

501
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,530
And when you went to church,

502
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:41,710
you just did needle point with your
legs crossed in the most feminine way

503
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,280
possible.

504
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,210
Maybe that's the way you do it.

505
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:47,170
Like some passive aggressive
way that you so embarrassed,

506
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,290
the most wonderful way from the
world that she asked you not to come.

507
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,193
You know

508
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,561
what?

509
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:58,520
If you do like a needle point that just
is like little atheistic sayings and you

510
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:01,340
make pillows and when they
have like the church drive,

511
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,920
like the bake sale and they wash your car,
you sell,

512
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,870
you sell the pillows that you, so
during the mass, Oh, you know what?

513
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,560
And they say Jesus is Lord.
But it's almost like,

514
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,290
like one of those pink Floyd
songs that if you, if you play it,

515
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,640
I don't know if you listened to some,

516
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:20,420
they got like hidden messages or
something or maybe they never did.

517
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,380
Maybe just these Jesus freaks did,
that's going to really freak them out.

518
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:24,600
Okay.

519
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,600
It may have like subtle messages and like
the outskirts of the pillow about this

520
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:31,440
is all a bunch of bullshit

521
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:37,620
and uh, you don't believe in
pedophilia, you know? Oh Jesus,

522
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:40,670
I'll get me some fucking emails.
Okay. Um, anyways, what are the asks?

523
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:45,170
Should I tell her now or just let it
be and hope that it never comes up? Um,

524
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,680
you're basically saying,
should I,

525
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:50,280
should I man up and be who I am or
should I stick my head in the sand?

526
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay. That's that. Those
are your two options.

527
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:57,000
So I am going to throw this back at you,
sir. What kind of man do you want to be?

528
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,320
Do you want to be the kind of man that
sticks his head in the fucking sand when

529
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:01,501
there's,

530
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:05,790
there's a confrontation or do you want
to be that guy who just sits down and

531
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:10,350
just says, listen sweetheart,
I tried. I just don't,

532
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,080
I don't believe it.
Okay.

533
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,540
And I think it's great
that you believe it.

534
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,940
If you want to go down there and
sing the songs, shake some hands,

535
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,710
close your eyes, right? Make a pledge for
Jesus. Whatever the hell you want to do.

536
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:28,220
You go down there and you do that. All
right? It's like watching football.

537
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,130
I like doing it. You don't, you don't,
you're not into it. You know I don't,

538
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:35,090
I don't make you watch football, do
I? I don't do that. You know why?

539
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:39,200
Cause I'm the greatest husband in
the world. Why don't you try that?

540
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:45,120
Just ask her. Listen, wait.

541
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:46,140
Does she know,

542
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:47,550
okay.

543
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,530
She all right.
She knows that you're not going,

544
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,860
ah, Jesus. You know what,

545
00:31:54,861 --> 00:31:59,240
you might want to give her a little Jesus
juice and uh, get a little liquored up.

546
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,330
I don't, I don't want to, you know, what
do you got? You got to tell her you don't,

547
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,890
I don't like how you're
deliberately working.

548
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:09,760
I feel like you've deliberately working
late on Sundays or early on Sundays.

549
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,340
Whenever the hell she goes. So
you, so you can just avoid this.

550
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:16,530
You're avoiding ships are, and
this is a snowball. All right?

551
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,500
A snowball, a Jesus and it's
rolling right down towards you.

552
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:23,490
And at some point it's good. It's
going to grow all over you. You know?

553
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,250
And there's going to be some fucking creep

554
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,120
church like that priest on the fucking
soprano's that's going to come over and

555
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,340
fucking hold your hand when
you're out there doing the, yeah,

556
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:37,840
you're a little job there. All right.
So I say, you just tell them, just say,

557
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:40,700
I just look, just be, don't be a
Douche. Just say I totally respect.

558
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:42,590
I mean I'm fucking around cause
they don't make this shift funny.

559
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:46,160
I don't care if you believe in that shit.
God bless you. You know, you know what,

560
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,850
I hope you're right so you can
laugh at me. Um, and we all die.

561
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,090
Um,
and so it really,

562
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:57,270
I'm going to hell for the rest of
my fucked for the rest of my life.

563
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,860
You don't think that's a little overkill?

564
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,930
I think the Rockefeller laws
of fucking bad anyways. Um,

565
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,620
yeah, just say, look, I respect that you
were under that type of stuff and listen,

566
00:33:08,621 --> 00:33:12,310
you know what I do? Who gives a
fuck? Somebody took you to church.

567
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,780
Somebody took you to church and you
after a while realize that you didn't

568
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:19,390
believe in it. So if she wants
to take the kids to church,

569
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,640
just let her take him to church.

570
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:25,870
But your wife has to be okay with the
fact that they, they say gay have them.

571
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:28,630
You don't go down and pray.
Do they hippie? You can say,

572
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:32,870
cause I don't believe in that stuff.
I don't think it happened. Okay.

573
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,240
And a couple of years you'll understand
what I mean when I tell you about all

574
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:41,590
saint nick, when they tell you the
real story, you know, there you go.

575
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:48,400
Santa Claus for adults every Sunday.
All right, Bill, do I go for it?

576
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,590
A belly fat face? Uh, love
the podcast, but be boo,

577
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,670
I need your opinion on something.
So like a typical douchebag.

578
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,030
I always joke with my wife
about having butts, sex.

579
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,030
He goes, just because it
makes you uncomfortable. Dude.

580
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Blood sex is one of the funniest
fucking words ever because it's,

581
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,020
it's, it's uh, but sex, it's
it, it's really fucking,

582
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,760
it almost, you know, it's almost
a sound effect of you pulling out,

583
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,730
but sex, you know, or going
in. That's disgusting.

584
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,080
I'm so much more disgusting on this
thing that I am in my regular pocket.

585
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,270
I'm in my regular act,
but a yeah, buts, but sex,

586
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:36,910
it's really like blunt
force kind of trauma there.

587
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,990
Can you hear every time I shift on the
couch so fucking well, Mike Tier, um,

588
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,780
he goes anyways.
The other day she offered to try it.

589
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,830
If I quit saying fuck and using the
Lord's name in vain for a month.

590
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,180
Honestly,

591
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,890
I never thought about trying it except
in high school with the chick using the

592
00:34:56,891 --> 00:35:01,090
anal virgin loophole.
Should I go for it? Thanks.

593
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:05,350
And Go fuck yourself. Um, no,

594
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,250
no you shouldn't.
Okay.

595
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,850
And not because I'm some purist and I'm
saying you shouldn't bang your wife in

596
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:17,670
the ass. Okay. That's your legal property.

597
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:19,160
You can do with it what you want.
Yeah.

598
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,600
Okay.

599
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,060
I'm just fucking with you.
No you shouldn't.

600
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,000
You know why you shouldn't cause you
have to do some sort of fucking parlor

601
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:34,930
trick. Hey, if you jump through
these fucking three hoops, you know,

602
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,430
then you can have a cookie.
Go Fuck Yourself.

603
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,100
Okay?

604
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,860
Go Fuck Yourself. See, it's too late
to say that. You know, if, if you to,

605
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,560
if you don't put your shoes on the rug,
maybe you can put the pepper. Yeah.

606
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:50,400
You know what?

607
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,230
Maybe if you paid for the NFL package,
I'll let you ride me about that.

608
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,550
Why do they always act like what they
have is so much better than what the fuck

609
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,160
you have.
You know why?

610
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:09,150
Cause we're weaker when like the fat guy
who can't resist a cookie and they're

611
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:11,750
sitting over there written
fucking salad laughing at us.

612
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,300
You know what you need to do, sir?
You need to get in control your Dick,

613
00:36:14,301 --> 00:36:16,640
you gotta get your fucking Dick and check,
okay?

614
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,610
This is the one thing for
you and for everybody else.

615
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,620
Lists every other guy listening to this.

616
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:25,700
Don't ever do a fucking party
trick for a sexual favor.

617
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,590
Go Fuck Yourself. All right? I'm not a God
damn chimp. That's what he got through.

618
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,710
Just rub one out. Rub One out, and
then you're not going to give a shit.

619
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,800
You don't what she should've said if she
said it, if the second she said she'll,

620
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,780
she'll offer to try it.
See right there.

621
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:44,870
All that means is you're not going to
say fuck for a month and you're not going

622
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:49,580
to say, God Damn Jesus Christ. It's
God Damn fucking Dean, Jesus Christ.

623
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:51,500
It doesn't work. You're not be
able to say that for a month,

624
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,190
just so you can sit there and for
fucking eight eighth of a second,

625
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,340
because she goes,
Whoa,

626
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,620
and then that's it. And then
you're going to go g Christ, right?

627
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,720
And then she's going to
sit there and be like, oh,

628
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:12,380
see you just going to go back
to saying that. You know,

629
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:15,890
I thought it was really nice that you
didn't say that to like a whole math,

630
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:20,300
right, and now you're fucking in that.
You know what it is. It's like you gave,

631
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,240
you gave up, you gave up
that real estate. Okay.

632
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,940
Just like the native Americans, just
like the Mexicans. When you lost Texas,

633
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,440
you know what you have to do.

634
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,570
You know what Mexicans have to do
to get that fucking thing back.

635
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:37,160
Do you realize the level of bloodshed
that they have to fucking did to ever get

636
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:40,130
that back? Okay. This is the
same thing in the fucking,

637
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,190
this is the Louisiana purchase right here.
You never get it back.

638
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,870
If you fucking sit there and act like
a goddamn point extra for a month and

639
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:50,120
don't talk like how you normally talk,

640
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,410
just so you can just basically a knock
on the door of her butthole to have.

641
00:37:59,090 --> 00:37:59,923
Right.

642
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,290
I love how you have to do the
entire thing that she wants.

643
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,740
Just so she can attempt
to maybe do what you want.

644
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:11,860
See what's you see what happened?
All right,

645
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,960
now you get a pass on this one, cause
this is your first time at the Rodeo.

646
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,800
So you missed it this time, but the
next time she does some shit like that,

647
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,180
I'll use this one as an example.
I'll let you do that if you know,

648
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,800
if you just try and do not say fuck and
use the Lord's name in vain for a month,

649
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,220
you don't. You should have said, you
should have said, sweetheart, I love you,

650
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:37,870
but fuck that. Okay. And get
out of the way that God, MTV

651
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,140
and in a weird way, she'd
respect your more cheap,

652
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:47,650
respect you more. You know what, dude?

653
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,420
You ought to be able to finish your way
into that. Fucking move into that, that,

654
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,700
that, that act at this point. All right?

655
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,920
You gotta be able to
talk your way into it.

656
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,370
You ought to be able to make her want
to do it at this point. All right.

657
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,780
Stop looking for the fucking
pass interference call.
Sit and get the first down.

658
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:05,770
Why don't you fucking earn it?

659
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,800
Unlike half the fucking quarterbacks
in the league these days. All right.

660
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,880
Okay. Sorry. That was tough
love. But you needed it.

661
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,900
Did she did everything but make
you put a fucking red nose on, um,

662
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,300
pink boxing gloves.

663
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:24,250
Jesus Christ felt I was watching the
boxing match between Adrian Broner and

664
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:27,280
Antonio Demarco and they
both have pink gloves.

665
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,090
Broner is wearing pink shorts.
It's fucking November 18th.

666
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
I don't know if you were into boxing.
Well,

667
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,720
the way I try to pronounce their names,
you can tell them that.

668
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:36,870
You know what it is.
I love boxing, but uh,

669
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,240
it's on Saturday nights and I'm
always working, so I miss it.

670
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,803
MMM.

671
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,490
Jimmy Dore, the great Jimmy door. He
always orders the fights and he always,

672
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,380
you know,
once every 10 fights,

673
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:51,540
I'm in town and I'll try and go over
there and watch him. He's a big,

674
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,680
big fight fan and a phenomenal comic. One
of my favorites. All right. Um, he says,

675
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:58,800
I don't know if you're into boxing,
but I know that if you watch this match,

676
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,660
you would have been furious.
I'm not, I, you know, I don't
give a shit. I just, it's,

677
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,920
I just think,
you know,

678
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,920
you could just see the writing on
the wall with all this pinch shit.

679
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,920
Eventually there's going to be a real
sports segment or there's going to be a 60

680
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,750
minutes segment.
I'm calling it right now,

681
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:22,250
like Paul Versey that there's going to
be some big fucking thing about how much

682
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:27,140
goddamn money these
corporations made off of,

683
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,210
off of um,

684
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,300
all this pink stuff that they
made off of this horrific disease.

685
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,560
You know what I mean?
At five hour energy.

686
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:40,190
A portion of the proceeds. Yeah.
How, how, how much of a portion,

687
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,660
how much of the portion goes to fighting
breast cancer and how much goes to you

688
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:49,640
and your fucking yacht? Huh? They
had tassels on your fucking shoes.

689
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,750
You don't, you don't, I love about that
pink. It's just a raising awareness.

690
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:57,230
Why don't you fucking tell us
how not to get it. You know,

691
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,850
from what I've been reading lately is
what you want to do is you want to eat

692
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:05,420
some of the, uh, some of the power
foods there. You don't like Kale.

693
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,750
Lot of those leafy Greens,
Bok Choy and all that type of things.

694
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:13,290
Their fill a fucking nutrients and they
actually help repair yourselves before

695
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,390
they go all the way over
into a cancerous cell.

696
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:19,350
Can you believe I have the fucking balls
to talk about something? This medical?

697
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,760
Do you realize I'm just sitting here?

698
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:25,440
Then I got three quarters away through
that sentence before I actually realized

699
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,640
like, wow, I am in way over my fucking
head. I don't even own a lab coat.

700
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,450
I've just been reading that book, uh, um,
eat for life and I got to tell you, dude,

701
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,410
I actually unbelieving in this because
I've tried. I did the ABS diet.

702
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:44,620
I've done all those fucking
diets, the pie protein, low carbs.

703
00:41:44,621 --> 00:41:48,880
I've done all of that shit. And every time
I was on those, I always had cravings.

704
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,290
Like, fuck I miss bread.
Fuck, I want ice cream. Fuck.

705
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,750
So what they should call those
diets, you know? But this thing here,

706
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,770
fill it up with Fiba.
It's been ridiculous.

707
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,730
It's actually easy to do.
I have a banana for breakfast.

708
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,130
Then I wait like an hour
and then I have an apple.

709
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Then I'm good to lunch and I sit down
and I have a giant fucking salad and it

710
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:18,310
fills me up. I feel great. Throw
some beans on there and I'm good.

711
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,420
I got to tell you something. You eat
like that. You'll never be constipated.

712
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:28,040
Ever eat like a rabbit. You will shit
like a horse. Trust me. Trust me.

713
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,110
If you see those shows,
the one that was at that fucking lady,

714
00:42:30,111 --> 00:42:34,880
you are what you eat for your meal
in, in a meal out. I was like,

715
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,510
what? What are you talking
about? I ate three meals a day.

716
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:42,140
You're gonna tell me I'm going
to fucking, you know, fucking,

717
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,660
uh, at the end of the night, I
got a six spot posting up a six.

718
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,350
The triple double a fucking shitting.

719
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:50,060
You're telling me that that's
going to happen. I'm telling you,

720
00:42:50,061 --> 00:42:53,150
if you fucking eat like that, it's
gonna happen. It's gonna happen.

721
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,910
I don't know. I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about, but uh, I, I have,

722
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:03,730
I've actually for once
I'm starting to read up on
nutrition and, uh, I don't know,

723
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,940
give, give that book a read. Let
me know what you think. By the way,

724
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:11,390
there's no advertising on the
podcast this week. None whatsoever.

725
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,040
I'll tell you why at some
point. Um, all right, Bill,

726
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:20,970
how much weight do I need to
lose to be fuckable? Oh, Jesus.

727
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,770
Uh, all right. Just saying that your
Europe decent looks. Here we go.

728
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:30,530
Dear Bill, a big fan of yours. Go
Fuck Yourself. That was perfect. Look,

729
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,230
compliment and an upper cut. I
liked it. He goes, I'm a fat ass.

730
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,660
I'm six one and used to weigh
400 pounds as of January,

731
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,600
2010 I've lost weight with little effort
on my part and now weigh 337 pounds.

732
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,970
Basically,
I lost weight by giving up soda,

733
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,840
adopting a one animal prob product,
meal philosophy,

734
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,320
and exercising two to three days a
week at the gym. Congratulations, dude.

735
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:01,090
That's awesome. I've got a
charge out of that. That's great.

736
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:03,750
You're attorney itself
around. Good for you. He goes,

737
00:44:03,751 --> 00:44:08,220
I currently work at Satan's
asshole Walmart. Uh,

738
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:11,790
I will talk about them in another
email. Oh, do buy it by all means.

739
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:16,410
By all means. Hey Al, you people who
work with for these giant corporations,

740
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:19,530
if you're seeing some CD shit,
by all means send it to me.

741
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:23,250
I'd love to read the stories or if you're
actually doing some good shit and you

742
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:26,220
want to bring down my paranoia a little
bit, I'll read the good shit too.

743
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,400
All did good shit. Fucking Douche. Uh,

744
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:35,340
my with them doesn't allow me to get
much exercise and this time a year or so

745
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:39,390
increasing my exercise,
Aina possible eight possible till January.

746
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,790
This question is for the lovely Nia.
Well,

747
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:48,630
she's not here right now and I fucked
you guys over last week cause I didn't

748
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:53,240
have time to do, uh, uh,
Neil Ogg anyways. Uh,

749
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,540
he says, how much, how much weight
would I have to lose to be fuckable?

750
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,730
I got a John Goodman,

751
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,060
Patton Oswald like potato face and want
to trash pat and I didn't know you were

752
00:45:04,061 --> 00:45:07,300
gonna say that. Um, sorry. Pam,

753
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,190
one of the best fucking comics out
there. Absolute beast. There we go.

754
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,640
Sorry, I don't read these till
they read them. My apologies.

755
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,510
Here's the link to my Facebook
picture with my skinny brother.

756
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,320
Let her see her.
Remember I am lazy.

757
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,520
I want the bare minimum to be fuckable
way. I got to go with this one now.

758
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,330
Here we are in faith. Jesus Christ. Dude.

759
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,790
All right, hang on a second. Let's look
at this here. There's your brother.

760
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,560
All right. To, how much weight
do you have to lose? All right.

761
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,300
The first thing you've got to do
is get some contacts. All right.

762
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:46,170
Lose those glasses.
I like how you're dressed.

763
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,340
You got a nice suit on.
I would say ya

764
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,940
get, you win the game. What'd you say?

765
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:55,780
Three 37 [inaudible] you know
I gotta tell you something new,

766
00:45:55,781 --> 00:46:00,300
but if you get down to two 75,
you get down to two 75.

767
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,720
Yeah, you six one two 75
year. You football weight,

768
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,030
you'd be fine to 75.

769
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:09,150
You could carry that and then just
keep going and get down to like two 30.

770
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,350
You'd be good. I'd keep rocking
the suits. I'd lose the glasses.

771
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:16,050
Or you know what I would do if you, if
you'd like, if you don't like context,

772
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,060
get a, uh, get a hipper more,
uh, you know, I'm judging Europe.

773
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,880
You're fucking souffle kind of
glasses. You know those, those,

774
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,000
that they were on TV, you could turn
it around. You're right there. Dude.

775
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,570
You're within 50 fucking pounds.
But a,

776
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:35,400
I wouldn't use the holidays as an excuse
not to lose weight. Dude. Just, um,

777
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,220
you know what? Here's one for
you. Get that fucking book. Um,

778
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,720
uh, eat to live. Get
that book, eat to live.

779
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,450
Just read the first hundred pages of it.
You'll get the gist of it.

780
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:50,280
And I'm just telling you,
you start turning yourself around.

781
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:54,320
You start losing fucking weight without
even having to go to the gym. All right?

782
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,610
Uh, he said, remember, I am lazy. I
want the bare minimum to be fuckable.

783
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,221
Dude,
you know,

784
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:03,000
something you got going for you as
you've got a great sense of humor too.

785
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,490
You get down to two 75 all right?

786
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,600
And you're funny and you're a
warm guy and you wear a suit.

787
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,010
I'm telling you it's going to
start happening for you. All right?

788
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:16,990
And you send me the fucking email about
Walmart and when you start getting late,

789
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,630
I want to know what the number was.
All right? Okay. Where are we now?

790
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,670
How many fucking minutes on 47 minutes.

791
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:27,900
Jesus Christ and coming up short
this week. Uh, overrated, underrated,

792
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,410
overrated. Making the bed.
Throughout my entire life,

793
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:36,760
I've noticed I've not once voluntary,
voluntarily made the bed.

794
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,860
I see it as a pointless, trivial tasks
that makes it serves no other purpose,

795
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,240
but to please other people with OCD
by giving them a sense of completion.

796
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,390
Why spend even more
then a minute of my day to fix something?

797
00:47:51,391 --> 00:47:55,590
I'm going to mess up in 14 hours anyway.
If I did my math correctly,

798
00:47:55,591 --> 00:48:00,210
people spend an average of 81 days worth
of time making the bed in their life.

799
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,490
Kim Kardashians. Marriage lasted
shorter than that. What a waste of time.

800
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,290
If you, if you're living alone, do cause
there's tight. Be any smaller here.

801
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,290
If you're living alone, you're,
you're made out to believe.

802
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,640
Making the bed is unnecessary.

803
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,580
Must do thing right next to
showering and brushing your teeth.

804
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:21,090
Who am I trying to impress?
If nobody else is around,

805
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,490
even if people around to see it,
what does it matter?

806
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,350
It's not like I don't have a clean house.

807
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,610
Does making my bed alone really determined
my cleanliness to others? What's next?

808
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,870
Tying our shoes after taking them off.
That's actually a good analogy.

809
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,980
Perhaps organizing our trash before
throwing it away. It's just ridiculous.

810
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,430
You know what? I get a lot of
that. But you know something?

811
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:45,000
Coming home to a bed that's making also
make you feel good. And also who knows?

812
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:49,230
You go out to Applebees just to go out
and get yourself some Mozzarella sticks,

813
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,950
right? And all of a sudden
you, you'll hook up with some
shit. You bring her home.

814
00:48:52,951 --> 00:48:56,160
I'm telling you, she's like, what
am I doing with this strange guy?

815
00:48:56,161 --> 00:48:59,100
Is fucking apartment.
Smells may be a little weird.

816
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,770
I'm telling you a messed up
bed can be a deal breaker.

817
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,080
Girls look at a messed up bed,

818
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:07,120
they'd probably think you're fucking just
all over everything or banged another

819
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,170
broaden there and next thing you know
she's got a half a foot out the door,

820
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,300
you know. But I, I do see,

821
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,190
I do see what you're saying and
I don't want to make the bed,

822
00:49:14,191 --> 00:49:15,660
but I gotta tell you
when I do make the bed,

823
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,590
when I do come at night and the bed is
made, I, it actually makes me feel good.

824
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,713
You know

825
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,640
how many times have you lost something in
the bed? Is Cell phones under a pillow,

826
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,140
right? You lose your shoe horn. Some other
fucking thing that nobody uses anymore.

827
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:35,690
Um, youtube, Bam of fans.
Oh, I got to see this.

828
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,000
I didn't even watch this
youtube video of the week.

829
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,940
I want to see this. Is it a bunch of
hot chicks with that? Great fucking,

830
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,440
this video is no longer available
due to copyright claim. Ah,

831
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,000
fucking crap bar to bar stool
sports was going to have that.

832
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:56,680
They're like always on the cutting edge
of all this sports stuff that you wanted.

833
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,400
I, you know what, I have that guy
as a guest way back in the day. Um,

834
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:01,970
so anyways,

835
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,930
where the fuck am I going to be coming
up 50 minutes and watch me chill somehow

836
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:10,460
kill 50 minutes. Why do I feel like I'm
required to give you an hour? You know,

837
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,230
wait a minute. You're working as short
week. You're only working til Wednesday.

838
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,670
Why don't I got to put in a full
fucking hour, you know, you know why?

839
00:50:19,671 --> 00:50:21,110
Cause I'm a solid fucking guy.

840
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,610
I'm not a solid guy and just
have a fucking need to be

850
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,610
he's firing on all cylinders.

851
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,330
I got more than enough.
You know,

852
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:09,570
I was afraid because I retired the
Steve jobs bit cause I did it on

853
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,000
the uh,
night at too many stairs.

854
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,810
Did you guys watch that clip that
I send you a like a clip of that?

855
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:22,920
Um, did I send a link to

856
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,720
Can you hear me clicking here

857
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,700
I'm going to try and find this
for you right here. Cool. Anyways,

858
00:51:32,701 --> 00:51:35,140
but if you get a chance to watch it,
it's night.

859
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,480
Too many stars just go on youtube search
that night at too many starts with the

860
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:43,380
fuck is my stomach door now.
Too many stars, uh, Bill Burn.

861
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:45,350
You'll find it on
youtube. And, uh, I never,

862
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,880
I got to thank Robert Smuggle cause he's,

863
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,470
he fought for that sec because there were
some people that were nervous cause I

864
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:56,471
was trashed and Steve Jobs and
on that network apple advertises,

865
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,470
which is a logical,

866
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:59,630
that's one of those corporate
decisions that doesn't bother me.

867
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,840
I understand that.
I'm fucking with their money.

868
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,290
But uh,

869
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:09,720
Robert Speigel really stuck up for me
on that one flock for this set. So, uh,

870
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,340
if you see it and you'll like it,
he's the reason why listen to my stomach.

871
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:17,110
If we'll do it and you hear it,
come on,

872
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,470
I'm to have to break it
down really quickly. Um, oh,

873
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,580
you know what I'm doing this week.

874
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,290
I'm going to my 25 year
fucking high school reunion.

875
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,820
I to get it down there at the time.
Did you hear her?

876
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,020
Gramma I'm on my 25 year
fucking high school reunion.

877
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,030
I haven't been to any of them
yet cause I felt like a loser.

878
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,940
Um,
you know what I mean?

879
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,540
So I'm actually gonna go back there with
a couple of my old drinking buddies and

880
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,310
I'm really looking forward
to seeing everybody there.

881
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:48,760
And I'm just hoping that I'm,
I'm able to have, uh, you know,

882
00:52:48,761 --> 00:52:51,220
I really chose a different road,
you know,

883
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:54,370
most of the people obviously that I know,
including the guys I'm going with,

884
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,070
they got married, they had kids, you know,

885
00:52:57,071 --> 00:53:00,920
they got the House with the picket fence,
they did that type of shit. And, uh,

886
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,500
so I'm just hoping that it's not going
to be like, so you're a comedian. Oh,

887
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:06,940
that's awesome.
All right.

888
00:53:06,941 --> 00:53:08,900
And then everybody's just going
to talk about their kids and,

889
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:11,860
and we sitting there with my fucking
hands in my pockets, like, yeah.

890
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,530
So, ah, you know what? I think I
left something in my rented Geo,

891
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,680
you know, it's pretty confident. Move on.

892
00:53:19,681 --> 00:53:22,980
I'm showing up in a fucking
rented economy car. Do you know,

893
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,580
I met some Douche one time,

894
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,010
this fucking lady and she had gone,

895
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,640
she had grown up in my town.
I,

896
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,220
she was a little bit older and,
uh,

897
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,170
I met her at one of my shows

898
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:42,410
and she was talking about how she had
recently gone to a high school reunion and

899
00:53:42,411 --> 00:53:47,411
just was talking about how pathetic
everybody in her class was and how,

900
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,513
um,

901
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:53,540
she only stayed there for two hours
before she left and went back to the Ritz

902
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,540
Carlton in downtown Boston before boarding
her United flight back to Colorado.

903
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,710
I'll never forget that she used all the
names of every corporation that she was

904
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:07,370
involved in, the Ritz Carlton
in Boston, Boarding night,

905
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:10,690
United Airlines flight,
you know, and it was,

906
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:13,660
it was fucked up because as far
as I can tell from talking to her,

907
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,850
all she didn't life was marry a rich guy.

908
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:17,343
You know,

909
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,910
she's sitting there looking down on these
fucking people. It's just, you know,

910
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,300
United Airlines.
I liked how she said that,

911
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:28,620
like it was the fucking conquered
going to back to Paris. I don't know.

912
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,480
I just hope it's not,
I don't think it can be like that.

913
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:35,430
I actually came up with a
really cool grade. It was crazy.

914
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:39,420
The grade above me and the
grade below me where, uh,

915
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,920
they wa everybody might and my
high school were, were cool,

916
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,610
but they will psychos the grade
above me and the grade below me,

917
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,770
they just fought like they will fucking
maniacs every weekend there was some

918
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,890
bench clearing brawl and a party,

919
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:00,390
somebody gets a bottle smashed over the
fucking head. That was like lawsuits.

920
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,290
There was a dude in the grade above me.
You want to talk about party tricks?

921
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,310
His thing was he would eat a light bulb
and he'd be just sitting there eating it

922
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:10,620
with his gums bleeding and be smiling.

923
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,370
It's blood in between his
teeth like fucking maniac.

924
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,410
Okay, I need combat
that. It's fucking nuts.

925
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,560
But my grade was mellow.
We would just be like,

926
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,920
what was cool about my grade was
when you know, suburban shit,

927
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:29,850
everyone would end up going drinking in
the woods and everybody had their click.

928
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,410
And with each year the clicks
just sort of started, you know,

929
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,090
you know, coming together like
a virus, but in a good way.

930
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:42,240
And by the end of it, everybody was
kinda hanging out with each other.

931
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,813
You know,

932
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,560
we go up,
we used to go to this play,

933
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:50,130
this industrial park that wasn't not
developed yet and we would go down there

934
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:53,640
and there was a bunch of burned out
cars back in the day when you could just

935
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,560
burn cars for fucking insurance

936
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,190
and uh,

937
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,120
and nobody would do it. You know,
there was no fucking, I don't know,

938
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:05,970
it just seemed that they didn't
even investigate it. Yeah.

939
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,530
I got a fucking had is 74 pinto.
Yeah.

940
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:13,680
I can't believe somebody stole it
either. Had, it's unbelievable.

941
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,390
Then they give you money. Insurance
fraud was really easy back then and that,

942
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,490
and the during those days. But
anyways, we used to drink down there

943
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,410
and uh,

944
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,780
that's fine. That's all we
would do. We would just,

945
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,870
everyone could come down in your cars
and you see some of these headlights come

946
00:56:29,871 --> 00:56:32,500
in and then everyone will be like,
is that a cop is a cop.

947
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,970
And there was always the people,

948
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:37,330
the experts recognizing the silhouette
of the car and like the, uh,

949
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,580
the square headlights
back then, it was the, uh,

950
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:44,260
the crown Vic and an 85 crown Vic
that had a very unique look to it.

951
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,700
And that was an aerodynamic at all and
you could just tell and everyone would

952
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:53,290
fucking scro hide the beers. All the
bullshit we were drinking. So, uh,

953
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,470
I dunno. So I, I haven't
gone to any of the, uh,

954
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:59,690
the union said from a
feeling like a loser.

955
00:56:59,691 --> 00:57:04,691
And then I will say I kind of a paranoia
where I so liked everybody in my grade.

956
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,120
I didn't want to come back and
see somebody's not doing well.

957
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,500
I didn't want to see somebody with the
fucking gallbladder problem or somebody

958
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,840
divorced or just somebody you know,
want, I want to remember everybody,

959
00:57:14,841 --> 00:57:18,050
the way I remembered them. Everybody
in my grade was fucking hilarious.

960
00:57:18,051 --> 00:57:19,930
They had that light in there.
I know you're there at the end.

961
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,140
Their whole fucking lives
ahead of them. So, um,

962
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,090
I guess that's the thing that I'm
the most nervous about. I just want,

963
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:30,770
I want to go back and see
like happy people, you know.

964
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:31,490
Okay.

965
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,180
I don't want to see somebody fucked up
their back and now they can't work and

966
00:57:35,181 --> 00:57:36,800
their fucking jobs fucking with them.

967
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:39,560
I'm just really hoping that
that's going to be, you know,

968
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,850
this is the ups and downs in life,

969
00:57:40,851 --> 00:57:44,360
but I'm really hoping that that's going
to be to a fucking minimum, a minimal,

970
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,340
a minimum. You don't have mine nuts.
Do you guys, actually, you don't,

971
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,870
you guys have any high school
reunion stories? I want to hear him.

972
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:56,640
Some good ones, some nightmare ones, uh,
and that type of shit just to, you know,

973
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:01,180
keep the podcast rolling here and maybe
a different direction at some point. Um,

974
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:02,330
anyways,
that's all I got.

975
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,570
I could really fucking hang in here for
another fucking round and take a couple

976
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:09,590
of concussions that are going to fucking
catch up with me later on in life.

977
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:12,340
I don't want to do that.
Lead the cops on a, um,

978
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:14,450
okay.

979
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,100
A police chase or some fucking
thing, whatever. Oh by the way,

980
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,170
before we're playing the dirty
stinking jets this week, uh,

981
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,270
the very quiet jets, I guess somebody
was shitting all over the jets this year.

982
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:29,180
I kid shit on the jets.
They've had so many fucking injuries.

983
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:33,750
I think it's actually amazing that
they're a, the [inaudible] six and a,

984
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:34,371
what's his face?

985
00:58:34,371 --> 00:58:38,600
Rex Ryan hasn't been talking shit and
there's something funny about seeing him

986
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,561
and uh,

987
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:44,561
that guy there raw Tony Serono with
his witness protection hat and glasses.

988
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:46,780
I know his ice got something
going on with the Zionist.

989
00:58:46,781 --> 00:58:48,590
Why are you going to wear,
this is just something funny about them.

990
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:51,650
I was watching the game today before we
switched over to the next and I saw the

991
00:58:51,651 --> 00:58:55,640
two of them standing there like high
fiving and hugging each other after a

992
00:58:55,641 --> 00:58:58,460
touchdown. And I just started
laughing. I said, diversity. I go,

993
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,900
they look like two fucking guys who were
just about ready to walk into a casino.

994
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:03,501
You know,

995
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:06,560
those guys that walk into a casino still
haven't learned the lesson that they're

996
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:10,220
going to lose. They come in like rubbing
their hands like they got a system.

997
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,400
That's what they look like.
They looked like two guys.

998
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,850
They weren't like a buddy movie and you'd
fucking roof for himself. Uh, I dunno.

999
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:22,340
I Dunno. I've kind of lost my heat when
someone's not talking shit anymore.

1000
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:26,340
I don't give a fuck. Is that
weird? I Dunno. Go Fuck Yourself.

1001
00:59:26,341 --> 00:59:30,230
So that's a podcast for
this week. Okay. Um, Nhl,

1002
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:35,630
I'm sorry, I waited to damn near
December. I need another sport,

1003
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,400
um, to offset when football's not
on. So I don't know what to tell you.

1004
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:45,050
I'm getting the League pass. Um, I don't
think you should take two weeks off.

1005
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,780
And you know what people out
there who blaming the players.

1006
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,620
It's not the player's fault. This
is a lockout. This is the owners.

1007
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:55,430
The owners are basically saying that we
don't agree with what we agreed with two

1008
00:59:55,431 --> 01:00:00,020
already a couple of years earlier.
That's such a fucking, like,

1009
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,960
it's such a, it's so, so what the self,

1010
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:06,500
the players really don't have an agreement
unless the agreement totally works

1011
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:10,040
out for the owners. That, is that
what it is? You know what I mean?

1012
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,760
This is what the NFL owners did last year.
Oh wait a minute,

1013
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:16,300
that agreement that we agreed to,
we don't agree with anymore.

1014
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:20,600
So we're taking our stadiums and going
home and unless you agree to our fucking

1015
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:22,130
demands,
I dunno,

1016
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,490
I side with the players on this
one and I really hope that they uh,

1017
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:29,120
that they could work it out cause I'm,
I miss it.

1018
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:33,140
I was watching this thing on Hbo.
They were running this thing on the uh,

1019
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,150
I know this is fucked up cause I keep
leaning back and coming forward to help

1020
01:00:36,151 --> 01:00:38,890
this as a mess with the
recording too much. But I um,

1021
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:44,220
I watched this thing on the
broad street bullies and a,

1022
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,270
I have a love hate even
though it was before my time.

1023
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:48,470
I have a love hate for that whole,

1024
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:53,090
that whole fucking team just because I
always loved the fighting cause that's

1025
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:57,320
what was going on when I got into
hockey. But it also, you know,

1026
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,980
that style of play really
set the game back for a long,

1027
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,210
long fucking time to,

1028
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:08,270
to the point that people to this day
when they criticized hockey and when you

1029
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:11,900
listen to them talk about it,
you would think it was the mid seventies,

1030
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:16,160
early eighties. Like they don't
even fucking watch it. And uh,

1031
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:17,600
I dunno.

1032
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,900
Do you ever see that whole thing about
when the Russians came over here to play

1033
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:21,950
the NHL?
He basically,

1034
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:24,860
I guess it would plan for exhibition games
and everybody knew that they were the

1035
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:28,700
shit. It's Canada's game and uh, you know,

1036
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:33,170
the Cold War was in full effect
and it was basically like,

1037
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,270
um, we wanted to beat
these guys. You know,

1038
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:41,390
it was like saying that capitalism
was right and communism was wrong.

1039
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,100
So the Russians came in and played
three top teams and beat all of them.

1040
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:51,500
So it was down to the flyers to beat
them and the flyers, to their credit,

1041
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:53,510
that coach actually
came up with the system,

1042
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:56,240
which seemed like the lock of
the trap and they just fucking,

1043
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,910
they slowed them down and the
Russians couldn't figure it out.

1044
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,970
And once they had that goal and
they started playing flyer hockey,

1045
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,390
which is why I really feel where
they made their fucking mistake,

1046
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,510
they shouldn't have done that.
They should've just beat him straight up.

1047
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:12,800
But basically they started throwing
elbows to the face is slash and Adam and

1048
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:14,120
doing all this type of ship.

1049
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:19,560
And the final one was some fucking guy
in the fly escapes out of the penalty box

1050
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,180
and just fucking elbows.

1051
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:26,040
This guy right in the face and the guy
goes down and it's not that he did it,

1052
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,690
it was that there was no call.

1053
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:32,430
So then the Russian guy calls his
players off the ice and says, all right,

1054
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:33,840
fuck it. That's it. We're going home.

1055
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,620
And I then they will show him the
flyers and the guys going, so you quit,

1056
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,890
you take your players off the ice,
like this guy a posting.

1057
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:44,060
It's like now he's not a pussy.
Okay.

1058
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:49,210
It's like we fucking played you straight
up and we beat you three fucking times

1059
01:02:49,211 --> 01:02:53,380
in a row. We're better than
you. Even if you win tonight.

1060
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:56,380
We won three out of four
and we proved that we were,

1061
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:59,650
we were better during that time.
The Russian team was fucking better.

1062
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,800
So the only way you can fucking beat
him is to basically cheat in play dirty.

1063
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,820
I think it was fucked up,
but,

1064
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:11,020
but the Russians came back out and
they ended up losing them. Uh, I dunno,

1065
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,950
I don't want to be on American here,

1066
01:03:12,951 --> 01:03:15,620
but I gotta side with the Russians on
that one. I think it was fucked up.

1067
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:18,680
So I imagine I'm going to hear from
a bunch of fucking angry flyer fans,

1068
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:22,500
but I've never liked that shit.
I've never liked it.

1069
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:25,230
I don't mind a goon fight
and the fucking goon,

1070
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:28,080
but I never liked that shit in hockey
where it was just like, all right,

1071
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:32,390
let's do some all Samuelson
shit. I'm not as good as you. Uh,

1072
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,230
maybe I'll just jump on your fucking knee.

1073
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,090
And then for some reason they then
they do that day happy a halo,

1074
01:03:38,091 --> 01:03:40,710
but it moves on your thing. Who
Love Them. I never got into that,

1075
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:43,020
but I think it's bullshit.
But I do respect of the,

1076
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,640
the flyers to a certain extent
and their fan base. But I,

1077
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:49,860
I thought that that one was fucked up.
He should have, he had the game plan.

1078
01:03:49,861 --> 01:03:54,030
You can, she should have just
beat him straight up. All right.

1079
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:56,520
I had to put that one to bed.

1080
01:03:56,950 --> 01:04:00,670
I already give you my opinion on a fucking
game that happened 37 fucking years

1081
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:01,481
ago.
All right.

1082
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:04,620
That's the podcast I would that I went
over an hour during the holiday week.

1083
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:08,770
Sticks it everybody have a wonderful
thanksgiving. Uh, you know,

1084
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:12,370
try to get along with your
relatives. Don't take the bait, okay?

1085
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:15,810
You can't change the past. You
can't change them. All right?

1086
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:20,470
All you can do is change the
future by, uh, by what you create.

1087
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:25,480
Okay? So they, you'd go, man, that's the
most hippie thing I've ever fucking said.

1088
01:04:25,481 --> 01:04:29,290
And trying to be a little more positive.
All right, that's it. Go fuck yourselves.

1089
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,340
I'll talk to you next week.
