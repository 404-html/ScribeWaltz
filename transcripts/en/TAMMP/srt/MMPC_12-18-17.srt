1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,681
Hey,

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:04,600
what's going on is bill burr and it's
time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:08,880
Monday, December 18th, 2017.

4
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:13,710
What's going on? How are
Ya? How you doing? How are
Yay, look at you over there.

5
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,500
You look good. You look
good. Um, I, you know,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,750
a lot of people probably think I'm in a
great mood with that patriots' victory,

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,130
uh, yesterday, which is actually today
cause I'm recording at night, but uh,

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,510
I just had what can they
fix that fucking rule.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,593
Okay.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,250
That's it. It's a catch. You caught the
fucking ball. You're ran with the ball.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,600
You stick it over the goal line.
It's a fucking touchdown.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,910
Dez Bryant, few years ago, fucking
touchdown. The week before that,

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,160
whoever the fucking cowboys played,
was it the lions?

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,240
They should have won that game. I,
I don't, I don't fucking get it.

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,160
I don't understand how that rule is
supposed to make it less confusing.

16
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:04,750
Nobody even touched the guy.
He had control of the ball.

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,080
I, I don't like the ground.
Can't cause a fumble,

18
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:14,580
but it can cause an incomplete pass.
It can break up a pass.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,130
So it only if you're a receiver do
you get fucked over by the ground?

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,840
But if you're a running back,

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,410
you're in the clear does
that how it works daddy?

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,140
They made a football move.
I'll tell you,

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,960
that's going to be the last one.
Did they?

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,910
They're going to have to adjust it.
That rule during the off season.

25
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:43,470
They have to fix it cause that
was for home field advantage, um,

26
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,510
throughout the playoffs. That
was fucking huge. And uh,

27
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,210
it's a fucking amazing game.
Amazing fucking game. Right?

28
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,070
I think we both can agree with
that on both sides. And by the way,

29
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,330
conti ass fucking Steeler fans.
Remember I'm saying this shit for one.

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,230
The pendulum swings your fucking way.
All right.

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,590
I hate why he would fucking,

32
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,820
when I hate those sports fans where
if there's a bullshit call in in a,

33
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,600
it goes your way.
Yo Bro.

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,660
That's like that 50 year old guy banging
an 18 year old girl was, you know,

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,330
I just know scumbag Arry going on there.
Um,

36
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,770
yeah, that, that, I dunno, that
whole fucking thing was just like,

37
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm trying to remember what happened.
At the end of the game. Okay.

38
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:44,920
The game starts off great. I know. I'm
going to say the guy's fucking name wrong.

39
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:47,320
I've been too fucking busy. But, uh,

40
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,110
seeing Ryan Shazier is NSA Shazier,
you know,

41
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,850
at the game,
that was great to see.

42
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,630
And he looked like he was in great
spirits and I was looking up like, like,

43
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,481
I don't know if you guys know this,

44
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:01,840
but like paralysis is a major
fucking like phobia, you know,

45
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,780
like when people go, I don't want to
be burned at death. Like my thing is,

46
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:09,160
is just fucking laying there
and not being able to move. Um,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,720
I dunno like that, that just seems
like the worst, I don't know,

48
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:14,950
worse than fucking death.

49
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,260
So to see the tech guys getting feeling
in his legs and that type of stuff was,

50
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:23,230
I don't, I'm just some weird selfish
way. It was like a relief to me.

51
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,150
Probably should have thought of him first,

52
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,810
but I'm a selfish cunt living in
Hollywood and that's why the good lord is

53
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:33,280
burning it down. Um, no, let's,
let's even mean you know what,

54
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,680
you know what it was. I actually
felt great for the guy, but I,

55
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,730
I grew up in such a fucked up part
of the world that actually me saying

56
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,790
something nice about him.
I got, I get weirded out.

57
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,030
So then I had to be a dick
throughout all of that. So anyways,

58
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,780
what I'm trying to say is I'm really
happy that that guy looks like he's going

59
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,840
to be okay. Okay. That's
what I was trying to say.

60
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,350
So it starts off with that and then
it's going to be another classic Patriot

61
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,190
Steeler battle, which it was,
we missed an extra point.

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,170
Is that going to come back to haunt us?

63
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,840
There's no way this game could go into
overtime. That's what I'm thinking.

64
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,710
And then all of a sudden

65
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,870
to the steel has had the fucking game
one who's kitten Ho and then the last two

66
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,000
possessions before we went
with the go ahead score,

67
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,780
they kind of fucking played the
little alligator arm ball. Right.

68
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,960
Which allowed us to get back in it.
Then Brady threw an interception,

69
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:23,230
but the guy dropped it.
Sorry, the guy drops the ball.

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,580
This is what I can remember the
dewdrop drop the fucking ball.

71
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:31,090
That was the end of the game.
And then Tony Romo goals yet though.

72
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,930
I get the chance.
Was it basically what I was saying,

73
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,420
we go down the field,

74
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,160
Brady to Gronk Brady to Gronk Brady
Brady to Gronk touchdown two point

75
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,370
conversion Brady to Gronk
go fuck yourself. All right.

76
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,803
Okay.

77
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:52,070
That was like when Batman and Robin and
the TV show would be stuck in a fucking

78
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:54,450
trap. You know what I mean?
And they, we ended the episode,

79
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:55,830
lots of that for the cake crusade.

80
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:58,230
Then all of a sudden they break out and
they beat the fuck out of everybody,

81
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,130
right?
That was the football version of that.

82
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:03,930
Okay.

83
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,830
So then there's 50 something seconds
left and now I'm not feeling comfortable

84
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:12,240
cause they got fucking Big Ben and they
have this great field goal kicker and I

85
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:15,060
know that everybody's going to go into
the fucking whatever the fuck they went

86
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:19,260
into, whatever that defenses that
makes everybody look like Joe Montana,

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,270
including fucking, uh, Jimmy
Garappolo out there in San Francisco.

88
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,680
I love how both quarterbacks,
who's The fucking guy in Tennessee?

89
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:33,180
Is it Vinny Testaverde? Is he
still playing? Uh, Mike Moriarty?

90
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,220
What the fucks, I can never remember
his name. The kid from Oregon,

91
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,870
he marches down the field,
go ahead. Score, you know,

92
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,030
against their fucking end of the game.
So now we don't play defense.

93
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:44,490
So I guess the ratings
increase is that what happens?

94
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,300
Okay.

95
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,240
Right. They go ahead and when
they go for the go ahead score,

96
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,370
then fucking 49 is get the ball back or
they just marched right down the goddamn

97
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,050
field. The old right there, Fred. Um,

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,953
anyways,

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,750
yeah.

100
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,480
So it was like 56 seconds left.
What the fuck?

101
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,170
Just don't let them get out of bounds.
Give him the middle of the field.

102
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:08,860
I guess that's what they try to do. And
what do we do? What the fuck did we do?

103
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,630
How many times is our defense going to
do this to Tom Brady after he wins a

104
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:18,280
fucking game? God knows we did it twice.
Playing the giants and the Superbowl. Tom,

105
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,510
terrific.
As Paul Versey calls them,

106
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,990
goes down the fucking field
and for the go ahead score,

107
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,270
all that defense has to do is stop them.

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,860
Sanjay Samuel drops the fucking ball.
Uh,

109
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,090
anyways, I don't know what the fuck. Let
me, let me, let me stay on this year here.

110
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,820
So I don't know what this
fucking defense is going to do.

111
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:41,670
So for whatever fucking reason,
Ben Roethlisberger

112
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,840
fucking throws.
What was,

113
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:49,841
it was at a screen pass that
goes for 69 fucking yards.

114
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,930
It was like the guide.
It was like the,

115
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,230
all of a sudden we turned to look
at a third grade pop Warner team.

116
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,700
Two guys bump into each other and the
dude continues on down the fucking

117
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:06,670
sideline.
Now that down at the 10 yard line and all,

118
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:09,830
I'm thinking, well the very least this
is going to go into fucking overtime,

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,553
right?

120
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,870
Ben goes back to pass, throws it
to the fuck. Was it a white dude?

121
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:20,290
I don't even remember. Everything
happened so fast. He caught the ball.

122
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,980
He goes in touchdown, right? Well,

123
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:28,580
they've got to look to see
if his knees down hair.

124
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,370
I can't believe. I cannot fucking
believe they called that back.

125
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,030
Okay.

126
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,130
What more do you have to
do to establish possession?

127
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,020
He's got the ball.

128
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,860
Is he supposed to stop with 10 seconds
left and hold it up to the ref?

129
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,930
This is a football,

130
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,250
I have it in my hands to try to run it in.

131
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,520
The guy did exactly what the fuck he
was supposed to do. He caught the ball,

132
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,110
headed to the end zone,
reached out and score.

133
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,500
They took it away from
him. Then I think the, uh,

134
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,781
you know,

135
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,690
this is when it comes down to coaching
and this is why the Patriots win these

136
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:17,620
Games is that when they fucking
call the fucking touchdown back,

137
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,310
it didn't look like the fucking
Steelers knew what they wanted to do.

138
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,260
I don't know what the hell that was

139
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,210
and I'm just basically telling
you what the fuck you saw. Um,

140
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,690
cause I'm doing it Sunday night.
I still can't believe that we,

141
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,600
not even that we won the game.

142
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,820
I can't believe that that
wasn't a catch and a touchdown.

143
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,250
I don't know what else you have to do.

144
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,620
Okay.

145
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,810
To show a possession.
You know what,

146
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,470
I'm to them for like the 19th
time on this fucking podcast.

147
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:49,650
I'm going to look up this
rule and I'm going to read it.

148
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,800
Reading NFL rules is is
it's like reading the Bible.

149
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,770
It's like what are they about?

150
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,580
Yeah.

151
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,350
Alright. Nfl. That's why you have
a preacher for all the dummies out.

152
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:03,300
Like I actually,
do you mind times?

153
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,820
I've sat down when I was younger
and I tried to read the Bible.

154
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:07,940
Okay.

155
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,300
It's like don't kick. Can
we, can we update this shit?
Can we put it in in some, in,

156
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,930
in just some language that
I can understand cause it
might as well be in Latin.

157
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,490
I don't know what anybody's talking about.

158
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,450
Just know there's a lot of murder
incest in the beginning. It's just like,

159
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,120
I don't want to see the end of this movie.
All right.

160
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,390
Nfl Rule

161
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,350
and that felt real catching pass.

162
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,580
Yeah.

163
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,590
How many people look completing a catch?

164
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,003
Okay,

165
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,460
what in the fuck do you have to do?
All right.

166
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:47,280
A player who makes a catch
may advance the ball.

167
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,190
I'm aware of that a Ford pass is,

168
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:55,191
it is complete by the offense or
interceptor intercepted by the defense.

169
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:58,320
If a player who is inbounds number one,

170
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,240
secure is control of the ball in his
hands or arms prior to the ball touching

171
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,074
the ground.

172
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,260
Okay.

173
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,750
Which I felt that guy did see.

174
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:11,050
The thing is you have to know what
they consider securing the ball.

175
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,510
I think he was supposed
to hold it like an infant

176
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,930
and two touches the ground
in bounds with both feet. Oh.

177
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,010
At any part of his body and others had
that was not pluggable to this. All right.

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,500
Well I mean, yeah, I guess it's applicable
to every catch it, but it wasn't.

179
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,540
There was no out-of-bounds issue.
Here's what I'm saying.

180
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Number three maintains control of the
ball after a and B have been fulfilled

181
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,650
until he has the ball long enough
to clearly become a runner.

182
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,940
That's another weird thing. It's like
he's running while he catches it,

183
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,470
he's a runner.
The whole fucking play.

184
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,460
What we mean is running in full possession
of the ball after fulfilling the the

185
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,610
requirements of number one and number two.
I'm a player,

186
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:00,510
has the ball long enough to
become a runner when after
his second foot is on the

187
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:00,961
ground,

188
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:05,961
he is capable of avoiding or warding
off in pending contact of an opponent.

189
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,230
Okay.

190
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,580
What if it's a bang bang play
I guess then it's not a catch.

191
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,320
Well I guess they call that all the
time. Okay. Comma, tucking the ball away,

192
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,350
turning up field or taking additional
steps. So that's what happens at,

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I think at the goal line is when you're
that close and there's that little time

194
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:31,180
left, you don't have time and
you're fallen to the ground,

195
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,310
you don't have time to Tuck the ball away.

196
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,020
Okay.

197
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,800
They okay.

198
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,780
They have to put something here for this
goal line shit or first her first down

199
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,720
situations where

200
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,990
they have to be able to understand that
somebody is reaching the ball forward to

201
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,270
either get a first down or a touchdown.
Maybe that's what it is.

202
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,400
So I guess because didn't
Tuck the ball the way.

203
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,910
If a player has control of the ball,

204
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,140
a slight movement of the ball would
not be considered a loss of possession.

205
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,350
He must lose control of the ball in order
to rule that there has been a loss of

206
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:08,974
possession,

207
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,530
so he has to establish
control and then lose control.

208
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,870
If the player loses the
ball while simultaneously
touching both feet or any part

209
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:23,620
of his body to the ground,
it's not a catch. All right,

210
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:28,621
so both feet were on the ground so they
thought he lost control of the ball or

211
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:33,771
never had it to begin with despite the
fact that he caught it and then turned up

212
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,670
field for those finals,
whatever,

213
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,940
three yards saw the goal line,

214
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,100
took the ball in,
reached over the fucking goal line.

215
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,100
I just feel like for me, when you
fucking have the ball and you're like,

216
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,100
if he wasn't in control,
he wouldn't have done something like that.

217
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,280
He wouldn't be going like Wah Wah,

218
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,400
like fucking he at that time at the
fucking juggling the fucking thing.

219
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,863
MMM.

220
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,451
All right.

221
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:09,451
End Zone catches for the requirement for
a catch in the end zone or the same as

222
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:13,180
the requirements for a catch in the
field of play. Note in the field of play,

223
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:17,980
if a catch of a Ford Pass
has been completed after
which contact by a defendant

224
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:21,430
causes the ball to become loose
before the runner is down by contact,

225
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,360
it is a fumble and the ball remains alive.
That all makes sense. In the end zone,

226
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:29,200
the same action is a touchdown because
the plays automatically. Oh, okay.

227
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,910
I understand that.
That makes sense.

228
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,030
Okay.

229
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,790
All right.
Four ball touches ground.

230
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,150
If the ball touches the ground after
the players secures control of it,

231
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,620
it is a catch provided. The player
continues to maintain control. All right,

232
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,380
so they didn't think he either
secured or had control of it.

233
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,020
So what constitutes having control
of it or securing the ball?

234
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Jesus fucking Christ. I mean dd you feel
any closer to having an answer for that?

235
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,540
I don't. Um, anyways,

236
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,310
so here's a bright side.
If you're a Steeler fan.

237
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,623
MMM.

238
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,150
In this weird way.

239
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:16,880
I was kind of hoping the Patriots were
going to lose that game even though we

240
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,740
would have to play you guys in Pittsburgh.

241
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,900
I just feel like both teams are so evenly
matched that is going to be very hard

242
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:28,901
for one of the two teams to beat each
other twice to sweep the other teams.

243
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:30,620
So I was thinking like,
well,

244
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:34,310
if we lose then Bella check is going to
figure out what they're fucking doing

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,650
and then he'll correct it and
he's done that time and again,

246
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:43,310
and he will avenge the loss and God knows
we've gone into Pittsburgh enough time

247
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:47,630
in one there. So we know we
can do that. But now, I dunno,

248
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,740
I dunno about this one.

249
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,280
I Dunno.
Like,

250
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,470
uh, that was just a
weird, it's just a fun,

251
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,450
it was just a weird ending to
a game. Okay. And all of that.

252
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:03,830
What's going to be forgot is that we
gave up 69 yards on a fucking screen pass

253
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,120
at the end of the fucking game
and should a lost, but we did.

254
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,920
So now we're going to be
home. I Dunno. I Dunno.

255
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,000
That was a,
that was weird.

256
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,910
That was a weird one.
Uh,

257
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,320
that was just a weird one.

258
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,120
But thank God in Pittsburgh they've gone
back to back with Stanley Cups. Okay.

259
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,590
So they can fucking,
uh,

260
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,450
they can stick both those in their ears
so they don't want to listen to dead

261
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,250
fucking crying in the other room. I don't
know what to tell you guys. That was,

262
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,084
you know,

263
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,743
I dunno.

264
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,010
I am now fascinated with this.
I am officially after,

265
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,780
this is the third time I've seen a
team get fucked over on a touchdown or

266
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,740
winning the game.
I have to figure out what the fuck.

267
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,260
Okay.

268
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,980
When, when did do you like
tucking the ball away?

269
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,310
Like there's so many times when you say
fourth and a couple of yards where you

270
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,410
have to catch and people are coming in,

271
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:10,350
you've got to grab it and fucking
reach forward to get a first down.

272
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,740
I Dunno, I have no idea.
But you know, it's funny.

273
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,730
On Twitter they were blaming the
patriots like some outlets are shit,

274
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,343
you know.

275
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,333
Okay

276
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,020
packers, you know, you could shit
on the packers, couldn't you?

277
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,710
Then they benefit from that cowboy
has benefited and got fucked.

278
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,140
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

279
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,830
Somehow I know it will somehow go back
to deflate gate and somehow it will go

280
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:40,450
back to that shit once again. You know
what I mean? I swear to God. Um, anyways,

281
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:45,040
plowing ahead. I just got back from
Orlando, Florida in Fort Lauderdale,

282
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:49,120
Florida. Uh, two of the most
fun shows I had this year. Um,

283
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,640
just great crowds. I was down
there with a forest Shah and um,

284
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,690
it's great pan of Jag. I,
I'm just not drinking dude.

285
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,350
So I'm getting up early.
I've been practicing my drums,

286
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:05,210
kind of hard to practice drums now when I,
uh,

287
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,720
it's just like when we edit a lot of
the times my daughter's up and then the,

288
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,870
the one window I have to play is like
this time at night right now when she goes

289
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,580
to go to sleep. So I can't
be a Douche, so I don't, uh,

290
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,240
not playing as much as I
would like to play. But I saw,

291
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,980
I watched two amazing
documentaries on Netflix.

292
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,773
MMM.

293
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,610
I was embarrassed by my,
I'll show you. You know,

294
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,010
do you guys know like on
your Netflix homepage,

295
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:40,990
like everybody's homepage is different
because they sort of watch what you watch.

296
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,870
They have like this fucking thing
and then like whatever you're into,

297
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:47,620
you know what I mean? You guys, why am I
going to explain to people how it works?

298
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:49,770
You know how it fucking works.
Everybody's is different.

299
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,650
So what mine became was
everything that I was watching.

300
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,750
See now it's cool again.

301
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,950
But what it was before was everything
was just fucking drug cartels behind the

302
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:08,790
scene.
Prison Shit.

303
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,740
MMM.

304
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,950
What else did the head, it was all just,
yeah, it was just all shit like that.

305
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,240
And then, yeah, it was just all prisons,
drug dealers, people getting killed,

306
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:24,890
all of this shit.
So I watched two fucking documentaries,

307
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,180
like as I got, I got, I got,

308
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:30,680
I got to watch some other shit too to
switch this up a little bit. And, um,

309
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,890
I watched the John Coltrane documentary
and then I watched one called,

310
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,730
uh,
I called him Morgan,

311
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,490
which is about this trumpet player
that I had never heard of before called

312
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:45,180
[inaudible] guy's name
was lead Morgan. And, um,

313
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,680
I cannot tell you how great a player the
guy is and it's an amazing documentary.

314
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,080
Really sad too. But uh,
but since I did that,

315
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,390
I watched two things with black people
in it. I now have a thing, Nat King Cole,

316
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:03,510
they got, she's gotta have it up here
is something about Richard Pryor,

317
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,660
but I also got better call Saul.
You know what I mean?

318
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,250
There's a way to do this because you're
gonna miss all this other cool shit if

319
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,890
you just keep going down the
rabbit hole watching the same shit.

320
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:17,880
I got to Jimi Hendrix thing,
I got the Jerry Seinfeld comedian.

321
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,430
I got one of the star wars movies.
Something about Mike Tyson, right?

322
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,780
I think it's funny they got that whole
something on Jacko. Pistorious it's,

323
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,310
and he says fucking named World War
Two when color right. There you go.

324
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,610
No more prison shit.
This is great.

325
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,240
Perfect pulp fiction. I like it now.
It was going too far. The other,

326
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,890
the other direction like,
oh this is all this guy wants to see.

327
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,880
Cause I watched this thing, they
will like, you know, before,

328
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:54,470
never seen behind the scenes in a Russian
prison and they would show in these

329
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:59,360
guys.
And I'm as bad as the prison was.

330
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,200
What's great about it was,
is if you commit a bad enough crime,

331
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:07,310
you don't have to worry about getting
raped. Guess they don't leave me alone.

332
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,210
They're staring at your 24 fucking seven.
Um,

333
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,070
I didn't watch it that long enough.

334
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:16,190
All I know is the crimes these guys
committed was so fucking horrific.

335
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,750
And then they cut to the, um,
the, the warden and he goes,

336
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:24,230
I have no sympathy for these people
whatsoever. And I was just like, yeah,

337
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:25,064
neither do I.

338
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,850
This guy killed the whole family and
then like took their bodies out in the

339
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:32,540
woods and fucking lit them on fire. And
it's just like, yeah, fuck that guy.

340
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,300
And the guy sitting there going,
you know,

341
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,920
you gotta be really strong mentally
here, Rah Rah, you're not gonna make it.

342
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:42,860
And it's just like, I
hope you don't. I, yeah.

343
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,400
So I watch 10 minutes of it and I agreed
with the warden and I shut it off and

344
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:50,380
then I just looked my page at that
point and that's all it was. Um,

345
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,410
but anyways, I got to tell you that, um,

346
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,360
Lee Morgan was a guy I believe.
Who did he start out with?

347
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:02,780
I watched so much shit this weekend.
The fuck did he started out with,

348
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,390
he started with felonious monk.
I can't remember.

349
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:08,870
He played a little bit with John
Coltrane and then he got into a,

350
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,980
with Art Blakey, the Jazz messengers,
and then he went out on his own.

351
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,460
But like his playing is just,

352
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,480
he sees one of the guys, you know what
I mean? I don't know. Like, you know,

353
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:21,590
like guitar players,

354
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,460
there's a bunch of guys that can fucking
shred and then there's the guy that

355
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:28,760
makes you fucking hair stand up on your
arm. Like that guy's one of the guys.

356
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,900
He's that with the trumpet. The name of
the thing is called, I called him Morgan,

357
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,370
I forgot what the John Coltrane was,

358
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:37,790
but the cold train one was
on a whole other level where,

359
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,630
uh, it actually makes you
want to be a better person.

360
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,030
That's the only way to describe it.

361
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,760
His fucking worldview was
incredible and I didn't,

362
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,870
I didn't know a lot about them. You know,
I'm the typical John Coltrane hacky fan.

363
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:55,710
Like I have a love supreme, you know,
but I should get all those other ones,

364
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,990
blue train and all that
type of stuff. But, um,

365
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,230
I always went down the miles Davis,

366
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,233
uh,

367
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,910
road work, wherever he went,
whoever he played with,

368
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:11,350
I just kind of followed all the way
through that. And I know Coltrane was,

369
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,890
was with them twice.
Um,

370
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,420
he got fired one time and the
second time he left. And uh,

371
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,050
so then I just followed
miles into his second, uh,

372
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,760
was a quartet or quintet, I think quintet.
And that's the one with Tony Williams.

373
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:27,594
And then I just

374
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,740
stayed with Tony Right through
lifetime and all the shit he was doing.

375
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:34,540
And I kind of missed all those other guys.

376
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:39,541
So I'm finally going back and
listening to all these guys and that,

377
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,760
that fucking music is incredible.

378
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,710
It's fucking incredible. And the way
they shoot it in the black and white,

379
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:51,280
when you see the video and stuff,
it's unbelievable.

380
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:54,940
And there's this weird thing where you
wouldn't think with jazz is like a danger

381
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:58,900
to it, but there's like a
fucking edge to it that is a,

382
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,330
I dunno, it's compelling. And I just,

383
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:04,360
I wish they had more
documentaries like that on a,

384
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,720
on Netflix or if people know or
some other streaming services,

385
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,740
some shit where I can watch
it because, uh, I would watch

386
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,470
of about anybody from that.
And then I ended up finding out by Shelly,

387
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,290
is it Shelly Mann? A Shelly
main, he's a famous, um,

388
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,070
jazz drummer,
a white dude.

389
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,940
And through watching the Coltrane thing,

390
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,900
I saw the played a Gig and he had this,

391
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:34,870
this Shelly Mann had this place called
sh Shelly Mann's manhole is Shelley's

392
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,900
manhole or something like that.
And I was sitting there going like,

393
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:38,910
I wonder where that it,

394
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,880
that that was in la because
nothing has ever preserved in la.

395
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,980
And,
uh,

396
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,630
I found out that it's right on
cove whanga just north of sunset,

397
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:54,980
right around the corner from big Wang's
where I used to go there all the time

398
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,890
before I was married and
watch games and all that shit.

399
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:02,650
And I just was thinking like
miles Davis, John Coltrane,

400
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,290
all these monster fucking players

401
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,123
all

402
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,350
played live right around the corner
for where me and my friends were

403
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,690
like 50 years later gone dude all day.

404
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,690
Like how much that blocked
dropped off. Uh, but, uh,

405
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:25,920
very announced La thing.

406
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:29,370
I guess there's some sort of commemorative
thing to that jazz club in the

407
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:33,120
sidewalk. They're like, I'm
not like a star or anything,

408
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:37,250
but I thought that was pretty
cool. So anyways, all right,
so there's that checkup,

409
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,360
both those documentaries,
if you're into that type of shit.

410
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,700
And I know I'm all over the map
here. A little music, little sports,

411
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:42,600
maybe I'm a little law.

412
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,490
Maybe this is a nice little fucking
balance here for once. Um, all right.

413
00:24:47,491 --> 00:24:50,670
I do have some sad news here
and this really is sad news. Uh,

414
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:54,780
I lost another advertiser. Now, if
you're a fan of the podcast, you know,

415
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:59,130
this shit happens all the fucking
time to me. All right? There's a,

416
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,830
there's people that, you know,
they don't quite appreciate the,

417
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,220
my colorful way that I try
to sell the products. Um,

418
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,991
but these people,

419
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:11,991
they hung in there for a long time and
they finally had enough of me and I just

420
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:15,990
want to thank them for being on the
podcast. I had a great time reading their,

421
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,980
their copy,
a farewell to Sherry's berries.

422
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Evidently I finally went too far where
I somehow made a clan reference while

423
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:28,590
reading about chocolate
covered strawberries.

424
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,210
I thought it was funny,
you know,

425
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,590
I was with Harris standing. He, you know,

426
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,900
I guess if I was by myself and I made
the claim reference, it would seem weird,

427
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:46,840
but, uh, I was in the room
with another black guy,

428
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,250
not another black guy with the black guy.
Right. With another guy who was black.

429
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:52,540
That's how I was trying to say.
Right.

430
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,400
So then obviously it doesn't
then obviously mean that
I'm just fucking around.

431
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:59,020
I don't know.
I had a great time reading your shit.

432
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,620
You're definitely welcome back.
Anytime.

433
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,560
Anytime he'd like to come back,
we'd love to have you back.

434
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:10,420
I love reading your copy. You
fucking striver is a delicious. Um,

435
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,270
but I get it. You know what I mean? It's
a very sensitive time out there. We have,

436
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,600
we have to really be conscious of what
we're affiliated 80 their archive fit bed.

437
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,080
The Grand Dragon starts fucking order
in some goddamn strawberry. Reese,

438
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,640
I don't know. I don't know what
people in advertising or, um,

439
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,100
you know what their problem is, is they're
trying to please everybody, you know?

440
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:34,720
And if they would just collectively,

441
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:39,460
if they could just grow a dick in some
fucking balls and just be happy with

442
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:44,190
selling strawberries or nature's box or
whatever the fuck it is. You're blue,

443
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:47,400
you're blue apron. All these people
who fucking walked off this podcast.

444
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,940
If you would just focus on the phone,
all the money that you, you know.

445
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,263
Okay.

446
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,330
Do you know what I would be like if I
tried to make everybody laugh? Yeah.

447
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:02,120
I, I would, I wouldn't have a puppet. I
don't know why that would have, I would,

448
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:06,340
I would, I would, I would work totally
clean. I way I would not saying any,

449
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,950
having a puppets bad, not saying
working clean is bad, but I would just,

450
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:10,850
I would stop

451
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,310
you step.
What happens is,

452
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:18,420
what happens is basically you step outside
yourself and then you start watching

453
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,430
yourself thinking what did they want?

454
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:23,940
And then the second you do that shit you
had done. All right, so Sherry's berries,

455
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:27,270
I think you're making a
terrible mistake here, you know,

456
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,520
but I'm letting you know
the door is always open.

457
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,820
I'll let you back in like a battered wife.
You know,

458
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:34,260
when a bad fucking relationship,

459
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,940
I'll let you back in and
then you can try to fuck.

460
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,460
You know what's funny about
these advertisers? They
always want to talk to me.

461
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,820
And there's the rule on the podcast
is I don't talk to any of them. Okay?

462
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,430
I'm not talking to you this,

463
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:51,040
this is just some bullshit I do
to make people fucking laugh for,

464
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,170
to promote my gigs.
Okay?

465
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,740
I'm not gonna Start Having fucking
conference calls about chocolate covered

466
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:59,880
fruit. There's only so many
hours in the day, you know.

467
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,740
Anyways, I'm happy trails guys. All
right, I'll still order your strawberries.

468
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,300
No hard feelings. All right.
Okay, man. Crate everybody,

sons of guns, they send me the night.

470
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,960
These sons of bitches.
I said sons of guns.

471
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:21,770
Cause I was fucking thinking
about old. Ooh. Oh, whoa.

472
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,820
Don't fuck dumb. Don't offend
the strawberry people. Um,

473
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,570

475
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,320
They sent me all this cool grill stuff.
It actually comes in a crate.

476
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,440
You feel like a man when you
open it up, it's fantastic. Um,

477
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,700
I can't row.
I can't recommend this enough.

478
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,670
Now I'm not saying that I'm not going to
make a clan reference or anything like

479
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:53,990
that when I'm selling this stuff.
Oh, look who's here. Look who's here.

480
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,860
Was I too loud?

481
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,853
No, no, no.

482
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,310
Just close it.
Close the door the whole way.

483
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,570

to call who? The decorator.

484
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,320
Who's the decorator.

485
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:15,830
Oh, all right. Come on now.
Can we come here? Do you?

486
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,750
Do you know you no
normal Sherry's berries.

487
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,690
I know you burn that bridge.

488
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,540
Maybe I didn't burn a bridge.

489
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,790
It was a fucking bridge was
on fire when they got there.

490
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,400
I did the, I did the we. You're such a
bad boy. I'm not saying it like that.

491
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,090
I'm saying like what I meant by that.

492
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,940
He's such an asshole. Why
did I marry you? What's,

why did I marry you?

494
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,110
I always know when you're full of
shit because you were in la. Yeah.

495
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,980
What I meant was I was already doing this
shit when they got with me. [inaudible]

496
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,480
don't try to change me.

you're not. You love it.

You love it admitted. No, I just know

503
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,060
Okay.
What are you doing?

504
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm fucking reading advertising
and people don't want to hear it.

505
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,780
So you're trying to make it fun with
it so you can, the show doesn't stop.

506
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:31,990
You just keep fucking around with
these fucking dopes. Who Sold Shit.

507
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,590
Understood that for two
seconds. Everybody. All of
these other fucking podcasts,

508
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:38,100
you know what to do. They press fast
forward. They blow right through it.

509
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,143
[inaudible]

510
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,830
okay. It fucking works. Yeah, right?
Yes. It's a little late for that.

511
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,970
Now that you trash me,
you trust me down. Yeah.

512
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,620
Well you'll be okay.
Oh yeah.

513
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,040
What are you doing? Yeah,
we're on a podcast. I can't
listen to her crying. I know.

514
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,060
That's the hardest thing is when you
send them down, they're totally fine.

515
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:03,910
They just crying and they're trying to
get you to pick them up and you can't

516
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:08,320
fucking do it. Um,
anyways. Sleep training.

517

520
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,540
No, I mean you can do it. I
just wasn't trying to be like
that, but go ahead. Do it.

521
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,070

pick out the perfect gift,

523
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,950
but all too easy to get it totally wrong.
I liked that.

524
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:37,580
They think fear right under the bat.
Huh?

525
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,230
Nobody didn't curse. I didn't curse.
That wasn't what I was talking about.

526
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:51,490
I wasn't talking about you. Beads of
sweat forming on your forehead. Oh my God.

527
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,610
You can't get man crate somehow.

528
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,460
I can't do it. Let's go. Let's

534
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:23,701
Crate offers awesome gifts for every type
of man from the rugged outdoorsman to

535
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:30,730
this sports fanatic and everything in
between. I'm sorry, that's a small window.

536
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,790
If you're got to go rugged outdoorsman,
you should only two types of guys. One.

537
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,980
Now. They did say everything in
between, but those are the two. The

538
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,060
two ends. Well I guess if you
go hunting, if you go hunting,

539
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,640
you don't really watch
football, dude. I don't know.

540
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,920
I don't do either of those things. What
animal could you shoot? None of 'em.

541
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,730
What animals do you eat?
Oh, I eat all of them.

542
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,100
I mean I eat the ones that you can eat.
So you're sorta like a Mafia don.

543
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,020
Just having everybody do
all your hits for you.

544
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:07,310
The only animals that I can kill our
end sucks. And I would kill a possum.

545
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,700
You know a lot of work. Parts of
the worlds that eat insects. Yeah.

546
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:12,290
Source of protein.
I kill them.

547
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,560
I could eat somebody else's
around the world. Gone.

548
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,620
That's a nice little Jalapeno popper
spider there that you could have fucking

549
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:23,420
yeah, I read it in deep fried. Awesome.
Cause that's my least favorite animal.

550
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,120
I could also kill a raccoon
cause I also don't like them.

551
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,450
You don't like varmints environments?
No. And I don't feel like a black.

552
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:33,680
You sending me Sam with a pussy. Who? Yo,

553

00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,310
a personalized crowbar?
Yeah.

575
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,600
I like the kind of crowbar that you
like break into a car with. That's what,

576
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:12,370
why would you do that?
Isn't that what auto thieves use?

577
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,710
Crowbars how would you know
that? I wouldn't, I'm too,
I just, from the movies,

578
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,080
do they use what movies? Crowbars do you
break into cars when I'm on the road? No,

579
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:27,760
no, no, but isn't that a thing
that you use a crowbar to?

580
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,650
Like Jimmy the oh boy. Wait, yeah,

581
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,360
take the crowbar and you
slide it in between the door
and the window. Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:37,470
He just sorta just sort
of slipped that in there.

583
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:42,120
Do you know what a crow bar looks
like? Um, is there like a ranch?

584
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:45,270
Like a big, it's, you can't,
that's not what they use.

585
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't want to fat shame a crowbar,
but it can not fit.

586
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,930
It cannot fit in that little area.
There. You have a little of this,

587
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,790
the little slim. Yeah, no, that's, what
do they call it thing? This is a slim Jim.

588
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,650
A little fucking thing.

589
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:01,830
You just go down there and they just
fucking know there's always there.

590
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,090
It looks like he's jerking off.

591
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,510
Was it crowbar used for?
It's used to open man crates

592
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,310
and regular crates to,
what about lady crates?

593
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,790
Do they have a lady grapes too?
I Dunno what they are.

594
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,600
It's probably vibrates to crop it.
Sorry. All right. Dollar Shave Club.

accent. He always finds a way, kid, sorry.

601
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,420
At the store.

602
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,840
There are too many options and you can't
tell the difference between any of them.

603
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,520
Then if you have any questions to cure,

604
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,240
the clerk usually doesn't know the
difference either or either can't help you

605
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:57,300
since they're not experts on the products
or they're the only person working on

silly? Okay. It can be so mean sometimes.

operation and visit Douche.

646
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,670
My teeth are starting to move.
Um, I have a couple announcements.

647
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:35,150
Patrice O'neil, if you want an eight, if
you guys want a great, a great gift idea.

648
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,120
Patrice O'neil, uh, comedy benefit,

649

stuff at near Goddamn stocking and come

650
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:47,780
out and see the show on February 20th at
the New York City Center in Manhattan.

651
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,370
If you don't live in Manhattan,

652
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:53,120
it's a great excuse to come to New York
City and check it out before the entire

653
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:56,210
thing becomes a giant bed bath and beyond.
All right,

654
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,520
well what am I up to here?
30 not 40 minutes. All right.

655
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:04,820
Can you help me out here, Neil with
the uh, yeah, she's sleeping right?

656
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,650
No, she's gotten there. What is she doing?

657
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,880
It looks like she is. She's still
squirming. She thrashed around of that,

658
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,060
but now shit.
All right.

659
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,300
Oh, also Santa Steve, Steve,
SumoMe, the Great Steve [inaudible],

660
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,350
Steve Simone and regular hero are raising
money again this year for children

661
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:24,820
fighting cancer and their families.

662
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,680
Monday morning podcast's listeners help
raise $15,000 last time around and it

663
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,510
had a huge impact on a lot of families.

664
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,800
Their stories are brutal and every bit
helps. The goal this year is 50 grand.

665
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,530
We'll tweet a link today.
Thank you guys so much.

666
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,220
You've already been ridiculously generous
this year, so thank you very much.

667
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,910
All right. M P three player. All right.

668
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,040
Yet you're going to be annoying.
You know,

669
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,240
and this year you're
going to help me out here.

670
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,193
Sure.

671
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,620
Yeah. Okay. You don't sound too enthused.
Would you like your own microphone?

672
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,200
No, that's okay. How does use yours?

673
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,370
I think it'd be better if you had
your own microphone. Talk to the Pe.

674
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,080
No people from it.
Um,

675
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,560
people describe what
I'm wearing right now.

676
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,950
Bill is wearing a pair of pajamas
that I got him for Christmas,

677
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:18,510
not last year, but maybe the year
before last year was the last year.

678
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,890
What a pair of pajamas that
had got him last year. Oh,

679
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:27,630
I don't know what another fight and he
looks like, um, like he's on that show.

680
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:29,730
My two dads that

681
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,090
I look more my three,

682
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,010
my three dads was no, my two
dads was a porno, wasn't, no,

683
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:44,930
it wasn't 80 show about a girl who had
two dads for a reason that I can't really

684
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:47,660
recall for the situation.
Comedy of it.

685
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,530
Maybe her mom died and her mom
wasn't sure which one was her dad.

686
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:56,000
So they were both her dad
or maybe she was dating one,

687
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,640
but the other one was her dad.
I don't really know,

688
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,340
but it was my two dads
and I used to watch it

689
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,400
sounds like the ges was flying around.
All right. MP three player. I know.

690
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:10,580
What do you want me for me?
MP three player. Hey Billy.

691
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:14,530
Red faced very Christmas
dude. Uh, thank you. Uh,

692
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,190
my suggested Merry Christmas to you too.

693
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:21,140
My suggestion for MP three player is
the Apple Watch I'm trying to get at,

694
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm trying to get out of them. I'm
trying to get away from apple. Okay.

695
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:28,910
Cause I have all this other music and
they just won't recognize it and I buy it

696
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:30,290
off of them,
but they don't have it.

697
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,600
Okay.

698
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,450
All right. Whatever. I'll listen to you.
I know it's more than an MP three player,

699
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:38,990
but that's the great thing is you
get so much more for the money.

700
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,610
The big drawback is that you can only
use Bluetooth headphones with it.

701
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,470
That's the thing about
app and let me guess,

702
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:49,520
only Bluetooth headphones made by
fucking apple. Other than that,

703
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,650
I liked that it stays
strapped to your wrist,

704
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:54,650
so you don't need to carry
anything else with you. Uh,

705
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:56,920
if you've got the series
three with the Elta,

706
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,770
sounds like a giant commercial for
this thing. Uh, but I, you know,

707
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:04,970
I did ask the series three
with LTE a doubles as a phone.

708
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,670
What he talked to your risks
like fucking captain Kirk.

709
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,980
The call time is very limited.
I'm not doing this.

710
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,670
Why would I do this? I'm just,
okay friend who smells like anus.

711
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,670
Hell boy. Hey, you redheaded Mick bastard.

712
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,920
Um, I don't give a shit. What are
you going to do? I don't want to.

713
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:30,810
What about the thing I told you?
What do you think about that? Were,

714
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,710
you know Matt Damon commented on,
that's the stuff going on in Hollywood.

715
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,030
So this person wrote an article
about him and they go, Matt Damon,

716
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,740
a white male Blahblahblahblahblah like,
it was just like, Oh, who doesn't know?

717
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:48,650
He's a white guy. Like what
does that mean? It means,

718
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,880
and maybe he should
shut as big white SRAP.

719
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,550
Is that not race baiting?
That's like some fox new shit.

720
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,180
There was no reason to say what his race
was or his sex was there and the person,

721
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:05,870
there was nothing. Anything else
add? They just said that the,

722
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,450
he was a white male and then they just
continued on with the fucking thing.

723
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,390
It's fucking, this is such a, it's,
I swear to God watching, I dunno.

724
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,810
It's just I don't get,
if you just going to,

725
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,950
if you just just say, listen on now,
now it's my turn to be a Douche.

726
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:25,720
Then I'm fine with it,
but don't fuck it.

727
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:30,280
Act like you're a better person
because you're not. I mean that's,

728
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,980
that's a fucked up.
I mean you keep

729
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,230
what he's looking at me like you can't,

730
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:37,380
you can't fucking go two wrongs
don't make a right. Nothing.

731
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,040
What do you mean two wrongs
don't make a right. That's total.

732
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:44,370
That's fucking race baiting.
Raise baiting and who?

733
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,600
All stereotypes above fucking with his
whole thing about sexual harassment raise

734
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,570
meeting is the same as someone's a
white male. How has that raised baiting?

735
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,681
This is so funny.

736
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:58,260
I sound like a black person right now
and you sound like a white person.

737
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:03,120
What always said was says he was just
white. I don't understand what you mean.

738
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,370
Call somebody what they
are. A white male. Oh,

739
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:11,670
you're saying that if this was like
Fox News they'd be no, this is no,

740
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:14,640
this is what they were
doing. Tyrrell Jackson. Oh,

741
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:18,810
black male was spotted at the Bubba.
I like the way they do that type of shit.

742
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,640
I'm saying the reason that they added
that detail was because he was commenting

743
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:28,641
on sexual harassment and white guys
positions of power in all of that.

744
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,410
So what they was saying in there
is they just say white males.

745
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:36,330
So then you can go with all your
stereotypes and be like, oh,

746
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:39,930
totally privileged enough to work
for shit in a position of power.

747
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,280
He doesn't understand this.

748
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:45,720
Like all this negative shit where
it was no longer Matt Damon.

749
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,730
It was hashtag white male trash. That's
what the fucking guy was doing. Or woman,

750
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:53,310
whoever wrote that fucking article.
That's what bugged me.

751
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,510
Whether you agreed with what he said
or not is a completely different thing,

752
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:58,530
but I just,
it just was like,

753
00:45:58,531 --> 00:46:01,260
what the fuck does anyone who the fuck
doesn't know Matt Damon's a white guy?

754
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,950
No, he's just some, and they had
a fucking picture of them anyways.

755
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,480
If he was some complete nobody.
I see the picture.

756
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,570
It was a giant picture
of Matt Damon's Whitehead

757
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,680
and they go, Matt Damon, a white
male. You know what they're doing.

758
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,710
That's that feminist fucking
psycho shit feminist psycho shit.

759
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,750
That fucking psycho shit,
white male trash,

760
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,990
all that shit that they're doing
that literally doing the Sh, not,

761
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,160
not saying all of them are doing it,

762
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:34,430
but they're doing that
shit where they're there.

763
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,840
They're fighting this thing that
they are literally becoming really,

764
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,500
no, no, no, no. Keep it out.
I'm not talking about what
he said. I'm talking about.

765
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:48,260
That fucking detail was fucking weird.
Just throw on there. Matt Damon Cama,

766
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,380
Matt Damon, White Male. I was like
male prostitute. It's like what?

767
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,390
I just remembered. What the fuck
does that have to do with anything?

768
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,500
And then I'd read the art, the
gist of the article. I'm like, Oh,

769
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,290
oh I see why you threw that in there.

770
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,590
Cause I mean he's speaking like a
typical white guy. So yeah, it was,

771
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,830
wow, look at that. Look at these all.
Look at always getting thrown around.

772
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,130
Well why you Nia?
You know how they are.

773
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,810
You know how those white guys are
where you feel like I am Sikh,

774
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,730
I secretly hate people.
No, no, no. I'm just,

775
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,520
I'm actually in a way enjoying this shit.
Why?

776
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:28,200
Because of all that. Hey white guys
are evil and blah, blah, blah, blah,

777
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:31,420
and I just know to human beings
who have too much fucking power.

778
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,410
I would agree with that.

779
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:37,390
And when you have too much power as a
nation or as a fucking race or a sex,

780
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,770
you stent you 10 it's very hard to
not overstep. You bounce. Right. Okay.

781
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,970
And what I am now seeing is the pendulum
is changing is that people that what I

782
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:48,400
always felt as people just,
they're going to behave the same way.

783
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,810
It's not going to become better.

784
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,710
It's just somebody else will then get
in power and then behave the exact same

785
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:58,390
fucking way while they pat them on selves
on the back saying how great they are,

786
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,990
like white guys who did a bunch of
horrific shit and then put up statues of

787
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:06,520
themselves. Does that make sense?
Hmm. That's an interesting point.

788
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,410
Ooh, ouch. All right friend
who smells like anus,

789
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,350
your beard is like kind of
out of control right now,

790
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:20,570
don't you? She come over here
like it's a little bushy,

791
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:26,590
isn't it? Yeah. What's the, what's
going on? What's a, what's a,

792
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,900
what's a happen and hot
stuff that's racist. Um,

793
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:35,850
did, um, did dollar shave club
not hook you up this morning?

794
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,470
I Dunno.
I just like fucking Robinson Caruso.

795
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,010
It was funny. I've heard that name my
whole life. I don't even know who that is.

796
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,060
Then you get stuck on an island or was he
like, uh, I think so. I don't even know.

797
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,040
Oh, we've got to look it up. No. Something
from literature. It's a, it's a book. Oh,

798
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:58,320
there you go. There's your
quote for the week. Everybody.

799
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:03,000
It's something from literature. That's
what I married and made a child with.

800
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:06,200
It's something from literature shipwreck.

801
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,480
It's some white dude probably
trying to explore some island.

802
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,240
Robinson Caruso a white man.
Yeah.

803
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,780
Trying to act like he discovered some
shit when people were already lived there.

804
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,480
That's probably what it was. All
right. I go with all of that.

805
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:23,610
I had a big argument. Somebody bought
that about what? Oh, about the whole,

806
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,920
you can't discover some shit with people
who are already there and this guy

807
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:30,010
actually argue with me. He goes, well,
he was discovering it for himself.

808
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:33,700
And the people didn't know, but it's
just like, no, he's a dog for Columbus.

809
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,870
I forget who he was talking
about. Yeah, cause fuck that guy.

810
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,220
What did he fuck that guy? Fuck
that guy. Fuck Christopher Columbus.

811
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:46,820
If he didn't call me out, you,
you wouldn't have met me. Wow.

812
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,350
Really? Listen, knit. You know, to make
an Omelet, you've got to break a few eggs.

813
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,970
Things that come out of your mouth. Oh
fucking deal. Nia adults, listen to this.

814
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:02,810
They know I'm fucking around Jesus.
Fucking Christ the consult.

815
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,390
They will take that clip and what you will
see, the trouble I get in that, that's,

816
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:09,410
that's a classic one for Huffington
Post. Fucking Douche bags. The,

817
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,140
we'll clip that out of it. Oh, those low
hanging fruit douche bags. All right.

818
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,410
Robinson Caruso.

819
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,250
So cross out the way it's spelled.

820
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:22,250
C R U s s e Robinson Crusoe.

821
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,510
Everyone says Robinson Caruso,
but it looks like Crusoe.

822
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,030
So cause I always think of Rick Caruso,
um,

823
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:35,130
first published on the 25th of April 17,
19.

824
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,090
The first edition is Bubba plot summary.
Jesus,

825
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,690
let's get to the cliff notes.
Oh God, this is too long. Crusoe

826
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,960
joins an expedition to bring slaves
from Africa, but he's chick. Yeah.

827
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,400
Who gives a fuck about this guy?

828
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:53,950
But he was shipwrecked moving on in
his dorm. Exactly what I thought.

829
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,700
That's exactly what I thought. No,
no, no. It was about that. Nah.

830
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,000
Did they do a second version where
that wasn't in there? Oh God, no.

831
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:06,460
They make it. They make 'em out
like he's some fucking hero though.

832
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,500
Dante cannibals,
discover NAO cannibals and island.

833
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,540
Kill and eat president. Oh
God. You know what? Yeah.

834
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,493
I don't give a shit.

835
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,800
It's for his arrival there.
Olin only he and three animals.

836
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,270
The captain's dog and two cats survived
the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair.

837
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:28,690
He fetches arms,
tools and supplies.

838
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:30,370
So basically white people read this,

839
00:51:30,371 --> 00:51:33,190
ignore the slavery part and then
root for this white guy to come home.

840
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:36,360
Cause Yeah. Put themselves in
that place. What did they venture?

841
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,763
Yeah.

842
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:48,580
How did we get on this subject of that
guy? Oh, you said my beard, right?

843
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:52,450
Because I said your beard. It
was too much. All right. Well,

844
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:55,930
the three months were the three
musketeers, Robinson, Caruso.

845
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,230
Christopher Columbus,
Matt Damon White males was,

846
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,710
it wasn't a white males that
really needs to shut the fuck up.

847
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,820
Why do they need to shut the fuck up?
That's such an ignorant statement. Ignite.

848
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,250
It isn't near.
You can't want,

849
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:15,160
if you tell people to shut the fuck up
and then not going to listen to your

850
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:18,790
point that like what you just said there
is how people try and communicate in

851
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:22,030
the Internet where they start
things off with, hey shit, Dick,

852
00:52:22,031 --> 00:52:26,200
maybe if you fucking didn't have your
head up your ass and they could actually

853
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:28,360
be making a good point,
but they started that way.

854
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:32,020
If you tell people that they need
to shut the fuck up and then what?

855
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:32,800
Listen to you,
what?

856
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,760
What sort of human being is going to
be receptive to what you have to say if

857
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:38,980
that's the way you're going,
you're dipping into the pool.

858
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,300
That is because I'm thinking about
other things that Matt Damon has said.

859
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Other like sort of stands is that he's
taken and I just feel like he is really

860
00:52:48,821 --> 00:52:53,821
arrogant and he's not really as worldly
and understands people as well as he

861
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:58,840
thinks that he does and he's in a very
like small little bubble and I'm just,

862
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:00,820
I'm not here.
You've never met this guy.

863
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:03,760
And I guarantee if you went to a Christmas
party out there and he was there,

864
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:05,470
you'd be like, Oh my
God, Matt Damon's here.

865
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,050
Maybe a couple of years ago I would have,
oh Jesus Christ.

866
00:53:11,051 --> 00:53:15,760
Everybody needs to just fucking just,
just,

867
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,970
just relax a little bit. This is where
my problem was. Like first of all,

868
00:53:18,971 --> 00:53:21,880
this wasn't even about that. This
wasn't even about what the fuck he said.

869
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:26,550
What it was about was that that fucking
person says Matt Damon, White Male,

870
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,180
a white male. I'm just saying
that's all I'm talking about.

871
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:32,730
I don't give a fuck about
all of that other shit.

872
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:37,110
I'm trying to stay out of that shit. No
you don't. But I'm trying to say why I,

873
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,220
but that's a whole other thing having to
do with project greenlight and the last

874
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,630
season and the way he was. All right.
Oh, come Dick. What are you doing? Geez.

875
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,400
He's already getting enough fucking shit.
You can throw more crap on the fire.

876
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:50,940
I mean, I'm sure you want to
do a movie with him Monday. No,

877
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:55,000
that's not what I'm saying.
Hey,

878
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,760
I'm not trying
you such,

879
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,960
you're such an asshole on this.
Why did I invite you when?

880
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:07,470
That's not why I'm saying that now.
You made me look like a fucking asshole.

881
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,730
Hollywood phone.

882
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,040
Stop trying to get into bed
with all these guys. I'm not,

883
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:23,110
that's not the point of any of this.
First of all, near he's not in,

884
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:26,310
but this is the thing. This is the thing
that every dumb mistake people think of,

885
00:54:26,311 --> 00:54:29,610
you get to know the actor. They're going
to get you in the movie. They're not.

886
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,820
They're not.
That's not how that works.

887
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,130
They're trying to keep their
own fucking head above water.

888
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:38,880
They don't have fucking time for you
and can I play your fucking postman?

889
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,530
They don't give a shit. All right. Jesus
fucking Christ. I got to tell you any,

890
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:47,070
you're killing it on this podcast cause
every time I try to make a fucking point,

891
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:52,200
you trash me in such a way that just
destroys anything. I'm trying to say.

892
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:55,980
I'm just saying, I'm just,
you know, Jesus Christ.

893
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,383
I can't look,

894
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,390
I can't make fun of the Huffington Post
and then get somebody else in trouble

895
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:04,310
for some, some bullshit. They
already got in trouble for that.

896
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,980
That's what I'm saying. I'm leaving
it alone. Okay. I'm leaving it alone.

897
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,790
Fuck all right friend who smells
like anus for the 90th fucking time.

898
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,480
I'll tell you, I think you're banned
from this podcast. Can I read it?

899
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:25,020
Yeah, go ahead. You read it. Thank you.
[inaudible] big fan of the podcast.

900
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,120
My friend and I saw you and Mr. Don't
forget this part. You already read that.

901
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:33,960
Hey, you redheaded Mick
bastard. That's offensive.

902
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,670
Now somebody is going to take that.

903
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,250
Someone's going to take that and cut
out the part where you said that's

904
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:42,330
offensive. I just wanted you on tape
saying, Hey, you redheaded Mick bastard.

905
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:46,140
I love it. All right.
Big Fan of the podcast.

906
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:50,790
My friend and I saw you
and Mister [inaudible] do
standup in Albany, New York.

907
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:53,700
Phenomenal show.
My question is about women's hygiene.

908
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,340
Oh boy.

909
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,790
My two buddies and I have a friend that
has a very nice person and he was very

910
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,690
preppy clothing. However, [inaudible],

911
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:06,800
however she smells like
a bag of rotten clams.

912
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,270
The odor has become so bad that the three
of us have questioned whether wearing

913
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:13,210
a guests about questioned,

914
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:18,110
whether wearing a gas max around her as
a person needs to write better as men.

915
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,910
We know it is not right to tell
a woman she's smells like ass,

916
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:24,460
but we don't know what else to do.

917
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,600
Should we tell her or con one of her
friends and to telling her, thanks bill.

918
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,800
Keep up the hilarious podcast and
go fuck yourself. First of all,

919
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:37,660
you are so unoriginal by being like
she smelled like a bag of rotten clams,

920
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:42,370
you know, clams. Poussey
um, second of all,

921
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:46,300
if you're not fucking this broad, no,
you don't have anything to say next.

922
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,710
All right. Nia got a
little defensive. Nick,

923
00:56:52,711 --> 00:56:53,770
can I ask you a question?

924
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,620
If you walked around smelling
like a bag of rotten clams,

925
00:56:56,621 --> 00:57:00,910
wouldn't you want somebody to give you
the heads up before you became a very

926
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:04,270
preppy clothing? However she smells
like, what does that have to do with?

927
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:08,860
And I don't, I don't get it. Oh cause
she's nice and she wears nice clothes,

928
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:13,240
but she smells like clams.
A bag of rotten clamps,

929
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,410
a bag of rotten clams. This sounds
like an exaggeration. Give me a break.

930
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:22,360
Smell so bad. The three of
us have questioned whether
wearing a gas. Why are you,

931
00:57:22,361 --> 00:57:25,780
why you matter what? Like where's the
rest of your sentence? First of all,

932
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:27,730
learn how to write a sentence properly.

933
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,790
Then maybe I can hear you getting
so defensive. Like they said,

934
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:34,690
you smell like a bag of rotten clamps.
This is this fucking thing.

935
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,060
You just defending this
person because she's a,

936
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:42,460
you inserted yourself from the story and
you would be the person I'm supposed to

937
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:45,240
put myself in the scenario.
I guess so.

938
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:49,270
So now what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying to help pull you out of it and say

939
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:53,820
that you in no way, shape, shape, or
form, smell like a bag of and clamps,

940
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:58,600
um, edgy tonight. All right, fine. Okay.

941
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,290
Uh, so what would you
say, how can they tell her

942
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:06,490
all right, this, this, this woman. Okay.

943
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,370
Probably wants to find love at some
point and you, you're not going to,

944
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:13,230
you're really limiting.
You know,

945
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,710
she's got to find somebody that works
in some sort of chemical plant that's

946
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:18,030
destroyed his sense of smell.

947
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:23,100
So I got some sort of medical issue.
Yeah.

948
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:26,030
Sometimes you could have like literally
a sinus infection that can give you a

949
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:28,020
really bad breath.
There's all kinds of stuff like,

950
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,880
um,
you know,

951
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,170
and this is a thing like guys,
like,

952
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,570
it's not like I'd never ran
into a woman that didn't,

953
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,020
wasn't so fresh and so clean,
you know, and I, there's no
way to tell him cause it,

954
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,170
the embarrassment of it,
which they do. Singing,

955
00:58:46,171 --> 00:58:49,340
telegram,
you smell.

956
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:55,080
Um,
how can they do that?

957
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,280
I would actually, uh, I would,

958
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,260
I would actually think that she needs,

959
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,890
if she's dressing nice and all that
type of stuff, meaning she's clean,

960
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,000
I would say that she probably needs to
see a doctor and it's probably something

961
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:13,940
with their diet. I'm just, this is
just shit that I've heard diet. Uh,

962
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:19,080
or I don't know, maybe she's
stressing a lot. I have no idea.

963
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:23,420
But I honestly don't know how would handle
that. Well, how would you handle it?

964
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,360
Okay. If they, it's,

965
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,260
it's like the end of a Tom Cruise movie
and you've got to clip the right fucking

966
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:31,640
wire. It blows up in your face.
Okay. First, first thought.

967
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:35,130
I how you doing it? I
think you, you're taking,

968
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:39,320
you take the mouth not on like a day, but
just hang out and just be like, listen,

969
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,460
I love you so much. You are such an
amazing person. You are the best.

970
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:47,840
You're the best. Yeah. You breaking
up with me. Um, no, no, no, no.

971
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:52,040
I just feel like, you know,
sometimes I just noticed like,

972
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:57,170
like an odor coming from you.
So I don't know. I don't know if

973
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:01,230
like, I don't know if like
you're, you're, you're Washington

974
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,000
gene isn't working,
you know?

975
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:07,570
Or like why would she put a
vagina and a washing machine?

976
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:12,280
They're not smelling her vagina.
They're smelling her be, oh, right.

977
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:16,390
Well, when I heard clams, I thought the
problem was in the basement accolade.

978
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:21,150
Exactly. They're talking about
her B o I would assume. Oh,

979
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,240
but we could be halitosis. It could be
if you're not, if you're not fucking,

980
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:28,720
or like what do you, what do you care?
You know, but because they liked her,

981
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:32,170
they want to hang out with them, but
she smells like fucking, and I'm sorry,

982
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:37,120
he said a bag of clamps. I don't want to
tell you. She smells like low tide there.

983
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:41,210
Yeah. Maybe. Oh, maybe you're washing,

984
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:46,390
your washing machine isn't working
effectively or you should try a different,

985
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:51,700
uh, I know what I would do.
Detergent. What would you do?

986
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,360
I get to those spray aerosol cans of
like deodorant and I dress like a cowboy.

987
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,020
I walk into the bar and go heads up.
And when she did it go,

988
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:09,100
sorry, you got nothing. I don't
know. I would try to have,

989
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,730
uh,
I w I would have,

990
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,290
I would talk to a female friend of hers
and tell her to do it because it'll be

991
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:21,100
less embarrassing and just say
you just given him the heads up.

992
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,250
That's a friend.
And uh,

993
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:26,830
I still have this friend and we
had someone that we worked with,

994
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:30,790
someone who I'm actually still friends
with and said a white male. Yeah.

995
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,170
And he would talk about how
my friends breath stank.

996
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,560
And I would always like laugh
because he was right. Her,

997
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:43,090
her breath did stink a lot and I would
always offer her gum, gum, mints. Oh,

998
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:45,910
you want one? Do you want one? And
she would always refuse. So it's like,

999
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,290
what can I do? You have to
sit her down and say, bitch,

1000
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:54,520
you state doesn't sing anymore.
But at the time,

1001
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:58,510
because probably somebody told
her. Yeah, probably. All right dad,

1002
01:01:58,511 --> 01:02:01,670
cheating on mom.
Dear Billy skank

1003
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,950
please do not say my name now.
He's got a jokey name.

1004
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:11,200
He's got a jokey ne.

1005
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,160
Why are you such a drag?

1006
01:02:15,161 --> 01:02:20,010
All of a sudden one fucking stinky
clamp thing and no, come on man.

1007
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:22,770
Like nup. Yeah, sorry. Sorry everybody.

1008
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,690
I should be in a bad mood the way
you've been trashed me on this.

1009
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:30,160
I invite you on them onto my show.
I already lost Sherry's berries.

1010
01:02:30,161 --> 01:02:33,220
They're walking out of my life and
then I got to listen to you trashed me.

1011
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:37,330
All right. I had been a fan of yours
since the year 2000. I remember that.

1012
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,980
How great was that bit?

1013
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,070
I fucking love that bit.
CONAN O'Brien show everybody.

1014
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:51,050
I love hearing your podcast every week.
I use it as it as an escape,

1015
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:56,030
as an escape from my shitty life. Um,
I want to ask you for your advice,

1016
01:02:56,270 --> 01:03:00,140
but a month ago I started to notice
my father would talk to a coworker who

1017
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:03,380
happens to be a lady.
I didn't think much,

1018
01:03:03,381 --> 01:03:08,270
much of it seeing as how he's been
happily married for the past 27 years.

1019
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,930
I checked my dad's phone number,
my phone the other day.

1020
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:15,950
He usually has me fix his phone since
he doesn't understand technology.

1021
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,570
Upon checking his phone,

1022
01:03:17,571 --> 01:03:22,250
I saw a couple of texts and a picture
that they have been sending each other.

1023
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,223
Oh,

1024
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,200
all right. A couple of texts. I
don't know what it was in the text.

1025
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,340
I don't know what the picture was.

1026
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,800
And he doesn't need to be sending pictures
of themselves to another woman. Yeah.

1027
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:37,070
I don't know what to do.
I have looked up this guy for 25 years.

1028
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,730
Oh No. Now I feel crushed.
Sing. The piece of Shitty is,

1029
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,890
should I confront him and tell him to
stop or else I'll tell my mother. Bill,

1030
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:49,610
can you please help me thank you and
go fuck yourself from Adolph Stalin.

1031
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,250
Ooh,
just in time for Christmas.

1032
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:59,830
Uh,

1033
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,170
what would you do?

1034
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,420
Okay.

1035
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,880
What would you do,
Babe?

1036
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:11,030
What would you do if you had to give
your lab freedom? What will you do?

1037
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:17,650
Um, I dunno what I would
do. I would, I would,

1038
01:04:17,651 --> 01:04:18,484
uh,

1039
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,900
just say I was the,
you know,

1040
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:24,630
I was fixing your phone the other day
and I saw this picture of this woman.

1041
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:28,140
Who is she? I would do it.
There you go. You probably lie.

1042
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:32,100
Just know that he's probably
going to lie to you. I mean,

1043
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:35,230
you can confront him and just say,
hey, like what Skype was, you know,

1044
01:04:35,231 --> 01:04:38,370
you had me fix your phone.
I saw these pictures and these tax like,

1045
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,060
what's going on? He's probably going
get upset. Why are you reading my tail?

1046
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:43,050
I didn't ask you to do that.

1047
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:47,290
I just asked you to get me off airplane
mode or whatever the fuck it is that he,

1048
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:50,530
he did, you know, why are you
looking right? Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron,

1049
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:51,870
he's probably going to get really,

1050
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:55,260
really upset with you and he's going to
lie and he's going to deny it and then

1051
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:59,070
he's going to be probably overly
sweet to your mom in front of you.

1052
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,220
Um, I dunno, but your, um,

1053
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,680
up to this guy for 25 years now.
Yeah.

1054
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:12,040
It's a hard thing to realize that your
parents are not as perfect and great and

1055
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:14,230
upstanding as you thought.
They were not suck.

1056
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:17,830
So what you think he should just go up
and ask them? I mean, if it's mine, yeah,

1057
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:21,130
he should just say like, Hey, I just
saw these pictures. Like, you know,

1058
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,770
I don't know what they were,

1059
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:26,950
but I thought they were maybe
something inappropriate,

1060
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,190
but maybe I'm wrong and it's just
been bothering me. But like I said,

1061
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:31,510
just maybe that will make them stop,

1062
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,270
be prepared that he is going
to get very pissed at you.

1063
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,260
He might not, he might be fucking
embarrassed. I don't know.

1064
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:44,190
And it's, it's probably gonna make him
be really upset and yell at him. So,

1065
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,940
but I feel bad for your mom.
That's the thing. But who knows?

1066
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,190
Maybe your parents have an
arrangement that you don't know.

1067
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,300
Uh,
oh

1068
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,720
Jesus. I don't know. You got to consider
all the possibilities here, you know?

1069
01:05:56,721 --> 01:06:00,170
But unless his mom's at home, just baking
cookies and making dinner every night,

1070
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,500
you know, and being like, oh,
she's just nagging him every night.

1071
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:07,700
You just get sick of it. Maybe she's
banging in the mail, man. Hey, you know,

1072
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:08,830
can we have a little sympathy for the guy

1073
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:13,630
fucking wrote in here? Jesus Christ.
I would go with her first advice.

1074
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,990
All right. Over. Okay. Overrated.
Underrated. It's back. All right.

1075
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:20,650
Overrated.
Outdoor hockey games.

1076
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:25,030
I've been twice one in Comerica Park in
Detroit and another at the big house.

1077
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:28,750
It's cold. You can't see the whole
ice and it's hard to track the puck.

1078
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,500
Not to mention the blinding glare
from the sun. Do yourself a favor.

1079
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:36,760
Save your money and watch
it at home. Wow. Um,

1080
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:41,220
underrated homemade French fries. Huh? Uh,

1081
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:45,070
if you're hosting a barbecue or
just making burgers for the family,

1082
01:06:45,071 --> 01:06:49,540
take the time and make some hand cut
fries at the beginning of one of your

1083
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:53,260
advertisers.
Double Fry them and toss and sea salt.

1084
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:58,240
[inaudible] if you're feeling really
ambitious, a homemade spicy ketchup,

1085
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:00,760
we'll put it over the top. Wow. Nice.

1086
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:03,600
Your grand rapid show at the church
was great. Can't wait to hear it.

1087
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,970
Those jokes again. And your next
special. I love that fucking,

1088
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,170
that's such a great
gig. Um, all right. Uh,

1089
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,250
advice

1090
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,030
lady.

1091
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,440
Is this the last one? It's a long,
it's a long one. Brace yourselves.

1092
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:24,460
Bill's going to be reading for a while.
22 year old.

1093
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,260
Married to a 47 year old.
Oh boy.

1094
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:34,270
Bad idea. I'm calling it right
now, but go ahead. All right.

1095
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:37,750
I had been putting off email you this
because I feel pretty embarrassed,

1096
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:41,410
but I adore your podcasts,
your honest advice and I have massive,

1097
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:43,960
massive respect for you. So fuck it. Uh,

1098
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:47,860
if you do actually read this and take the
time to respond and thank you so much.

1099
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,730
I Dunno why, but I actually love
when somebody uses the word adore.

1100
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:57,580
I adore your podcasts. It seems so much
more sincere than I love your podcast.

1101
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:59,050
But now that I put that out there,

1102
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:03,560
everyone's going to make fun of
me and say how much they adore a,

1103
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:08,580
I should probably start by saying that
I was in a really bad spot when I first

1104
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:11,830
met my guy.
I was 20 and he was 45.

1105
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:15,890
I lost my mom when I
was 17 of lung cancer.

1106
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:20,891
And then I lost the mother figure who
had taken me in and I had stayed with for

1107
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:26,360
two years again to lug cancer.
Jesus Christ.

1108
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,860
I never knew my dad. Oh,
you knew that was coming.

1109
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:36,560
So I know there's some daddy
issues in to play here probably.

1110
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:37,251
But anyways,

1111
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:42,251
I felt like a giant curse to of my family
members became ill and I was falling

1112
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:46,760
behind. In my degree. The only
happiness I had was going to concerts,

1113
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:49,310
getting high and trying to forget
my grief in the music. Yeah,

1114
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:50,540
that sounds like what I would've done.

1115
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:54,530
That wasn't until I met my guy at one
of the shows and everything started

1116
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:57,830
changing for the better. He had
the most amazing, confident,

1117
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:02,831
positive energy I had ever seen and I
felt so unbelievably happy just by being

1118
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:04,700
around him.
We started dating.

1119
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:09,020
I fell in love hard and fast forward nine
months later we got married in a Vegas

1120
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:13,370
in Vegas on a trip visiting his
family as he's American. I was drunk.

1121
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:17,150
The marriage is not registered in the
UK and my family still doesn't know.

1122
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:20,600
Please don't judge me. I would
never judge you. I'm a fucking mess.

1123
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:25,220
Everything is mostly wonderful between
us and we have lived together for a year

1124
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:25,491
now.

1125
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:29,780
He's a roadie and will typically spend a
couple of months touring and then three

1126
01:09:29,781 --> 01:09:33,290
months at home in that cycle
he is 100% trustworthy.

1127
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,180
I liked that dynamic we have,

1128
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:37,850
because I get my own time to
focus on my freelance work.

1129
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,670
But the time of park keeps
the love fresh and exciting,

1130
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:44,210
especially as we travel a
lot when he is off to work,

1131
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:51,320
uh, before, before the baby. Right. Uh,

1132
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:55,610
but he wants to start breeding within a
couple of years and whilst he is someone

1133
01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:00,110
I would start a family with, I know
I'm not ready for anything like that.

1134
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,890
We've spoken about this and he
said he would wait a few years,

1135
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:06,440
but I still know I'm not going
to be ready in a few years.

1136
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:09,500
I still feel like a lost
teenager most of the time.

1137
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:13,280
I know what the responsibility, so I
know what the responsible thing to do is,

1138
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,680
which is to end it.
But he's been,

1139
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,530
the reason the last couple of years in
my life had been so much brighter and

1140
01:10:18,531 --> 01:10:22,700
happier than they have in so long.
He's great in bed.

1141
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:26,450
Super thoughtful and generous.
No, it isn't a sugar daddy thing,

1142
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:28,850
but it's nice having someone
wants to look after you.

1143
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,210
I just don't know what to do at all.
I really don't want to lose him,

1144
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:35,090
but he's 47 now and once
kids as soon as possible.

1145
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:40,280
I don't want to be a cunt and knowingly
waste his time. I do have a good Chase's.

1146
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,270
Okay.
Two more paragraphs.

1147
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,570
I do have a good circle of friends that
I'll be absolutely fine alone slash.

1148
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:44,871
Single,

1149
01:10:44,871 --> 01:10:48,110
but I just don't want to regret throwing
away a good relationship over this. Ps,

1150
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,720
I'm so glad you liked Manchester.
We loved you here.

1151
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:52,370
I fucking loved going to Manchester.

1152
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:57,070
I had a great time and I would love to
go to Liverpool and new and a new castle.

1153
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,680
I would like to do more of those cities
up there a next time I come over.

1154
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,160
We'd love to meet you and the beautiful
Nia in England one day just so I can

1155
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:09,161
shake the hand and thank you in person
for making a post uni existential crisis

1156
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:14,010
so much more bearable. I don't even know
what that means. Huh? Stay shiny and

1157
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,660
go fuck yourself. Um, all right. Look,
you've been through a lot of shit.

1158
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,470
Okay.
And you married this guy nine months in.

1159
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:27,210
It's not what what he wants is not
what you want and here's the deal.

1160
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:27,900
Okay.

1161
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,170
As much as you're going to feel like
you're an asshole for doing this to this

1162
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:35,990
guy. What kind of a fucking 45 year
old guy marries a 20 year old boy.

1163
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,230
He's 47 now and she's 22 yeah,
but w and last,

1164
01:11:39,231 --> 01:11:42,210
the like knock her up right away and
all that other kind of stuff. Yeah.

1165
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:46,460
I mean he, yeah. How do you not know that
that's coming? Yeah. I mean, she didn't,

1166
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:50,580
she's young. You know what I'm saying? How
does he know that this isn't coming? Oh,

1167
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:55,830
I don't know. I mean, I just feel like he
is like on, you know, the middle and age.

1168
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:59,760
He's a middle age and so he's freaking
is not middle aged. He's over the hill.

1169
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:04,890
I'm so sick of people saying 47 why
isn't that Middle Age 47 times to come on

1170
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:10,230
artists? What is it? Um, 94 yeah.

1171
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:13,620
How many people make it the 94 not a lot.

1172
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:17,400
Like 94 people make it to 94.
Yeah,

1173
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,230
like 35 is middle aged 35 times two is 70.
You have to be,

1174
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:25,200
um, you'd have to be true to
yourself. You're so young,

1175
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,000
you don't want to have
kids now because yeah,

1176
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:31,740
your life is going to change Jurassic
Lee and you haven't had a chance to even

1177
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:36,000
fully, you know, experience everything
that you want to experience your, your,

1178
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:40,080
your weights. A young people
of course have kids at your
age, but you're so young,

1179
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,470
so you know, you should just be
honest with him about it and you know,

1180
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,050
I'll wait a couple of can't have kids.

1181
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,270
You don't know if you don't know who
you are or what the fuck you're doing.

1182
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,910
You can't have kids.
And honestly,

1183
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:55,170
it's not your fault that he
waited this long to, you know,

1184
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,780
be in a relationship and have kids like,

1185
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:02,820
and sometimes you have to be selfish
to get what you want. Okay. That's it.

1186
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,120
Okay. You're being, you're
being a good know. She just
takes off now. He's still 47.

1187
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:10,570
You can meet a fucking 31 year old.
Yeah. That's who he needs to meet.

1188
01:13:10,571 --> 01:13:14,930
A chick in her thirties who's
just sweating it out going,

1189
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:19,680
what the fuck I need a baby DiMauro.
I need to trap a man. That's,

1190
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:23,700
that's what he's, it's not your fault.
He's drafting this late in life.

1191
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:28,080
He's drafted in the later rounds.
That's what's left. You know that,

1192
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:32,220
you know the trap car. Know what he's
talking about. He's, he's going to,

1193
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,410
he's going to date these going to date,
the female version of that.

1194
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,530
They got this fucking thing
out there called the trap car.

1195
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:46,770
Speaking of racist. They drive
it in what? They drive this car,

1196
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,460
a nice car. They leave it running
with the keys on and they,

1197
01:13:50,461 --> 01:13:54,720
but they only do it in like
non white neighborhoods. Yeah.

1198
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:59,490
It's such bullshit. Bullshit.
Um, but anyway, don't, um,

1199
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:02,790
don't have a, maybe just to keep
this guy because you will end up,

1200
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,100
you'll love your baby and
you'll end up hating him,

1201
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:10,320
but you'll resent your baby cause she
didn't get to go to fucking Joshua tree

1202
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:14,190
and eat mushrooms and do whatever the
fuck he supposed to do in your early

1203
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:16,090
twenties. Whatever. What our kids do
now in their early twenties. Yeah.

1204
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:20,560
You guys are really at
completely different stages in
your life. And this is why,

1205
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,041
you know,

1206
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:25,690
unfortunately it's not advisable to
marry someone who could literally be your

1207
01:14:25,691 --> 01:14:26,524
father.

1208
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:30,760
So Nia with another cold bucket of water.

1209
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:36,730
I liked this. I liked this Rainer. She
is sweet and you know, I don't know.

1210
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,360
It sucks.
You know what I mean?

1211
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:43,840
She sounds like she's genuinely in love
with him and it doesn't want to break up,

1212
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:47,800
but this is a pretty big issue.
This isn't a little thing.

1213
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:51,730
So He's,
by the time you're ready,

1214
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:56,380
he's going to be dead. And I'm just
kidding. Um, he's going to be, you know,

1215
01:14:56,410 --> 01:15:00,760
even older. So it was
just, yeah, I dunno. Yeah.

1216
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,710
Or you could like adapt a Twat. I
told you so. But you had to say,

1217
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,450
I feel like you're all you over
selling it. No, I'm done. I'm quiet.

1218
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:13,310
Did a great job in the podcast media
people feel like it was going to love and

1219
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,490
you trashed me two times.

1220
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,480
You gave me like the trashing of the
year twice on one fucking podcast.

1221
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,540
That's cool.
I can live with that.

1222
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,580
I always know when there's
something going on with you.

1223
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,440
I always know there's
something going on with you.

1224
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:32,320
I don't know what the fuck
it is when you do that,

1225
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:36,000
because I'm always right because
I'm always right. Knee and leg, man.

1226
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:39,790
It was going on with you.
I'm fine. You're not.

1227
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,920
You're a, you're a fucking mess. You're,
you're freaking out about the holidays.

1228
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:49,060
I know. You are. All right. That's it.
That's a podcast. That's the podcast.

1229
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,030
Ladies and gentleman, that
is the podcast. Bill Burr,

1230
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:56,440
a white male signing off with Nia.

1231
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,160
Nia Hill, a black female. Alright.

1232
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,180
Have a great couple of days. Uh, I'll
check in on. How about them apples?

1233
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,520
Perfect. You're crushing
it. All right, I'll see you.
