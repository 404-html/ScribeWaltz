1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,450
Okay.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,750
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,960
It's bill burns time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,220
April 24th, 2017. How's it going? Oh, why

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,230
are you doing, how's your week? Obs?
Sorry, the podcast is a little late.

6
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:19,940
I traveled today. I flew
back from Boise, Idaho.

7
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:22,220
Not Boise. Everybody.
There's an s in there.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,300
That's what I learned when I was
up there. Boise, Idaho. And uh,

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,970
and it was hilarious when we, when
we landed, when we landed it, it um,

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,510
you know that, uh, the fucking
shooter, you know on the plane,

11
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:39,340
the shooter and I don't meet with a gun
because you can't get guns in the planes

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,600
unless you make one like a,
what's his face there?

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,550
John Malcovich and that Clint
Eastwood movie. What was it called?

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,560
Gun. Is that what it's called? He
made like that little plastic gun

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,370
till I get some God damn respect
and he fucking hung up the phone.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,860
Um, now this, I'm not talking about
a gun. The fucking, the shooter,

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,420
the guy, the wedge breaker.
It's like the second they ring,

18
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:09,950
that Little Bing Bong mean you
can take off your seat belt.

19
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:13,390
Some guy from 12 rows back like
runs up to the front of the plane.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,650
So of course he stops right on my roast
and I can't get up and I'm looking at

21
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,080
his dad jeans and he was
wearing flip flops. Alright,

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,120
so I gotta give it up to the guy.
All right,

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,870
you don't have to show that kind
of quickness with like, you know,

24
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:28,240
a third of a shoe on was
in as it was impressive.

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,900
So this fucking guy who was in the
row behind me diagonally across starts

26
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:38,320
fucking chirping in his ear. It was
like the fucking NHL playoffs. I'm like,

27
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:39,760
are these guys going to drop the gloves?

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,190
I see him talking to
the guy and see the guy,

29
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:44,560
you know the flip flop guy
looking over his shoulder, right?

30
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,620
It's basically a guy with really nice
shoes and Polka dot socks in first class,

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,880
which is where I sit. I,
that's I, I, I don't give a
fuck. I don't give a fuck for,

32
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,310
I'm flying to Las Vegas.
I sit in the front of the fucking plane.

33
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,840
That's just how I do it.
All right.

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,950
I spent 20 goddamn years in the back of
the plane. I swear to God I'm not cold,

35
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,550
but they just spill the fucking tee all
over the what did they, what did he like?

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,270
What are the odds that I was putting my
wallet on the fucking string to the tea

37
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:12,980
bag and then this shit's going to
go all over the place. It's just,

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,330
I swear to God I'm having a hell
of a like fucking four days here.

39
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,050
Every goddamn thing. It'd be little
cunty thing that can go wrong. You know,

40
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:25,710
first I break my computer screen
and then the tea bag comes out.

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,660
I'm my Jesus Christ.

42
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,870
That's going to take me at least 11
seconds to clean up or I just kind of wipe

43
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,520
it up with my sock. Oh,
what a fucking animal.

44
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,490
I said a stop it from going down the
side of the table. Don't judge me.

45
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,750
So anyways, let's get back to the polka
dotted polka dotted socks. All right.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,940
Fucking gentlemen worked his way up
to the front of the fucking plane,

47
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,650
or maybe he was born into money.
I don't know.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,610
I don't think this guy was because he
was fucking all over this fucking animal

49
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,830
with his flip flops. Who was coming
up from, you know the fucking,

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,610
the animal section of the plank.
Well,

51
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:06,240
this guy deserved debate. All
right, telling you right now,

52
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,950
that should be your guys' goal in life.

53
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:11,790
You got to get to the front of the fucking
plane and that, that's not a metaphor.

54
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,140
That is it. Literally you have to get
to the front of the fucking plane.

55
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,070
Unless you don't travel that often,
then just, you know, suck it up.

56
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,630
Who gives a shit?
But if you travel a time,

57
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:25,320
you have to get to the front of the
fucking plane. And I'm telling you,

58
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,550
the only difference between the front of
the plane and the back of the plane is

59
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:33,840
they just, they treat you like a
human being. That's it. That's it.

60
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:36,360
It's not like it used to be where,
you know,

61
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,970
there was fucking broads
up there and you know,

62
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,470
they meet you in the Eastern Airlines
fucking lounge afterwards and they,

63
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,560
you know, Gavin like a fucking
whatever the fuck happened in the 70s,

64
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,910
you know what I mean? Is it credible
meeting of pubes that that decade was?

65
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,480
Um,
so anyways,

66
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:59,220
this guy is fucking in the guys. It
like, I, you know, I got my fucking,

67
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,220
the free fucking Bose headsets,

68
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:06,510
the wireless ones that those posts gave
me and then I found out this spying on

69
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:10,110
you if you have the APP,
I had to delete the fucking APP.

70
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,630
Yeah.

71
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,411
Jesus Christ.

72
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:15,860
And then I found out those guys at blue
apron are like going down to farmer's

73
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,430
markets. They're going,
hey, you don't want to,

74
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:21,020
you don't want to be with these guys.
Come over to us. You know what I mean?

75
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,290
What a bunch of pussies, if that's
what they're doing, allegedly,

76
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,071
that's what they were doing.

77
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:29,330
And why don't you fucking go do that
and a god Damn Ralph's do it in a

78
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:32,990
supermarket, right. Stay
in your own weight class.

79
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,650
Yeah.

80
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,970
You colored apron,
constant fucking hilarious.

81
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,220
Just farmers Barker guy was going
off on him. It's going to blue apron.

82
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,700
They eliminate the middle man. He's
like, ah, hello. You are the middlemen.

83
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,900
You dumb cunt. We eliminate
it. We farmed this shit.

84
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:52,950
We're going right to
the people. Um, anyways,

85
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:55,740
I probably just lost a sponsor there,
but I don't give a fuck right.

86
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,170
If that's what they're doing.
If you weren't doing it,

87
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,980
I apologize to everybody that,
uh, you know, wears an apron.

88
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:06,660
The color of my balls right
now. Okay. I apologize. Anyways,

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,790
um, t spell, can you get to the fucking
fight? All right. All right. Sorry.

90
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm a little distracted.

91
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:15,570
I don't like doing this podcast on
days that I traveled on. I'm a little,

92
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:18,990
I'm a little scatterbrained there,
more so than usual. All right.

93
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,670
Before you make a joke, God damn,
my new computer screen is Gleeman.

94
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,440
I'll tell you underrated. Breaking
your fucking computer screen. You know,

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,870
you take it down,
you'd never go to the apple store.

96
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,670
Don't ever go to the apple store.
The apple store is like flying coach.

97
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,610
Okay, you're going to go in there and
they're going to treat you like a fucking

98
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:42,390
animal. You know? Nazy
put themselves on a,

99
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:46,230
on a higher plane walking around genius,
right on their shirt.

100
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,950
What does your shirt
say? Says Nothing. Right?

101
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,140
Like you have no fucking thought you
had and you got to go down there and go

102
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:55,440
talk to those fucking wire. He cuts. Um,

103
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,600
yeah.

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
Anyways,
now you got all just

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,800
some local fucking place. You know,
they charge a little bit more,

106
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:04,820
but you go in there. Okay. And did you
get treated like a fucking human being?

107
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,240
So I go in there and you know,
and they see the bus to computer screen.

108
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,130
They know what the fuck
happened, you know, and I'm
not going to lie to him like,

109
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,110
Oh, you know, uh, I got a
little one at home and she
knocked it off the table, the,

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,230
you know, doing that shit.
I didn't do that. They go,
what happened to him? I said,

111
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,640
I stabbed it with my phone.

112
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,540
So they start laughing. They
go, why'd you do that? I said,

113
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,710
because I'm an impatient person and
I'm not good at these things. And uh,

114
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,970
it seemed like the right thing to do in
the moment and I immediately regretted

115
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:41,570
it. So now I'm here to give you my money
if you can fix this. And they were like,

116
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,404
absolutely.

117
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,933
You know.

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,620
No, it's funny because I
always have a piece of tape.

119
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,630
I have a piece of tape
over the fucking camera,

120
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,830
so I don't want people watching me
fucking jerking off to porn. I don't want,

121
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,710
I didn't want to watch people meet modern
walking around talking to myself in

122
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,870
the hotel room,
trying to come up with new joy.

123
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:01,190
I just don't want people watching me self.
That's the first thing I noticed.

124
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,571
I was like,
wow,

125
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:05,320
this screen is really clean and fucking
big brother can see what's going on.

126
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,740
You know, I don't mind if
they can hear what's going on.

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,450
I just don't want them to see it.

128
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,650
So anyways, so there's this guy, he's got
polka dot socks on his fucking, you know,

129
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,850
smart pair of wing tip shoes on and
he's just fun given this Guy Shit.

130
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,790
So I take off my Bose headphones,
you know,

131
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,060
which they probably downloaded the entire
argument was fucking spine cuts, right?

132
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,900
So I take them off and he's right in mid
sentence. Jay just walked right up here.

133
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,020
Yeah, hit me with your bag. What's
wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

134
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,020
And I can't hear what the other guys say,
but this other guy,

135
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,040
the guy in first class,

136
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,890
you'd think he'd say some fucking guy
with a little soft hands, you know,

137
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,880
never worked a day in his life. He's
fucking all over this guy to the point,

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,970
the guy who who uh,
you know,

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
the flip flop guy just turns his back
and doesn't want to say anything and this

140
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:57,050
guy just keeps going, going and
he goes, what are you doing next?

141
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:59,750
Are you going to push
down a kid? You know, hey,

142
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,190
you might want to brush your teeth too.

143
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,290
He started giving the guys shift from
bad. His breath stunk. I was like,

144
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,890
I've five fucking love this guy.

145
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,420
Okay,

146
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,220
fucking love the guy.
Just fucking,

147
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:14,520
just the entire time it took them
to get the goddamn jetway over.

148
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,700
This guy is just in his fucking end his
fucking year and the guy wouldn't drop

149
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,880
the gloves, would not drop the
gloves during the playoffs.

150
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,190
Unbelievable. You know, like
he's some star player, right?
He's gonna, he's gonna. Uh,

151
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,950
he actually hurt the team.
He fucking sits down

152
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,100
the shooter man. You know, I wished
what happened. I wished he grew up.

153
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,030
I grabbed him by his backpack because
I don't give a shit if you have,

154
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,840
if you fucking have a black
belt in every martial art,

155
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,250
um, discipline. If you have on
a backpack, it's fucking over.

156
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,480
Cause all the person has to
do once somebody just grabs
your backpack and starts

157
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:58,840
running the way and there's nothing
in Jujitsu, there's nothing in it.

158
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,300
Kido, you just, you can't, you know,

159
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,430
that's why if you watch the UFC and
Joe Rogan, I'll tell you this, did,

160
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:11,300
they do not allow backpacks into the
octagon for that specific reason?

161
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,310
You know what I mean? The backpack,
it's like the gun as far as like, just,

162
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,780
just throws the black belt right out the
window. You know what I mean? You know,

163
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:21,800
like all karate movies,

164
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:24,260
like nobody can have a gun cause
then it's just kinda like, well yeah,

165
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:25,400
I can just shoot you.
You know,

166
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,750
it's the coward way up or the CINCI
way out. You remember that? Really? Oh,

167
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:33,290
you could do it at Cinci.
That's what I was a little kid.

168
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:37,750
That was a word that just disappeared.
Meant easy, I guess. It's essential.

169
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,510
Yeah.

170
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,130
Became Cinci I just figured it out
fucking 48 years later, I finally get it.

171
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,800
Um,
anyways,

172
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,960
I just wish I reached up,

173
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:56,120
grabbed his backpack and yanked it back
past him to the polka dotted sock guy

174
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,490
and everybody just passed him
right back to his fucking row.

175
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,600
It would have been tremendous.
You know,

176
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,090
and I know a lot of ya young
listener to this podcast,

177
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:05,970
and I could lie to you and say that pre
nine 11 that was the America that I,

178
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,920
that I lived in,
you know.

179
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,320
Well, no, you know,

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,850
like you could sit in my house and not
have to worry about somebody from the

181
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,610
Geek squad watching me
fucking rub one out. You know,

182
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,350
in the privacy male God damn home.

183
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,640
I have tape over every fucking thing
I could find. I they can listen,

184
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,500
but the kids see it. That's
the deal. If there's no video,

185
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,480
it's just like the podcast.
No fucking video.

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,040
Then my living room right now
that got, I got, I got my TV,

187
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,100
they got the little fucking camera
up there. Not fucking doing that.

188
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,990
I want to look at some fucking pimple
faced Douche and play war of the worlds.

189
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,630
Whatever these kids do, you
know, or the worlds. What are,

190
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:47,580
where the fuck is Warcraft, Minecraft,
mind head. What is it called

191
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,190
as a video game? Trans said video gamers
to the point that I actually know,

192
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,400
isn't it with witches of Eastwick.
What does that,

193
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,560
what does that fucking game that
everybody loses that by when it comes out.

194
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,380
It's not war craft.
Something like that.

195
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,270
Oh, it'll come to me. Not
well, but whatever. I said,

196
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:16,030
you just guess I'd get out of your own
stupidity. That's such a great phrase. I,

197
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,883
it'll come to me.

198
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,770
Why didn't I know that back in the day
when I was in math class, you know,

199
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,670
what is the sine, cosine, and tangent
of that fucking iPod news? Uh,

200
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,000
Mr Birth. Oh, it's uh, uh, uh,

201
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,250
don't tell me [inaudible] I, you
know what, it'll, it'll come to me.

202
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,010
It'll come to me and my
teacher. Hey, fair enough.

203
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,980
Then maybe I wouldn't have to go to
summer school. Two out of four years.

204
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,020
I should have gone all three. Fuck,
I should have done all four years.

205
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,310
You know what I mean?

206
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,950
My Sophomore teacher let me off
the hook and gave me a d minus,

207
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,300
and then senior year I was
like, well, what's the point?
What's the fucking point?

208
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,990
What am I getting to a better
community college? Yeah.

209
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:57,400
It didn't make any fucking difference.
You know what I mean?

210
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,050
It's like when the fucking
outfields playing in, you know,

211
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,930
and then the guy up to the plate,
he hits it over the guy's fucking head.

212
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,550
He doesn't go get it. He
just, he just runs it.

213
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,220
That's why I treated summer
school in my senior year,

214
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,830
not fucking doing that shit. What's the
point when I can go out and get hammered,

215
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,690
drive drunk and do what you did in
the 80s just driving around, hammered,

216
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,060
hammered. You'd go down to the
fucking liquor store. The packy is,

217
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,980
we called it, hey, go down
a Paki. Gimme a sec said,

218
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,530
don't we go down to the package store,
right. And you just stand there out front.

219
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,790
You know the hands in your pockets
looking as conspicuous as possible.

220
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,150
And then you just fucking walk
up to adults and be like, Hey,

221
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:43,180
could you buy me some beer? You were,
you know, and there was no fight.

222
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,690
There was no cameras back then. The
television had just been invented. I mean,

223
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,140
and nobody knew how to work these
things and people would do that.

224
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:53,590
They would actually like not
even think about the liability.

225
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,520
They would go out and they, you know,
you try to judge, like get a buyer.

226
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,600
That's what it was. He tried to like,
tried to like pick the right person.

227
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,000
Somebody look cool. You know what
I mean? Anybody in a suit you like,

228
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:08,290
fuck that guy. I'm not asking him.
You don't ask a mom, you know,

229
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,280
didn't ask any women. You know what I
mean? And she hoarded up a little bit.

230
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,900
You're like,
you then you gotta make the judgment call.

231
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,970
How involved in her life
was her father? Uh, I dunno.

232
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,000
I Dunno now I'm not doing
it then I'm not doing it.

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,030
And you just wait for somebody a
little bit of long hair, you know,

234
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,590
some fucking shitty little mustache.
He looked for dirt bags.

235
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,281
Basically what you did,

236
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:34,600
someone who would have no concern for
people under age driving away with alcohol

237
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,810
and uh,
and that's the way it was done.

238
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,230
I don't even know what I'm
talking about right now. You know,

239
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,120
as I got these fucking helicopters
in my ears, can you hear that thing?

240
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,480
They're like hovering right over my house.
They have an a big parade right now.

241
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,120
A parade or a or something.
It's a, the Armenians,

242
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,630
the recognizing or
remembering everybody who, uh,

243
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,560
died in the genocide,
you know,

244
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:02,530
you know,

245
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,320
I just realized that you're sort of
really just fucked up my relationship with

246
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:08,080
the Turkish funny boat. I probably won't
be getting any weekends out there for,

247
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:08,914
well

248
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,900
that in cad Zacker stay on whatever the
two countries are that try to act like

249
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,980
that. We didn't, we never did that.
Ah, that never happened. Yeah.

250
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,870
Well the rest of the world knows it did.

251
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:25,210
So you could just sit there
and deny it all you want,

252
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,460
but are you fucking Bernie Madoff?

253
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,730
How long are you going to
fucking lie about this shit? Um,

254
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,730
I actually watched this documentary,
speaking of just despicable,

255
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,210
horrible things to do to human beings.
You know,

256
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,040
I don't know anything about Turkish
people, but I'll tell you right now, I,

257
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,820
if they were probably scared shitless
of Armenians, you know what I mean?

258
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,060
The fucking tough people.
That's probably what it was.

259
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,330
They got all nervous or some shit.
I don't know what it was.

260
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,470
It's a lot of Armenians in my
neighborhood and I swear to God,

261
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,220
like every other one of them
you look at you like, is that,

262
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,850
is that a UFC champion?
They fucking jacked.

263
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,440
The heads are shaved.

264
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:13,220
Every one of them just looks like they
could kick the shit out of you. I Dunno.

265
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,860
Maybe Turkey got nervous.
I have no idea what happened.

266
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,980
I don't know how you
could fucking do that.

267
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,943
MMM.

268
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,810
I don't know. The older
I get, the older I get,

269
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:26,200
the more a sickening
human behavior becomes,

270
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,140
not saying I'm some fucking sink,
but I still,

271
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:33,670
for the legs of me do not understand
how war is legal. I just don't,

272
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:34,540
I don't get it.

273
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,013
You know,

274
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,300
let, let's, let's,

275
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:41,750
let's wait into international waters
here without really paying attention to

276
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:46,400
anything. I don't, you know,
I don't even watch the BBC,

277
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,410
you know, that's what a lot
of stuck up cuts over here.

278
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,870
Do I just want to get another perspective?

279
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,320
So Syria gases,

280
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,650
some of its own fucking people and
then we shoot missiles at them.

281
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,080
Okay.

282
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,080
So my thing is where did the
missiles goal and who died,

283
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,300
how accurate are those missiles?

284
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,940
Was it just some guy selling
popcorn on this quarter?

285
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,460
A buzz Syria and a Kazakh is
Stan, you know, and he's up there.

286
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,770
It's the fried pray about it and it,

287
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,880
yeah.

288
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,360
Then we're like, ah, sorry
about that. Sorry about that.

289
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:28,690
We were trying to get the guy that
did the thing that we didn't like.

290
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,910
We frowned upon.

291
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,330
We would like to apologize to anybody
at the food court. I have no idea.

292
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,630
Our missiles that good. I
don't know. I have no idea.

293
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:42,860
I just don't get how that works.

294
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,593
MMM.

295
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,890
Yeah. Warren's just really, I
just don't, I don't understand it.

296
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,250
We're gonna murder more your people
before you murder all our people and then

297
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,290
when we win,
we're going to say that you guys are evil.

298
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,010
Okay.

299
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,010
Right. The only way it is if somebody
just starts with you, if they start it,

300
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,583
you know,

301
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,680
then you got to finish it.
I guess that's how it works.

302
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,343
You know what I mean?

303
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,810
Then Sean Connery make a speech about
this and the untouchables or something

304
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:12,644
like that.

305
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,130
I don't fucking know,

306
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,310
but I don't,

307
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,520
I don't get why we were all up in arms
about that hairless fat fuck over there

308
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:21,354
in Korea.

309
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,723
You know what I mean?

310
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,541
I just don't,

311
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,690
I don't understand why this guy can't
shoot off his fireworks at his own fucking

312
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:31,690
country. I mean, we do that shit
all the time. Who gives a fuck?

313
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,020
What is that fucking
durable going to dope?

314
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,083
Yeah.

315
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,570
That's what he's built.
Like it's built like a Jervis.

316
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,950
He just has like a fucking,
yeah, I these adorable,

317
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,770
if you would just stop with the, I'm going
to blow up fuck in the United States.

318
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,760
He's, you got to admit the guy.
He's kind of adorable, you know?

319
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,310
I Dunno, I have no
fucking idea. But anyway,

320
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,280
so I was watching this thing on Europe,
uh,

321
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,090
right after World War II and uh,
then I,

322
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,500
it was so fascinating to me. What the
fuck was going on that I actually,

323
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,650
I went on, I actually
got on my, the Internet,

324
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,930
I didn't have my laptop because
I stabbed it with my phone,

325
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,520
but my phone was still working,
so I was checking out, you know,

326
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:27,540
a couple of websites and this one
website put exactly how my mindset was,

327
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,590
how I believe World War Two right
after was like, all right. I mean,

328
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:35,180
I knew in Germany that obviously
they had the fucking rebuild. Yep.

329
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,450
Obviously Japan, hello. It was a rough
one. Right. I knew that they, you know,

330
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:44,090
we're rebuilding, but everybody
else, I kind of, hey, you know,

331
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
everybody was all in a good mood and
shit and skip and down the fucking street

332
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:48,434
because it was over.

333
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,070
Is this website put at the end of there
was sailors kissing nurses and fucking

334
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:53,630
times square.
That was it.

335
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,150
Okay.

336
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,560
And evidently it was not,

337
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,243
uh,

338
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,220
it a lot of ways,

339
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:04,900
like people were acting exactly the way
against the people they were fighting.

340
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:08,260
It was fucking brutal. There
was all kinds of rapes, murders,

341
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,000
people settle in scores.

342
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,123
MMM.

343
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,850
All Germans that were all around Europe
that it, you know, we're not in Germany,

344
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,480
they will getting fucking
killed and sent back to Germany,

345
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,030
couple of little mini
genocides, which, you know,

346
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,920
between people in eastern fucking Europe,

347
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,370
it was just like Jesus Christ and I to
say some of these, the fucking Nazis too.

348
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,900
Every time I think like,
I've heard the worst thing they ever did.

349
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,090
It's like you literally
can't even watch it.

350
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,520
I just found out something else they did.
I'm going to tell you,

351
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:44,140
it was so fucking disturbing.
I'm not even going to repeat it.

352
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,480
I can't stop fucking thinking about it.

353
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:50,870
And then they were showing the Goddamn
Nuremberg trials and those fucking Nazi

354
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:53,180
conscious sitting there with this
arrogant look on their face like,

355
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:54,630
well this is fucking bullshit.
Right.

356
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,733
You know,

357
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,650
and then I'm thinking, how could you think
that? How could you not be like, wow,

358
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:04,320
like the attack got a little, yeah, with
guess we got a little sideways with that.

359
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:09,060
A plan hub.
They fucking sitting there.

360
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,660
You know what these look on
their face like, yeah, like,

361
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,080
like this is fucking bullshit.

362
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,270
And I'm thinking like how
could they possibly think that?

363
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:20,030
Because they're prior and I'm thinking
they think, well if we fucking won,

364
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,930
you guys would be sitting here.
All right,

365
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,200
what about when you fire bombed Dresden?
How about that shit?

366
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,790
And then we could just
be like, well, you know,

367
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,040
we wouldn't have done that if you
wouldn't do what you were doing.

368
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,780
You weren't doing what you were
doing. Right. Mister Blonde.

369
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,530
They just done what I told him
the dough or would have been dead.

370
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,890
That's what we were doing. You didn't
do what the fuck you were doing.

371
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:46,970
We would have done what we did and
then they would say, well, we what we,

372
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,670
we learn from you with what you
did to the native Americans.

373
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,370
And then we would say, well,
you know what, that wasn't us.

374
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,980
We weren't alive when that happened. And
then there'd be like, well, you know what?

375
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:57,830
You're still alive and a lot of them
are still alive and you're not doing

376
00:20:57,831 --> 00:21:01,040
anything about it. And when we
like, all right, fair enough.

377
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,590
You know what will set some emotion
to eventually give him our casinos?

378
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,790
And the Nazis would be like, ah, you
know, it's fair enough. Fair enough.

379
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,270
And that's it. You should to handle
all his fucking footage of them.

380
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,280
Hang in these fucking guys.
Just a nonchalant way they did it there.

381
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,960
This is footage of this guy. I don't even
know what the fuck it was. It was like,

382
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,820
it was just a board.
It was like a do it yourself.

383
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,770
Fucking hang the guy right in court.

384
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,490
Okay.

385
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,920
They fucking tie the guy's
hands behind his back.

386
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,910
They lay him down on this board.
It just goes like to a 45 degree angle.

387
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,850
They hoist a guy up,

388
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,390
they put a fucking rope around
his neck and he's sitting there

389
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,780
fucking all of them up,
right.

390
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,430
And then a guy with gloves just covers
the guy's eyes and then they let go of

391
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,740
them.
And as the guy slides down,

392
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,870
he breaks his neck and the
guy with the hands just,

393
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:58,780
he just moves his hand with the guy's
head. So you never see his fucking eyes,

394
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,780
you know, cause they didn't
want to upset people in court.

395
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,150
It's fucking insane.
Fucking insane.

396
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,870
And uh, Jesus Christ, I
gotta be honest with you.

397
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,420
I really wish I didn't watch it because
there was this woman testifying and that,

398
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,770
that, that, you know, if you want to
see it, I can't remember the program.

399
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm sure you can find it on the fucking
Internet. You don't just Google.

400
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:26,500
What the fuck was bill
talking about World War II?

401
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,290
I'm sure somebody will find it and um,

402
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,680
okay.

403
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,580
You got to see them like, you know, all
right, this is just not funny anymore.

404
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,520
All right, let's plow ahead.
Let's talk about something
else. Okay. So I was in, uh,

405
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,870
I was in Boise. This, um, uh,

406
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,830
Jesus Christ, sorry, I'm
typing in my password here.

407
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,090
I was in boy, you know what,
uh, does anybody seen uh,

408
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,720
Joe Macintyre's new shelf.

409
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,720
Okay.

410
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,810
Joe McIntyre from new kids on the
block from the movie the heat.

411
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,170
I got to work with Tom with them on that,
that movie.

412
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,810
And he was fucking great guy.
Absolutely hilarious. Right?

413
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:10,811
So I was supposed to do a podcast with
them to help promote his shell and I had,

414
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,440
I just completely forgot and he drove
all the way over to this podcast studio

415
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:19,990
and I wasn't there, completely fucked
the guy over. So he's going to be, um,

416
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,140
I'm going to be interviewing them for
next week's Monday morning podcast and he

417
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:28,370
is going to give me a fucking ton of
shit. So out of guilt I'm like, fuck,

418
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:33,050
I got to watch this guy show cause they
fucked this up and I put it on and Lo

419
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:37,070
and behold, it's fucking
hilarious. It's fucking hilarious.

420
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,900
Okay. I'm not gonna lie to you. I hit
pause cause I wanted to make sure that I,

421
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,450
I said this guy's name right.
Joey Lawrence did a guest star.

422
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,750
I always forget there's too many.
Joe Is in the story so I fuck,

423
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,210
I was going to fuck it up.
He was fucking hilarious.

424
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,860
And the guy who plays is a agent is great.
I don't know what his name is.

425
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,160
I'm on the CMDB page.
I'm going to fuck all of this stuff up.

426
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,390
Everybody on the show's hilarious.

427
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:04,340
Jamie Denver who I also
worked with in the heat.

428
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,950
MMM.

429
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,100
Who else was in Donnie Wahlberg?
All of these guys were just,

430
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,770
it's really fucking funny,
thank Christ.

431
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,770
Cause I was already sitting there going
like, fuck I fucked this guy over.

432
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:19,440
I didn't show up. And then I'm going
to watch your show him like, God, God,

433
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:22,940
what if it's terrible? Then what do I
do? I got to sit there and cross. Ah,

434
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,160
it's a great show that I can actually
tell you it's a fucking great show.

435
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,200
I don't know what network it's on.

436
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,120
I'm going to fuck them
but I'll know by Monday.

437
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,210
All I know is it's not on the comfy
network, but it's fucking hilarious.

438
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:36,700
Just look it up. It's really,
really well written. And uh,

439
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:41,670
the guy who plays his agent is
a fucking beast. Um, kills it.

440
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:44,520
And uh, I don't know. I actually
found it interesting too,

441
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,280
like what his life is like,
you know,

442
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,850
cause it's based obviously on his life
and does so much like creepy older women

443
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:55,230
wanting to come up and hug them

444
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,740
and now he's got to kind of
just allow them the do it. Um,

445
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,750
I found that hilarious just because I
don't like people touching me. You know,

446
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,020
I just,
after a while I just like,

447
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:15,530
I so understand how he meant Dell,
you know what I mean?

448
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,060
Just as people always wanting to come up
and touch him and then like what if he

449
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,550
wants a fucking sandwich
and all those hands,

450
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:25,310
he just shook all that DNA.

451
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:28,490
He could literally start his own country
with what is on his fucking hands.

452
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:33,410
And when you really start thinking about
that, you know, that's, I don't know.

453
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,120
Like my favorite time to meet people is
during the winter when I'm back east and

454
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,660
you already have gloves on. I love
winter. When you're in New York,

455
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,470
you know you can go on the subway,
you can grab onto shit.

456
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,050
You can finally hold on,
you know?

457
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,530
Okay.

458
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,290
Just walking down the street, high
five and homeless people. It's fun.

459
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,970
You don't give a shit. Right.
You've got on gloves. It's perfect.

460
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,470
Yeah.

461
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,450
Maybe that's what I'm going to do.
You know?

462
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:05,470
I've always been looking for something.
Oh look who's here.

463
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,710
Am I being too loud? No, no, no,
no. I haven't done the podcast yet.

464
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,410
Oh,
it's the two lovely ladies.

465
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,110
Can I say a load of my daughter?
What's up?

466
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,100
Huh? Oh, you know what?

467
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:27,310
The Internet doesn't work in the office
and I was worried I was going to stab my

468
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:31,880
laptop again with my phone. I
didn't want to do that. Give me a,

469
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,550
let me get one little smile here. Let
me get one little smile. Hey Buddy. Oh,

470
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:40,090
she just woke up. Did
you just wake up? Hey.

471
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,490
Yeah, it is that smile.
Oh, are you all right?

472
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:48,550
She's too adorable. And this is not
going to be a funny podcast anymore.

473
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,590
How are you cutie? We're
going to hang out today. Ah,

474
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,930
we did a couple of BS. Nice smile, right?

475
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,483
Oh,

476
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,773
okay.

477
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,570
Sorry, I'm back. I'm back. Um, all
right, let me do some of the, um,

478
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,240
let me do some of the regions. So
yeah, check out our return of the Mack.

479
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,430
How funny is that shelf? Right there
you go. See that Nia would never lie.

480
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,690
Um, all right, let me, let me read
some of these fucking things here.

481
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,940
Where is, all right. Okay,
here we go. Oh, policy genius,

482
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:34,610
life insurance. Do you have
it? If you don't, why not?

483
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,340
Too expensive or a hassle,
man,

484
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,280
I actually have life insurance now
and I'm fucking excited. You know,

485
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,560
I can't tell you how relaxed I am on
planes now. Now I know that if I die,

486
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:46,460
it doesn't matter.

487
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,390
Okay.

488
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,690
I have rendered myself like just,

489
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,680
I know I've just sort of delegated
everything out to this point that I'm just

490
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:59,820
sorta useless.

He looks everybody Helux you're unique.

You don't walk like everyone else.
Talk like everyone else. Sure. Why?

550
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,130
Or sleep like anyone else.
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

551
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,350
I don't know. Yeah, it feel
it feels good. I don't know.

552
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,460
These guys give me anxiety like I
thought my aunt, my mattress was fine.

553
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,060
This is a classic sales technique.
Scare the shit out of them.

bucks.
Who the fuck has that kind of money?

But that guy with the Polka dot socks
does. You know I loved about him.

557
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:26,660
He wasn't afraid of getting sued either.
Is that on my screen? Oh No. Okay.

558
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,510
Until now. Okay. Go to helix,

they developed with the help of the
world's leading era Gomix and biomechanic

comfortable mattress you've ever slept on.

570
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:09,730
How x Helix customers report at 30%
improvement in overall sleep quality?

571
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,980
I don't, I don't understand how, you know,
I guess how you feel when you wake up.

572
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,290
How does it feel? But yeah, it feels,
yeah. How much better I, you know,

573
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,990
I don't know.
30% 30% sounds like a lie.

574
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,350
If they said like 27%
it'd be like, okay. No,

575
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:32,500
but that's something people would say.
They'd pick a round number. All right.

576
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:34,630
You know what I believe? Um,
all right. And for couples,

577
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,960
they customize each side of the mattress.
That's the beginning of the divorce.

578
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:38,530
By the way,

579
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,150
your mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% free.

580
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:46,870
And you and your wife can
begin the slow drift apart,

581
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,190
like the way the continent's separated,
right? Just do it all starts with my Mac.

582
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,280
I want the mattress to feel like this.
I want it to feel that way.

583
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,390
And you're not working relationship,
you know, somebody has to cave,

584
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,120
but not anymore.
Thanks to helic sleep,

585

breaking up marriages for over 30 years.
Um,

586
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:07,810
your mattress arrives in about a
week and it's shipping is 100% free.

587
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,430
That's why everyone from Gq magazine,
oh Jesus, Gq magazine. Oh my God.

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,010
Get out the most to Forbes.

talking about helic sleep.

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,420
You have a hundred nights to try it
out. Graphs. And if you don't love it,

they'll pick it up for free
and give you 100% refund.

592
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:29,560
No questions asked.
Whenever I pictured them picking it up,

593
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:33,430
I always picture fucking Jesse and Mr.
White showing up in their hazmat suits.

594
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,300
Uh, got a helix speaking
of Boise. All right.

595
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,690
Okay.

596
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,130
Aaron Paul,
he's from up there.

597
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,660
Go to hell and sleep.com/bar
and get $50 off your order.

598
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,120
That's helix,
sleep.com/burr Heloc,

599
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:52,760
sleep.com/pr okay.
Anyways,

600
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,790
so let's get on it. Okay, so I was
up there. I am going to talk hockey,

601
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,950
but I'm trying to avoid the pain.
Um,

602
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,160
I'm trying to avoid the pain.
Okay.

603
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,650
I just thought about
Carlito's way it comes to bed.

604
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:11,070
I read that Ed Kleinfeld is my friend.

605
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,700
Um, that's, that's one of my
favorite roles Sean Penn ever played.

606
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,160
I fucking love him in that.

607
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,960
I love them with the fucking Perm
and the receding hairline, you know,

608
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,030
he's doing the fucking blow.
Cop comes in,

609
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,570
says all that crazy shit to him
trying to scare the shit out of him.

610
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,780
He just looks at the cop
and goes, don't, don't

611
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,130
fucking hilarious. Oh, I
love Sean Penn. You know,

612
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,640
sometimes I pray for a flood just so I
could see him coming up on a boat just to

613
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:50,370
rescue me. He's that kind
of guy. Um, anyways, um,

614
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,180
so I'm up in Boise, Idaho, working the
Egyptian theater had a great fucking time,

615
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,160
despite the fact for the first
time in like 12, 13 years.

616
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:03,640
I had it kicked somebody out of the show
and I never do that. And I told the guy,

617
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,420
I don't want to do that.
I think it's a pussy move by a comedian,

618
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,400
deal with the heckler and that's it. But
this guy was just, he just was, you know,

619
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,080
he wasn't even remotely coherent. And, uh,

620
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,080
I dunno, I offered to pay for his tickets
and all that. I was just like, dude,

621
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:21,790
you take, you just, you gotta
go, you gotta fucking go.

622
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:24,280
And I gave him like a one more word.
You could just shut the fuck up.

623
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,700
And he's still is that,

624
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,590
I couldn't even respond to what he's
saying because I couldn't understand them.

625
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,300
And it was getting, uh, it
was getting ugly. It was
getting ugly. So, uh, you know,

626
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,490
I apologize to the people there and
if the guys listening, you know,

627
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:44,440
just come back next time sober. All
right. That's all. I didn't want to do it.

628
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,490
All right. I'm sure you woke up today
all fucking mad at me. Um, you know,

629
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:52,880
when they threw him out, they found 14
beers, empty beer cans underneath is a

630
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,460
okay

631
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,880
underneath his seat. I Dunno if
they're trumping up the charges.

632
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,140
I don't know if because
he was in the front row,

633
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:02,260
a bunch of rows of beers cans
rolled down to him. I have no,

634
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,530
I don't pretend to fucking
know. But anyways, I was, um,

635
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,800
I was performing at the theater and uh,

636
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,070
one of the coolest things
anybody has ever done for me,

637
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,670
the people at the theater
heard that I played drums.

638
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,380
So they rented a drum kit and during
the day I got to go into the theater,

639
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,520
the theater, and just fucking, you know,

640
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,390
put on my Walkman, whatever the fuck
you call it, the iPod thing, my phone,

641
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,100
my little handheld stereo and just
fucking, just rock out man. I had a,

642
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,490
I had a great time and whoever the,
whoever to adopt those drums,

643
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:40,130
they sounded great.
The snare was fucking unbelievable.

644
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,443
Yeah.

645
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,730
Was okay. It was like a marching, I
don't know what the f how deep it was.

646
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,870
It was like six and a half by
like, uh, what's the next size up?

647
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,250
I'm sorry, it was like 14 by six
and a half. What's the next size up?

648
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:59,070
Is it eight inches deep? Nine inches
deep. But this isn't a porno here.

649
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,800
People I'm talking to [inaudible]
was incredible,

650
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,360
incredible fucking sound.

651
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,500
And I was this old Ludwig's and they
didn't even have like the usual,

652
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:12,010
I'm like lugs on them.
Whatever the fuck he called.

653
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:14,410
The things you unscrew when you're
tuning up and tune it down. The drama,

654
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:17,620
whatever attention any tensioning the
drama of what the fuck he supposed to say

655
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:21,820
it. They just had screws that were all
stripped so it's got this great kit.

656
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:26,020
But to adjust it, I had to take out a pair
of pliers that came with the drum kit.

657
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,210
Um, so it was a five piece,
broke it down to the four piece,

658
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:34,480
set up the Steven Adler fucking set up
that he fell in love with when appetite

659
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,190
for destruction came out.
You know,

660
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,850
when I was going down the slippery slope
of I want as many drums as possible

661
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,880
cause I was listening to iron maiden and
then Steven Adler came out. I'm like,

662
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,630
this fucking guy's get more music out
of these four drums and half these guys

663
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,390
out with these fucking 15 piece kits.

664
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,400
So,
um,

665
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,620
I just say I had,
I had the greatest fucking time and uh,

666
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,680
was up there with the Rosebowl
tailgate legend Joe Barnett,

667
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,700
who fucking murdered all week
and a Monday morning podcast,

668
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,860
uh,
produce producer,

669
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,340
producer said he said extraordinary.

670
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:15,900
Andrew [inaudible] was up there and uh,
we made a tour. We did a tour of, uh,

671
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,250
Boise. We fucked it. We got
everywhere. We got fucking everywhere.

672
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:24,810
We went on the blue field,
we went up to the fucking table rock.

673
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,650
We will all over that fucking
town. We had a great time. Um,

674
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,440
so that'll be coming out.
The San Jose one is almost done.

675
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:34,830
And then I also got another one
for a San Antonio that's coming up.

676
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,350
So I'm just going to start
doing those fucking things.

677
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:39,670
I don't know why I like
doing them the fun. You know,

678
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,460
plus it makes me get up and do shit.
You know,

679
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,030
I've been to Boise a number of times.
I never got up into those fucking hills,

680
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,690
you know, so, all right. I think
I've avoided it long enough.

681
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,790
Let's talk about the NHL playoffs.

682
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:56,340
Ooh.
Uh,

683
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,473
you know,

684
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,290
you want your team to make the playoffs
until they lose a playoff series,

685
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:06,130
then you dislike that sucked. Shouldn't
they just not have made the playoffs?

686
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:09,070
They could. He just ripped the
emotional bandaid right off. Um,

687
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,560
congratulations of saying
this through gritted teeth.

688
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:16,210
Congratulations to the Ottawa senators
and which will allow flight series.

689
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,200
They had nothing to show that restrict
for you guys and your organization.

690
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,200
Good luck in the next round against
the New York farm. Could ranges.

691
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,393
MMM.

692
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,590
And uh, and I got to, you know, you know,
they always do the star of the game.

693
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,410
I mean, at some point you
got to give it to those, uh,

694
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,970
all those Ottawa locals, you know,
there were refereeing those games,

695
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,170
particularly game three, game five,
it even a little bit of game six.

696
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,580
You know, I'm not saying it. If, if you
know, I'm not saying that's why we lost,

697
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:56,440
but Jesus fucking Christ all I wanted
was a little consistency, you know,

698
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,930
and he has a deal.
A Ref could fuck he in one game,

699
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:03,250
but you know when it's like three
out of the sex Jesus Christ,

700
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:06,120
how many times did we have to win
game five before they weighted score?

701
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,390
Like two fucking goals.
If fucking sit in the crease,

702
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,290
cover the puck up in the
crease, not the goalie. Okay.

703
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,000
For those who don't watch hockey,
that said,

704
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,240
I've been watching hockey for 37
fucking years. That's a penalty shot.

705
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,803
Cool.

706
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,580
They have replay. I don't know how they
met. Well, uh, after further review, uh,

707
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,720
where the defense man put
his hand over the Puck,

708
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,430
we could no longer see the plug.

709
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:33,620
So it was inconclusive as to whether
it was underneath his or not.

710
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,390
So we actually won game five despite
the fucking Ref's trying everything they

711
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:41,150
possibly could to give Ottawa
chance to fucking win it.

712
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,550
Game three was a debacle,

713
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,983
you know,

714
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,330
end of the third period.

715
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,830
I can't remember the fuck it was someone
on Ottawa just stood up and punched one

716
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:55,340
of the roads in the face and
we got offsetting ruffings.

717
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,580
We both got two minutes for roughing the
auto guy for punching the dude in the

718
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:02,880
face and I guess the Bruin for
not ducking. I don't know what he,

719
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:04,800
I don't know what,
we got two minutes for not ducking

720
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,260
for allowing yourself to be punched in
the face. I have no, so it was also,

721
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:11,950
I was like, all right, that's what he's
going to do. What I saw that I was like,

722
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:13,870
okay, this ref is like, it's
going to be even strength.

723
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,240
I'm not going to be a part
of this horse shit. Okay.

724
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,830
I don't know why he
punched him in the face.

725
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:20,560
Maybe some other shit happened right
before that. And this is retaliation.

726
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,660
I don't have time for you
fucking bullshit children.

727
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,660
You're both sitting down and it's going
to be even strength and no one's going

728
00:42:25,661 --> 00:42:28,240
to know my fucking name at the end of
this, but that's not how it went down.

729
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,040
Cause then in the fucking overtime,

730
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,340
a lot of what comes in fucking
smash is us in the face.

731
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,850
Nash punches the guy back in the face
and we get two minutes ago on the power

732
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:40,470
play and the fucking business.
I Dunno,

733
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,530
I'm not even saying that we would have
won the fucking thing, but it's just like,

734
00:42:43,531 --> 00:42:46,710
well what, why do that to me now? I got
to think of that the whole fucking summer.

735
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,020
Can't you just let Ottawa beat us? They
were going to beat us. Maybe they weren't.

736
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:56,670
I don't know. I don't fucking know. But
Jesus Christ, I even thought that last,

737
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,600
that last one. I mean I'm, I'm,

738
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,220
maybe I'm looking at this through fucking
black and gold fucking colored glasses,

739
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:06,030
which of course I am. I'd love to hear
what you think. Even like that fucking,

740
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:07,590
you know,

741
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,940
they want on the power play again on
some ticky tack fucking Horse Shit.

742
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,880
It looked bad, but when you looked
at the fucking, when I did anyways,

743
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,870
let's be honest, when I looked at
the, at the, at the instant replay,

744
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,650
it's like [inaudible] was trying to get
to the guy with the puck who's entering

745
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,190
the offensive zone,
Aka a fucking scoring threat.

746
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:32,150
The fucking Ottawa Guy Turns around,
looks at Pos to knock any,

747
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,740
initiates the contact.

748
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,810
Okay.

749
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,720
Pasta reached out,
grabs the guy and he just sits on his ass.

750
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:43,640
Two minutes for fucking holding fucking
30 seconds later. Hey, enjoy your golfing.

751
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,840
But you know what?

752
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:46,440
Okay,

753
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,290
what do I do? I mean I
actually, I have no fucking,

754
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,240
I don't give a shit about Ottawa at all.

755
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,530
Okay.

756
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,310
I go there. I have a good time. I do
shows they've never done anything to us.

757
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,710
For some reason they decided
to trade shower to us.

758
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:03,100
So thank you for that to God
bless you on your fucking wing.

759
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,460
But now I get this is it, but you
know, something is sad as that was.

760
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:07,923
MMM.

761
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,490
I was equally happy for the New
York Rangers. Not Cause I like,

762
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,900
I don't dislike the ranges. I
actually liked the ranges. Um,

763
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,010
it's one of the few New York
teams that actually kind of, uh,

764
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,650
I I really love actually love the Knicks
and I love the rangers unless the play

765
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:24,830
in us then I don't like,
and it's not really even them.

766
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,070
It's so we always comes down to the fence.
So I was extremely excited that the,

767
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,070
uh,
ranges knocked out the Montreal Canadians.

768
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,080
But of course I can not give a hundred
percent credit to the New York Rangers.

769
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:37,770
Uh,

770
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:42,770
I do have to thank the fans of Montreal
who were in the Montreal forum.

771
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:48,450
The second forum on that fateful night
when you guys absolutely humiliated

772
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:52,470
Patrick Wa to the point he
gave you guys the fingers,

773
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,790
right,

774
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,330
number that then he went over and he
sat on the bench and he looked at your

775
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:00,330
owner and I've read his lips. He
said, listen, you mother Fucker,

776
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,910
I'm never playing for
you. Cons again. Alright,

777
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,130
trade me to whoever the fuck in Nordiques
are now. And that's what happened.

778
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,060
That's exactly what happened.
He called it and then he went on any one,

779
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,650
two more cups, I believe in
96 and in 2001 or was it 2000?

780
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,610
I can't fucking remember. Right.
And the greatest thing ever is mine.

781
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,280
The Montreal Canadiens
never won another cup.

782
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,980
The end. That's it. That's how
the story ends as a right now.

783
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:33,750
Yeah.

784
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,890
That's how it's going to end.

785
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,253
Yeah.

786
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,060
I love it that they're dead.

787
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,510
Can you believe this? I'm literally out.
I root for a franchise. It has six cups,

788
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,660
you know, but we wanted 2011 so that, that
gives me, that gives me rights. You know,

789
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,300
whenever Montreal fans talk about
their fucking all the cups they want,

790
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:56,860
I just started singing glory days.

791
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:58,460
Okay.

792
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,910
That's all I do. It's really obnoxious.
It annoys the shit out of him.

793
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,910
They started wiping the tears away with
that little hanky say up and their front

794
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:07,190
sport coat pockets.
Um,

795
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,400
I was actually talking to Barton and
host of puck off and I was trying to tell

796
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:16,550
him, I was, you know, saying that I was
going to root for Toronto. So, of course,

797
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,200
then they get the old right there, Fred
from fucking the capitals. Um, by the way,

798
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,050
hey bill, who do you think's gonna Win
The cup? I think the penguins repeat.

799
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,960
That's what I think.
That's what I think.

800
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:30,050
I think they're gonna have an
amazing fucking series, um,

801
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:31,700
okay.

802
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,410
Against the, uh, the capitals.

803
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,390
And then they'll probably
face the fucking rangers and,

804
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,740
uh, who they going to face in the
west wealth full. The fuck knows.

805
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:47,560
Now nobody saw that four game
sweep against the Blackhawks.

806
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,100
And I mean,
Noah saw that shit coming

807
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,620
fucking people in Nashville, you
know, they actually have this such,

808
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:59,230
not a hockey fan.
So they actually showed up for game five.

809
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,850
They didn't know how
many games you had to win

810
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,130
at such a cheap joke, but I enjoyed
it. Congratulations to Edmonton.

811
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,691
Who else moved on?

812
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:14,390
Anaheim and I'm fucking kicked the
fuck out of somebody's St Louis Blues.

813
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,380
You know, I guess I've got
a roof for the blues again.

814
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,940
I'll root for the blue save and fucking,
they've never want a cup. And, um,

815
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:27,670
but anyways, I was talking to
Bart, nick, Joey Budnick. And, um,

816
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33,040
a lot of people don't this, um, cause
the maple leafs have not won since 1967.

817
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,690
And I was surprised when I was going
back one day just going down some fucking

818
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,610
hockey history, rabbit hole. And uh,

819
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:44,290
do you know in 1967.

820
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,400
Okay.

821
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,233
Like

822
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,860
if you ask somebody like who
the greatest hockey franchise,

823
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:53,720
the most successful one
of all fucking time,

824
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,640
it would still would have
been the Canadians. Right.

825
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,870
They'd still one the most cups. But a
lot of people don't know this. In 1967,

826
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,050
the fucking maple leafs
were only one cup behind

827
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,030
the Montreal Canadians. They are now 10
cops behind him or something like that.

828
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:12,650
11 cups, I believe.
Yeah. 24 to 13. In 1967,

829
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:17,720
the fucking Toronto Maple leafs
won their 13th Stanley Cup.

830
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:18,690
Okay.

831
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,600
To be within one of
the Montreal Canadians.

832
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:24,180
So that's like Celtics Lakers,

833
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,020
except the maple leafs weren't
lying about any of their titles.

834
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:32,200
They didn't win one and some other fucking
hockey league, you know. And then they,

835
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,180
they called it a Stanley Cup
championship, you know. Anyways,

836
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,710
so they win it in 1967 all right.

837
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:45,660
The Canadians have 14 leaves, have 13
that breathing down their fucking necks.

838
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,010
Okay.

839
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,300
If they went to war,
right,

840
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,880
all of a sudden they're the greatest
fucking franchise of all time.

841
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:52,710
That's how fucking close they were

842
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,150
at. Once again, they aren't,

843
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:02,090
they won the cup in
[inaudible] 67 the end,

844
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,980
and that's the end of that book.
It's fucking unbelievable.

845
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,090
And then the Canadians,
they want it the next two years in a row.

846
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:15,860
68 69 then the bronze one at 70 oh
God. Here we go. This is from memory.

847
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:16,960
There's so much that was fucking nerding.

848
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:21,350
I'm 71 the Canadians went 72 the Bruins,
73 Canadians win.

849
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:26,530
Then the flyers went back to back
in 74 75 and then they fucking had,

850
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,600
the Canadians had a dynasty (767)
077-0870 nine when Larry Robinson beat the

851
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:37,070
shit out of Dave Schultz. You know both
of them rocking the same fucking perm.

852
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,280
Both of them, I believe had
a mustache. I mean it was,

853
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,780
it was 1976 you watch it now.
They looked like a couple of write it up,

854
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,540
hipsters.
But back then that's what men look like.

855
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,220
And he stood up to him and that was it.

856
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,160
That's one of my favorite fucking moments,
by the way. That's as a Bruin fan.

857
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:55,890
I love that fight. You know, just cause
you know, I don't know. I, I've uh,

858
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,460
I just don't like bullies. And I'm
not saying Dave Schultz was a bully.

859
00:49:59,461 --> 00:50:04,220
It's like you're playing fucking hockey
for fuck sakes. Me. We do mean to me,

860
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,780
you know,
but whenever they would call the bullies,

861
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:06,710
so it was just something about it.

862
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:10,190
Like I just saw him pulling people's
hair and shit and I was just like, ah,

863
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,260
you know, who's kidding?
Who? I love Dave Schultz.

864
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,800
But after awhile you win so many fights,
you just start rooting for somebody else

865
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,170
anyways.

866
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:23,600
Then they want an 86 then they won in 93
they want 10 more fucking Stanley cups

867
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:25,820
and just,
they just disappeared over the horizon.

868
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:31,190
It was like when Lance look back at
that guy, you know when you went on,

869
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:34,910
went on to win the Tour de
France like seven fucking times.

870
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,080
I still can't believe they took
those titles away from it. It's so,

871
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,260
it's so fucking ridiculous.

872
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,760
That's one of the dumbest things ever
that whole fucking sport is, is on drugs.

873
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,120
They're all on drugs.
So it was a level playing field.

874
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,890
Okay.
That's it.

875
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,090
I'll tell you right now, if they
all at the same people raised okay,

876
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,160
and they all went clean,
he's going to win it again.

877
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,223
Right?

878
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,270
He's the best guy. If they're
all on drugs, it was even,

879
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:03,963
yeah.

880
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,830
I don't know. That whole thing
fucking annoys me. You know why?

881
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:08,270
Cause everybody fucking shits on the guy.

882
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:10,040
But everybody made all
this money off of them.

883
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,460
You never saw anybody give any of
their fucking money back, did you? Oh,

884
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:14,590
they were so fucking outreach.

885
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,200
Like the fucking cops who run the sport
of cycling didn't realize what the fuck

886
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:22,670
was going on. You know
what I mean? If someone,

887
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,780
if someone you work with,

888
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,780
if you're in a restaurant and somebody
is on fucking heroin at the staff,

889
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,820
you know the people in
the restaurant don't know,

890
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:30,470
but you fucking know
because you work there.

891
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,270
Okay.

892
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,220
They let that guy would seven in a row,

893
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,910
blow up the fucking sport and then they
took it away from and then they all kept

894
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:41,450
their fucking money. That's exactly
what happened as far as I'm concerned.

895
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:43,460
You know, why doesn't Trump go
shoot some missiles at them,

896
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:44,923
you know?

897
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,620
Um, anyways, I didn't, what the fuck
I'm talking about? Let me, let me, uh,

898
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:54,600
let me fucking type in my goddamn
passport. The passport, right password.

899
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,060
All the screen is just so cool.

900
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,980
I never fucking wipe down the screen
fucking animal. I am never doing. I just,

901
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:03,900
I'd rather squint if for some
stupid reason. All right,

902
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:08,880
let's do a couple of questions here. All
right. Big Eyes follow up. Uh, Hi Bill.

903
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:11,190
I listen to your podcast.
When you were going,

904
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,560
when you were googling big eyes and heard,

905
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:16,590
you mentioned the fiasco that occurred,
which you dismissed,

906
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:20,970
assuming that it wasn't the same artists.
Actually there was a fraud involved.

907
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,850
The husband took credit
for the wife's artistry,

908
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,470
which came out after the images were
licensed. Love your podcast. I love you.

909
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,920
Go Fuck Yourself. And by the
way, I am a 62 year old woman.

910
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,730
Oh God bless you sweetheart. Yeah,
I actually looked it up. Yeah,

911
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:38,170
that guy was a fucking creep.
Well we should put a link up to that.

912
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:40,860
It's a crazy story.
Um,

913
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,710
my favorite part of that story was,
uh,

914
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:48,340
I forget there was some big fucking,
you know,

915
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,500
one of those things that like
social lights show up to your nose.

916
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:55,260
People who are just, you know, they
just did famous cause people they go to,

917
00:52:55,261 --> 00:52:59,610
these parties were famous people are
there and evidently only they just have a

918
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:02,870
great conversation.
You know,

919
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,610
they go in there and they talk about
fucking hot air ballooning or just

920
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:07,290
something just, I dunno, they just,

921
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:11,340
people just find them fascinating cause
they can go from subject to subject,

922
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,500
you know, while eating appetizers and
not getting anything between their teeth.

923
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:19,110
They just, I don't know what it
is about fucking rich people.

924
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:24,210
They are fascinating idea to take got so
much fucking money. They just get bored.

925
00:53:24,211 --> 00:53:27,820
Right. And God knows they're not talking
to their wives anymore. You know,

926
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,340
they went out and they got
themselves a mattress that, you know,

927
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:34,540
two different kinds.
Right? Fucking banker.

928
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,580
He probably wants a heated one.
The reptilian content.

929
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,590
So I think, I don't know if it was the
world's fair, I don't know what it was,

930
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:49,390
but they fucking bought, they had all the,
they bought some big, one of those big,

931
00:53:49,391 --> 00:53:53,680
I'd fucking kid paintings and somebody
in the New York Times and one of these

932
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:58,681
fucking papers that all these fucking
social lite cons want that respect.

933
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:04,570
Trashed those drawings saying they're
creepy there hacky. It's awful.

934
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:05,680
It's terrible art.

935
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,190
The what happened was they just became
to main mainstream and people got sick of

936
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:12,100
them and they trashed him and then they
immediately took it down after they

937
00:54:12,101 --> 00:54:15,600
think they commissioned her to
fucking paint the goddamn thing. Um,

938
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:21,220
I mean, what a fucking shame. One
article. It's like, you like that shit.

939
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,210
You like that shit. And then you walk.
Do you commissioned that artists?

940
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:29,320
She told her how much you fucking liked
her and you appreciated her work and one

941
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,180
little fucking article.
What did you do?

942
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,810
All of a sudden you were like a fucking
kid in high school who wasn't strong

943
00:54:34,811 --> 00:54:37,740
enough to say, yeah, I'm friends with
that snot nose kid over there. Right.

944
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:43,200
And stand with them. You know, you did.
They just stepped away and they watched.

945
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:46,240
That lady gets stuffed into a fucking
locker with all God goddamn paintings have

946
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,800
to, what the fuck happened
to her and her husband?

947
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,870
I'll tell you right now that that's
reprehensible. All right. Captain America.

948
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:57,790
Everybody a Billy Bruce Banner.
I don't imagine you're sending,

949
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:01,090
spending your free time reading comic
books. Yeah, I can't get into them.

950
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:04,060
I really like the way
they're drawn though. Um,

951
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,640
and I also like the superheroes
always have like fucking,

952
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,340
they have like the hottest girlfriends.
At least the ones that I read.

953
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,970
Spiderman's girlfriend
was fucking ridiculous.

954
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,460
Jesus Christ, a fucking Teddy's acid legs.
I mean she was, she was fucking amazing.

955
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,890
Beautiful, beautiful God damn woman.
Um, that's why I don't like the movies,

956
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:26,200
you know what I mean?
Cause now nowadays they take,

957
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:30,580
they got to make sure they can't go to
fucking pretty now are also the fatties

958
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:34,360
get fucking upset.
That's an impossible image.

959
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:35,650
I go to the fucking gym.

960
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,680
Do I fucking cry when Brad Pitt
checks his shirt off? Maybe I do,

961
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:47,630
but I don't tweet about it.
All right.

962
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:50,360
I don't imagine you spending your
free time reading comic books, Bill.

963
00:55:50,361 --> 00:55:55,280
But I thought I'd share some news with
you, man. Uh, it was revealed months back.

964
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:56,600
Uh,

965
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,600
the captain America was actually
a Hydrus by all these years.

966
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,300
Hydro is basically the Nazis.

967
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,753
What?

968
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:13,100
All right. It was assumed that they
would write it in that he was actually,

969
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:16,790
he wasn't actually a spy this whole time,
but was pretending to be,

970
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:22,010
well this month they decided to make
it so that captain America is and has

971
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:26,560
always been a bad guy.
The story elements,

972
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,480
they are adding our trash. So it's
not even a cool twist. Oh, I love, oh,

973
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:35,650
is there anything better?
Is there anything better
than the, than the fucking,

974
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:40,060
the pissed off comic book reader with
the direction they've taken the story.

975
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,070
You like dead fucking Dolores, Clayborne,
whatever the fuck her name is, misery,

976
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,720
whatever the hell her name was.

977
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,573
Yeah.

978
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:54,470
I hope.
What else are they supposed to do?

979
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,460
He's been a good guy for 100 fucking
years and I'm gonna tell you right now you

980
00:56:58,461 --> 00:57:01,100
fucking comic, but I'm gonna.
I'm going to read the rest of us.

981
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:05,480
You guys have I, you know, out of
respect. I'll read the last few.

982
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,660
Okay,

983
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,570
sentences here he goes,
I'm not a staunch Republican.

984
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,520
The fuck did my screen go. I'm not a
staunch republican Earl wild southerner.

985
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,690
I'm just a guy who is tired
of this self hating trend.

986
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,190
What's with people are hating tradition
so much that they can't stand a hero.

987
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:26,610
Just being a hero. Oh, I see. You went
a different direction. This is good.

988
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:29,760
Why read it? Okay. I think you'd
like some of the newer comic titles,

989
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:35,040
pictures and words and some good stories
makes for an easy, stimulating read.

990
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:37,470
Just don't read Captain
America. Love you. Love Nia.

991
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:40,110
Congrats on the little weighty.
Thank you,

992
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:46,650
sir. What's your dealing with? The here
is money. That's why they're doing it.

993
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:51,420
They have exhausted every fucking
possible story, storyline.

994
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,800
You know what I mean?
Like,

995
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:56,280
do you remember the Brady bunch when they
had to bring in all of Oliver? Right?

996
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,000
Remember like Weber happy days? Like after
a while, like Ron Howard, g, d they just,

997
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,570
he just left. It's just like there's
nothing left to do with this character.

998
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,473
I'm Outta here.

999
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,040
And also the Fonzi started wearing suits
and he was teaching a mechanic class.

1000
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:12,970
He became a teacher. It's fucking
hooligan, riding a motorcycle.

1001
00:58:12,971 --> 00:58:13,280
Next thing.

1002
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,290
Now he's pulling up in a station wagon
teaching this fucking guy with blonde

1003
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:18,124
hair.

1004
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:19,140
Okay.

1005
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,170
How to fucking to the carburetor. He's
actually helping them with their problems.

1006
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,880
All of a sudden it
became like welcome back.

1007
00:58:23,881 --> 00:58:27,690
Kotter is cause they were out of
ideas that it had run its course.

1008
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,380
And I hate to tell you this, but captain
America has run its fucking course.

1009
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:36,270
All right? They're going to get
themselves out of this. All right?

1010
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,940
Don't do the classic thing that,
you know,

1011
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,730
it wasn't actually the real captain
America, it was fucking somebody else.

1012
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:45,780
But the thing is, dude, um, you are,

1013
00:58:45,781 --> 00:58:47,910
you who you should really blame is,
is Al Gore.

1014
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,720
He's the reason that this is all
going down because as we all know,

1015
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:54,810
Al Gore invented the Internet.
He said it himself,

1016
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,050
he said it himself and he said it again.
All right.

1017
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:01,950
The man invented the Internet
and the Internet, you know,

1018
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,140
gave birth to fucking Napster,

1019
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:09,170
which gave birth to all of these things
where people could watch movies and shit

1020
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:13,320
for free. Right? Napster obviously
was music, but the other shit,

1021
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,660
people go on Pirate Bay,
they just watch all these movies for free.

1022
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,090
So what happened was that killed,

1023
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:19,630
okay,

1024
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,950
the fucking 30 to $70 million movies,
like they just went away.

1025
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:29,010
So then everything became either super
fucking cheap or $100 million Superhero

1026
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:31,810
fucking movie where it's like,
all right,

1027
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,360
we're going to just spend all this
money and people are going to go,

1028
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:38,920
cause they're gonna want to see special
effects in, you know, at the movie screen.

1029
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,060
That's what happens.
So,

1030
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:45,360
and they made 9,000 of
these fucking movies and um,

1031
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,010
there's nowhere else to go with them.

1032
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,890
I think they made a couple of
captain America movies. Didn't,

1033
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,813
I don't fucking know.

1034
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,660
But now what they're going to do is
they're going to set this up that now this

1035
00:59:55,661 --> 01:00:00,490
guy is actually a fucking
Nazi, you know? And uh,

1036
01:00:00,491 --> 01:00:03,160
who was doing all this great stuff
in America? I don't understand.

1037
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:06,070
He was like saving children
while spying on us.

1038
01:00:06,071 --> 01:00:08,650
I don't know that they could somehow
going to try to explain all of that shit.

1039
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,030
I have no idea. But eventually he's
going to fight Batman. All right?

1040
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:17,500
We all know that Batman
has one professional fight
under his belt and he's all

1041
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:20,290
for one, right? He lost a superman.

1042
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,400
So before he gets another
shot at the title,

1043
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:28,030
I think he has to fight somebody else.
Who's he going to fight? You know,

1044
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:31,390
it can't be Lex Luther and
in fucking the octopus guy.

1045
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,480
I mean those guys that played out
all right, they're all punch drunk.

1046
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,990
Spiderman has been fucking them up
for years if they need somebody. Nope.

1047
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,510
So this is the only way to go.
All right?

1048
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:45,820
I would be surprised if Vince McMahon
does not sue them for this storyline

1049
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:50,170
because he did this with Hulk
Hogan like 50 times. You know,

1050
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,700
you knew how Kogan was was you
knew when he was the bad guy.

1051
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:57,370
I love because he would
die this side of his beard.

1052
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,870
He would die that fucking black and
then he would have the fucking blonde

1053
01:01:01,871 --> 01:01:04,870
mustache, which by the way,
I thought looked really cool.

1054
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:08,890
He had a great fucking fool
man show. He still does. Um,

1055
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,590
do you ever see guy go bald
more gracefully than that?

1056
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:15,280
He just kept pushing it back like Richard
Rawlings and every time he did it,

1057
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:17,500
it was a little further back,
you know?

1058
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,590
Then he started wearing
the fucking the scarves.

1059
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:22,170
Okay.

1060
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,830
And always come off in each, I dunno.
Tanned his head up. He looked great.

1061
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:30,870
Then when you say that, how Kogan went
bald very gracefully. What'd you say?

1062
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:32,973
Yeah.

1063
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,150
You don't think so? What's wrong with
you today? I feel like you don't like me.

1064
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,470
Well, I mean, part of being married,
some days you're not going to like me.

1065
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:43,700
I feel like that's one of these days.

1066
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:44,923
No,

1067
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,300
I don't understand how you're
so loud with slippers on.

1068
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,610
She just said, that's why I don't like
you. All right, princess Kate fines.

1069
01:01:56,611 --> 01:01:57,810
Parenting hard.

1070
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,320
Well, I imagine when they try to
play hide and go seek in that castle,

1071
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:09,270
what's going to take forever? Hey Bill,
get a lot of this crap. Kate Middleton,

1072
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,890
a fucking princess did his speech in
which she says she's finds it hard being a

1073
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:18,630
mom. Now I'm sure she has a busy schedule
for Christ's sake. She has servants.

1074
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,330
I, she doesn't even have
nannies. She has servants. She,

1075
01:02:22,331 --> 01:02:25,130
it may have one of the easiest
jobs in the entire world.

1076
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:28,430
She wasn't born to royalty.
She married into it.

1077
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,840
So all she needs to do is not be
a con for the next 50 to 75 years.

1078
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,070
Stay married and she's all set.
Attached is a link to her full speech.

1079
01:02:37,071 --> 01:02:39,680
You can listen to it. Uh,
if you care to listen to it.

1080
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,340
I'm not listening to the shit. She's
trying to promote mental health awareness,

1081
01:02:43,341 --> 01:02:44,061
which is nice.

1082
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:47,840
But did she really need to try to tell
us that she finds parenting difficult?

1083
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,550
Huge fan from Newfoundland,
Canada. Thanks. And don't
forget to go fuck yourself.

1084
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,590
Um, yeah. I mean, you
know, this is the thing,

1085
01:02:57,591 --> 01:03:01,340
when a kid comes into your life,
there's an adjustment period.

1086
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,230
So she was sitting there getting fan by
feathers and all of that shit. Right.

1087
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,750
Having somebody bring
her old Dagwood sandwich.

1088
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,610
Is she sitting on, you know, the
little Louis, the 15th fucking,

1089
01:03:13,611 --> 01:03:18,380
I dunno Ottoman. Is that a word?
Is that a piece of furniture?

1090
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:23,440
It is, isn't it? Or is
that an empire? Um, yeah.

1091
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,360
Then all of a sudden the kids there and
she has to pretend to give a fuck about

1092
01:03:26,361 --> 01:03:30,890
it. You know, I think it just makes
her photo shoots more difficult.

1093
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,180
Okay.

1094
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,100
What did she name her kids?

1095
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:38,280
He probably gave him some old
white guy named Winston. Ebenezer.

1096
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,320
The fucking 19th or some shit.
Um,

1097
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:42,360
yeah,

1098
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,590
the,
I have to be honest with you,

1099
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,700
like that has to be the most boring
fucking life you could ever fucking live.

1100
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:49,160
Okay.

1101
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,510
Being a fucking princess, at least when
you're a prince, you know, you get the,

1102
01:03:52,511 --> 01:03:54,800
he kept fucking guy goes around,
he flies helicopters.

1103
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:57,470
He was in the God damn army.
You know what I mean?

1104
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,320
Yeah.

1105
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,910
Goes out. He does shit right tags
out with the boys. He smoked cigars.

1106
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,130
What do you do as a princess once
you fucking married? You know,

1107
01:04:06,131 --> 01:04:10,540
you broke down on the white horse. She
had your fucking, your wedding, right?

1108
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:13,060
Everybody shows up,
you know,

1109
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:15,730
all the women in the crowd giving you
the evil eye because they wanted to be a

1110
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:18,640
princess. All the haters,
you know, there's,

1111
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:20,710
there's nothing good about that right in,
you know,

1112
01:04:20,711 --> 01:04:24,010
cause it's either going to be haters or
people just sobbing because that dream's

1113
01:04:24,011 --> 01:04:25,090
never going to happen for them.

1114
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:29,530
So it's how he sees people stare and
stare and fucking daggers at you next to

1115
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:31,120
fatties and fucking Weirdos like,
yeah,

1116
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,820
okay.

1117
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:36,790
She's so beautiful.
Um,

1118
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,310
I would think it would
be hard to be a princess.

1119
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,070
These the mind numbingly boring fucking
life that you're going to live, you know,

1120
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:50,080
to the, to the fuck. This is when you know
your board is when you promote a cause,

1121
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,820
you know? Yes. So fucking bored. You
have to go out and help somebody.

1122
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,100
It's so fucking all set is not that.
What of, there's nothing to do.

1123
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,900
You know? There's nothing
you, we got everything you
fucking want. It's, it's, yeah,

1124
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:12,230
the end game over now. What do
you do now? You got to fucking,

1125
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:16,750
you got to go down to some third world
country and start installing plumbing or

1126
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:19,060
some, but he got it. You
have to do something.

1127
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:21,980
Either that or you just fucking,

1128
01:05:21,981 --> 01:05:24,830
you just become like one of
those Dudley Moore characters.

1129
01:05:24,831 --> 01:05:26,560
You just get shit faced every day.

1130
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:28,380
Okay.

1131
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:32,640
That's what I would do. Take
up like archery and shit.
I just be in the backyard,

1132
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:33,960
just fucking shoot stuff,

1133
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,920
walking around with some
fucking ridiculous cognac.

1134
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:42,720
I would be such a piece of Shit,
you know? I really would be. I I,

1135
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,730
if you know it,
can you get written out of the will?

1136
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:49,440
Can you get unfucking prince x
prints or something like that?

1137
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:52,680
Excommunicated from that. I, that's
exactly how I would do, oh my God.

1138
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:56,760
I would have all the fucking sports
packages, I'd go to all the fucking games.

1139
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,730
All right. I wouldn't give
a shit either. I would be,

1140
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,050
I would be fucking ridiculously
blowing the money and like,

1141
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,220
that would be my goal in life.

1142
01:06:05,221 --> 01:06:10,221
Like how overt can I be with the English
Tax Pique People's money that they're

1143
01:06:10,741 --> 01:06:14,580
there? What am I trying to say? The
English taxpayers' money. There you go.

1144
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,850
You ever seen somebody like
dyslexic when they're just talking,

1145
01:06:17,851 --> 01:06:20,280
I'll beat you to think I'm trying to read
this shit. I always flip words around.

1146
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,700
Um, and by all means, all
of you who aren't doctors,

1147
01:06:23,701 --> 01:06:26,760
please diagnose me and tell me what sort
of fish oil and I don't need to take

1148
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:30,120
the cure it. Um, that's what
I would do. I would just like,

1149
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:35,160
my goal would be by the time I'm 42, I
want them to, I could easily do that.

1150
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,230
I could easily do that. I could get x
fucking, you know, you no longer at Duke,

1151
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,043
you know,

1152
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:47,060
Oh, you know what would be great in order
to be great that people would actually

1153
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:50,390
love you. I want to say we're done. Hate
you. The second you walked into a pub,

1154
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:55,620
you have no more security anymore and
you just come walking in. Oh yeah.

1155
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:59,400
Why you really fucked that one
up then yet be like, yeah, I did.

1156
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:03,720
I had a great time though. The fuck was I
supposed to do? I was living in a castle

1157
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,330
you fucking week. You know, that
would be it. The next, you know,

1158
01:07:08,331 --> 01:07:12,290
you sitting in the bleachers right in
the fucking pit at the footy games.

1159
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,780
Just being a regular guy,
getting fucking hammered,

1160
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,360
eating fish and chips and just laughing,

1161
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:22,730
just laughing at how bad you fucked up
your life and all those fucking sad sex.

1162
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:23,564
They'd love you.

1163
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,043
Okay.

1164
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:29,730
Um, anyways, fat yoga
instructor. Hey Billy.

1165
01:07:29,731 --> 01:07:31,120
Read Sec.
Uh,

1166
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:38,070
I don't know why that struck me so
funny. I mean, I see it every day.

1167
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:40,030
You think that that would be an old joke?
Uh,

1168
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:45,040
I work out here in La as a
personal trainer and teach
some yoga classes here and

1169
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,890
there.
Um,

1170
01:07:46,891 --> 01:07:50,520
I've been teaching yoga at this studio
for over four years and I got this fat

1171
01:07:50,521 --> 01:07:54,330
ass cunt for a manager bill.
She's gotta be 80 pounds overweight.

1172
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:57,180
And despite being around
all this healthy lifestyle,

1173
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:01,530
she has done nothing to improve herself.
I'm talking donuts and cookies in this.

1174
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:05,460
I fucking love this person. Oh my
God. I love both of these people.

1175
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:07,800
I love that you're calling her
out for being fat or him out.

1176
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,160
And I love that this person sit there
fucking eating donuts in a yoga,

1177
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,490
a yoga shop. What do you
call it? Studio a studio.

1178
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,160
A dojo crib.
Uh,

1179
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:22,120
I'm talking donuts and cookies in the
studio lobby around people that are there

1180
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:25,780
to avoid these temptations.
That's fucking hilarious.

1181
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,260
Anyways,
I've kept my mouth shut for years,

1182
01:08:29,261 --> 01:08:34,261
but recently we had our annual class
review with a manager comes and sees how,

1183
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,520
how you class,

1184
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:40,990
how your class is put together
and how you are with the students,

1185
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:45,490
et Cetera. Uh, this whale could even
get through the first 15 minutes.

1186
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:50,350
She was beached on her mat. Belly
was beached on a mat, belly up,

1187
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:55,120
gulping fucking water. Oh, she went
into, yeah, she went into a whale post.

1188
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:58,900
Okay.

1189
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,890
Then afterwards she had the nerve
to criticize my class that it wasn't

1190
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:07,300
challenging enough. Oh my God.
And you didn't say anything.

1191
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:13,690
Okay. This is their reason. The grudge is
being held. Okay. The, the, it should say,

1192
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:17,560
the reason, the reason the grudge
is being held is that my aunt,

1193
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:20,920
my annual raise was a mere 30 cents.

1194
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,580
And I wonder if that
criticism affected it.

1195
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,200
Give me that Billy Berg philosophy on the,
the situation.

1196
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:32,750
Love the pod podcast.
Congratulations on the baby.

1197
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:37,540
It was great hearing her on the podcast
the other day. Uh, go fuck yourself.

1198
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,180
Fire Nips.
Um,

1199
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:43,720
Jesus Christ really coming at me with
the fucking red head shit today. Are you?

1200
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:48,640
Um, I, I think the whole
thing is fucking hilarious.

1201
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,280
Um, I gotta ask you something. All right?

1202
01:09:51,281 --> 01:09:55,370
You've been doing this shit
there for over four years or you,

1203
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:59,860
why don't you eventually start
your own Spec at this point?

1204
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,810
You know, get out from that. This is
what, you know what I would do if I was,

1205
01:10:04,811 --> 01:10:07,960
you get in a good graces bent,
you know,

1206
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:12,850
just start bringing a donuts.
I bring a fudge, you know,

1207
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,360
and just, you know, I don't
know if the cops could prove it,

1208
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:21,160
but you just killer killer with what
she loves. Kill her with kindness.

1209
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:26,090
Okay. There you go. Kill
her with kindness. Just keep
what she got to do. Okay.

1210
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:29,320
And this is the thing about those fatties
is that they can handle donuts are

1211
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:32,890
right, but I'm telling you right now,
nobody can handle fudge. Fudge is like,

1212
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:35,020
it's like an online,
it's almost 100% sugar.

1213
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,220
It's like a solid form of cotton
candy with like chocolate in it.

1214
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:43,450
I mean it is fucking, you can't even eat
it. Thank you. I hope face puckers up.

1215
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,760
This is what you do. You come
in, you make a tray of fudge,

1216
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,350
all right? You cut a piece
out, this is what you do. Okay.

1217
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,570
He cut a fucking piece out.
All right. And just, you know,

1218
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:59,410
give it to the birds or some shit.
Right? I think sugar is good for them.

1219
01:10:59,411 --> 01:11:01,570
I can't remember it. See good.
Or it kills him either way.

1220
01:11:01,571 --> 01:11:03,010
Just give it to the fucking parts,
right?

1221
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,420
Then you bring the fudge in this and
now it looks like somebody or he took a

1222
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:10,080
piece that she's not going to feel
guilty and I guaran fucking tee.

1223
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:15,560
I guarantee you do in the sugar is going
to fuck with it. Joints. All right?

1224
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:19,940
Then you come in with some
bacon, some sandwiches. You
just keep going. Sugar, salt,

1225
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:22,100
sugar, salt, sugar, salt. Okay. And just,

1226
01:11:22,101 --> 01:11:24,710
you know that 30 cents
they should have given you.

1227
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:28,970
You take 30 another 30 cents out of
your fucking check. Every God damn hour,

1228
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,790
all right? And, and you,

1229
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:34,250
you put it towards giving this
person food that'll slowly kill him.

1230
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,770
There they go.

1231
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:41,120
Or you get a new job.

1232
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,990
I Dunno. I just, I just think killing
her. Be Funny. All right, to Sony,

1233
01:11:46,991 --> 01:11:50,700
your daughter a Billy Bathgate's.
Uh,

1234
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:55,120
would you ever disown your daughter if she
brought home a. Dot, dot, dot. Dot. Dot,

1235
01:11:55,121 --> 01:11:58,840
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,
dot, dot. Dot. Hack comic.

1236
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:05,140
Oh Jesus. Think of the hackiest type of
comic you can think of. And in the future,

1237
01:12:05,141 --> 01:12:09,340
she brought him home talking about how
she loves him and now he's the funniest

1238
01:12:09,341 --> 01:12:12,610
comic ever. Uh, Oh God,

1239
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,780
he's got a youtube channel, tells
jokes with the lampshade on his head.

1240
01:12:16,781 --> 01:12:21,190
It's Cetera. She asks you
what you think of him. Uh,

1241
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:23,920
you tell her is a hack
she gets mad at you,

1242
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:28,450
tells you you don't understand him
and how he's funnier than you. Uh,

1243
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:31,780
would you dishonor her and tell her she
can't bring the hack into what's out now?

1244
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,870
No jokes. Reef. Yeah. Joke thief.
He can't come into the house.

1245
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:40,120
You can't come into my house as
a fucking joke thief. Um, uh,

1246
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:44,290
I, this is what I would do. You know
what? Even even if he stole fucking jokes,

1247
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,470
I know he's going to get caught and
people going to call him out on it.

1248
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,900
I wouldn't say anything Eric.
Cause I'll tell you this, I,

1249
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,130
I've seen how that goes down when you
say you don't like somebody that you kid

1250
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:58,260
likes. You know what I mean? And then
there's all those enlarged problems.

1251
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:03,310
All right, this, this is your job as
a parent is you gotta Trust your kids.

1252
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,700
Decisionmaking all right?
They love the guy.

1253
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:11,950
You just got to go with it, you know what
I mean? And then if they get divorced,

1254
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:15,630
you can't be like, hey, you know,
I, I was, you know, cause then,

1255
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:20,560
but why didn't you fucking say something
cause you'd hate me. Um, Jesus,

1256
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:23,710
why would you bring that up? I'm,
I'm just, I'm three months into this.

1257
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:27,100
I want to enjoy my, my daughter
growing up. Jesus Christ.

1258
01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:30,600
You already got me the picture
of being at the fucking wedding.

1259
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,090
You know, the guy would have some
fucking crazy colored fucking bow tie.

1260
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,860
The cumber bun all. Alright. I don't
know Jesus Christ. What a way to end.

1261
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,810
Um, by the way, uh, how about the Celtics
not coming back when in two games.

1262
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:48,620
How lucky did we get with Rondo
going down? Jesus Christ, by the way,

1263
01:13:48,621 --> 01:13:51,440
he pulled off a short sleeve suit.
I don't know how he did it.

1264
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,180
He actually fucking look cool.

1265
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,420
I think you had to have a cast on to
make it work though. Like he dead.

1266
01:13:59,421 --> 01:14:04,070
He fucked up his thumb assumption. All
Right Patrice, dear Billy, big tits.

1267
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:08,630
Hey, I'm losing weight. You found this
on youtube almost shit myself laughing.

1268
01:14:08,631 --> 01:14:13,130
Thought you'd appreciate
this. Some classic hope you
enjoy and go fuck yourself.

1269
01:14:13,131 --> 01:14:18,010
I will definitely retweet this. Um,
thank you for sending that in. Um,

1270
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:23,120
you know, it's always great that people
are still watching his shit and uh,

1271
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,250
I'm always talking about them and that
type of stuff. It keeps his comedy alive.

1272
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:29,340
I know that's all cliched stuff.
But like I was talking to,

1273
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,620
I was actually talking to Bart,

1274
01:14:31,621 --> 01:14:34,830
Nick and Andrew last night about them and
the green room and I was just talking,

1275
01:14:34,831 --> 01:14:36,660
just saying how,
um,

1276
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,890
just what a fucking just
still like crater comedy.

1277
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:47,780
Fucking crater. What a fucking
lost that was, man. It's just, uh,

1278
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:51,530
that guy was so much,
he was so much better than all of us.

1279
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,170
It was fucking ridiculous.
And um,

1280
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:55,760
okay.

1281
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,570
I'm telling you, even in, even as
great as elephant in the room is,

1282
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:03,590
I'm telling you he's,
he effortlessly cook.

1283
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,940
His next special would've been at least
fucking 30% funnier than that one.

1284
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,250
That's the trajectory
that that guy was on.

1285
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:14,530
And I'm a fucking kills me, man.
Fucking kills me. So anyways,

1286
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:18,190
that's the podcast for this week.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1287
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:22,830
Uh, please check out. Return to
the Mac. The first couple episodes,

1288
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:27,790
it's streaming on something. I don't
fucking know anymore. Um, very funny.

1289
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:31,720
My apologies to John McIntyre
for standing up last week.

1290
01:15:31,721 --> 01:15:33,340
I really fucked that up and he couldn't,
you know,

1291
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,890
it was the worst part and he was
totally cool about it because no one,

1292
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:38,860
no worries brother. Fuck it. Don't worry
about it and all that. That was the worst.

1293
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:42,760
I was like, can you at least be mad at me?
Something? All right, go fuck yourselves.

1294
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:44,140
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
