right to Magnum P.I.

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,500
it was until I did Crowley's podcast back
in the day when I saw the Lamborghini

They just back there.

102

106
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,680
Next thing you know you've stopped at a

107
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,860

That this guy had 17 fuckin TV shows.

109
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,650
Anyways I could really get into
that to be honest with you.

110
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,400
Who's getting who I'm not a mogul.
I'm just fucking lazy and I don't know.

111
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,760
I think there's just two types of people
as they get older there's the person

112
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:47,761
that just you know takes up cycling in
rock climbing and they take like a fuckin

113
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:53,951
glass blown class of some shit you know
and then there's other people being like

114
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,980

115
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,790
You know I like to chill if I get another
forty nine years or whatever I get.

116
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,330
You know I'm on the back nine. Who's
kidding who. Forty nine times two is 98.

117
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,810
I want to make one hundred
staying positive. Who can do.

118
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,870
All right

119
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,100

121
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,990

would just enjoy it if you had that kind

122
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:33,710
of loot if redo an old fucking
beautiful car like that.

123
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,740
You restore it you bring it back to life

accoutrements being the booze there

126
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,560

127
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,583
Drive around

128

Well whatever your driver's name is you
still column James every fucking every

129
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,710
chauffeur was always named that would
be great. You want to go to the movies.

130
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,790
You know I drink too much already man.

131
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,370
There's no way I can handle always
having a designated driver I begin fuckin

132
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,830
steward go into the supermarket.

133
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,040
Speaking of which Billy no fun.

134
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,090
Oh Jesus Jesus Christ was seven days in
seven fucking days and last night he had

135
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:24,140
a couple glasses of wine.
We went out with another couple.

136
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,100
What am I supposed to do.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,230
Everybody you know have an Italian meal
and I suppose I have a little Borroloola.

138
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,430
What am I supposed to eat a couple of
those you know and I don't even fucking

00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:35,264
like mine.

140
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,560
It's just it's just it's always reminding
you of the hangover it's gonna give

141
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:45,440
you. Turns your teeth Grey.
But I actually enjoyed.

142
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,140
That's the one wine that I like.

143
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
I really enjoyed it last night and I was
actually going to order a whiskey but I

144
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,360
always said the referee.

145
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,920
The waiter forgot to come back and asked
me at that point I was just like fuck

146
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:04,921
this I'm just going to stay with the wine
and then tonight my family took me out

147
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:10,681
for Father's Day and they had one whisky
and I oh man I got a fucking good one

148
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,420
right.

149
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,420
I got a really good 28 years old and then
I went outside to return a phone call

150
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:21,650
and I'd set the glass down I came back
and one of my red lines had bumped the

151
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:24,080
table and said they knocked a little bit
out and I didn't think there was that

152
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,640
much and then I looked down there was
this big puddle of it. I was like fuck.

153
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,030
That was 28 years old.

154
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,090
I mean the back of my head I was like
Oh that's good because I'm trying not to

155
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:36,050
drink anyways but I was 28 years
old the shit poured in a glass.

156
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,650
I sipped it and then somebody came by.
Boom hit the table.

157
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,790
And then there was a puddle of it.

158
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,060
He spent 20 years in a fuckin barrel to
be spilt on the floor and then cleaned

159
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:50,660
up with a rag.
That's a travesty.

160
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,470
I felt my liver crack but it was good
because then I had the perfect amount of

161
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:57,350
booze and I was fine.
So I don't know.

162
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,930
I know you guys were in a you know
collecting a little chippy poos there.

163
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,630
You know just five days sober you
know give you a little cookie.

164
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,283
Got you down there.

165
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,410
There's no way even if I was like a full
on fucking algae like I'm in Tripoli of

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,950
alcoholism I never got called up to
the big show I'm basically like Kevin

167
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:24,770
Costner in bull durham except I'm drinking

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,313
that would annoy me.

169
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,600
Going to AA and give me my stupid chip
like that's what I'm like I'm supposed to

170
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:38,750
be fuckin chasing these things I
get too much of a contrarian in me.

171
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,970
That's the new word for cunt by the way.

172
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Yeah I'm a bit of a canary a canary
a contrarian a bit of a contrary.

173
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

174
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,620
You you're you're difficult.
You're a cunt. You know.

175
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,260
Your fucking pain in the ass.

176
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,700
You're the kind of guy off
the fucking jet went down.

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,220
You're the fucking guy you're
the guy that would get us killed.

178
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,520
We'd all be fucking sick
now if we survive. Go ahead.

179
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,310
You know what I say we go over this ridge.
Everybody agree with yeah.

180
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,780
And is why I won't go to turbo this rich.

181
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,140
Well what do you fucking go over
there buddy. Get mauled by a bobcat.

182
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,730
Well wait feet are
slowly dying in the air.

183
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,380
There there's a new nourishment for
the rest of this fucking walk down this

184
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:21,760
snowy god forsaken tundra.

185
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,643
Anyway sorry.

186
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,380
The fuck my topic and so.
So we go to the car show.

187
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,190
None of the fucking restaurants are open
fuck the dads. It's like food trucks.

188
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,680
Nobody gives a you know what's
funny though. I didn't give a shit.

189
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,660
My wife was upset.

190
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,890
Are we don't of these places are open.

191
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,940
She's like you are right with us again.
I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit.

192
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,070
You know I really don't.

193
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,190
I am I am I am the way I'm wired like
a guy I walked around I looked at some

194
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:01,291
shiny cars I'm happy it's hot as shit
let's get back in the car go home.

195
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm fine. Completely fine. Brunch.

196
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,520
That's that's some you shit

197
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,910
turning this whole fucking thing into a
whole day. Yeah. Father's Day lead it.

198
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,830
I had to buy the perfect
Father's Day and then

199
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,760
I say I started my day

200
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,020
with fuckin no fun.

201
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,210
Billy I can wake up now
like super early and

202
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,030
I finally have a little
drum space about 20 ways.

203
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,060
A little a little Jesus Christ came
to tuck a little ways away for like 20

204
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:40,440
minutes away from my house.
I got a little rehearsal studio right.

205
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,633
You can just rent them.

206
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,160
And I got the smallest fucking one I could
buy stretch out I can touch the walls

207
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:49,750
on all sides and I got this little fuckin
that little sonar kit that I bought

208
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:54,751
the martini kit 16 inch based bass drum
which cracks me up because I was playing

209
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,640
that giant Bynum one that had
a 26 inch fuckin bass drum.

210
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,200
And I'm trying to you know.

211
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Just go in a completely
different direction after
all of these goddamn years of

212
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,180
just fucking trying to ape everything
that he did and I just I it just hit me

213
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:19,750
one fucking day I told you what if one
day I just sat there and he said What is

214
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:23,860
this fucking guy came back to life and
he came walking into my house I keep

215
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,190
saying this on the podcast right.

216
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,160
And I was just like hey hey
man John Bonham Holy shit.

217
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,680
I'm a big fan of yours come
in and look at my drum kit.

218
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,520
I had his exact drum kit right
down to the Rogers high hat.

219
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,130
He would have looked that he would have
slowly backed out of the fucking room.

220
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,960
And what was funny is now I'm going down
this whole fucking rabbit hole you know

221
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,790
I'm listening to Pantera and fucking
Primus and Miles Davis figure that one out

222
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,110
listening to all his fucking great
drummers from Philly Joe Tony Williams to

223
00:14:55,781 --> 00:15:00,030
fucking Jack D and I just
listen to these fucking geniuses

224
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,640
and trying to get something else in my
fucking head and through reading up on

225
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:12,710
Tony Williams I went down this fucking
rabbit hole full of I don't know how many

226
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,940
hours on the Internet just trying to
have all these tracks I was listening to

227
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,290
and trying to see if I could.

228
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,940
There's so many tracks where Tony is
just killing it live and they just won't

229
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:24,420
show him.

230
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,420
It's so fucking annoying that we show
showing miles of coal train of fucking

231
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:34,230
nicotine in political train miles of
fuckin was it shorter that he played with.

232
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,350
I don't know if they're
always showing those guys yes.

233
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,820
It's like if everybody else stops
playing they'll finally fucking show him.

234
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,410
It's annoying but you know typical
they never show the drummer.

235
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,510
That's why I love the Romantics.

236
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,320
When I was a kid and what I like about
you came out and I finally got the

237
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:53,154
drummer was singing.

238
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,660
The drummer sang then there would be
on a hotel california with Don Henley.

239
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,520
You'd see the drummer
the whole fuckin time.

240
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,770
Other than that you were shit out of luck.

241
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,550
So anyways I ended up

242
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,400
when you read about Tony that leads
to Billy carbon which leads to fucking

243
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,263
eventually

244
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,290
you know I don't know Vinny called Uta
and Steve Smith and all these fucking

245
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,110
guys and then they start talking about
the guys they listen to and then you go

246
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:22,540
back around again.
It's amazing.

247
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,720
So I end up finding this
quote that really made me

248
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,020
feel good about getting rid
of the drum kit that I did.

249
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,190
Cause sometimes I think I and I always
wanted that Kit and I finally fucking had

250
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:34,610
it.

251
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,250
And then I just always think Yeah and you
sat down and played it and you sounded

252
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:37,760
like you.

253
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,080
So it was too fucking big for you and
you have all these other ideas why don't

254
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:45,570
you go pursue those and I just stumbled
on this quote by Vinnie calling you to

255
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,393
write.

256
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,600
That's actually transcends playing drums
you can apply this to anything he says.

257
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,180
This is what he was trying
to find his own style.

258
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,190
He said I went through periods where
I tried to imitate Tony and Billy.

259
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,630
That's Tony Williams a Billy cop.

260
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,220
He goes by eventually
realized how dangerous it was
basically trying to imitate

261
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:03,740
those guys.

262
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,500
He goes I began to ask
myself what am I saying.

263
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,750
I wasn't saying anything.

264
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,840
It had been said before and
that a reason for being said.

265
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,110
But I didn't have a reason.
I wasn't making a statement.

266
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,370
I was just repeating it like a parrot
by imitating and copying someone else.

267
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,810
A person becomes a parrot.

268
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,170
I saw the trap and I knew as great as
those guys were and still are that I had

269
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:29,530
to find my own voice and
I was like God damn it.

270
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,463
Look at that.

271
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,040
That applies to stand up comedy that
applies to fucking washing cars.

272
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,330
Do you want to be one of the greats.

273
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
You know how many times
can you watch Mr me argue.

274
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:45,330
Do the wax on wax off before you're going
to fucking break out of then come up

275
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,350
with a new way to do it right.

276
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,360
I don't want to tell you I'm just happy
that I got this place so I wake up now

277
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,203
because

278
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,120
you know the way my daughter sleeps she
sleeps in these four hour chunks so she

279
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:05,230
finally falls asleep you know around 2:00
in the morning after she slept for my

280
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,950
you know eight to 12 then she'll be up
for an hour and a half or some shit and

281
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:13,650
then she sleeps till like 7 my wife
feeds her and then she goes back to sleep

282
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,840
again until 10:00. So that window
right there from seven to 10.

283
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,540
Now I've just been jumping in the car
drive 20 minutes down the street nobody's

284
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,180
up there's no musicians over that place
you know they're just getting done doing

285
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:29,740
blow they're going home you know they're
like 8:00 in the fucking morning and I

286
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:34,030
get to play for like a nice solid hour
having the time of my fucking life.

287
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,090
I don't know why I didn't do this for
myself years ago and it never dawned on me

288
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:40,174
to do it.

289
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,720
I was always trying to play him in the
fucking house and trying to find quiet

290
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,680
ways to do it because he was kidding.

291
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,950
Drums are fucking annoying other
unless you're the person playing him.

292
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,580
So I finally got this place and um I'm
beyond psych so we'll see we'll see what

293
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:59,620
this little kid leaves to me

294
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,390
but I know whatever I'm just
saying it was a great Father's Day.

295
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,420
So we went out tonight and then got
a nice framed picture of me hold my

296
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,840
beautiful daughter and I could not be
having my arms around her anymore and she

297
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:19,310
looks content is how it was an instant
classic of kissing her on the cheek and I

298
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:22,190
got it framed and looking at right now
sitting on my desk I'm fucking psyched.

299
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,480
So Happy Father's Day Father's
Day to all the fathers out there.

300
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,340
You know if you used to play drums you
want to play him again go get one of

301
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:31,480
those.

302
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Get that fucking that Quest Love little
break beats set go find some fucking

303
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,090
studio space.

304
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,070
Cause you're like one twenty five
twenty bucks a month who gives a fuck

305
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,920
you know go get it go down there bring
your fucking you know or find a studio

306
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,580
space like you know where I used to play
I never used to say they said he wanted

307
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:52,550
but he bugged me down there.

308
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,240
The best place that I
found out here in L.A.

309
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,020
You don't have time to get a drum kit
knowledge shit but if you just want to go

310
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:05,021
play someplace is Cascade studios down
on Santa Monica just east of Highland

311
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,650
it's the shit it's fucking clean the
drunk it's a great and it was the first

312
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:15,370
class place and I went to a bunch of
places that was the best place that I've

313
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:18,110
found so free plug there.
And speaking of that.

314
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,590
Speaking and oh by the way everybody
keeps telling me to watch the fucking

315
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:26,591
Lakers sceptics documentary thing that
they got on ESPN so I have to check that

316
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,970
out but before I do that.

317
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,310
Before I do that if I get fucked up to
get the podcast that podcast I fucked up

318
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,570
the password

319
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,210
you know complex these things have to be
now you know I you know I hate when you

320
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:50,900
fucking put a nice easy one in and then
they just say to you like oh yeah that's

321
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:55,400
not that's not good enough
it's not fucking good enough
it's like well why don't

322
00:20:55,401 --> 00:21:00,040
I determine that why are you acting like
I'm in the Pentagon I don't give a fuck

323
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,963
you know what I mean.

324
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,650
Oh you know it's hilarious too now
I gotta I'm out of my Bonham phase

325
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,870
I still play to some Zeppelin today I'm
like a lady when I was over there but

326
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,810
somebody show me his fucking remember
that car and the song remains the same.

327
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,910
That crazy look and I don't know who
made it forward or some shit that he had

328
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,520
that oh that crazy paintings
and stuff like that.

329
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,810
You know you always wonder what happened
to that shit if somebody bought it and

330
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:32,630
then somebody else bought
it and now it's up for sale.

331
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,330
It's like two hundred and fifty fucking
grand you know he's gonna buy that

332
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,480
thing.
I'm on a Jimmer say.

333
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,973
The Colts.

334
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,540
I think that guy's gonna end up having.

335
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,050
Like the equivalent of
Jay Leno's car collection.

336
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,420
He's gonna have that
with musical artifacts.

337
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,110
I mean the guy's getting to the point
where he can kind of fuck with the Rock

338
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:00,620
and Roll Hall of Fame.
He's got like a prince guitar.

339
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,400
He's got Jerry Garcia's guitar.
They had John Bonham Carr.

340
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,970
I mean that really adds to the collection.

341
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Then you put your fuckin Prince's guitars
and all this Charlie Parker saxophone

342
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:18,140
whatever the fuck else
that guy owns in the back

343
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,510
yes some hookers come over he starts
doing blow whatever the fuck it is he does

344
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:24,640
it make it could be a good time.

345
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,300
No. Anyways let's let's
read some advertising here.

346
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,090
Upside down.

347
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Boy you turn me all right upside there's
a better way round it round your turn.

348
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,460
I mean but without one that's all that's
obscure the key is take the upside down

349
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:48,511
you turn me the dirt upside there's a
better way for you to buy business travel

350
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:54,331
it's called upside down every time you
buy a trip at upside you'll save your

351
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:59,590
company a ton of money and they give you
an amazon gift card worth hundreds of

352
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,424
dollars.

353
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,620
Upsides able to do this because they
bundle your flights and hotel together for

354
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:10,540
one low price bundled saving
bundled prices saves money.

355
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,610
Well what the hell do I still get a gift
card worth hundreds of dollars maybe if

356
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:17,870
you get a bundle and
it's going to save money.

357
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,410
I'm going to come out around 3 and it
all is that he gonna give me to win it

358
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:22,900
back. This is like the
greatest fucking deal ever.

359
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,160
If you're a frequent business traveler
your company saves a ton of money and you

360
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:31,510
could get thousands a year in gift
cards just for buying your air and hotel

361
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,170
together upside.

362
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,780
Plus you still get all your miles if
you're shopping for business travel travel

363
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:40,590

check out upside dot.com.

364
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,020

like business tickets selling it is

365
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:44,854
business class.

366
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,550
It takes just three minutes to see how
much you can save by buying your flights

367
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:50,560
and hotel together for one low price.

368
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,300

a one hundred dollar Amazon gift card

370
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,150
for your first trip. It probably
depends on how much the ticket is.

371
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,880
I would guess that's my name.

372
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,870
Barbie you are to get at least a one
hundred dollar Amazon gift card for free.

373

Save Big on travel and get a big gift
card every trip I love upside dot.com

374
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,060
evidently even though I've
never used it upside dot.com.

375
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,530
Minimum purchase required see site for
complete details I should start fucking

377
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,350
but then I need you know you give me an
amazon card and then I've got to go out

378
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:28,090
and buy shit.

379
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,670
I'm trying to get shit out of my
fucking house I know I did I read it.

380
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,470
I'll give it to somebody else see you
go you buy shit you drown in your own

381
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:39,520
fucking artifacts whatever
the hell it is you're buying.

382
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,390
A black tux everybody black tux.

383
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,460
There's only so many opportunities in
life to wear a tuxedo so when you're big

384
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,590

385
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,540
you don't get married go into a prom.

386
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,240
You somehow know the mayor and he's
fucking got something going on you know.

387
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,120
What else did you wear when you're
on trial. Would be fucking hilarious.

388
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,973
Wear a tuxedo.

389
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,710
It's like he's shown respect and saying

391
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,560
The guy is out of his fucking mind
who is a taxi who wears a tuxedo.

392
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,370

My answer is gonna be No.

I don't give a fuck when anybody asked me.

No I believe no I'm not doing it.

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,720
I'm not fucking doing it. I. I got.

470
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm on the road again.
Boom boom boom boom.

471
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,590
I'm doing the roast of David
or TS this week Thursday.

472
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,310
And you know I've got to
figure out I don't do that.

473
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,900
I'm not saying this guy walk a walk.
But this bubble bobble yada yada yada.

474
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,440
You know those fuckin roast jokes for
summarizing the format of roast jokes is

475
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:01,350
still from the 1950s.
I don't understand why that is.

476
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,780
I have to figure out how to do this shit.

477
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,390
So-and-so is here you know.

478
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,410
Last time I saw I had like dad and a
fucking wagon wheel well I well you know

479
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,890
they still use that except the young guys.

480
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:20,440
Now they all say AIDS and cunt and fuck
and it just it's just so over the top.

481
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,140
You know 9/11 it's always like I gotta
figure out how the fuck to do this and I

482
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:27,550
only have four days to do it.

483
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,960
And of course I'm busy as shit
so I don't know what to do here.

484
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,120
So but this is the last thing if I just
get past this which I will either by

485
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:43,020
doing a good job a mediocre job
or eating my fucking balls on it.

486
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,190
The bottom line is it's over.
You know it's it's a 12 minute spot.

487
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,220
I just have to get if I get past this
fucking roast the rest of I'm gonna eat

488
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,080
the rest of my year.
It's downhill.

489
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,140
Billy no fun is saying no to everything.

490
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,780
What do you what what is it.
I can't make it now.

491
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,710
Can't do it.

492
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,710
Nah nah nah not gonna throw it at me like
that fuckin buzzard way back a little

493
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:14,250
thought but they put up a lowball put him
in that bashful buzzard on Bugs Bunny.

494
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,200
No.
The whole market though.

495
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,930
That's gonna be me.
I have to start fucking doing that because

496
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,180
yeah it's not good. It's just too much
shit. And I am I'm again now with the kid.

497
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,070
I'm fuckin I'm exhausted.

498
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,660
It's 9 22 at night and I was ready
for bed two fucking hours ago.

499
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
It's just my cutie pie doesn't
fall asleep till about 9:00

500
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,380
and you know what's great about no
booze you sleep like a fuckin baby.

501
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:52,000
I mean booze will put you to sleep but
the next morning you wake up and you're

502
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,050
just like you know

503
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,290
you wake up you feel you
should be tied to a chair.

504
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,010
And there's some guy just waiting
for you to come around to continue

505
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:04,550
interrogating you by punching you in
the head and then you realize like now I

506
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:08,150
punched myself in the head
with all those fuckin drinks.

507
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,290
So I'm actually really enjoying it
despite the fact that I drank the last two

508
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,500
nights. I have one tonight and half
of it's spilt on the fucking ground.

509
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,520
All right.
Fucking judge me.

510
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,270
All right I decide. I'm in my own AA
okay. I still earned a chip today.

511
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,330
I just feel like for me having
my own AA is a good thing.

512
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Speaking of for me in reality show stars
you're not going to fucking believe who

513
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:43,140
I think was at that car show today.

514
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,180
We're walking around we're looking at
Dave it's fucking this two to a Cadillac

515
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:51,780
that I swear to God was like it
was like two town cars put together

516
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,600
incredible fucking car.

517
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,710
Gigantic Oh my God I saw this one Jaguar
you know the one that the early that

518
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,320
one of their had in the 60s
with the long fucking Hood

519
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,310
not the one from the 50s that Sinatra
had that one the James Bond era one you

520
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:13,840
know the one and the patched back
open like a fuckin regular door.

521
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,580
This guy showing it off he's got the back
door open and then the hood opens like

522
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:22,510
the reverse way you know
from the windshield out
looks cool as shit and then I

523
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:26,580
look in there he's got like some small
box small block Chevy engine in there

524
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,700
you know I don't know if that's what you
want to fucking do I don't know why you

525
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:35,570
would do that.
Anyways I

526
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,400
walk around looking at those cars and
all of a sudden there's there's these

527
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:44,660
people on like they're giving out awards
to cars and shit and there's these

528
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:49,661
listeners this person on the microphone
going I think that's Caitlyn Jenner I

529
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:55,430
think Caitlyn Jenner's hand I was like
no fucking way I gotta go seek I gotta go

530
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:58,520
see Katie I gotta go see when
by the time we got there.

531
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,080
I'm not even sure if I was
but like has said that Bruce

532
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,780
it gets confusing she sees she
said she's really into cars

533
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,340
so I got confused saying like ah it was
was he not into it and then can that

534
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:17,304
happen.

535
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Do your hobbies change then I know what
she was saying like no he was into him

536
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,620
he's always been into him
and now he's become Caitlyn

537
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,000
days wants it transferred

538
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,510
what's the fucking word you're
supposed to say transitioned

539
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:44,310
helicopter November 1 5 3 Sierra hotel
on with you information Bravo requesting

540
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,640
token transition through transition

541
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,430
to you know being Caitlyn but
the hobbies stay the same.

542
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,000
There you go.

543
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,110
Who would know that I would think
you'd take up some other hobbies right.

544
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,490
Maybe you wouldn't
I got to look this up.

545
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,650
I got to look this up.

546
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,250
This is fucking weird because I know
you take hormones and stuff right.

547
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,690
So does that make it any other shit.

548
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,260
It's fine it's fascinating you know and
you know it's funny is they're going to

549
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,250
keep doing the same way they're doing
the plastic surgery where you know it's

550
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:26,560
gonna keep looking better and better
and better. You know what I mean.

551
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,920
Same way you know everything keeps getting
better and better and better except

552
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,210
for the fucking environment you know.

553
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,150
Oh by the way I did a fuckin benefit the
other night and flea was in the crowd.

554
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,290
I can't fucking believe I didn't give him
a shout out for giving a shit about BS.

555
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:47,420
That was one of the few positive things
I saw about the environment last year

556
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,980
was that fleas somehow got it you know
fleas of the fucking bees are dying off

557
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:58,930
and fleas shows up like a goddamn hero
and it gets into these beekeepers stuff.

558
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,960
He's got the whole suit and everything
I saw this whole article on it.

559
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,980
Any he sees hooking up like a little
like there was like ten thousand of them

560
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:09,590
hanging out in his backyard.
You know.

561
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,030
What's funny is that's one of those
things your neighbors would be annoyed at

562
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:18,780
because they don't understand
photosynthesis I don't
know where that fuckin word

563
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:23,781
came from but I literally I think I I
think I used it correctly this and that

564
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:28,200
when the bees go from flower to flower
and stuff gets on their cute little feet

565
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,880
you know that cute little beefy you know.

566
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,580
And then they pollinate
shit inadvertently.

567
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,700
They're out there running errands
for the queen. Right. The Queen Bee.

568

get put on looking this shit up.

572

Come on man don't do this to me.
Come on internet.

573
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,380
Come on internet can you fucking work
for once in your life you fucking cunt.

574
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,770
Can you believe someone who can't even
get Internet in his whole house is

575
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:17,820
talking about having a chauffeur. I mean

For strategies to change your habits.

578

This has to be I have to be wrong.

579
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,880
You transition to a woman

So Bruce was into it. Now Bruce is
Caitlin Caitlin's like you know.

585
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,100
Good on you Bruce way to get those
fuckin cars because I'm still digging a

586
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,050
that's fucking amazing.

587
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,960
You know I hope someone I
know fucking transitions.

588
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,210
I want to see that whole goddamn thing.

589
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,083
You know

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,380
someone's got it something it's
it's gotta be something all right.

591
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,540
Does your preference a color change if
you'd taken hormones like your fucking

592
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,810
would like the chemicals right.

593
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,220
Is it it fucking amazing how I just
refuse to read about shit and I just

594
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:36,870
continue to ask questions
while answering them.

595
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,130
But this is how I come to conclusions
and then I can somehow legally get on

596
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,700
stage with the microphone
and do a fucking podcast.

597
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,680
I can't imagine how many people who used
to be men and are now women are just

598
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:53,090
slapping their female for head their
transition for head right now listening to

599
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:57,930
me as I'm talking of I apologize to
anybody out there transitioning I don't

600
00:39:57,931 --> 00:39:59,100
fucking mind what I think that

601
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,420
you because she said she's really into
cars doesn't take a night to trip me up

602
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,230
that's all I'm saying.

603
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,380
All right let's read some shit here.
Right.

604
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,250
Mute Math and cold bear
Hey Billy boom bap.

605
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,530
But boom boom back.
Thanks for putting me onto mute math.

606
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,800
Oh my God they're fucking
amazing fucking incredible band.

607
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,500
They've got a brand new album out.

608
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,800
Whatever you could say they got some
brand new shit that you can download

609
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:31,801
through the fucking air and
capture it on your device.

610
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,810
Share it with your friends.
Man

611
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,720
this guy says I've seen the name before
but never listened and they are all caps

612
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,070
fucking dope.

613
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,970
Just bought a ticket to see
them on their tour in September.

614
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,390
Dude you are not going to be disappointed
they are fucking as good as their band.

615
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,350
Their albums are their fucking
incredible life. Fucking incredible band.

616
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,750
And then he said to me.

617
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:01,090
Told me to check out these bands it
says check out Big Data in Portugal.

618
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,850
I don't understand this next
sentence it says the man karma.

619
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,760
I think you might dig them. Is the
man also a band. I'll look it up.

620
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:12,870
All right.

621
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,280
If my internet hasn't shut down after
that last stupid fucking search keep

622
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:21,570
drumming and make Stephen keep drumming
and making Stephen Colbert uncomfortable.

623
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,750
Oh I did the Stephen Colbert
show last Thursday aired Friday.

624
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,940
I wasn't making him uncomfortable. He
enjoyed it. I had a great time with him.

625
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:29,803
He's a.

626
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,230
I met him briefly one time at some
benefit but he's a really good dude it was

627
00:41:34,231 --> 00:41:37,350
fucking amazing to go back and do that
show because that's where Letterman used

628
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:40,710
to tape and it's still
fucking ice cold in there.

629
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,430
It's still roughly like the same setup
and it's just weird because Cobain's desk

630
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,890
is over where the band is and

631
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,800
I talk to him you know
during the break I go out.

632
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,750
I was just crazy being over here.

633
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,680
You know I did stand up on Letterman
like 4 5 times and this is where I always

634
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:08,020
look over and Felicia and Paul Schaefer
Anton Fig all the whole band was over

635
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:13,021
there and now the desk is here and he
said that he asked Letterman where he

636
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:18,430
should put the desk and Letterman said
on the right side saying that he always

637
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:20,840
wanted to sit over there
but Johnny sat over there.

638
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,860
So out of respect he
sat on the other side.

639
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:29,140
That's how much you know the level of
respect that wasn't just amazing story.

640
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,720
The level of respect that Letterman
had for Carson and why wouldn't you.

641
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,800
That guy's the king of it all.

642
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,380
But Letterman was the Carson
of my generation all right.

643
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,210
Phelps versus the shark.

644
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:47,370
Bill I just listened to
your Monday morning your
Thursday afternoon just before

645
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:50,140
Monday podcast and enjoyed your rant.

646
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,470
About the upcoming fight
between McGregor and Mayweather.

647
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,930
It's not wasn't a rant wasn't a rant.

648
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,040
I just was discussing the fucking subject
if I was screaming and yelling ranting

649
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:03,990
and raving that is a fucking rant.

650
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,080
You know I'm going to look up
rant about probably got wrong

651
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:10,300
wrong about you know if you
transition your fucking habits change.

652
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,890
Why the fuck would I be wrong
about this rant definition.

653
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:19,590
Come on. Somehow I got to rant now
what the fuck is that. No rant.

654
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,653
You cunt.

655
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,080
Come on
definition

656
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,390
OK.

657
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,260
Rant definition.

658
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,700
Speak or shout at length
in a wild impassioned way.

659
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,300
Yes.
She was still ranting on the.

660
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:41,830
I don't know.

661
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,160
Well I think this just goes back to me
being from Massachusetts and my ideas of

662
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,830
of yelling and fucking being out of
control are just different than everybody

663
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:55,720
else's. But you go on to say a rant
that finally fine whatever yeah.

664
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,520
I just don't I fucking hate most
about that McGregor Mayweather fight.

665
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,510
Aside from the fact that McGregor
is only going to be allowed to box

666
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,710
that guy is a fucking Swiss Army Knife
to death and they only let him take out

667
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:11,480
the spoiled you know

668
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,730
you fucking annoys the shit out of me
about that fight as I know I'm going to

669
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,564
order it.

670
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,880
I know I'm going to wondering
how do you lay off that.

671
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,180
Once I found out it's going to be 100
bucks I thought it would be like 20 bucks

672
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,880
I thought they were both making a hundred
million I guess Mayweather makes a

673
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,670
hundred million McGregor makes twenty
million for whatever fucking reason.

674
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:31,890
How fucked up is that.

675
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,910
I think the guy that isn't you know if
they were doing the fact that McGregor

676
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:42,680
isn't allowed to do what the fuck you
know we could do which is put Mayweather

677
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:46,100
right on his back and the thing
would be over in 30 fucking seconds.

678
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,470
He should be getting 100 million.

679
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,600
This is a walk in the park for Mayweather.

680
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,050
This is his fuckin strength
and never went the other way.

681
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,860
McGregor was allowed to use all of his
fucking fighting skills then Mayweather

682
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:02,000
should get the hundred million.
This is classic Mayweather.

683
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,200
This guy's a fucking genius.

684
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,710
He's getting it entirely his way and
he's making 80 million dollars more than

685
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:07,570
this other fucking guy.

686
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:13,320
Anyways he goes did you see that Michael
Phelps is going to raise a great white

687
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:18,090
shark for some discovery channel thing.
I fucking refused. That's a joke right.

688
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,100
That has to be a joke.
Do I have to look this up.

689
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,070
I thought you might like that one.
That's.

690
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,850
That is fucking ridiculous.
All right I can look it up.

691
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,050
What. Dude even if the shark
was full I mean that's.

692
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,240
This is like the Mayweather fucking
McGregor fight. This is what he does.

693
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,890
Meet Phelps swims but he also does
other shit he goes to restaurants.

694
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,840
You know what I mean.
He hits a bong every once in a while.

695
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,400
What the fuck does a shark do.

696
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,050
That's all it does. There's no
fucking way. There's no selfies.

697
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,120
Oh my God it came. No. Phelps first shark.

698
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,020
This can't be fuckin real

699
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:00,790
Michael Phelps to race a
great race against a great
white shark in shark weeks.

700
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,240
Phelps first shark.

701
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,010
Jesus Christ of average has been
on the fucking Wheaties box.

702
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,740
Not making enough money doing that.

703
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Michael Phelps isn't done swimming yet
the twenty three time twenty three time

704
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:20,950
Olympic gold medalist this
guy is twenty three gold five.

705
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,170
You know what this guy wants to race
as you know we get. Course he does.

706
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,180
He's done with human beings.

707
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,740
I think a shark is a good tune up
fight when you go into the ocean.

708
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,510
I think that's why I don't know who put
this together. Maybe it was Mayweather.

709
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,150
He said he always picks the
perfect fuckin opponent.

710
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,260
You go in there gets a great
white shark in Artemis there.

711
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,020
They're not known for this speed are they

712
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,670
always dolphins zipping around.

713
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,640
It's always the shit that they have to
fucking catch that's fast rate than the

714
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:56,990
slowest thing gets cut by twenty three
time Olympic gold medalists will compete

715
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:02,050
in the most adrenaline filled race yet
when he swims against a great white shark

716
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,920
for its discovery Channel's Shark Week.
All right so how do I handicap this.

717
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,840
Are they starting in the water is the
shark gonna get up on that fuckin block to

718
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,480
wait for the whistle.
We got a false start.

719
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,273
We got a false

720
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,960
we're having difficulty explaining to the
shark what the fucking whistle is he's

721
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:25,230
just so freaked out that he's out
of his natural atmosphere here

722
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,440
in Phelps first shark great gold verse
great white is what they're calling this

723
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:37,630
the retired athlete will take on
the ocean's most efficient predator

724
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,510
in a competition of speed.
Jesus Christ can you imagine.

725
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,660
Who is Nike putting up the swim
goggles for the fucking shark.

726
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:50,963
All right I guess.

727
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,870
Phelps tweeted something I was able to
do something that I had always wanted to

728
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,120
do.

729
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,720
Being a cage and dive
with great white sharks

730
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,960
you see Mary's got a kid now
give him first birthday party.

731
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,780
Happy Father's Day to him.

732
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,760
What kind of a dad he's got. You know
what. He's got all that gold you know.

733
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,510
You know it's funny.

734
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,980
The dollar the entire U.S. economy
could collapse and he's gonna be fine.

735
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:19,130
He's got twenty three gold medals you
just melt those fucking thing down.

736
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,670
You make a little nickel sized coins
that guy's in subs for the rest of his

737
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:23,504
fucking life.

738
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,790
Phelps great white race isn't
the only shark week special.

739
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,150
He'll be appearing in the
father of one will also.

740
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,190
I don't give a fuck about what he's doing.
I.

741
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,600
Together the trio will dispel myths
and misconceptions and teach Phelps the

742
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:45,340
proper way to get up close and personal
with hammerheads and great whites

743
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,810
OK you know what's funny about
fucking the Discovery Channel.

744
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:56,110
After all these years of being the
champions the absolute champions of mis

745
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:02,290
information about sharks you'd always
watch their things on the sharks

746
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,720
you'd always watch these
things on the sharks and

747
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,450
while you watch the program
they'd always say all this.

748
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,590
You know these things are being hunted
down there aren't misunderstood.

749
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,250
Blah blah blah.

750
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:24,250
But when you watch the fucking advertising
for that week shark week it was

751
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:29,600
always there was like another Jaws
movie was coming out was really bad.

752
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,230
So now I guess they're finally feeling
guilty and maybe some younger people came

753
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:36,210
in on the Discovery Channel
and they've finally done.

754
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,060
Shitting on sharks.

755
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,420
So where they're waiting and they've
been a fucking saltwater pool

756
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,110
if they're in a pool.

757
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:51,940
I like Phelps for the simple fact that I
have a feeling that the sharks gonna go

758
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:55,390
out of its lane and be disqualified and
at the very least the shark can't do

759
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:57,970
that little somersault flip at
the end of the fucking pool.

760
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,760
Jesus Christ is this this is what the
world is the world of sport is becoming I

761
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:08,730
don't know back in the days to have
those fucking fat bald guys strongman

762
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,990
they're always bald right.

763
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,400
Some lifting weights back in the day you
know you went bald there would always

764
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:16,260
be pullin trains with their teeth and shit

765
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,990
all right first time listening hey Bill
first time listening to your podcast.

766
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,600
My husband and I came to L.A. for the
Rose Bowl last year and saw you stand up.

767
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,740
We love it. Thank you.
Thanks for taking so much.

768
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,850
Thanks so much for talking in
detail about jazz and sports.

769
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:39,300
I think this show this think this shows
a lot of respect for your audience.

770
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,540
We like cool shit obviously we like
to stand up don't be afraid to go into

771
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,390
technical details about whatever.
It's interesting.

772
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,330
Any who happy podcasting.
Well all right.

773
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,790
There's two people that are enjoying it.

774
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,460
I think I talked about it a little bit.

775
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,140
I downloaded all of this
fucking Miles Davis shit.

776
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,830
I am like I was a huge
Miles Davis fan like.

777
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,920
In the early 90s and my favorite album
was in a Silent Way and I read his

778
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:12,210
autobiography.
I got like fucking.

779
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,460
I mean I had all his shit on cassette
tapes. I even got like on the corner.

780
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:20,900
Which he talks about in his book how when
Herbie Hancock came out with chameleon

781
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:26,590
like that's what he was trying to do
that head on jazz album but you know he

782
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,590
blamed the record labels saying that
they fucked up the promotion of it

783
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,340
but I got into all of that shit and then

784
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,450
I moved to New York and I
stopped playing drums because

785
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,690
I was living in a walk through
fucking bedroom apartment.

786
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:49,640
I just drums it too goddamn loud I didn't
play for like five six years and then

787
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:52,850
I started back up again.
So I started in 88 and I've been

788
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,830
like a five year break in there so
I've been playing about 19 years.

789
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,420
That is what it is.
I don't what the fuck it is.

790
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:03,770
But anyways Dave Brubeck jazz
stuff here we got more drunk shit.

791
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,040
Dear Billy backbeat not the exact error
you were asking for but Dave Brubeck's

792
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:14,771
band experimented with some crazy time
signatures starting in the early 60s look

793
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,200
for the album The Dave Brubeck
Quartet at Carnegie Hall.

794
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,740
I bought it when I was a music major
in college and it was a borderline

795
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:25,580
spiritual experience.

796
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,800
It's got songs in 11 for
aptly named eleven for.

797
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,640
Wait a minute eleven for now.
How the fuck does that work out.

798
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,820
Eleven for C just count that's when
you count that just up to eleven

799
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,870
all right.

800
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:50,800
So that's just basically it's like playing
three three bars of four and then you

801
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:54,940
just play one bar three four and you
just lop off that last bit right.

802
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,480
Five four take five nine eight.

803
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,400
Blue Rondo Alla Turk.

804
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,170
Not only are the songs great but the
audio quality is impressive for the time

805
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:06,590
period.

806
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,070
Every once in a while you can even hear
Dave or another member of the band blurt

807
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:13,790
out a cool jazzy during a solo.

808
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,690
It really immerses you in the time
period and culture. All right.

809
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,220
You know this is a classic.

810
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,940
I'm going to download this and listen
to this with some really nice headphones

811
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,863
in the dark.

812
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,550
You probably wish that I did some drugs.

813
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:34,460
If you listened to a check out to track
Castilian drums at the four minute mark.

814
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,940
There's a drum solo where he turns the
snare off and does some really cool and

815
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:39,860
creative stuff with his hands
and it sticks on the snare.

816
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,160
If you look at Joe Morello shit where
he's playing with his hands and stuff and

817
00:53:43,161 --> 00:53:48,161
then watch John Bonham playing with his
fucking hands I'm sure he Morello wasn't

818
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,810
the first the only guy to do it but
there's just a couple of things where he's

819
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,300
hit with the back of his hand and shit
and you see Bonham do that but then

820
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:55,134
there's also like.

821
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Like YouTube and all that shit did
not exist when Bonham was coming up so

822
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,830
he was over in England.

823
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,000
The odds of him checking that out and
actually seeing it is so fucking I don't

824
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:14,040
know how people were able to.

825
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,990
You definitely listened
to everything you could.

826
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:21,240
But to actually get to watch all of em
was fucking it's when something something

827
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:24,030
came on the TV you just fucking
sat there and watched it.

828
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,960
There was no hit and pause there's
no all there's gonna be a rerun.

829
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,760
If you missed it you fucking missed it.

830
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,910
Anyways this guy says thanks and go fuck
yourself with that shiny new high head

831
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:37,110
stand. Jesus Christ. All right.

832
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,730
Join in the army.

833
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,900
Hey Nia if you want to come
in there's a question for you.

834

Get your ass in here and do the podcast.
Bye bye.

839
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,360
Where are you.
Oh you're coming.

840
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:16,240
It's hot as hell and you wonder why
I don't open a window. I don't know.

841
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,730
Okay. Can you can you. There's

00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,660
She's a beauty.

845
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,110
Well I can't do a podcast and
hold the kid at the same time.

846

849
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,160
Please don't tip over my computer.

850
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:54,360
Don't tip it over. All
right. This is perilous.

851
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,410
I'm holding her and there's a computer
here. She's gonna knock it over.

852
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,730
She's gonna knock it over.
What's up Kutty pie.

853
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,720
What's up Kutty. All
right. Plug it in there.

854
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,520
Plug it in plug it in and here we go.

855
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:16,490
Ladies and gentlemen coming back to the
podcast I don't need to put the screen.

856
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,540
You don't need put a windscreen
on any of the windows open.

857
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:23,440
Can you grab your beautiful
daughter here please please.

858
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,450
You crazy. I know I know. I know. I know.
All right. Here's a question for you.

859
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,820
How did you pull the map up.
All right. Here's your question.

860
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,573
All right.
You ready.

861
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,430
Dancing wedding.
Hey there billy back freckle

862
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,860
my girlfriend and myself are attending
a wedding for our good friends.

863
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:49,770
Two gay fellas. It's a very
progressive podcast by the way.

864
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,720
That you're doing.
Yes.

865
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,040
Because I already brought up Caitlyn
Jenner and I learned something today when

866
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:01,570
you kind of freak me out when you said
like oh she's really into cars why did I

867
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:02,404
freak you out.

868
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,370
Because I know I had to do the math in
my head was like was Bruce not into cars.

869
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,530
Then I was like No way I've ever read the
Sports Illustrated and Porsches and he

870
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,450
was a pilot and all that shit right.
Mm hmm.

871
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:17,860
Does his pilot's license must transfer
over. You got to change the name.

872
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:22,030
How far out crazy is that then you got
to go down there be like listen I'm this

873
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:27,031
guy now I'm sure it's it's every everyone
knows that Caitlyn Jenner is Brown

874
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:27,340
right.

875
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,560
So if you're not ready
what if you're not famous.

876
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,850
Yeah if you're not famous you probably
got to do that some. Yeah and I do.

877
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,360
I am.
I am good.

878
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,750
You know I'm going to get you for Mother's
Day next year speaking into a mike

879
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:40,584
class.

880
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:41,943
Sorry.

881
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,290
All right.
So here it is.

882
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,470
By the way so I google that when you
transition do your habits change and

883
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:51,304
nothing came up.

884
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,570
So I guess it does.
Okay.

885
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,020
What's the goal you want to take one
little thing would be kind of like oh shit

886
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:58,690
now I'm into this.

887
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,960
If you take him like hormones and stuff
like when some change your favorite

888
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:02,800
color would change.

889
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,260
I don't think so.
It doesn't affects your brain right.

890
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,170
Why aren't you allowed to ask questions
about this shit is be like Oh my God

891
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,790
what are you a fucking Trump supporter.
I'm really excited to go to this wedding.

892
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,480
He's saying OK these two gay guys are
getting married grant to gay fellas as he

893
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:23,670
says. I'm really excited to go minus
the fact that they are dancing fools.

894
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,320
Could they be more stereotypical.

895
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:31,840
My girl and that whole group
will be dancing the night
away. Well it's a wedding.

896
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,773
Yeah.

897
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:39,060
Do you not want to do this.
No I'm just trying to. I'm I.

898
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,570
I shouldn't wait to hear the
question fully. Please proceed.

899
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,600
OK. You seem annoyed at any point you
need to walk out. I'm fine with it OK.

900
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,400
He says meet for me.

901
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,530
Says me for me or me I
just feel he says me.

902
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,620
I'm not a dancer.

903
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,200
Perhaps I shouldn't assume but I'm
assuming that you're no dancer yourself.

904
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,750
Evidently he has not seen Daddy's home.

905
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:04,020
He writes
I'm the worst.

906
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,340
I'm your standard pasty white guy who
doesn't really dance. I don't like it.

907
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:11,160
I don't really understand it.
It's just you don't understand.

908
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,590
Just seems goofy to me.
I totally line up with this guy.

909
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,350
I have an appreciation for your NEW DAY.

910
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,710
You danced at the wedding though you
danced at our wedding all night long.

911
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,763
I was drunk.

912
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,330
My girlfriend has expressed her dislike
with my opinion of dancing after a

913
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:25,164
couple of drinks.

914
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:29,100
Going as far as to tell me
it's a real disappointment.

915
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,640
I know that I don't enjoy dancing.

916
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,900
Oh I love how honest she is.

917
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,960
You know it's a real disappointment
in our four years together have you.

918
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:45,960
But I'm really this really disappointed
and I completely don't respect the fact

919
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:47,550
that you don't like something that I like.

920
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,410
Hey Nia Do you like hockey.

921
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,750
I'll know what I do. Could you
just play along. No I don't.

922
00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:00,300
That's a real disappointment
in our four years together.

923
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,300
We've never really had any sort
of arguments other than that one.

924
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,450
Jesus Christ that's the only thing
you argue about how you're very lucky.

925
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,550
How often do you guys go marry this girl.

926
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,300
He goes I don't try and guilt her
into doing something she doesn't like.

927
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:15,180
So I get a little hot blooded
when she does it to me.

928
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:19,350
How long did she say
we danced to that one.

929
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,610
How blood was it that God gave
a fever of a hundred and three.

930
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,190
Oh baby.
Do you do more than dance right.

931
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,400
That's another white guy doesn't
want to dance. They do more to dance.

932
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:37,020
Can we get out of here the
weekend. Yeah. And Van herpes.

933
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,490
Well what do you think. What
do you think. Oh Ruby pubic.

934
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,080
Ruby Tuesday.

935
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,870
I don't stand my ground.

936
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:49,680
And what do I stand my ground and
what will most definitely become a

937
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:54,660
disagreement when I don't go flail around
like the non dancing whitey that I am

938
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:59,280
or do I sack up and do my best revolted
from Pulp Fiction and go attempt to cut

939
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,950
some rug even though I'll
be miserable the whole time.

940
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:06,980
Best to you your little one and in
season two of efforts for family has been

941
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:10,970
great. Thanks for the content
and go f yourself. All right
all right all right. So.

942
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,960
What do you say. Well as I'm
snorkeling said earlier it's a wedding.

943
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:21,290
So obviously there's gonna be dancing
whether they're gay guys or straight like

944
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:25,250
everybody dances at weddings. Let's
not. I don't know how he expect.

945
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:27,650
Like why would he think that
there wouldn't be dancing.

946
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,520
Maybe that's he had nothing do with the
gay guy. He just says he doesn't want to.

947
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,430
He just doesn't want to dance.
No one.

948
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,050
Can Dance.

949
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,340
Okay.
Oh that thing about me is the way that.

950
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,570
Well.

951
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,000
I don't know.

952
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:52,090
Listen girls that liked to dance like
guys that liked to dance with them.

953
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,790
That's just how it is.
You said the name of a new reality show.

954
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,880
If you don't go in there and do the YMCA
and the electric slide you can at least

955
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,950
do a couple of slow dances.
How about that.

956
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:09,060
Can you guy meet me outside. How about
that. Yes those cash meals at home. That

957
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,410
maybe that can be the compromise.

958
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,050
Listen I'm not going to
go up there YMCA and.

959
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,500
Break good come out.

960
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,770
Doo doo doo. This is not
a career. What's it like.

961
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,410
I don't know I'm saying what I saw.

962
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,070
None of those things would
get a beloved prince.

963
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,640
Do we have Prince at our wedding.

964
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,340
I don't want to stay focused.
Oh yes.

965
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:36,620
I think I think the compromise sir is
that you should give your lady a couple of

966
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:43,730
slow dances and also also.

967
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,150
Wait a minute.
It's one night.

968
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,830
It's not going to kill you to get
up there and like be goofy with her.

969
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:55,030
No one's watching you because I feel
like there's a little bit of you that's

970
01:02:55,031 --> 01:02:58,000
like you don't like to dance because
you feel like you can't dance.

971
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,910
Nobody's looking at you.
Nobody's judging you.

972
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,920
It's one night out of your life.

973
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:07,330
Just be silly have fun with it and
definitely slow dance with her.

974
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,090
She'll really appreciate.
This is one of those times where.

975
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,620
Even though you don't like doing something
you do it for the person that you

976
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:16,950
love.
This is what it is my suggestion.

977
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:21,100
You're not going out dancing every single
Saturday would you. But with a wedding.

978
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:26,590
You said I'm a little distracted so I'm
sorry I can't put my mouth like you know

979
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:31,740
you want me to blow the damn microphone
not what you can do is Hello.

980
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:40,030
I'm thinking car. OK. I'll do
that. You're blowing the thing up.

981
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,870
I just this is what he should do.
He should go go there.

982
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:49,860
And have five quick drinks five five get
fucking hammered and then just go out

983
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:55,780
there and then just that's it.
You blackout drunk.

984
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:59,890
I don't think that doesn't get around
like a fish out of water. Yeah I don't.

985
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:00,803
Next day.

986
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,660
I don't know when you're hung over and
you're laying there and she's giving you

987
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:07,420
looks you just look at her and your best
Clint Eastwood voice and you just feel

988
01:04:07,421 --> 01:04:08,440
like it was your idea.

989
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,860
You want me to dance.

990
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,220
These are the rules that would just sell
it say listen I'm going to dance my ass

991
01:04:15,221 --> 01:04:16,720
off that night OK.

992
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,560
And I want you know how stupid I'm
going to feel I'm doing this for you.

993
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:23,980
However these are the rules.
You line up five shots.

994
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:24,903
I'm doing those

995
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:29,200
like Mr Blonde going through that bank.

996
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:34,540
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam.

997
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:39,850
If you had made me go out on the fucking
dance floor I don't think you should

998
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,380
get a good Mr. Blonde that was all right.

999
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:45,000
I don't think you should be five
shots wasted. I think he should.

1000
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,900
Would you accept three. I would take two
and see how it goes. Are you the worst.

1001
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,630
Three give him three.
This gives us a major anxiety.

1002
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,010
You think of all the stuff you
like to do. Right. Exactly. Yeah.

1003
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:00,390
But I'm just saying well how about
this. Can he at least give her up. How.

1004
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:05,470
Before he gets wasted. Can you just give
her a slow. Because we love slow dances.

1005
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,240
They don't start with the slow dance.

1006
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,380
I know you go out there and it's like
immediately like immediately get down on

1007
01:05:11,381 --> 01:05:13,630
it Get down on it.

1008
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:19,320
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
do the beat it is there was it just by

1009
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,370
doing a neutron dates.

1010
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,260
Someone stole my brand new Chevrolet.
Yeah.

1011
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,300
At that point you've got to be like you
can be like fuck yeah you got to be.

1012
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:39,540
You got to be five shots it it's one
night out of your life do it because your

1013
01:05:39,941 --> 01:05:44,941
lover chose and say I this
is my dancing for the year.

1014
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,440
I loving you more night.

1015
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,220
He's gotta be shitfaced.
Can you just let the guy get drunk.

1016
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:59,410
I don't say this a lot. I don't says
Love is a white thing. What do you mean.

1017
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,580
We don't do we don't dance the
way people dance all the time.

1018
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:08,620
Fred Astaire. We did do it
professionally we just don't do it. I.

1019
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:14,920
Read that one of those people on Dancing
With the Stars. That's it. I don't know.

1020
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,260
All right here's another one for a
girl at jujitsu. A Billy bollocks.

1021
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:26,910
So my dilemma is I'm 18 and I've
Oh my it's hot is friggin hell.

1022
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:32,140
And when I enter the AC on. Because
what am I spot. I'll hit pause. Hang on.

1023
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,360
All right. I'm back. Here we go.

1024
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:38,260
So my dilemma is I'm 18 and I've just
finished the first my first year of

1025
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:40,570
college a few months ago and
I've been hit in the gym.

1026
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,680
Good for you as much as possible. Good
for you. And I've been going to jujitsu.

1027
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:49,740
You're crushing it for the past couple
of months anyway first day going there I

1028
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:54,460
noticed a girl in the beginner's class
with me and thought she was hot and she's

1029
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:55,630
doing jujitsu.

1030
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:59,470
This is this is nothing
but a great stuff so far.

1031
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:04,150
So after a couple of weeks I work up
the nerve to talk to work. Good for you.

1032
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:07,780
Turns out I went to school with a
younger brother something in common.

1033
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,670
This is like all rainbows right now.

1034
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,240
And I was also the youngest in my
years so I think she might be 19 or 20.

1035
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,760
Jesus Christ this is just all aces.

1036
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,450
On my computer screen keeps shutting down.
I don't know any way after training.

1037
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,140
I don't know.

1038
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:29,740
Anyway after training yesterday I
asked her I asked for her snapchat.

1039
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,510
Is that the way millennials as four
digits. No. I never even said digits.

1040
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,600
I'd be like What's your number.
I'll get a call yeah.

1041
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,990
You like my Z Cadbury
cheese Daisy view carnage.

1042
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:44,900
Dude it's a meat market.

1043
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,780
Try not to curse in front of her even
though he's already done it 50 times here.

1044
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,510
I don't know. I don't know. Anyway it's a
trip. And she gave it to me and after I.

1045
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:58,010
Asked her for it I felt like a weight
had been lifted because I've never really

1046
01:07:58,011 --> 01:08:01,350
talked to that many girls let alone
get their Snapchat or whatever.

1047
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:06,430
Good for you because I'm
incredibly reluctant and a
bit scared to talk to them.

1048
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,940
Yeah. Pathetic. I know but I think
this girl's girlfriend material.

1049
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,030
That's not pathetic.
Not just a fuck one time bitch.

1050
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,530
That was pathetic. Yeah. He really
just made a left turn there.

1051
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,030
That statement was pathetic.

1052
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,890
He kind of built himself
up as the oh shucks guy.

1053
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,750
Yeah. And then he now turned around
and said now he's a lady killer.

1054
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:31,970
Yeah well I know what it is
what he's afraid of love.

1055
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:36,410
Whatever. No no we'll see what you just
did. You just turned her off. All right.

1056
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,330
I think I'm solo on this one
so Billy Boy what should I do.

1057
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,790
How should I go about this.
How should I texture.

1058
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,660
Any advice would be appropriate
appreciated. Love the podcast.

1059
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:51,380
Wouldn't mind hearing for the lovely
knee is important too if possible.

1060
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:56,670
Would love for you.
Could you just let a guy be a guy with me.

1061
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,840
That's the equivalent you guys me like.
Well what does he do for a living.

1062
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:04,250
How much does he make or what size
house could I get when I kick him out.

1063
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,200
Is that the equivalent Bill.

1064
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,590
Yes equivalence equivalent as well.
Nobody talks like that.

1065
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,140
At least not in my circle.
Oh sorry.

1066
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,870
Oh my God.
For me I feel I need a twist.

1067
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,950
However your friend's dog would love for
you to not like play a gig in Ireland

1068
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:23,680
sometime. Thanks. Go f yourself too.

1069
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:27,740
I played a gig I played 3 last year I
went from Dublin up to Belfast and at the

1070
01:09:27,741 --> 01:09:32,300
Galway I had an isosceles
triangle of freckled fuckers
I performed two out there.

1071
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,450
Are you trying to be a
bad ass with this whole.

1072
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:37,640
Not a one time bitch fuck type of thing.

1073
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:41,300
Like what what was that. What was that
little statement he threw in there.

1074
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,920
Because that did really turn me off.

1075
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:47,230
Why do you keep latching onto that. This
guy has all kinds of great qualities. 18.

1076
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:52,160
He's he's he's one year into
college. OK. He's hitting the gym.

1077
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,480
He's taking jujitsu.

1078
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:58,340
He saw a beautiful woman he was
smitten by her and he's nervous OK.

1079
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,380
He loves to use this locker room talk.

1080
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,860
I just don't understand why he.

1081
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:08,120
I just don't I don't build a wall around
why it has to be like categorizing

1082
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,130
girls that he doesn't even know.

1083
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:13,260
And so this is like the kind
of bitch you just fuck Woods.

1084
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,670
And this is girlfriend material girl
fuckers. How about your neither.

1085
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,880
How about you're not gonna get laid
and you're an asshole that won't have a

1086
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:21,650
girlfriend. How about
that. How does that feel.

1087
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,840
Meet me outside. How about it.
It gets really bad about me.

1088
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,200
Yeah.
You guys do the same thing.

1089
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,450
We're not talking about what you
guys do and what everybody else does.

1090
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,690
I'm talking about this person
I wrote in this question. OK.

1091
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,810
That's not that's not what
this conversation is about.

1092
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:46,400
You know what everybody I'm a child.
I want her to feel my passion here.

1093
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:51,540
OK. Now I owe her. I'm not. We are.

1094
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,410
We're not discussing what
women do versus what men do.

1095
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:59,210
We're talking about this particular
person who is like oh good for you.

1096
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,480
You got her snapchat also.

1097
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,870
Like Snapchat grow a pair and get her
number if you're really trying to like

1098
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:06,530
come with it.

1099
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:10,220
Like don't be lurking on her snapchat
so you can like jerk off to her like a

1100
01:11:10,221 --> 01:11:13,100
little selfie pics. I mean
with this person. I'm sorry.

1101
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,890
I just you know what. I'm jealous
of this person. You know what.

1102
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:21,340
I don't see that he's working out a
pretty little line that you threw in.

1103
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:25,550
So I married his wife and he feeling
that type of way about it. So.

1104
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,350
All right. Here's my. Well this
is reaction. Here's my advice.

1105
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,900
What was what do you know something on.

1106
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,540
I swear to God if you were a pitcher
right now I'm coming out and before I even

1107
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,100
get to the mound I'm
taking you out of the game.

1108
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,420
I don't even know what that means.

1109
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:41,820
It means you get way too emotional you
lost your control and you're gonna you're

1110
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:42,654
gonna kill somebody

1111
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,080
else's girlfriend material.

1112
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:51,350
Not just a one time you
know a bitch you fuck one.

1113
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:54,440
This guy cannot run from the bullpen.
Quick enough.

1114
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:57,290
You've completely lost your composure.
Hit the showers on this one.

1115
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:59,463
All right.

1116
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,550
How do you know what kind
of person she is. Oh boy.

1117
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:09,160
Because you decided because you projected
what you want your fantasy because

1118
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:12,080
she's not a real person to you right.
She's not a real person.

1119
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:16,640
She's just someone you saw doing jujitsu
and is like Oh my God this is like my

1120
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:20,870
dream girl. Not like those other girls
that you just like tossed to the side.

1121
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,540
You don't even know her
you even care to know her.

1122
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:27,320
You got her snapchat her snapchat really.

1123
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,880
Grow a pair ask for the
number or stay the fuck away.

1124
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:34,310
Don't be lurking online
like some kind of creep.

1125
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:38,300
What is this person's name.
It was from Ireland Colin.

1126
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,253
Mia.

1127
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,250
Does Seamus.

1128
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:57,170
Seamus O'Leary.
No shame this guy has no Seamus.

1129
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,390
Sorry. Sorry. Derek listen. Yes.

1130
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:08,080
Don't you hit. Did she guys have
like oh this guy's husband material.

1131
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:13,660
Yes. Well all right then. So
why did you relax. All right.

1132
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:14,973
Good Lord.

1133
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,380
I did it.
I really got hot.

1134
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:20,540
You got grumpy all right fine.

1135
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:23,690
Yes this is that there
are days I eat your legs.

1136
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,940
This guy you would not
want to be in relationship.

1137
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:30,550
This is a guy that you just like bang
out a few times and don't ever see again.

1138
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:34,880
Yes. What do you mean. You
bang out a few times now.

1139
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:39,700
Right. You're right. Women do the
same thing. It's 100 percent true.

1140
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:43,030
I think it just took 20 minutes to get
there. I don't know it just bugged me.

1141
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,720
Of course it bugged me that I am being
a hypocrite because I've certainly had

1142
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:49,540
those feelings toward certain guys.
So exactly.

1143
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,650
And it's about time I start fucking
admitting that instead of acting like the

1144
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:56,020
world owes you a round of drinks.
Here's a man.

1145
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,920
He's found he's smitten with
this girl. He's afraid. Get out.

1146
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,640
So he just needs a tooth coming in there.
Yes.

1147
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:10,360
Well this is what I would say.
How should you go about this.

1148
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:13,780
You have to do something that's
probably difficult at your age.

1149
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:17,380
And I hate when older people say this
but you gotta figure out a way to be

1150
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:20,650
yourself. You gotta
walk. You've said enough.

1151
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:24,540
And I think you've said it. I'm sorry
Shane. I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1152
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,690
I think you've said enough.

1153
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,820
I think you dumped a whole bunch
of other stuff from other days.

1154
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,630
Was it something I did. I don't know.
But this guy did not deserve that.

1155
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,970
This is an 18 year old.
He just became a man.

1156
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,740
Okay okay.
I overreacted a little.

1157
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,870
He's a colleague go to college and he's
gonna want to defend his family back for

1158
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:48,610
good eats right with his jujitsu.

1159
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,550
I'm just saying if you were my
son I'd be like can you not.

1160
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,890
Can you get off at me.
I'll write them off. Yeah.

1161
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,730
You're a hypocrite you're a hypocrite.

1162
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,850
But what I love about you is
you admit what a pig you are.

1163
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,050
Like the rest of us.

1164
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,340
Jesus Christ could you give
the kid some advice here.

1165
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,590
What was the question.
He got our Snapshot.

1166
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,290
He's nervous. He actually likes
this woman. What does he do.

1167
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,950
He should just be himself just
say listen I got a admit like.

1168
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:19,810
I saw you across the room and I
was a little mini heart attacks.

1169
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:24,070
I really like you. I'd like to take you
out like you do. You gotta go on a stage.

1170
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,460
Just asking. Yeah. You don't have to
just sit there and brood in the corner.

1171
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:31,120
It's right. There's no reason
to feel what you do is you.

1172
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:35,740
You fake with those ones you just gonna
bang somebody actually like you got to

1173
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:40,170
be honest with them or else it's not
going to work. So just yeah okay.

1174
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:44,250
This is getting what I say I want to
go. Okay cool. I think you will get.

1175
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,450
I think you both need a nap. I'm sorry.
Yeah I know. I'm sorry about that.

1176
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,070
It's all right. Hey we all
get it. Whatever his name is.

1177
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,910
Yeah well you know his name is Vinny.
All right.

1178
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,930
Okay.
Dancing at the wedding.

1179
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,560
I already did that girly
jujitsu I already did that.

1180
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,600
Did I answer all the questions.

1181
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:12,630
Oh joining the army joining the army as
you can sail the seven seas in the army.

1182
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:20,200
You can eat some mushy peas in
the Army okay. Joining the army.

1183
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,640
Dear William no fun.

1184
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,470
I'll skip all the ass kissing since you
blow through all your both through on

1185
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:31,090
your reads anyway. All right. I'm a 34
year old married guy former Navy vet.

1186
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,720
Bah bah bah bah who's sick
of feeling like a shit bag.

1187
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,590
I want to do something with my life
and feel like making a difference.

1188
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:42,790
I've kicked around the idea of going
back into the military for a while now.

1189
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,540
And it's shit or get off the pot time

1190
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,870
while you go back into the military.

1191
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,733
34.

1192
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:55,450
Okay I brought this up to my wife in
the past and all she can say is you're

1193
01:16:55,451 --> 01:16:59,890
married and changes the subject.
Some back story on us.

1194
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,880
We've been together for seven
years and married five ish.

1195
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:08,470
We've had our ups and downs
like any couple but I get
sick of being treated like

1196
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:10,420
a child when it comes to my own life.

1197
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:17,100
Anyway I'm just about at the cutoff age
cutoff age wise to go down the path I

1198
01:17:18,461 --> 01:17:21,640
want in life.
I want to be a combat medic.

1199
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,880
Jesus Christ dude.
Good Lord man.

1200
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,950
I mean how much excitement
do you need in your life.

1201
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:31,950
You already served and you want to go
begging with this guy's a friggin hero

1202
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:36,420
here said I'm a determined man who cares
about my family and my family and my

1203
01:17:36,421 --> 01:17:40,470
country. I've done my research
and I have the time to join.

1204
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:45,770
Do the medic training go to
rasp Ranger assessment program.

1205
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,100
You're gonna become an Army Ranger at 34.

1206
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:56,660
Do you guys ever watch that documentary
on Netflix about it just to see if

1207
01:17:57,241 --> 01:18:02,241
you're worthy of going through like the
week long of 10 days or 14 days a hell.

1208
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:07,050
Only thing I remember was they had this
giant like telephone pole that you and

1209
01:18:07,051 --> 01:18:10,350
ten other guys had to hold up
and do curls with it or some shit

1210
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,070
and his people quit.
The rest of you had to hold the thing up.

1211
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,310
I mean I was screaming
in pain watching it.

1212
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:24,420
And if you puked in the pit you had
to get your puke out of the pit.

1213
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:30,530
It was just like just that beginning
thing was more obstacles than I've ever

1214
01:18:31,561 --> 01:18:33,090
faced in my entire life.

1215
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:38,160
You are a driven man.
You're a special kind of person man.

1216
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:43,020
If you can't get special forces right
he says then special operations combat

1217
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:45,870
medic training.
My question is Bill what do I do here.

1218
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,740
Do I risk losing her or
stay here and resent her.

1219
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:54,030
I don't want to do either but I also can't
continue to work myself to death as a

1220
01:18:54,031 --> 01:18:58,140
construction worker making someone
else rich at the cost of my health and

1221
01:18:58,141 --> 01:18:58,760
happiness.

1222
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,360
Dude if you want to be a combat medic
and you're fucking putting drywall in.

1223
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,640
I mean that's gonna be torturing you.

1224
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:10,430
He said I've worked seven twelves for
six months sixty seven days a week 12

1225
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:15,690
hours a day for six goddamn months trying
to save money to go to nursing school

1226
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:20,670
she tells me she booked us on a cruise.
She spent that money on a cruise.

1227
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:23,830
Oh yeah.
Oh boy.

1228
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,370
I don't know what to do
and I need your help.

1229
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:31,400
Thanks in advance for your advice and
thanks for the minute mediocre job on

1230
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:32,910
efforts of family.
Go fuck yourself.

1231
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,273
I deal to

1232
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:39,790
what's going on in your relationship
but as is is a critical lack of

1233
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:40,624
communication.

1234
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:45,800
OK. You're telling her what you want to
do. She's just saying you're married.

1235
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:50,890
Changes the subject you've saved up all
that money to go to nursing school and

1236
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:54,860
either she didn't realize that that
was what it was for and booked you on a

1237
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:57,510
cruise
or

1238
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:02,800
she's one of the most selfish people on
the planet which I don't think you would

1239
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:03,634
have brought that up.

1240
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:08,470
So I think what's going on
here is you're one of these.

1241
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:12,020
You're this guy's guy John Wayne type.

1242
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:16,120
And like most of them you
know people like that.

1243
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:19,690
You ask me how you're doing and
you just say fine. All right.

1244
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,440
Well you need to do
what you got to open up.

1245
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,950
You got to sit down you've got
to say listen we've got to talk.

1246
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:27,430
And you have to sit down and
tell her what you want to do.

1247
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:32,700
Tell her how you feel at work and you
have to communicate and start there and

1248
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:38,050
work your way
to the ranger assessment program.

1249
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,430
That's what you have to do

1250
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:47,690
because other than that
you have a major blow out

1251
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:50,720
argument on the horizon.

1252
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:55,310
And her catchphrase is going to be
where is all of this coming from

1253
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:57,883
you know.

1254
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:05,710
You if you're one of those guys that does
stuff the right way there's a problem.

1255
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:12,680
You can run into where you
have this expectation that
everybody else should also

1256
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:17,841
do things the right way and when they
don't then you get fucking pissed and it's

1257
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,160
all of it builds it is complete.

1258
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:24,610
Like I lead by example and all that shit
you've got to learn how to communicate.

1259
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,280
So yeah I would sit down with her
and I would talk to her. All right.

1260
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:34,160
And good luck with that.
Those are amazing friggin goals.

1261
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,140
I just want to learn how
to play Tommy the cat.

1262
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,400
That's what I want to do
anyways.

1263
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,540
That's the podcast everybody.
I hope you enjoyed it.

1264
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:46,580
By the way I have

1265
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I have a number of friends on that show
I'm dying up here and they're telling me

1266
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,810
that is good as the pilot
was it just keeps getting
better and better and better.

1267
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,470
And there's a zillion shows out there
so they really need people to watch.

1268
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:06,610
The book was fucking incredible I know
Jim Carrey's names attached to it so I

1269
01:22:06,611 --> 01:22:10,270
know it's gonna be great.
I'm gonna watch Episode 2 right now.

1270
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:12,820

1271
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:19,530

with and he's just a friend

1272
01:22:19,661 --> 01:22:21,810
and general is killing it on there.

1273
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,880
I don't know. I hope you guys watch
the show because I'm I'm really

1274
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:33,080
I really I'm really enjoying it I'm
enjoying a family vacation all right.

1275
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:34,070
So what are we gonna do here.

1276
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:39,020
Is there anything else I need to fucking
do anything else that I need to hype

1277
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:41,840
here.
Should I give a shout out.

1278
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:48,010
To anything I already gave a shout
