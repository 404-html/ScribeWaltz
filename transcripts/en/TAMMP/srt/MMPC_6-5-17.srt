1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,880
Okay.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,440
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

3
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:07,670
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, June 5th, 2017.

4
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:12,560
What's going on? How I, yeah, how's
it going? How was your weekend?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,680
Um, it's really not Monday
morning at this point. I mean,

6
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:18,140
it's still my Monday morning.
It's 20 to fucking 11,

7
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:22,220
but by the time I finished this
shit's going to be about noon, noon.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,560
Um,
Saskatoon Thiede the northern lights.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,470
Um,
I just had a fucking amazing weekend.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,270
I want to thank everybody who
came out to cluster fest up in,

11
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:38,510
um, San Francisco. This
new comedy festival.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,120
I was up there SASAC say,
and on a Sunday,

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,860
um, I had like this, I had like
a make a wish weekend was crazy.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,390
I went up there. Um,
let's see. What did I do?

15
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:57,920
I did the two dope Queens
podcast. Then I did, uh,

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,980
I did the comedy jam.
Goddamn comedy jam.

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,050
We playing outside near City Hall,
which I called the fucking state capitol.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,530
Anytime I see a dome, I'm like, that's got
to be the capital of the state. I mean,

19
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:13,940
what, why, why would they spend that much
fucking money making something look that

20
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,830
impressive and all it
is is just city hall.

21
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:19,970
You're telling me the fucking
mayor lives there. Jesus Christ.

22
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:23,300
I'd love to see the governor
governor's above the mayor, right?

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,630
Is that how it works?
It's like meter maid den.

24
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:31,631
It goes mayor than governor and
state representative congressman.

25
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:37,960
Right. And then a senator.
Then the Moto GP level is,

26
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:41,510
you're the fucking, you're
the president, right?

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,610
Who tweets and gets up and storms out
of interviews when he doesn't like the

28
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:50,590
questions. Um, the fuck
is going on with it.

29
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,950
You know, I watched this thing on, uh,

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,140
what's his place of laddy daddy
there Vladimir Putin saying like,

31
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,610
how like anybody who was
like an opponent of his,

32
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:04,810
they stay fucking kill him is
they've had all these weird suicides.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,130
Swan Guy tied himself to a chair and
somehow threw himself into a pool.

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,070
That one right there
is not only,

35
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,620
um,
getting rid of your enemy,

36
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:24,700
but it's also displaying your level of
power because when you're not even trying

37
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:28,420
to hide it like that, oh
yeah. That was a suicide. Um,

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,650
anyways, and then he's like poison
and fucking people and all this shit.

39
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,980
Whenever I watched those shows,

40
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,740
whenever I watch her stories
about people like that,

41
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,430
there was this guy and
he's gotten poisoned twice.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,740
First time he went into a coma for a week
and he was in the hospital for like a

43
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,180
fucking month. Now he walks with a limp
and he went right back to protests and

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,690
you know,
the current regime in Russia.

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,880
And then he fucking, they him
again. He goes to the same hospital.

46
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,220
This time they realized, you know,
with his symptoms going right,

47
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,620
this guy's probably been poisoned against.
They knew something a little better.

48
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,390
So they got them out
like a week to 10 days.

49
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,640
I don't know about you guys the first
time I get poisoned and I, and I live,

50
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,350
I'm going to say to the cause, listen
guys, I'm passing the torch. Okay.

51
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,320
I did my part. I'm going to, uh,

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,380
I'm going to start making
those furry Russian hats.

53
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:27,060
Someone opened a little fucking
kiosk down at the local, um,

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,590
people's mall, whatever
the fuck it is. It's,

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,840
you know what's funny is everybody
thinks Russia is communist, right?

56
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:34,290
Somebody told me that the
other day going like they do,

57
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,460
they haven't been communists for like
fucking 25 years. They're like, over here.

58
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,520
It's like a small group of people
running shit except a, you know,

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,330
rather than tweeting
and walking out on shit,

60
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:47,380
they just kind of poisoned people
that taking it to the next level.

61
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,950
I believe that kids say it's
turnt up. Um, but anyways,

62
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,880
cluster fest,

63
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,950
I just said I went to bed watching that
as I started talking about a comedy

64
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,920
festival and then I go over it talking
about a guy getting poisoned and

65
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:07,590
continuing to do what the fuck ever got
poisoned doing. Stand up. That said,

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm done. I'm done. I would just,

67
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,910
I would send out a tweet, uh, to whom,

68
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,380
whoever poisoned me,
uh,

69
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:20,560
what would you like me to be doing
with my life so I can get on with that

70
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,180
stock stock,
Rome at best buy you got it.

71
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,100
I'll fucking load and unload flatscreen
TVs for the rest of my fucking life to

72
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:34,270
not go into another weeklong coma in
stay in the hospital for a goddamn month.

73
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,540
Knowing that there's people out
there that not only can poison me,

74
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,460
I don't know who the fuck they are.
And when they did it,

75
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,850
it was just sitting there
talking to his wife.

76
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,470
Everything's fine and out
of fucking nowhere he see
you went from feeling all of

77
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:51,370
a sudden you, you know, hey, feel a
little, ah, is it hot in here? Boom.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Right to a coma to fucking 20 minutes
later continues to fight the good fight.

79
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,050
Man, that's amazing. That's
amazing. You know, if there
is an afterlife or whatever,

80
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,500
I feel like that guy's in the
pre-checked TSA line, you know,

81
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,720
just goes right through.
Um,

82
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I saw this little view to video on this
guy who allegedly had a 200 Iq and I

83
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,930
guess the average person has a hundred.
You get up to about one 31 40.

84
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,450
You're a fucking genius.
You know,

85
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:27,451
fucking Tesla had a one 50
fucking Galileo at a one 60.

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Somebody had a one 90 and this guy's
got a 200 so he's allegedly the smartest

87
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:34,780
person on the fucking planet.

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,260
And he lives in the fucking middle of
nowhere on a God damn farm with like a

89
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,820
couple of yaks and some chickens.

90
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,230
And he met some other super
genius woman out of Brooklyn. Um,

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,890
I don't know if you heard them both talk.
I didn't buy it. I didn't buy it for,

92
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,640
I dunno what's his wife
started talking and it's just,

93
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,290
they never really made them
demonstrate how fucking smart he was.

94
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,070
He just was talking
about what he was doing.

95
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,780
He's trying to prove that heaven exists.
So

96
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,680
okay,

97
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,890
right there. That was suspect to me once,
just kind of like going like, all right,

98
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,570
this guy is like the smartest person ever.

99
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:11,640
And he's like a fucking religious freak,

100
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,903
you know?

101
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,070
I don't know.
That's always a,

102
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,810
I haven't found too many smart
people that are like that level

103
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,660
into religion. I have found smart people
into religion, but they're kind of like,

104
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:30,090
hey, this is what I believe. You don't
believe it. I get it buddy. You know,

105
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:30,721
it works for me.

106
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:34,650
So while I have a nice day as opposed
to telling you you're going to fucking

107
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,360
burn forever or some Shit,
I dunno.

108
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,720
Like I was trying to prove the existence
they have. And what about health?

109
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Does that exist?
I don't fucking know.

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,090
Um, I'll, I'll send a, uh, uh, posted.

111
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,600
Is that what I'm supposed to say? I'll
post the fucking clip. Um, anyway,

112
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,800
let me get back to cluster fest. I'm
fucking talking in circles here. Um,

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,570
so yeah. So I landed, I did a private
gig and then I did two broke girls,

114
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:07,220
then I played drums at the God damn comedy
jam outside the fucking Mayor's house

115
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,020
in this giant square.
There was a couple thousand people there.

116
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,770
MMM.

117
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,920
And I forgot to adjust this one symbol.
So I tell him to bring my stick up.

118
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,740
This my dad, like the fucking
crash cymbal. The other drum.

119
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,230
We had the crash cymbal
nick right above it.

120
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,710
And I kept hitting it and that was
mission shit. I was fucking up. But I,

121
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:30,680
I just kept going. It's kind of a learning
experience. Like I fucked up a lot.

122
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:35,000
I thought and uh, by just kept going
and somehow landed on its feet.

123
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,630
And then later on that
night I did a show there.

124
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,680
I don't know how many fucking
people were there. It was freezing.

125
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:44,840
It was the coldest I've ever been
doing standup is it just like outside,

126
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,470
you know, safe for those people
who don't live in San Francisco.

127
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,370
And I've made this mistake because I
took a vacation there a long time ago in

128
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,460
July and I dressed like it was July.
Um,

129
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,020
San Francisco summer I believe is like
end of September to like middle of

130
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,640
October.
It's really quick

131
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,760
and the rest of the time
it is fucking freezing. So,

132
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,290
um, I was in this little
fucking trailer in the back,

133
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,220
which always cracks me up about
this business, you know, you like,

134
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm going to make it someday I'm going
to be a star and you end up in a fucking

135
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,800
trailer park for most of your career.
So I'm in this trailer, right?

136
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,510
Not even a double wide.
I'm fucking sitting there and oh,

137
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,021
by the way,

138
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:31,760
Les Claypool Band played across
the way before I went up.

139
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,590
So I got to hear and then play.
I couldn't see him play,

140
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:37,790
but I got to meet him briefly.
This is my make-a-wish weekend.

141
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,430
I just fucking broke out the double pedal
and I've been trying to play a Tommy

142
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:46,010
the cat and that type of shit,
which I'm failing miserably at.

143
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,710
And here I am meeting the fucking
guy that wrote the God damn song.

144
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,540
He was cool as hell. His
band sounded amazing. Um,

145
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,440
and uh, yeah, so I was standing
there and I did a show, it was me,

146
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,800
Joe de Rosa and Pete Davidson and I was
sitting in the trailer trying to get

147
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:05,430
warm, um, you know,

148
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,070
learning from the east coast going right,

149
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,600
if I'm already cold with
my hoodie and my jacket on,

150
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:13,860
I need to take this shit off and let my
body adjusts. So when I go out there,

151
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,410
when I put the Hoodie and jacket on,
I'll LBR right. That's something, um,

152
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,130
you learn as a kid.

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,150
If you already put all your snow shit on
inside the house and your body adjusts

154
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,160
the temperature in the
house with that shit on,

155
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,860
you going to then go outside and
you're going to be freezing cold.

156
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,380
I don't know how it works.
That's how it works.

157
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:35,130
You gotta take your fucking jacket off.
So I was doing that. And as I'm doing it,

158
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,420
I'm listening to,
to Rosa and he's murdering in like,

159
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:44,150
the laughs he's getting is not opening a
show. Laughs. And he went out there like,

160
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,580
no pun intended, cold. There was
no nothing, no music. I don't even,

161
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,550
what the fuck it was just ladies
and gentleman, Joe Turow zone.

162
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:55,200
He walked out to the parking lot where
the hell we were performing and he was

163
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,420
getting laughs that
we're not open or laughs.

164
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,110
And then he brought up Pete Davidson
and he's fucking killing justice hard.

165
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:06,360
Both of them absolutely murdered.
Whoever was at the show,

166
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,130
I know can back me up on that.
And

167
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,150
then I went out there and it was,
uh,

168
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,720
it was one of the more memorable
shows I've had with like the, uh,

169
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,520
the mayor's house.
There, they had the dome,

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,950
it was all lit up and like this Celtics
Green, which was pretty cool. And um,

171
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,530
where they'd sat everybody,

172
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:29,220
they would like these traffic lights that
would tell him butyl walk or not walk.

173
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,130
And I kept, you know, with seeing the
sign when they were counting down,

174
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,090
whether it was safe to walk across the
alleged traffic that was no longer there.

175
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,990
I kept thinking that was like the end
of my set. It was like fucking me up.

176
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:43,500
And whenever the, the red light came on,
I'm like, is that mean to wrap it up?

177
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,240
I kept it on, it's a fucking
traffic. Like, um, I dunno. Anyways,

178
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,130
so I did that. And then on Sunday, no,
and then I went to a big after party.

179
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:57,110
You got to hang out with Joe.
Rosa big J. Nate Barr got,

180
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,120
see all these fucking guys,
man, just having a great time.

181
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,830
And then the next day I got to
interview Jerry Seinfeld, um,

182
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,100
promoting his, uh, comedians in cars,

183
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,630
getting coffee that's going
to be out on Netflix. And, um,

184
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,770
I can't even tell you how fucking nervous
I was to do that because I was just

185
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,660
like, all right, I was joking in
the interview, we're going like,

186
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,670
I always feel like I'm one dumb comment
away from you just standing up and just

187
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:27,270
walking out of the room and I never see
you again. Like that's the vibe he has.

188
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,480
And as I said that he stood
up and just walked out of the,

189
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,450
starts to walk off the stage.
Um,

190
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,150
I was like really nervous
because I thought that, uh,

191
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,111
I dunno,

192
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:43,680
I just thought he was going to give
really quick short answers and I was just

193
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,680
going to be sitting there like Chris
Farley when he did that sketch,

194
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:51,330
what he you I interviewed a Paul
Mccartney, like minimum. We did Seinfeld.

195
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,940
That was awesome. Like I thought it was
literally going to be that guy. But um,

196
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,550
within two seconds I realized,
Oh wait,

197
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:04,150
this guy did the tonight show
with Johnny Carson. You know,

198
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,900
why wouldn't he come out
here and absolutely fucking
kill it if he just sat here

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
giving me quick answers
to thing would go nowhere.

200
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:14,170
And then he would look bad
with me. Um, it was amazing.

201
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,980
One of the most fun things I've gotten
to do with my career and, um, you know,

202
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,190
before I interviewed them for whatever,
all the,

203
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,610
I had all these fucking questions
like I was going to look at my kid,

204
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,860
never interviewed somebody like that.

205
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,370
So I had all these questions I
was going to ask him, you know,

206
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,780
his favorite car of all time, his
favorite met of all time, you know,

207
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,260
what level dictator would you still
be willing to do a private show for?

208
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,480
You know what I mean?
Um,

209
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,960
and I never even had to look at
them and I asked a few of those.

210
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,370
I think I asked him who
his favorite met was.

211
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:46,030
I forget who said it was someone
from like the 69 series, but, um,

212
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,910
it was probably that guy that
dove caught the ball. Um,

213
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,440
yeah.

214
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,180
But before I went and interviewed them,

215
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:56,080
I was looking up some information about
him just so I would have something.

216
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,080
I was trying to think what the fuck.

217
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:02,081
And I asked this guy that he's not been
asked a million times before and I just

218
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:06,490
happened to see it says Jerry Seinfeld
comments on Kathy Griffin, um,

219
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,340
controversy. And they got to
them, they would just like, Jerry,

220
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:14,030
why do you think about, oh Kathy Griffin,
blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

221
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,040
And he just goes, it's stupid.
Who Cares? That was it.

222
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,150
And I was like, oh my God, is he going
to do that when I interview them?

223
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,480
Is it going to be that quick? Um,
thank God, thank God he didn't. Um,

224
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,520
thank God he didn't. So it
went great. Thank Christ.

225
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,670
And then I,
um,

226
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,260
the interview ended,
um,

227
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,230
I dunno, we would just say, man, that
was a lot of fun. Then went great.

228
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,150
It was awesome.
And then he left and then me and Josh,

229
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,690
Adam Meyers jumped in a car.
It didn't really jump in a car.

230
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:55,840
Cherry jumped in his car cause
he does life. Right. You know,

231
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,440
he gave me some great advice
about being on the road. He said,

232
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,870
when the show's over, you just
goes, go back to the room.

233
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,370
Okay.

234
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,140
He goes,
go back to the room and I go,

235
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,910
you have just want to go out and have a
couple of, he goes, go back to the room,

236
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,400
counts this, nothing,
nothing good is out there.

237
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,730
Just go back to the room and do
you know I already knew that.

238
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,520
Do you know how many times I've learned
that fucking lesson? And he said to me,

239
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:19,821
he goes,

240
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:23,480
if you want to look this good in your
sixties go back to the room and he looks

241
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,314
fucking great.

242
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,700
So I'm going to try to do that.

243
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,160
Okay.

244
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,060
How do you go back to the room?
You don't go back to the room.

245
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:33,260
You have no stories.

246
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,830
I'm going to be in Montreal this weekend.
How do I go back to the room?

247
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,270
One of my favorites to gab eyes
in the fucking world is there.

248
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:46,300
How do I go back to the room?
I'd have to tell you,

249
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:49,050
every time I go back to the room,
um,

250
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,620
I'm hating it right until
I get to the elevator.

251
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,460
And then I go up in the elevator and I
go into the room and I put the TV on.

252
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,860
And the second I get into the bed,
I'm like, oh my God, this is awesome.

253
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,620
This is fucking great. I
don't know why. I just,

254
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,150
you know, I think I finished the
show. I'm wired, I'm excited.

255
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,430
It went well. And then I, you know,

256
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:17,570
I go on the road with friends and
they're always, what do you thank, uh,

257
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,840
maybe go have a couple, two
or tree. And I always say yes.

258
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,510
Okay.

259
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,160
I always say yes. So anyway, so the show
ends. I've learned to go back to the room.

260
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,050
I've also learned to have the
car service right fucking there.

261
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,320
Like Jerry, it was just,
it just, just like his act,

262
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,460
there was no fat on him fucking leaving
the stage, going to the dressing room,

263
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:44,390
getting his shit. And he just walked right
out and I said, I go, yeah, of course.

264
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:47,990
I go look at it. Look, this is how you
do your life. The fucking cars ready.

265
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,060
My guys,
I don't know where the fuck he gives.

266
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:54,990
And he just laughed and he just
got in his car and it was over. So

267
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,840
I usually don't have any sort of a car
service. I usually just walk out. Okay.

268
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:03,590
So the reason why I have a car service
was because I had tickets to go to the

269
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:08,570
game, to the NBA finals. My
make a wish weekend continuous.

270
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,510
So my car guy goes,
yeah, I'm fucking dude.

271
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:19,680
I'm fucking daft to street
and the car garage. And I
go, all right, so right here,

272
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,810
I told him where we were at.
Come to the stage door.

273
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,690
The dude comes to the stage door on foot,

274
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,590
then walk this back to the fucking car

275
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,740
show ended at three 45 to final,
started at five o'clock so I'm like,

276
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:39,300
what the fuck man? So we walked all
the way over to this parking garage,

277
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,580
got in the elevator,
went downstairs and wait.

278
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,350
I'm in the parking garage with the crowd.

279
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,060
It's the most anti show business thing
ever. It's the most anti Elvis left.

280
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:53,200
The fucking building was fucking
pedestrian. It was shameful.

281
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:56,740
I should've had my urine
show business card revoked.

282
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,970
So we get in the car and was sitting in
the traffic with the fucking crowd to

283
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:05,830
get out of the parking garage. Nothing
VIP about a complete fucking moron.

284
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:07,840
I am. So we ended up, uh,

285
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,540
me and Josh were riding in the car over
and which is laughing African dude,

286
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,110
but going to the fucking NBA finals,
finals, I whatever the fuck you saying.

287
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,033
And um,

288
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,000
and we had a couple of cigars and we
said to the guy who turned out to be the

289
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:21,250
greatest driver wherever, we
were like, dude, is it okay if

290
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,520
I don't get the guy in trouble?

291
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,120
He may or may not allegedly
have let us smoke cigar,

292
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,080
the cigar in the back of the car. And, um,

293
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,550
we ended up getting to the finals and uh,

294
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,600
we missed about half of the first quarter
and it's just one of those things like,

295
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:41,920
I can't believe I'm here. And,
um, I love that fucking arena.

296
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:43,480
It's going to be a shame
when they leave it.

297
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,120
I'm going to tell warrior fans right now,
enjoy that arena.

298
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,640
Cause your next arena is
not going to be that loud.

299
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,000
The new ones that never that loud,

300
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:55,830
because they build in all of those
luxury boxes and everything is just so

301
00:17:55,831 --> 00:18:00,640
fucking big and far away from
the court. Um, but anyways,

302
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:05,130
so we go to the game and,
um, we're watching the game
and it's fucking, you know,

303
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,890
it's great through about the first two
and a half quarters and then the worry

304
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,370
just start pulling away.
And I got to tell you,

305
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,800
as a fan of sport and
competition that Kevin Durant,

306
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,250
the allowing Kevin Duran
to go to the warriors was,

307
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,440
that's out of all those things.
Lebron going to Miami, uh,

308
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,730
fucking Kevin Garnett and Ray
Allen going to the Celtics,

309
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,290
Shaq and Phil Jackson go into the Lakers.

310
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,370
This one might be the worst
one because at least like,

311
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,500
like Shaq and, and Phil Jackson,
that was a bad time. But still,

312
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,860
you still had like the Spurs, they
attempt Duncan, David Robinson, you know,

313
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,610
you still had something
to compete with. And, um,

314
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,710
you know,
with the Celtics when we won,

315
00:18:57,711 --> 00:19:00,620
we still the beat the fucking Lakers
and God knows they always had 9 million

316
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:05,621
fucking free agents and even the fucking
heat that first year they lost to the

317
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:09,470
mavericks. But this one, it was just like,

318
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,330
I'm trying to think of an analogy to can
be be like if Matt Magic Johnson join

319
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:16,164
the uh,

320
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,760
the Celtics or Larry Bird join the Lakers
after the 1985 championship when we

321
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:28,250
lost to him in the finals, he just
joined the fucking Lakers. Um,

322
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,930
okay.

323
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,621
I kind of,
yeah,

324
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:33,830
it just felt it felt fucking dirty
when I was watching it going like,

325
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:38,630
this just doesn't feel
good. It's just, I dunno,

326
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,590
I wasn't an NBA final game
and I was actually bored,

327
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,380
which is funny because I,

328
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I thought when I was at home I didn't
know what the warrior fans were chanting

329
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:54,050
when they was saying Warriors, warriors.
I thought they were chanting boring,

330
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,810
boring.

331
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,580
I literally thought that that's what they
were saying because there was so much

332
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,560
look at last years.

333
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:01,940
Okay.

334
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,240
Western conference finals,
that was fucking unbelievable.

335
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,410
That seven game series with the thunder
and the warriors and then you look at

336
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:12,260
last year's NBA final was fucking amazing.

337
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:16,010
Went seven games and was one in
the last second by the Cavaliers.

338
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:20,330
It was incredible basketball.
Incredible level of competition.

339
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,440
Okay.

340
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,273
It was amazing.

341
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,840
Okay.

342
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
And then, I dunno, I don't understand.

343
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:28,370
Well how the Chris Paul
trade was bad for basketball,

344
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:31,100
but Kevin Durant going to the warriors

345
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,050
and then just watching him
puffing their chests out,

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,200
punching it fucking chess and the crowd
going crazy as if they don't realize

347
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:45,000
what they're watching.
Like acting as though like,

348
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,450
yeah man, this year is our
year. Last year you beat us.

349
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:53,110
But you know what? We dug down
deeper now. You didn't, you didn't.

350
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,420
You picked up the best guy that almost
fucking beat you last year and added a t

351
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:01,300
a team. It was like, I don't know.

352
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,700
Every time they get to within three to
five points, what's, I have to tell you,

353
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,940
it's pretty fucking amazing when
you're playing a team didn't,

354
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,220
haven't even lost the game yet.
They've lost one game since February

355
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,050
and they were already
playing like that before.

356
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,340
They had Kevin Durant's so I'm not
trying to rain on people's parade here or

357
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:25,670
anything,
but uh,

358
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,200
I really don't have anything to say
about the game other than I will for me.

359
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,590
I watched sports to watch competition.

360
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,660
I don't watch it to watch a lay up.
Um,

361
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,500
I mean the fact that they have
all of those guys and then,

362
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:47,730
then they can rotate them out and
when they are, Lebron is sitting down,

363
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:50,880
they got another two Lebron's
still out there. It's just fucking,

364
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,440
I dunno, there was a lot, I
dunno, there was a lot of like,

365
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,100
I just couldn't believe I didn't
hear one warrior fan address it.

366
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,470
You know, at some point just kind
of be like, yes, it's kind of a,

367
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,070
okay.

368
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,540
I mean any Celtic fans out there, you
didn't feel like, dude, what the fuck?

369
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,980
That year in 2000 we were like in last
place and then Kevin Mchale is in the

370
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:19,850
front office of the Timberwolves and
trades away. Kevin Garnett for nothing.

371
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,630
A former Celtic does that to the
Timberwolves like that should have been

372
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:27,680
investigated the same way. The power
is salt trade. When, what's his face?

373
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:31,940
Jerry West was in the front
office of the Grizzlies. Yeah.

374
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:35,600
We'll give you power. Go Saul for
his fucking brother who's now good,

375
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:40,040
but he wasn't back then. It's
a horrible fucking trade. Um,

376
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,990
those were bad enough, but I think this
is the worst one ever. Like this is, um,

377
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,630
I'm still holding out.
I have to root for the Cavaliers.

378
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,320
I'm still rooting for the fact
that they can somehow, uh,

379
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,711
you know,

380
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:56,980
obviously they've got to win the next
one most obvious fucking statement ever.

381
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:59,140
But um,
yeah,

382
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,260
I got to tell you from about halfway
through the third coordinate started

383
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:06,740
pulling away and then the Cavaliers
kept fighting back and they,

384
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:09,820
and they just had, it was, it
was ridiculous. It was like,

385
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,500
I don't know,
I just walked out of there going like,

386
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,890
that felt like a fucking regular season
game. I didn't feel like, I dunno.

387
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,013
I Dunno.

388
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,393
Okay.

389
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,340
I don't know how to Fuck Dick.

390
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,560
Somebody explained to me what the
competition, like as a warrior fan,

391
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:35,000
you're going to look at that and just
be like, yeah, man, that feels good.

392
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
And you have to be honest with yourself.

393
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:39,590
Warrior fans weren't you guys bitching it?

394
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:43,130
Lebron when he went to Miami
and he won two down there,

395
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,060
right once saying that's fucking bullshit
and to pile on team now. Now you,

396
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,640
if you were,

397
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
you got to say that about your own
fucking team and I didn't eat that once.

398
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,530
I just saw everybody fucking walking
around thumping their chest like this was

399
00:23:56,531 --> 00:24:01,300
the greatest fucking thing ever.
You know what else is funny too,

400
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,420
I really think is hilarious is when the
little kids come out and they do their

401
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,670
dance routines,
that aggressive hip hop dancing.

402
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:12,610
It's the funniest shit ever to me.
Like what dancing has become.

403
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,430
It's like you're literally sitting
there like a little kid dance.

404
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:18,610
When I was a kid. It was
cute. It was adorable.

405
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,030
Now you just sitting there like this,
does this kid want to fight me? He,

406
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,250
I think his six year old
is squaring off with me.

407
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:33,060
This whole fucking new generation where
everybody's just walking around like

408
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:34,540
they're these gods.

409
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,630
I don't know what the fuck that is about
these fucking Instagram douchebags who

410
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:44,900
are trying to be inspirational people.
Is this show enough that fucking abs like,

411
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,820
like they're trying to help you by
showing off their beauty and their own

412
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:53,500
success and standing in front of
private jets holding up a wad of cash.

413
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,290
I just for the fucking life of me,

414
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,270
I can't understand why that behavior
isn't ridiculed and why it's actually like

415
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:02,230
aspired to.

416
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,590
Okay.

417
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,000
Go out and get yours.

418
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,520
So fuckings get what?

419
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,700
A bunch of fucking shoes. I don't know.
Oh God. I'm just a crabby old man.

420
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,980
I have to tell you.
Um,

421
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
if the Cleveland Cavaliers and somehow
signed a giant free agent at the level of

422
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:29,850
Kevin Durant,

423
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,000
yeah,

424
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,360
then I think this would be probably
the greatest NBA finals ever.

425
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:37,750
Cause it would be like to
hall of fame fucking teams.

426
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,910
Okay.

427
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,010
Going at it with each other.
Um,

428
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,890
okay.

429
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,100
And then even if I, you know,
I always hated that fucking,

430
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,620
you know, I, I hate the super
teams is you can obviously tell,

431
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:56,110
but at least if you have two of them
going at it, then it becomes interesting.

432
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:59,470
Like back in the day
when the, uh, roid it up,

433
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,880
free agent red sox went up against
the roid it up free agent Yankees.

434
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:08,680
I know it was bad for baseball,
but at least there was, I dunno,

435
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,430
there was another write it up,
free agency fucking team out there.

436
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:12,680
This is just like,
um,

437
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,173
okay.

438
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,700
I Dunno,

439
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,260
I just don't understand how you play a
team that has the talent that Lebron has

440
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:23,080
and it's like fucking child's play
because you've got this other,

441
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:27,970
this fucking juggernaut you
just signed in a, I dunno,

442
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,620
it was weird. It was a weird feeling
leaving there. So I think I've, I fucking,

443
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,593
okay.

444
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,060
I Dunno.
I think that was a little too long.

445
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:39,890
It's probably talked about it too long,
but like,

446
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,920
I was so excited to go to the
fucking game and then you just,

447
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,020
it would've been nice if one warrior
fan when like, yeah, you know,

448
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,170
it's kind of bullshit, but uh,
you know, you Brian did in Miami,

449
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:53,690
so does that kind of make
it okay? I mean a, Hey,

450
00:26:53,691 --> 00:26:58,090
do you know that guy touched a kid? So why
can't we touch a kid? Right. It doesn't,

451
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,060
isn't that how it works? Isn't
it? How it works? Yeah, I will.

452
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,050
I was joking with Josh.
I've got two that felt dirty

453
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,660
and then I also have to, to, I absolutely
fucking cannot stand the west coast,

454
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,670
the west coast fucking, um, sports
fan. I just cannot stand them.

455
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:22,320
I did not hear one intelligent thing
yelled during the game. I mean, their,

456
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:26,100
their, their commentary is
different reads of, Oh shit. Yeah.

457
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,260
Okay.

458
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,900
Oh, that's it. Nobody fucking
seems to know what's going on.

459
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,600
There was one guy behind me going on.

460
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,550
I never seen the calves come out with
this lineup. Oh, they're going big.

461
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,810
There was a couple of people,

462
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:40,240
but everybody else was just
fucking mouth breathers.

463
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,730
Just waiting for the ball to go
through the net to be like, oh shit.

464
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,170
They don't want no, no, I'm sorry.
It did meet the fucking blow.

465
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,910
Cheers here. All right. I'm all right.
I'm done fucking whining about that shit,

466
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:57,850
but it is bullshit. It is. I
actually heard, this is what it,

467
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,130
and this is a fucking
west coast sports fan.

468
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,900
I went into the bathroom and somebody
yelled out with two championships going on

469
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:08,320
three and somebody goes two and a half.
We got two and a half.

470
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,700
I don't know if he was saying like they
should've got it called a championship

471
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:15,010
last year or there already
racking this one up.

472
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,450
Okay.

473
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,900
Because they already fucking, we're
going to win game two. I don't know.

474
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,170
I don't fucking know. I
have no, I have no idea.

475
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,920
I hope that that's what
that guy was saying. Um,

476
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,120
do you think I shit on the
whole fucking thing long enough.

477
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,460
I really didn't think it
was going to go that long.

478
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,310
I'm already fucking 28 minutes in.
All right,

479
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:37,450
let's do a little bit of advertising
here. Oh, by the way, uh, rest in peace,

480
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,680
blue apron, blue apron decided not to, uh,

481
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,660
continue advertising with me
because I said, um, you know,

482
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:48,760
when they were reading, I was
reading the copy and since, you know,

483
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,890
when you have fresh ingredients,
food tastes better.

484
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:53,650
And I was like really fresh
and green tastes better.

485
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,850
That's the reason they're claiming
that they, they, they stop, um,

486
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,370
wanting to advertise in the podcast.

487
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,330
Not because six weeks ago I read
that story where they were, you know,

488
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,490
going to farmer's markets, trying
to box out the little man, you know?

489
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,150
I know that's what it was. I know
that they just were like, well,

490
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,400
we can't do it now or he's
going to bring that shit up,

491
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:18,010
that filthy shit that we
allegedly did up again.

492
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,070
So we're just going to wait and we're
going to wait for him to do one fucking

493
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:24,580
read that we don't like and then we're
going to be out. Come on blue apron.

494
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:29,500
How dumb do you think I am? Huh? Stop
going down to farm farmer's markets,

495
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,990
allegedly,
you know,

496
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,790
do you want John Cougar? Mellencamp do
you have to write another fucking song?

497
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,520
Is that, what the hell are you
going after? All right, here's our,

498
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:42,090
here's our old friends. They don't
give a how I read these, these,

499
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,650
I like these guys.
This is all zip

500
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,430
recruiter. Are you hiring? Do you know
where to post your job? Well are Ya,

501
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,680
do you know where to post your
job to find? You know what?

502
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:56,110
I got to start this read over again.
You know what? I was just thinking.

503
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,140
I bet if I turned on ESPN
when you turn on Espn,

504
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,700
you know if and when the
warriors win the championship it,

505
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,220
I bet those fucking guys, they're
not going to address it on any level.

506
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,630
They're going to be like, where
do me gay? Which 60 to know?

507
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,190
Where do you put there? To the pit.
You'd have various team to fall time.

508
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,440
I mean even the 96 balls laws,

509
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,350
two games it you're done.

510
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,950
They're going to do that and they will
never address of fucking ridiculous it is.

511
00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:28,310
And how bad for basketball it was.
That Durant left the thunder

512
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,950
just to fucking go pile
on fucking pile on.

513
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,110
Anyways. All right. All Zip
recruiter. Are you hiring? Yeah.

514
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,540
Is that what you're doing?

515
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,540
Do you know where to post your
job to find the best candidates?

516
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,150
Talk about the challenge of finding great
talent and slash or the importance of

517
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:54,500
finding great talent to succeed
to a successful business.
Oh, I got to tell you,

518
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:57,320
you know, when I walked down the
street with my sandwich board going,

519
00:30:57,321 --> 00:31:00,470
who's talented? You know, it's really
hard and I always think, you know,

520
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:04,520
I wish there was a better way,
you know, because you know,

521
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:07,850
in order to win you got to fucking
have all the best guys on one team.

522
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,850
So they win by 30 every night. Um, dude,

523
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:15,620
you realize to fucking cavalier scored
63 or 64 points in the first half and

524
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,890
they was still down by five. I
mean, what are you going to do?

525
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,990
You score of 64 65 points?
Usually up by 10 or 15

526
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,310
how's zip recruiter is
different with ZipRecruiter?

527
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:31,690
You can post it notes and this is what
the west coast sports fans just going to

528
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,670
say hater.
That's all they got.

529
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,940
I don't know if it's cause they get up
three hours later than people on the east

530
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,430
coast, but they, I know they just
baked their brains in the sun,

531
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,280
but I don't know if fun. I'll
tell you though, rough out here.

532

The fuck are you talking about?
Well,

582
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:50,260
I guess I've forgotten
mining that I booked shows,

583
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,910
not realizing it was my anniversary.

584
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,500
I don't think about my anniversary
tilts coming up anyways. You know the,

585
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,530
those people that are just hard to
shop for, like your wife for your,

586
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,550
your anniversary or your sister for
a birthday. It's still worst thing.

587
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:07,330
Trying to get that perfect

Um, all right. Anyways,
here we go. All right,

619
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,410
let's read some questions
here for this week.

620
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,810
See if I can stop talking about that
fucking golden state thing. Hey, bill,

621
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:05,340
would love if you would find it.
I would love,

622
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,610
I would love it if you would
find it to come back to Sweden.

623
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,400
Malmo gets boring. There's
too few redheads to spend
my money on here. Thank you.

624
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,980
All right. I feel like he was vaguely
trashing me yet. He likes my comedy. Um,

625
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,170
I'm definitely going to be
becoming back to Sweden.

626
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:23,520
Last time I went through Europe,

627
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,260
I didn't do the Scandinavians countries.

628
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:33,060
What are the Scandinavian countries?
People come on? Norway. Sweden.

629
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,640
Denmark.

630
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,720
Okay.

631
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,030
I know there's one other one in there.
It's not Finland.

632
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,830
That's part of the Nordic countries.
That also includes Scandinavia.

633
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,350
I can't remember.
It's been so long since I was there.

634
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,900
I learned that Scandinavia was like
three countries and then those three

635
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,400
countries are part of
the Nordic countries,

636
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:58,360
which included Finland and this
little island just north of uh,

637
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Great Britain. Right. Isn't
it? Something like that.

638
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:05,460
I will definitely be back and I'll have
a brand new hour if few fucking blue

639
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:10,020
eyed blonde haired cats and uh,
we'll have a great time, uh,

640
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,170
from a lovely French lady.

641
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,680
Hey Bill. Uh, hello balls. Your uh,

642
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:23,280
I just wanted to say I just wanted to
send a little message and hopefully have

643
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:28,281
it heard that being a video
video video graph or myself,

644
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:32,460
I immensely appreciate the graphic
work in details and F is for family.

645
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,353
I'll thank you.

646
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Such a great show on so many levels that
it all the best to everyone involved

647
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,300
with bill in general.

648
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,190
And of course bill himself a
French fan fan from Patty. Hey,

649
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,490
guess what?
French lady,

650
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,480
Fam,
Della Francais,

651
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,860
Lady of the France,
uh,

652
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:00,610
of the show is actually that the,

653
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,280
the animators is Gaumont,
which is in France. All right.

654
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,420
And then of course, you know, then they
farm it out to these people. Big Jump in,

655
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:13,900
in Ottawa. That's how it works.
But you guys are part of the mix.

656
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:19,530
And what's great about France is if
you use French animators and animation

657
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:24,460
company is you get, uh, the government
gives a little bit of money.

658
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,850
It makes it cheaper. You know, it's a
smart thing. It's like a Trump thing.

659
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:32,050
They try to bring fucking business,
you know, into their country.

660
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,600
Like Trump says he wants to do as he
walks away from the Paris agreement, um,

661
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,290
it's just a hoax climate
change, not global warming
anymore. It's climate change.

662
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,360
Jets will change in the climate. Um,
I saw some lady on TV going like,

663
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:48,790
you know, I th I think it's good
for this country that we do it.

664
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:52,630
And because we've always been a
leader and um, environmental issues.

665
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,150
Yes, we have been a leader of the fucking
fucking it up the most as far as I can

666
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:03,550
tell, if I'm to believe what
the scientists are saying. Oh,

667
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,020
scientists if their
information. Anyways, um,

668
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,330
by the way, thank you to everybody
that's been watching season two, the, uh,

669
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,380
people have been loving
it and, uh, you know,

670
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:17,850
it's a ton of Goddamn works and
thank God you guys enjoyed it, uh,

671
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,560
or have been enjoying it.
Please tell more people to watch it.

672
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:21,940
The more people you tell the watch it,

673
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,540
hopefully the more fans we get and
then they'll let us do a season three.

674
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,760
Um, you know, and if not,

675
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,860
I'll just have all kinds
of free time in my life.

676
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,910
It's kind of a win win for me,
either white people,

677
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,690
either I get to continue working with
these great people doing this great show

678
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,310
or a, I'm going to become a hell
of a drummer. Um, all right,

679
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,030
well thank you so much and I can't wait
to get back to a France at some point.

680
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,280
Uh, just going to wait till the little
one gets a little bit bigger. Um,

681
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,970
we're actually, um, I want to
do, I was talking to Tinea,

682
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,860
I want to get like some sort
of fucking, uh, you know,

683
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,160
French person over here,
right. That can, you know,

684
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,380
help make my daughter's smart cause
she's got to learn from somebody. I know.

685
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,121
It ain't gonna be me.

686
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,910
And then she feels to teach us in
French and teaches us all French.

687
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:13,480
How great would that be?
My little cutie pie be over in France.

688
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:17,230
Speak being fluent. Huh? I'll
cute. What that be? You know,

689
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:21,160
she's sitting up by herself now.
It's fucking amazing.

690
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:23,350
She has this look on her face.
She's like proud of herself.

691
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:25,870
It's the cutest thing I've ever
seen in my life. It's just the best.

692
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:29,590
I'm telling you. It's the best.
There's no material and having a kid,

693
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,993
there really isn't,

694
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,980
other than your fear that something
bad's going to happen to them.

695
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:37,130
But I feel like that's been fucking
done to death. You know what I mean?

696
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,910
Other than that, it's just, it's been
fucking phenomenal. Um, okay. Uh,

697
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,700
F is for family. Hey Bill, I'm
a big fan of your work, uh, in,

698
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:49,560

Oh,

699
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:54,090
hope used top to see you
perform some day here. Um,

700
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,750
I watched the second season of
emphasis from family and is great.

701
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:01,110
Even better than the first one.
Completely hilarious. Well,

702
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:05,040
take care and keep the good work. Keep
up the good work. How would that work?

703
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:09,720
You know, Puerto Rico is like not
a state, but it's one of those,

704
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,610
yet another place that we kind
of just decided was ours. MMM.

705
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,350
If I go on stage there too, I don't
know. I went on stage in Singapore.

706
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,660
I didn't get caned.
I'm sure I'll be all in Puerto Rico.

707
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,680
I'd love to fucking go there. Bring my
wife. She can go to the fucking beach,

708
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,270
you know? Yeah. I'll be there
with all the lovely ladies.

709
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,050
All those fucking j Lo's walking around.
I think that would be that.

710
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,220
I could definitely be talked into that.

711
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,520
I go over there and tell my
fucking shit jokes. Um, all right.

712
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,230
Can't stop smoking cigarettes.
Uh,

713
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,170
all right.
Get Job on new season.

714
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,390
Good job on the new
season of F is for family.

715
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:57,620
I'm halfway through and it's hilarious.
I've been smoking for seven years now.

716
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,580
I'm 22 and I can't stop smoking.
Uh,

717
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,690
it's really starting to affect
my health and I'm sick of it.

718
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,060
I quit boozing and smoking weed,

719
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:12,910
but I've never been able to quit smoking
cigarettes. All right. And what the fuck?

720
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,490
How do I help you do this?
I tried to replace it with weed,

721
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:19,360
but it just makes me want to smoke a
cigarette after alcohol gives me cravings

722
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:23,380
too. You used to smoke cigars, so
maybe you've got some good tips.

723
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:27,000
I still smoke cigars to help me
quit. By the way, you, she, uh,

724
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,320
you should come to Minneapolis
soon and play a show.

725
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:32,870
Check out the new Viking
stadium. It's amazing. Yeah. MMM.

726
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,690
Let's see you guys. Yeah. Near the twin
stadium is amazing. You guys are doing,

727
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:42,170
are right up there as is the wilds.
The last time I went to,

728
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,230
uh,
I went to a,

729
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,550
okay.

730
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,150
What do you gotta take
the Timberwolves game?

731
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,910
Kevin Garnett was still there and you
played in the target center and that was a

732
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:53,230
shit hole. MMM. All right.

733
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,920
Well they say quitting cigarettes
is as hard as quitting heroin. So.

734
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,370
MMM. I Dunno. I,

735
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,730
I would try to get professional help.

736
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,000
Okay.

737
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,020
I am so happy I never started doing that.
And um,

738
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,260
you know, I don't, I like, I used
to smoke cigars like, you know,

739
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:18,090
once every like four days or something
like that. Now I smoke. I'm like, okay,

740
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,010
once every two weeks,
sometimes three weeks.

741
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,770
And I really don't have the craving to
do what I kind of wait for like the right

742
00:44:25,771 --> 00:44:26,690
time to do it.

743
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,380
Like riding in a car to go over
to the NBA finals that felt, yeah,

744
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,580
this is a cigar fucking moment.
Okay.

745
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,593
MMM.

746
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,930
But the way I was doing it before,
it was just like fucking, you know,

747
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:41,260
every God damn couple
of days, like, you know,

748
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,290
having a humidor and all that type
of stuff, you can really just, yeah.

749
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,260
I Dunno.
Um,

750
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,160
I still think I smoked
too many of them and

751
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,313
mmm.

752
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,820
I don't eat right when I'm on the road
and I drink too much when I'm on the road

753
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:59,240
and it's something I have a personally,
I have to stop doing that.

754
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,933
MMM.

755
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,310
I am. You know what it is. It's
really, I find it's just developing,

756
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,850
I know people say this, but it's
just developing new habits. Like, uh,

757
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,760
you know, if you're eating
shit food, you crave shit food.

758
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:18,930
If you're eating salads and good
stuff, you crave that. And, um,

759
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,980
I don't know. I'm a creature of habit and
if it's just like every night, you know,

760
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,730
we're going out, we're having drinks
after the show. It just because it just,

761
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,490
your body's like, oh, now we do
this, it's in like this routine.

762
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:32,970
So you kind of have to force
yourself to break up your routine.

763
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,463
MMM.

764
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,990
And I think you just have to make a
decision that you're going to be stronger

765
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:42,520
than it, you know, unless you
have like some sort of, you know,

766
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:43,800
okay.

767
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,080
Super addictive like personality,

768
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,620
like those people and you've got to go
into the doctor drew house or some shit

769
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,020
like that. I'm mean, I don't know what
your deal is, but I would definitely,

770
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,430
I would seek professional
help. Um, all right.

771
00:45:56,431 --> 00:45:59,880
VIP airline. Hey Bill, that
airline with the hot air.

772
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,070
Okay.

773
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,040
Hostesses, um, exist.

774
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,600
It only flies between Paris and New York.
Oh, I was talking about a VIP airline.

775
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:11,480
We don't have to go on with people that
are going to take their shoes off and

776
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,300
put their feet up over the God damn.

777
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,483
MMM.

778
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,410
You know,
stick in between your fucking,

779
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,730
what do they do the stick in between
your fucking arm rest and that type of

780
00:46:22,731 --> 00:46:25,390
thing. Just those God damn animals.
They should just have a first class one.

781
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,730
They should have animal airlines and
then fucking raised right airlines.

782
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:30,380
So he's saying there is a VIP airline,

783
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:33,410
but it only flies between Paris and
New York. It's only business class.

784
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,240
They give you iPads, feed you chef made
food and plenty of good French wine.

785
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,290
The tickets aren't even that expensive.
Um,

786
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,260
treat Nia to a holiday.
Best from France. Well,

787
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,720
what's the name of the fucking airline
do you got to give me the name of the

788
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,870
airline dude? Ah, now I
got to look it up. Oh, Hey,

789
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:52,340
I've got to tell you how to look at it,
but you know,

790
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,090
I got time to fucking do this.
Will my Internet even work?

791
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,160
Fucking scam at that is all right.

792
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,080
A v I P airline,

793
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,450
New York to Paris.
Come on.

794
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:12,800
What do you say? American Airlines,
New York to Paris flights.

795
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,760
Air France.
The companion.

796
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,280
Discover Paris was unique from all,
all business class airline. I found it.

797
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,190
It's La, c o m p a g n I e. Dot Com.

798
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,310
1800 bucks, dude. You
said it was a thousand.

799
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,890
I want to see some pictures
here. Plenty. A trip to Paris.

800
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,580
Oh Wow. Okay. I'm, I'm impressed
with their little terminal there.

801
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,170
Micah panic. Not Dude. I
live in La. I live in La,

802
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,240
so I'm not going to fucking
connects from New York.

803
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,270
I'm just going to say fuck it.

804
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,100
Use all my miles and uh, jump on a
plane. Okay. Full revver in New York.

805
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:05,000
That'd be a nice thing to do.

806
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:08,120
Maybe I'm doing a Gig in New York and
then afterwards we can just go fly out of

807
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:10,210
there. It's a good idea. God dammit.

808
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,280
That's a good fucking idea.

809
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,320
Who knows me out style as the wife
about that one. You know what I mean?

810
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,810
You know how that works. Oh, that
was a question I wanted to ask Jerry.

811
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:22,460
I forgot to do. I wanted to ask him, do,

812
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:26,270
can you just come home with a new Porsche
or do you have to clear it with your

813
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:30,500
wife? You know, can you get to a fucking
like, can you just look at it and be like,

814
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:35,150
dude, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. You know, look
around your house. Did he do like this,

815
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:38,870
this, this, this echo echo. Um, all right.

816
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:42,530
Heart surgeon busted for filming.
Me taking a piss.

817
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:43,870
Okay.

818
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:48,160
What beer dear Billy, double take tits.

819
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,910
I got the fuck.
That means it's hilarious.

820
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,370
I heard this story on your podcast last
week. His fucking phone keeps vibrating.

821
00:48:57,371 --> 00:49:01,330
This whole podcast, the
phone fart. Wayne. Wayne,

822
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,560
what the fuck is all of this
stuff? Oh, Jesus Christ. All right,

823
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,180
here we go.

824
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,960
I heard this story on your podcast last
week about the Oxford students stabbing

825
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:18,590
her boyfriend in the leg with a butter
knife and how she was led off easy

826
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,570
despite her psychotic actions.

827
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,650
I have a similar story that
involved myself a little while ago.

828
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,510
I mean musician and was playing a solo
gig near some markets in the popular

829
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,880
popular part of Brisbane. Where
the fuck is that? I've been there.

830
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,020
Oh, that's Australia, Australia hug.
That was the next thing. Let me sit calm.

831
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:43,130
I went to the next uh, page.
It's fucking hilarious.

832
00:49:43,131 --> 00:49:47,900
Not during one of my breaks. I went to
take a leak in the public amenities.

833
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:49,990
Uh,

834
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,960
I was doing my business and one of the
stalls when suddenly I noticed an iPhone

835
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:57,140
slowly coming over the top
of my stall to my left.

836
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:00,860
I can only see half of the phone
but could tell the camera was going.

837
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:05,300
Obviously it took me by surprise and for
about two seconds my head went through

838
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,890
a does not compute mode. I was only
halfway through taking a piss. I said,

839
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:14,600
what the fuck? Out Loud. When I heard
the stall next to mine open very quickly,

840
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,230
I looked behind me and saw short,
possibly Asian guy running.

841
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,910
I tried to stop mid Piss, very
difficult, adjusted myself quickly,

842
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:27,911
ran and ran out after him only to find
hundreds of people through the markets.

843
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,360
I couldn't see him anywhere. I was
infuriated. It was infuriating.

844
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,460
My first thought was, oh, great,

845
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,840
now I'm going to be uploaded to
some quote. I love public pissing.

846
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:42,170
Dot Khan porn site.
Uh,

847
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,420
I was really fucking pissed off,
no pun intended from this guy evidently,

848
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,030
but kind of glad I didn't
catch him because I probably
would have dragged him by

849
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:54,140
the balls to the police and then
they would charge me for assault.

850
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,040
I don't think you would because it's a
guy to guy a physical confrontation and

851
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:04,430
on his phone there would
be your Dick. Uh, anyways,

852
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,870
a few days later I was telling my friend
what had happened and he said that he

853
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:10,160
heard about an agent,

854
00:51:10,161 --> 00:51:14,570
German national being caught filming
seven men and the public toilets in the

855
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:19,420
same area. And he found the
article online. So it turns
out this 26 year old guys,

856
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:24,430
a trainee heart surgeon on holiday in
Australia celebrating his graduation from

857
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,590
medical school.
Here's the article.

858
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,110
What the fuck? Wait a
minute. Wait a minute. Well,

859
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:36,590
at least he doesn't work on somebody's
fucking urinary tract him. And he's,

860
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,800
he's, he's, uh, he at least had
enough discipline to be like, listen,

861
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:45,110
I can't be near the Dick area.
I don't trust myself.

862
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:48,770
So he's up by the fucking hot.
Um,

863
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:54,230
okay. This, this article is slowly
but surely opening what, what is the,

864
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:55,370
what is going on in the world?

865
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,930
The judge went easy on him and didn't
record a conviction because of his

866
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:03,350
promising career.
What the fuck?

867
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,170
I guess if you're a doctor you can
get away with anything. What the fuck.

868
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,540
So just because you're an
elite student in this world,

869
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:12,200
you get let off easy for
doing really fucked up things.

870
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,230
Apparently none of the other men
filmed were aware of what he was doing.

871
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,360
So I called the police in the area.
He was caught.

872
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,270
They asked me to describe what I
was wearing at the time, blah, blah,

873
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:23,660
blah and said the phone was confiscated
and the footage was deleted.

874
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,150
I fucking hope so.
They also act.

875
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:28,940
That was him saying that I just gave it
a great read. So it's sounding like me.

876
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,190
If I can pat myself on the back. They
also asked if I wanted to press charges.

877
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,510
I said,
fuck yes.

878
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:41,330
The cop I spoke to said he would pay the
pervert of visit very soon to lay the

879
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:44,240
charges as the guy was due to
leave the country in two days.

880
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,300
I called back on the day he was
supposed to leave the country,

881
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:50,540
but the cops said they wouldn't won't
be pressing charges because they had

882
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:55,541
already been laid by the arresting officer
and that the student had received a

883
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:59,690
conviction. Even though the
article said he hadn't weird,

884
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,110
but apparently he will never be able to
enter Australia again for the rest of

885
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:07,100
his life. I just think it's so fucked up
that these people can get away with such

886
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,150
disgraceful actions,

887
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:12,470
especially someone like this heart surgeon
who could potentially be be playing

888
00:53:12,471 --> 00:53:15,260
with some poor guy's balls as
he lays under the anesthetic.

889
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,210
I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Well,

890
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:20,750
they kind of have the guy in check because
heart surgery, you need other people.

891
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,310
Um, oh, here's the guy. German tourists.

892
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,310
Okay.

893
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,070
Lodi Tran was fine.
800 bucks.

894
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,830
Sounds like about a hundred dollars a dick

895
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:42,100
after pleading guilty
to several seven counts.

896
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:47,020
Oh seven counts, seven and
800 side I use, I don't know,

897
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:51,550
but 115 yeah, but on a 15 bucks a whack
or something like that on a 12 bucks,

898
00:53:51,551 --> 00:53:52,290
I dunno.

899
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:57,150
A council of recording in
breach of privacy training.

900
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,720
Heart Surgery. Okay. This guy, 26
a German national, Jesus Christ,

901
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,310
even fucking Asians, if they go to
Germany, that becomes sex perverts.

902
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:10,780
I thought it was just the Germans.
What is it with that country?

903
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,920
They just ended the P and in the shit
and what the fuck is going on over there?

904
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,033
Um,

905
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,390
okay.

906
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,960
So he's fine. Uh, 800
bucks. That's a pleading.

907
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:25,050
Guilty to the prison magistrate and
Saturday on seven counts of recording in

908
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,040
breach of privacy.

909
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,630
The court heard Lee had been in Australia
for a month to celebrate as recent

910
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:32,730
graduation from medical
school when he was,

911
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:35,160
when he filmed the naked men on Friday.

912
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:39,750
Lee Film seven men in the space of three
hours by holding his iPhone over the

913
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:44,370
wall of the neighboring cubicle. None of
the men realize they were being filmed,

914
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,360
but it's behavior drew the
attention of South Bank security.

915
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,090
Who contacted police Lee was arrested.

916
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:54,510
The police found the video of the men
on this phone acting magistrate bubble.

917
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:59,250
I described his ass actions. It's
disgusting. The fences of disgusting.

918
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,440
The offenses are disgusting offenses
involving a serious breach of the privacy

919
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:05,550
of other adult males.

920
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:09,120
I can only assume the offending was
for sexual gratification purposes.

921
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,770
Um, Lee's lawyer, Kate Mccarthy,

922
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:17,280
has said her client had been accepted
into cardiology unit in Germany and would

923
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:21,720
fly home on January 12th is a very
promising career ahead of him. She said,

924
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,300
she said her client was
ashamed of his actions,

925
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,100
but asking that a conviction not be
recorded against him because it could

926
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,470
jeopardize his career and
ability to travel. Mr Schubert,

927
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:34,530
finally $800 and did
not record a conviction.

928
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:36,290
Okay.

929
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:40,010
Wow, man. Uh, you know, that's
fucked up. That's really fucked up.

930
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,850
That's really fucked up.
And am I crazy to think that because he's

931
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,443
okay.

932
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,950
These actions are against men.
You know,

933
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,000
some Apis do a guide. It's just not
as serious. I don't think, you know,

934
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:57,900
I just think it's

935
00:55:59,160 --> 00:55:59,770
okay.

936
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,380
I Dunno. Either. People were like,
Eh, you know, they think it's funny.

937
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,393
Hmm.

938
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,370
Like if this is the thing,
if a,

939
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:10,510
if a woman told another woman that's
some woman I guess was filming and they'd

940
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:13,160
be like, what the fuck am I breaking
away? Maybe because it was a woman though,

941
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:16,670
but last week was a woman she had and
she stabbed the guy with the knife.

942
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:18,550
Okay.

943
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:21,190
Maybe it isn't any of these issues.
Maybe if it's just, if you listen,

944
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:25,570
if you want to get away with shit and
you don't want to be a banker or be in an

945
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:28,500
insurance company,
then I would say get into,

946
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,390
have a promising medical
career in front of you.

947
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,980
Evidently that just absolves you of
everything that's really upsetting.

948
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,870
Um, all right. Let's,
let's, do you want to,

949
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,790
I'm the only way to follow up that
upsetting story as the only thing I know

950
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:46,510
that's more upsetting than
somebody filming another
man pink without him knowing

951
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:50,410
was me reading out loud.
He likes everybody. Alex,

952
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,780
you're unique. Oh, you're a
special fucking snowflake.

953
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,220
You don't walk like everybody
else talk like everybody else.

954
00:56:57,221 --> 00:57:00,160
Share Jack are asleep like anyone else.

955
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:04,350

[inaudible] stamps.com.
Never go to the post office again.

1020
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,580
That's it. It's a fucking rap. Um,

1021
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:16,120
all right. All right. So what
do we got here? What do I
got left to talk about? Um,

1022
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:16,641
oh,

1023
01:01:16,641 --> 01:01:20,630
how about the fucking Nashville predators
making it a series winning game three.

1024
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:22,070
What?
I hope the Cavaliers do.

1025
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:26,300
What I still believe the
Cavaliers can do despite the fact.

1026
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,540
No, I'm not gonna get back into that
again. Um, predators, when game three,

1027
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:36,390
I saw a little bit of it.
I was working that night and uh,

1028
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:40,920
I actually saw when they went ahead to
one and then three one, was that the game?

1029
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,780
I can't remember.
Um,

1030
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,220
okay,

1031
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,720
so here we go. I mean,
from what I've heard,

1032
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:49,170
they've been out playing the penguins
at at least two out of the three games.

1033
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:52,890
So maybe they'll tie it up and maybe
someone like myself will get what I want,

1034
01:01:52,891 --> 01:01:57,390
which is a nice seven game
series. A nice classic. So a,

1035
01:01:57,391 --> 01:02:01,260
that game's tonight. I will definitely
be watching and a this week, this week,

1036
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,450
all Billy red face.

1037
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:07,770
I want to be on Howard stern on Wednesday,
Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.

1038
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,000
My triumphant return.

1039
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:12,900
I've not been on that
show since I believe 2003.

1040
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,930
I did it twice in one month. I
thought I was in, in guy and,

1041
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:19,980
and I never got another invite.
So I'm finally back.

1042
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,810
You know, I'm psyched. Psyched
to finally come back, uh,

1043
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:29,790
onto the show. So please
listen on Wednesday. Um,

1044
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,770
and that's it. That's the podcast.
Thank you for listening and really man,

1045
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:37,110
no joke. Thank you to
everybody who's been watching.

1046
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:39,070
F is for family telling people about it.

1047
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,823
MMM.

1048
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:44,410
And then also taking the time to let me
know how much you're enjoying it. Yeah.

1049
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,570
Uh,

1050
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,260
it's just, it's, it's really been
one of the great weeks of my life.

1051
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,200
I have to be honest with you.
So no jokes or anything.

1052
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:55,300
Thank you guys for watching it.
Uh,

1053
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:59,920
please continue to tell people about it
and um, cause we already have ceased.

1054
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,510
We know we want to do in season three.

1055
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,990
We just have to wait for Netflix to give
us the green light and they give us the

1056
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:08,620
green light by you guys watching
it and talking about it online,

1057
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:13,510
which you guys are doing. So I can't
thank you enough. And um, and that's it.

1058
01:03:13,511 --> 01:03:15,550
Thank you to everybody at cluster fest.
I had a great time.

1059
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:18,560
Thank you to the city of San Francisco.
Uh,

1060
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,850
thank you to the warrior says for
still playing in the Oracle, you know,

1061
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,970
great fucking old. Oh, you
know what's funny? When I did
that Seinfeld interview, I,

1062
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,060
I jokingly said that this,

1063
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:34,300
this venue feels like an old ABA arena
and evidently the Old San Francisco

1064
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:38,960
warriors used to play there, so it felt
pretty good about calling that one.

1065
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:43,580
Um, all right, Phil, you're overstaying
your welcome. Okay, go fuck yourselves.

1066
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:47,990
I'll check in on you on Thursday and
that's it. Let's go. Cavs. C'Mon man.

1067
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:54,650
If you beat the fucking warriors with
all their Cuatro Moss that they added all

1068
01:03:55,521 --> 01:03:58,550
of that fucking Juggernaut of
a Goddamn team walking around,

1069
01:03:58,551 --> 01:04:01,880
thumping themselves in the
chest as if what they're doing.

1070
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,670
I've said this for fucking ever,

1071
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:08,270
and I'll say the last time when you were
a little kid on the playground and you

1072
01:04:08,271 --> 01:04:12,350
would choose an up teams, even little
kids knew when it was getting to,

1073
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:17,020
when it was not on an hour. This is not
going to, there's no competition here.

1074
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,490
Even as kids,
you knew this,

1075
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,450
the warriors are doing right now.

1076
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,480
They're doing something that
even children know are wrong.

1077
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,420
Even children would break that up.
You don't even really think it is.

1078
01:04:28,421 --> 01:04:32,680
I think stern left the NBA. Maybe that's
what it is. Maybe he would've stepped in.

1079
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:37,420
Who knows? I always thought that that
guy was shady. Um, I do know this.

1080
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,201
Without a doubt,

1081
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:43,201
Cleveland's gonna win a fucking game
because the NBA does not make money is

1082
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,750
nearly as much money on a four game
series versus five, six, seven.

1083
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:50,830
So at some point I'm looking for them
to fucking just start calling everything

1084
01:04:50,831 --> 01:04:54,400
on the warriors. But then again, I am a
fucking conspiracy theory. Fucking freak.

1085
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,260
Um, I dunno. I still feel like the cavs
and not played their best game yet.

1086
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:01,850
All right. I'm going to say they're
going to win game three. Fuck it.

1087
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,650
I'm putting it out there. All right. Go
fuck yourselves. I'll see you on Thursday.
