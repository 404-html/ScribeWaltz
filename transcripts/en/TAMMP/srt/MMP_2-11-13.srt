1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,413
Okay.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,790
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:06,790
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:11,140
February 11th, 2013. Um,

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,740
how are you? How's it going?
How's your week going so far?

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,980
Uh, you know what, I just
looked across my Roman,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,420
I saw an object that reminded me of
one of my many failures this week.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,960
I was in a rush to leave my house and,
uh,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,880
I was taking my truck cause I was
finally going to get the brakes done.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,720
I bought a kit to switch my fucking,
um,

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,000
I got drum brakes on my old truck.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,480
And as much as I wanted to keep
the truck as original as possible,

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,800
just the way people text and drive
out here and there's so many people,

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,580
I just know that if I ever hit somebody
with the front end of that beautiful

15
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:55,440
truck that you know, I'm never going to
be able to replace the parts. So I'm like,

16
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:59,940
I gotta do this shit. All right.
So, uh, Christopher Titus,

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,040
very talented. Christopher Titus,
uh, he's into all of that shit.

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,110
So he tells me go out and go buy a kit,

19
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,890
will drive it over to my place and
we'll fucking slap this thing on.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,430
It's going to take no more than
four hours. Bing, Bang, boom,

21
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:18,540
everything's fucking done. Right. So I'm
all excited. I bought this kit by the way,

22
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:23,541
in July of last year and it's
just been sitting in my office.

23
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,080
I've been using it like just, you know,
putting my legs up on it because I'm,

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,840
because life goes by that fast.
When you're as old as I am next weekend,

25
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,350
next week, next week. Next
thing you know, you've,

26
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,290
you fucking had the thing
for like six months.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,980
So finally we set a date where like,
all right, let's fucking, let's do,

28
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:45,450
it was at Wednesday we were going to do
it. And uh, you know, I'm fucking nervous.

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,950
I don't know what I'm doing. So anyways,
I got to move the Prius out of the way.

30
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,240
So I move that out of the fucking way.
And I got the hazard lights on, you know,

31
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,120
because it's the day where the cuts
come around and they give people parking

32
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,770
tickets. So I bring the truck up, right.

33
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:03,390
It got to fucking choke off of
[inaudible] bring it up the fucking thing.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,690
Right.
And in my haste,

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,250
okay,

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,790
bring in the fucking car back.
I left the hazard lights on.

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,750
So after we were done with the job,
I came home and my fucking,

38
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,460
the fucking car was dead and I'm like,
no big deal.

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,510
I know how to jumpstart this
fucking hybrid. I know how to do it.

40
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,600
I watched the AAA guy do it and I went
out and I bought one of those self

41
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:32,530
contained battery pack fucking things.
Opened the hood.

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,890
Cute little hood dead. It is. I
opened the little battery pack,

43
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:39,370
I took the little red thing
off and I can't fucking
figure out how to clip it on.

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,420
I tried to clip it on the bolt rather
than that metal tab and it didn't matter

45
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:48,040
anyways because my thing wasn't fucking
charged and I had to call AAA to have my

46
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,650
car jumped.
Do you realize the level of,

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,620
of like how emasculating that is.
Have somebody come over,

48
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,390
you know, have somebody teach you how to
your brakes. Okay. That's understandable.

49
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,650
All right. That's, that's
some next level shit, right?

50
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,510
It's fucking jumper cables out
was the one word. It's the worst.

51
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,580
When the guy showed up, I should have
come out of the house and address, um,

52
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,940
just defeated fucking man. But I,
I bit the bullet, I was like, yeah,

53
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,580
I can't figure out how to do it.
And he explained it.

54
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:26,581
My thing didn't work anyways and I can't
find the cord to charge the fucking

55
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:31,600
thing. So they're there, it
sits there. It sits. Actually,

56
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,760
I just kind of slammed that
whole thing together. Reality is,

57
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,990
is it took us two and a half days to
get the fucking brakes on because uh,

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,350
the back plates that you stick
the rotors on, once mark left,

59
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,750
the other one was mark.
Right. And we put them on,

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,520
we know the difference between left
and right, and Titus kept going,

61
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,870
is it me or does it look like it's kind
of like talking in like it's been what

62
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,290
the, you know, and I'm looking at it like
I know what's going on. Oh, you know,

63
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,620
it looks pretty good to me. Right.
You know, put the fucking things on.

64
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:02,560
It's rubbing. If you turn too
far to the left or the right,

65
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,160
you know the calipers are
going to hit the springs.

66
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,700
The fucking break lines weren't
long enough. The whole God damn kit.

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,620
So finally we get these people on the
phone. I'm not gonna say who they were,

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,760
but when I would finally get him on
the phone and they like, oh yeah,

69
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:23,260
we had a batch of their ma went out
and all they weren't labeled right.

70
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,180
I got to tell you is of the Titus and
one of the most eloquent fucking ass rip

71
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,020
eggs you've ever seen in your life.
Never raised his voice, never cursed.

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,650
I think you said one f bomb. But it was
a throwaway cause he was like, you know,

73
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:42,920
I've been, I'm fucking here for
three days. Like one of those things.

74
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:45,170
Not saying you're a fucking asshole,
but other than that never cursed.

75
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,710
And he just basically went
right down the line like a,

76
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,320
so you knew these were labeled wrong
and you didn't call anybody these,

77
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,140
this is a safety issue.

78
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,710
And the guy at first would not admit any
wrongdoing to the point was hilarious.

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,750
He wouldn't have been any wrongdoing at
one point. I swear to God, he goes, well,

80
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:09,950
did you look at the picture?

81
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,990
Oh, in defense of them,
the picture was right,

82
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:20,310
but the picture was like the size of
maybe three postage stamps and it was in

83
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:24,870
black and white. And it was very confusing
because you couldn't quite see it,

84
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,330
but you kind of could.

85
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:31,680
But it was written clear as day left and
right. So what are you going to go with?

86
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,470
What I can barely see or
what I can clearly read.

87
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,650
That's what we went with and uh Oh my God.

88
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,480
And then we finally got that out of
them and then we fucking switch to them.

89
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:46,770
And then it worked like a dream.
But the great thing was,

90
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,150
was trying to figure it out.
We put them on and take,

91
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,850
took them off like I think
at least three times.

92
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,180
So I kinda got three like,
um,

93
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,560
okay.

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,660
It's almost like I did three,
three brake jobs.

95
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,950
I got like that level of experience
and I got to tell you, it was,

96
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:08,630
it was the fucking coolest thing ever
to finally do something like that to see

97
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,620
how it all goes together.

98
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:14,360
It was absolutely a fascinating and um,

99
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,140
I dunno,
tidy since the shit because he would not,

100
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,900
he could have just slapped it on and
be like, Hey, go take a team mechanic.

101
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:22,980
I don't what the fuck's going on?

102
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:27,540
He was determined to get this
thing on correctly. And he did.

103
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,160
And when he found out it was messed up,

104
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,220
he went to bat for me any so eloquently
reading these guys that they actually

105
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:38,490
gave me a credit on the kit.
So it didn't cost me a fucking dime.

106
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,120
How great is that? And then we said, oh,

107
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:44,400
you guys are all right now we're going to
send him some DVDs and it's all a wash.

108
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,320
So I finally, that was was three, two
and a half days of that fucking shit.

109
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:53,480
And then I finally do auto
zone like fucking nine times.

110
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,420
And every time I came into auto zone I
was a little more tired and a little more

111
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:00,500
dirty.
Nothing.

112
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,260
I was thinking how enjoyable
it would have been,

113
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,480
had the whole thing gone together. I want,
probably want to learn nearly as much,

114
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,710
but just,

115
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,823
uh,

116
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,510
you know,
like when you watch those youtube videos,

117
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,760
like Eric the car guy and
he's just fucking, he's just,

118
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:21,250
this goes here and this goes here,
you take that off,

119
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:23,440
put this on and put this
thing back on and it just,

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,340
it just goes so fucking smoothly.
And uh,

121
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:32,290
that was not the case on this thing. But
when we finally got it all together, um,

122
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,690
it was tremendous. And
I'm, I'm, I'm sick now,

123
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:37,180
but this how much of a
sentimental fool I am, I'm,

124
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,710
I'm keeping the old drum brakes and I
bought the tools to be able to put it back

125
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,530
together just cause I don't want to
leave it. I want to learn how to do it.

126
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:48,220
And then I also don't want to just leave
all the springs and shit laying around

127
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:51,160
in the garage, you know, kicking
them around and shit. You know,

128
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,670
how long can you leave that shit around
before something fucking happens and

129
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:58,790
then you lose it forever. So there you
go. How'd you like death? That was my, uh,

130
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,710
fixing the break story. So I
now have, I now have a, uh,

131
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,800
a disc brakes and I put one of the road
is on with the caliper and all of that.

132
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,230
And a, I was beyond, uh, beyond
site, although it does have a friend.

133
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,620
It does help to have a friend
who's basically a master
fucking mechanic who has

134
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,680
all the God damn tools,
uh, who was getting home.

135
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,750
I should have been over there
with a fucking nurse's outfit on.

136
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,420
I was just handing them shit,
but whatever. I get dirty.

137
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,493
MMM.

138
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,530
So anyways,
I,

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,250
I have no idea what is going on
in the world right now because,

140
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:37,084
uh,

141
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,140
for some reason I've decided to do like
10 do it yourself fucking projects and

142
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:45,270
uh, I'm painting my living room,
so I n I don't know. It's a,

143
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,890
it's a motherfucker. It's a
pain in the ass. It's easy,

144
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:51,220
but it's a pain in the ass
and a to tape everything up.

145
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,070
And I haven't watched TV for like the
last two days, so I know it in Boston.

146
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,840
Uh, that blizzard with the fuck are
they calling it Nokia? Nardi. Yeah.

147
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,270
What the hell was it here?
Nameable Nimoy Nimmo.

148
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,420
Blizzard Nimo I guess they're
gonna name a snow storms now.

149
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,640
Okay.

150
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,020
You know,
I don't even need to get into that.

151
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,390
Enough Comedians have made fun of
how much they overhyped these things.

152
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,750
This looks a little say was actually a
decent amount of snow, but in the end,

153
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:23,030
even if you have like, you know, fucking

154
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,910
okay.

155
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,920
Let's say there's three feet of snow.

156
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,160
Okay.

157
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,900
Yeah. I mean, what is, what is that up to?

158
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,100
Yeah.

159
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,140
Let's say two feet of snow.
Two feet of snow.

160
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:36,710
Is that even up to your knees
if you're an average size adult?

161
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:37,990
Yeah.

162
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,330
Like what is going to eat?
You can go 30 days.

163
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,920
I think I've said this
before in the podcast.

164
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:45,310
You can go 30 fucking days without food.
Maybe more than that.

165
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,390
The big thing is water.
Alright. Snow right there.

166
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,070
The Nice fucking handful of cold water
sticking your mouth and just relax.

167
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,280
Let it melt. He couldn't be
fine. You're not going to die.

168
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,630
Some guy on youtube made this hilarious
video of just screaming, I have to get a,

169
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,100
I have to get bread and milk I think is,
it's already got 2 million hits.

170
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,310
It's the funniest bucket that why
do you have to get bread and milk?

171
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,500
I don't know. Am I, I guess if
I was old I would be nervous,

172
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,350
but only if, if like, you know,

173
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,200
if the heat went out then that's
the only way I would be nervous.

174
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:25,530
But other than that, it's just fucking
snow. You're going to get the day off.

175
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:28,200
He can go sledding.
Build a snowman.

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,380
Yeah.

177
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,780
Just put on a fucking scarf. You
pussies. It's easy for me to say, right.

178
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:38,150
I'm out here and fucking Los Angeles. I
gotta tell you though, you know, it's,

179
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,570
it's been a while since I've been in
snow and I saw some of the pictures. My,

180
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,240
my buddy sent me this go and look
at what the fuck I'm dealing with.

181
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:47,260
And that actually looked awesome to
me. You know, Snow's fun to visit,

182
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:50,140
but you don't want to live in it when
it first comes down, it's beautiful.

183
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,110
And then once it starts being
dirty and all that fucking Shit,

184
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,300
you just get tired.
There's less parking spots.

185
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,390
It'd be buddy down in
southeast shoveling out there.

186
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,950
Kaz Putting a fucking trash barrel there.
Some Yuppie doesn't know the rules.

187
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,420
Pulls in his little fucking Puccio
and he never sees it again. Um,

188
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,610
at least that's how I
heard it works there. Uh,

189
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:13,460
this is the Monday morning podcast.
What am I going to do here? Well,

190
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,970
you know what else I miss today? I
didn't realize the broads. I know that,

191
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:19,030
that that game against Tampa Bay got
canceled and I didn't realize that they

192
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:22,510
played a, the Buffalo Sabres,
which has become a big rivalry.

193
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,570
And I know a lot of you
guys don't like hockey,

194
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,080
especially the Douche who had to write
me on Twitter to let me know that he

195
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:33,790
tried to watch hockey. Hockey didn't
enjoy it. It literally wrote Jaan

196
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,590
fucking cunt. You know, I
just said, you know, if you,

197
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,120
it's a great sport, watch Bruins
Montreal. If you want to try to get it,

198
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,250
do I really need your fucking like do you
think the Nhl get well maybe they give

199
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:51,250
a fuck. Maybe they want
your money, you know? Right.

200
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,040
Then why are you writing me
like I'm the commissioner

201
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,373
anyways.

202
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,080
Okay.

203
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,740
Why do I read them? I don't know why
I re I should just not read them. Um,

204
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,100
so anyways,
people hate fucking the Sabres.

205
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,940
They hate Lou Cheech because he ran over
their goalie last year in a hurt the

206
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:14,170
guy, granted it was a Douche move,
but you know, he was frustrated.

207
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:14,951
He had a breakout,

208
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:19,030
he couldn't settle down the puck and
old fucking old big eyes came out of the

209
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,770
net,
came out a little too far.

210
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,020
You know when he ran them over your right.
Your right to be mad at him.

211
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,580
But can you please stop asking why
Luci Cheech won't fight. John Scott,

212
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,370
why do you get John Scott
is like six, eight, two 70.

213
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,630
He's a fucking goon.
He can barely skate.

214
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,340
Why?
Why would you have an all star fight?

215
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:48,400
That guy risk getting hurt
and then sit in the box.

216
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,690
That's why he's not fighting them.

217
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,160
There's no way ownership is going
to let that guy fight. All right.

218
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,960
And all Lou chichis is a fucking million
dollar piece of meat to the ownership,

219
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,590
you know what I mean?

220
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,380
So they're not going to have him go
out there and go fight that big fucking

221
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,700
Sasquatch.

222
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,080
He shouldn't even go out there and skate.

223
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,110
So she just walk out there
with like work boots on.

224
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,370
I don't know. He probably can
play. They don't allow him to,

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,620
but I hate when people say that shit.

226
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,410
They pick like the best guy in
your team and were like, yeah,

227
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:24,630
he's too much of a pussy to fight
our toothless moron. Yeah, that,

228
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:26,510
that's a good switch off.
That's a good trade off.

229
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:30,980
Let's have one of our best guys sit down
for five minutes and all you lose is

230
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:35,920
some fucking God damn
gorilla. I get it. Buffalo.

231
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,790
You're upset.

232
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,190
Yeah.

233
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,540
Okay. You want to see Lou Cheech get
pounded. I understand how you're probably,

234
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,291
logic is well,

235
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:47,580
fucking what about saucer eyes there
he wasn't exactly a tough target.

236
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,220
Um, there maybe deserves it. I Dunno.
I feel bad for people in Buffalo.

237
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,920
You know what I mean? That's just,
that's, I been there as a sports fan.

238
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,340
Fortunately, I, they let me up off the
mat over the last 10 years. You know,

239
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm rooting for you guys. You know,
I know what people say to you.

240
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,930
I know exactly what the fight I dealt
with that Bucky Dent 1918 all at fucking

241
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:09,954
horse shit.

242
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,170
The fucking curse with the Canadians
back when they dominated us 25 fucking

243
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:18,990
years ago, whatever the hell it
was. Unless you're Dan Shaughnessy,

244
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,490
every time we lose to him, he starts,
the Kurds is back, noodle headed cunt.

245
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,440
Um, I know what you're going through.
I know. People say, why'd right?

246
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:32,130
They say bread hall. They
say a white, he plays sports.

247
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:34,050
Why don't you just stick
to make an appetizers?

248
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,170
You already came up with buffalo wings.
There's,

249
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:39,210
is there something else you guys can come
up with that we can enjoy eating while

250
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,900
we watch our teams win championships?
I realized they say holy Cunty Shit too.

251
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,850
And it eats away at you after
awhile. It's awful. You know,

252
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,561
I,
I don't,

253
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:53,540
I don't have any animosity towards any
fans who go through shit like that.

254
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,430
Haven't gone through it myself. I only
wish it on, uh, you know, I wish it on.

255
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,020
I don't need to get into
that shit anymore. Um,

256
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,180
yeah. Take a Colby stop passing the
ball. You guys are losing again. Huh?

257
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,370
Did you figure it out?
Laker fans or to years,

258
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,070
you've just figured out a new way to
compliment Koby Bryant. Unbelievable.

259
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,130
Do you know like last week out here,
uh,

260
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,680
Colby for like three games
in a row actually pass the
ball for the first time in

261
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:24,830
his career, he actually was passing
the ball on a regular basis.

262
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,390
And I know a lot of people are gonna say,

263
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,590
cause they wrote to me and who's good
foot Selgian careers schist Muggsy Bogues

264
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,370
has over 6,000 in like three less seasons.
Okay.

265
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,010
The motherfuckers not passing the ball.

266
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,360
Everybody who plays with
them is not lying. They're
not making up shit. Alright,

267
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,810
guide finally passes the
ball in place the team game.

268
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,980
Fucking the Lakers night and day.
All of a sudden they're this,

269
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,910
this does this team that's winning.
And the Laker fans think, oh,

270
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,910
oh, that was the problem. Colby
was the fucking problem. No,

271
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,090
they immediately dropped to
their knees in bloom again.

272
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:07,430
It's a new facet to with gay.

273
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,890
They started calling them Magic
Bryant. Kobe Johnson. I just,

274
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,360
I've never seen,
I just don't understand.

275
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,580
I'm not saying the guy
individually. Once again,

276
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,260
this is the Peyton manning thing all
over again. Individually phenomenal.

277
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,520
It's not even, it's not even paint, man.
He say, I can't even bring him up. Ah,

278
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,650
Christ, I'm rambling. Let's do, uh,

279
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,890
can you tell I got a zillion
fucking things in my mind. This,

280
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,270
this podcast is more fucking retarded
than usual. All right. Anyways,

281
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:45,330
plowing ahead here. Let's,
uh, what's today the 11th.

282
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,070
Oh my God.

306

00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:27,270
I miss the game today and I saw Campbell
jumped that guy in the savers. He get,

342
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,610
he, he uh, he didn't come
out too well in that one.

343
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,670
I love the guy in the state was
like looking at the ref like,

344
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,600
I don't want to fight. Oh
right. What does your day, um,

345
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,340
all right now put the sports talk.
Okay,

346
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,410
I need to appease the ladies
and the nerds out there. Oh,

347
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,810
here's one for,
um,

348
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,990
this weekend I actually took a night off
from standup comedy and I went out to a

349
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,760
Indio, California, I can't
remember the name of the Casino.

350
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,570
I saw Don Rickles. They had
to do it, man. I was like,

351
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:04,570
I always see these guys underrated.

352
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,040
Going to a casino and seeing a legend.
He was amazing.

353
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,740
And Tony Orlando tie a yellow ribbon.

354
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,600
He destroyed in front of them. I didn't
realize how many hits that guy had.

355
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,920
You know, I went with Bart neck and
we will, and I was just going like,

356
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:23,410
I think this guy's going to
open with tie a yellow ribbon.

357
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,930
He's going to close
with it and he's gonna,

358
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,390
he's gonna play it again in the middle.
And he came right out of the gate,

359
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,110
tie a yellow ribbon. And in my world,
I'm like, this guy's Outta hit.

360
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,740
He's out of hits and all of a sudden he
goes to the next, I'm like, wait a minute,

361
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,860
I know this song not three
times on the ceiling,

362
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:46,360
and if you want me twice or not pipe,
right?

363
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:49,990
Everybody go nuts. Then he had another
hit after that. I'm like, God damn,

364
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:53,530
this guy's got a lot of hits.
Then he got do a drum battle,

365
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,760
this drummer,
and I'd have to give the nod to Tony

366
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,010
and then Rickles comes out.
It was just amazing just seeing an icon,

367
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,950
you know, Tuxedo, the whole old school
thing, guy opened up for Sinatra,

368
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,270
underrated. Go into, go into a casino
to see a legend. This is what I realize.

369
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,980
This is a very blanket statement,
but I'm sort of the king of this.

370
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,230
Legends play casinos,
hacks, go to cruise ships.

371
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,400
Is that bad? I'm just saying, you know,

372
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,220
they give you a certain amount of
time to make it in this business.

373
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:40,140
And if you don't, they just, they
just put you out to see, you know,

374
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,750
Eh, that's not 100% true. There's
some, there's some good guys doing. Uh,

375
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,770
but you know what? I'm fucking
talking about. I told you this story.

376
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:51,300
I did a cruise ship one time.
I worked with like a juggler and a,

377
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:56,220
and the guy hosting it, I swear to
God, was like a real life guy. Smiley.

378
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,710
That was that story told you why?
Well,

379
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,510
they told me it was going to be
a young crowd cause I was like,

380
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:03,720
I don't think my ex can work on a cruise
ship. This is like 10 11 years ago.

381
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,510
I like not, I don't know. It's this young,

382
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:11,400
these young with a young hip cruise
liner thing, right. So I show up,

383
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:14,580
it's a bunch of old people in the guy.
Smiley guy goes out there.

384
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:15,330
This is how old they were.

385
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,870
He went out and he opens with the
f you're happy and you know it,

386
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:22,740
clap your hands. And they did it. And
at that point I was like, oh my God,

387
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:25,290
I am going to fucking eat my balls.
And I did.

388
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,710
It wasn't easy because we
were rolling over the waves.

389
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,110
It was kind of tricky to get
that second ball in my mouth.

390
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:34,740
But I did seven minutes into my set,
fucking munched on both.

391
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,060
Captain wrote a letter to the agency.
Oh God,

392
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:42,160
why didn't I ever get a copy of that?
Said I was offensive to

393
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,880
all races,
the handicapped.

394
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,620
I forget what else he said.
I don't know.

395
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,300
Nothing I said was as was as offensive
as the fucking food they were serving on

396
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:59,440
that goddamn boat. Oh my God. You never
saw so many fat fucks in your life.

397
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,180
I swear to God, if one of those
cruise ships ever goes down, you know,

398
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,890
has there ever been like an obese shark?
The whales too.

399
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,840
You know what fat people must be for
sharks just because they don't, you know,

400
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,430
we're not part of their diet. We just sort
of accidentally like we gotta be like,

401
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,240
remember those big pink snowballs,
those mushrooms there,

402
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:25,390
mushrooms in the middle and then they had,
I don't know what the fuck was good.

403
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:26,470
I never had the balls to eat.

404
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:30,160
One only reason why is because it was
marshmallow always thought marshmallow was

405
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:33,980
disgusting. They remember fluff
peanut butter and fluff and other,

406
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,400
that toxic horse shit.

407
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,580
I actually grew up right at the tail end
of just feeding kids absolute poison.

408
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,760
Like now they feed poison
but it's sort of disguised.

409
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:51,950
You have no idea cause they'll write
oh packed with protein or you know,

410
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,300
nutritious shit. You know,
there's somehow they'll put,

411
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,680
put like those words in there.
They try and camouflage.

412
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,670
But back then it was just straight up
like, you know, it was just poison.

413
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,060
Fluffer nutter. The fuck is
that? I Dunno. It's bunches.

414
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,910
White Shit with bunch of sugar and you
mix it up with peanut butter. I let,

415
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,580
um, right. What am I talking about? Oh,

416
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,340
we're talking about fat people going
overboard and he fat listeners.

417
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,540
You're going on a cruise and just
think like, wow, if this goes,

418
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:28,710
oh well wait a minute,
would you float more if you're fat.

419
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,330
The big thing is you'd have to relax.
But the problem is,

420
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,600
is like, you know, if you're
wearing like a fat person, like a,

421
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,460
like wet suit, you know, you
just covering yourself all up.

422
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,170
When you laying on your back in the ocean,

423
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,980
you know the water that's been absorbed
in your bathing suit is going to be

424
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:54,330
coming down in your face. Sort of be
like waterboarding yourself, you know.

425
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:58,020
So maybe you've got a
rollover and you stomach. Nah,

426
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,330
but then the roles in your neck of the
kind of holding your face in the water,

427
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,720
it's so rough deal.
Um,

428
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,530
is there ever been a fat navy
seal? I don't, I don't think
there has. All Right, oh,

429
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. People I,

430
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:17,730
this is why I do these Monday
morning when the brain is fresh.

431
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,380
I'm just attacking fucking people who
can't defend themselves or stop eating.

432
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,360
Um, all right, here's something for you.

433
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,330
It's just choppy is health.

434
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,030
I got to recommend something
as somebody recommended to me,

435
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,020
told me to go see that Dave
Grohl documentary on sound city.

436
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,130
You can actually go to his website. I
wish I had that up there. Just look,

437
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,270
update growth.
Sound city,

438
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:45,540
you can download it for 12 bucks
and it's worth every goddamn penny.

439
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,560
It's about this studio sound city
where basically I would say maybe 40%.

440
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:56,150
It seemed of every fucking awesome album
you've ever downloaded or ever wanted

441
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,060
to get over the last 40 years was made,
um,

442
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,580
in this studio. And, uh,

443
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,170
Dave Grohl actually bought the soundboard
when it was going out of business.

444
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:12,340
He bought the soundboard. So that kind
of starts it off. And when you watch it,

445
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,610
this isn't really a spoiler alert the
whole time they're interviewing him.

446
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:19,640
He's sitting in this old school
van and I was sitting there.

447
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,260
It's going to Zana one
of those old Ford Vans.

448
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,640
Okay.

449
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,350
The original, like the, the, uh, equal
liners that you say it, the early sixties,

450
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,690
I, he'd help like pedophiles
ruined vans. You know what I mean?

451
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,520
I don't know if it was pedophiles or
date rapists, but like vans in the,

452
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:41,550
in the 60s, if you look at
them, they're not that bad.

453
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:45,600
They're actually kind of adorable. I'll,
I'll bring a picture up there like,

454
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:49,140
you know, the Ford Econoline, it
looked like a big, big fucking eyes.

455
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,810
Looked like it needed some sleep,
you know,

456
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,220
and they was so tiny and he
could just see it. You, you,

457
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,810
you couldn't do anything
and people could just see,

458
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:02,730
you could see almost right through
the fucking thing. Um, in the 70s,

459
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:06,330
they became creepy. That's
when they started, you know,

460
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:09,000
putting carpet on the floors
and the ceiling of them.

461
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:14,001
And they had these crazy sort of
acid murals on the side of them.

462
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,870
And guys with Harry chess and mustaches
started driving him around and just saw

463
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:22,530
him somewhere. It just became
the big, just mobile, you know?

464
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,060
And this Skaggs liked him.
I wish I was around when vans were cool,

465
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,210
you know? Well actually
I was, when I was a kid,

466
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,970
I used to think custom vans with a shit.
I used to think,

467
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:35,770
why don't my parents have a custom van?

468
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,590
Remember that when you wanted
your parents to be cool,

469
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,890
why can't he get a corvette? Oh, I dunno,

470
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,330
cause you're this fucking six kids
with the hell. Am I going to stick you?

471
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,130
That's when you know your dad's fucking
around on your mom comes home with a two

472
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:53,110
seater. Fuck the family I'm
going out tonight. All right,

473
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:56,860
Bill, how do you tell a girl
she sucks in bed? Uh, the fish.

474
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,020
Uh,
hey bill,

475
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,590
how do you tell a girl she sucks in bed
without hurting her feelings or making

476
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:03,730
her embarrassed?

477
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,860
Is it okay to give pointers in the
bedroom or would you may over it make that

478
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:13,750
make me look like a Dick helped
me out, Bill. Go Fuck Yourself.

479
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,580
Um, all right. The first half, there's
no way to tell a girl she sucks in bed.

480
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,590
There's no way for a woman and tell a
guy he sucks in bed without hurting the

481
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,350
failings. Alright, let's
be politically correct.

482
00:29:26,351 --> 00:29:30,250
There's no way for a guy to tell another
guy if they live in an alternative

483
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:34,180
lifestyle, 2013 date, no
one wants to hear that.

484
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,390
Um, well, this is what I would do. I eat.

485
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,190
You can't just make somebody good at bed.
The potential has to be there.

486
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:50,020
There has to be a certain God
given talent. You know what I mean?

487
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,750
I mean, some women, they, they
reach for your package, like to,

488
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,480
they're grabbing something out of
the cupboard. You know what I mean?

489
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,590
There's just no,

490
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:00,960
yeah,

491
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,950
it's, you know, what's funny about women
being bad in bed is there's not a lot of,

492
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:09,080
um,
there's not a lot of stories.

493
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,790
I think guys not knowing
what they're doing is,

494
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,340
is pretty well documented
and guilty as charged.

495
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,640
Guilty as charged, you
know, but um, that it's,

496
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,580
it's definitely a two way street.

497
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,240
What I would do is if you
feel she has potential,

498
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,970
rather than give her
pointers, like, hey listen,

499
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,710
you're doing a great job in there.

500
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,960
He's a couple things like make
some halftime adjustments.

501
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,680
Maybe you could do that, like stop
halfway through fucking, you know,

502
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:44,200
have her run into the bathroom and as you
run into somebody interviews you. Yeah.

503
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:46,240
Well, you know, the first
half hour is pretty good.

504
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:48,100
There's definitely some
things we could do better.

505
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,980
I know my balls are kind of lonely and uh,
you know,

506
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,470
she's got to know she doesn't
have a good read them.

507
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:56,380
We're going to try to work on our
rhythm and the second half. Right? Yeah.

508
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,530
Go Fuck Yourself. You
know, runs back in. Um,

509
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,670
I would suggest rather than cake,
definitely don't tell us she sucks.

510
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,690
Do not give pointers. I would,
uh, the keyword here is guiding,

511
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,850
guiding, and, um, informative, moaning.

512
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,810
Okay.

513
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,760
I would say would be the,
uh,

514
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,380
the most user friendly

515
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,470
way to protect this girl's feelings.
It is, that's what you have to do.

516
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,640
Um, I need more information.
Do you feel she's aware?

517
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,680
How did she suck in bed? Like I said, she
grabbed me a dick. Like she's, you know,

518
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,220
reaching into a mailbox to see
what the fuck's in there or

519
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,780
is she just shy? You gotta help me
out here. I don't, I don't know.

520
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:54,530
Um, you know, that,
that's what I would do.

521
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,230
I would, I would guide her and by guide
her, I don't mean pushing her head down,

522
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,740
it guiding,
no forcing,

523
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,310
none of that type of stuff. And, uh,

524
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,810
and then where you gotta be Simon
Cowl is, um, don't give her any, um,

525
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:19,240
sympathetic mode once she starts
picking up that the moments, you know,

526
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,680
you know, don't give her any sympathy
once, if it ain't doin it for you.

527
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:28,660
Don't give her a AH,
yeah, no, don't do that.

528
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,440
Just dead silence. Okay. She has
to know she, it's not working.

529
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,740
I don't know what to tell you dude.
I know I told this story before.

530
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:42,830
I hooked up with this girl one time and
we were having sex doggy style and you

531
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:46,490
know, when I come forward you're
supposed to back in, you know,

532
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,780
like we're clapping, uh, with crutches.

533
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,520
Is that a,
was that a fucking,

534
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,050
does that one of those dances with wolves
names clapping with crutches? Sorry.

535
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:01,870
Hacky joke.
Um,

536
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:03,880
okay.

537
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah, no, what she was doing when I went
back, she went back, when I went forward,

538
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,280
she went forward. So I was
inner, but there was no friction.

539
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,700
So I was starting to have a performance
problem before I ever so gently put one

540
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,470
hand on her hip and the other
on the back of her neck.

541
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:15,700
And just sort of stopped her.

542
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,550
Okay.

543
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,940
Went back and then pulled her, but
it still didn't work. It was like,

544
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:24,600
not only does she not know how to do it,
she was I think almost as tall as I was,

545
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,800
you know, so doggy style, you know, they
got to have the kind of like, you know,

546
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,180
you can get a little too high there,
you know, without getting too graphic.

547
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,020
So I was already dealing
with that, you know? Um,

548
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,380
I don't know. Beautiful
girl though. All right. Um,

549
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,810
okay.

550
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:47,310
Unexpected pregnancy. Oh,
Jesus. He's a rough this week.

551
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,800
Unexpected pregnancy bill. Absolutely
love the podcast and the stand up.

552
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,990
You like a skinny Louis C K or conversy
Louis C K is like a fat bill burr.

553
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,740
I really wish I didn't read
that. Uh, um, anyway, not sure.

554
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,130
Now I get dragged into it. Uh, and
I'm not exactly skinny anymore.

555
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,820
I've been having, I've been enjoying
the high life lately. Mila. Um,

556
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,960
anyway, to business. I'm a
24 year old guy from Sydney,

557
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:18,540
Australia who's run up
against a big problem.

558
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Last November I lost a well paying job
due to an anxiety disorder I've developed

559
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:28,840
over the years.
I sought out treatment,

560
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:32,830
been through therapy, had all sorts
of diets and breathing exercises.

561
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,580
And although recently it's been much
more manageable. It's unfortunate.

562
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,140
Unfortunately it wasn't enough to
hold onto my high pressure job.

563
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,040
You know what dude? Yeah, it
was probably the job. Granted,

564
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,860
I have no medical background whatsoever,
but I really don't, you know,

565
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,920
when you have to like eat a calm,
quiet and start going,

566
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,880
just so you can fucking go to work.
Hello.

567
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:56,900
Okay.

568
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,440
Oh Nia, how are you? Sorry. Just so
the door opened. Uh, the lovely Nia.

569
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,410
Everybody. Oh, you're busy. Okay. Um,

570
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,980
what was it that was when you know
that I was here. Oh, okay. All righty.

571
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,190
Well, I'll see ya feel
me along this week. Okay.

572
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,350
Um,
yeah dude,

573
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,690
when you have to fucking do shit
like that just to go to work,

574
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:27,310
it's probably the job. And considering
you developed it over the years,

575
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:30,730
let me guess, was it as you got this
fucking high pressure job? I don't know.

576
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,650
So anyways, um, uh,

577
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:37,060
currently I'm looking for
a more low key job anyways,

578
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,090
days after I'm let go,

579
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,290
I get a call from a friend I had
had drunken unprotected sex with.

580
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,640
The only reason why I went back to our
house was at our house was within walking

581
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:52,170
distance from the pub. We share a
bed in nature, takes its course.

582
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,550
Oh my God.

583
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,940
It was a core of it was of course
a risk and like any idiot mail,

584
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:03,000
I just assumed nothing would happen.
Turns out I'm going to be a dad.

585
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:06,780
Come August after a mere
one sexual indiscretion.

586
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,520
I've known this woman for over three
years. She successful, smart, witty,

587
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:16,470
and we get on really well.
I'll be getting on really well.

588
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,010
Uh, she is sorry. There was a
big space in a new paragraph.

589
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,540
I'm not that dumb people. Please,
please will still believe in me. Um,

590
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,100
she's been up up until now childless.

591
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,100
And you can understand her reasonings
for wanting to keep the spawn.

592
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,450
She expects me to play an active role
in the parenting game. And to be honest,

593
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:37,170
that's something I am wholeheartedly
prepared to do. That's so fucked up.

594
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,630
They like make the decision.
I mean cause it is their body.

595
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:43,920
They have to go through the procedure,
but it's just really, you're really just,

596
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:48,600
uh, you're just a fucking Tj's hose.

597
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,690
That's really all we are a,

598
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,910
we were both really irresponsible and we
should both have to pick up the pieces

599
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,660
and work shit out. Here's the problem.
She wants me to move in with her.

600
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,260
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

601
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,670
Okay.

602
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:07,630
Before I read any more the fuck that.
Anyways,

603
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,970
in fact she's demanded
I moved in with her.

604
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,010
A double fuck that she's making demands.
Go Fuck Yourself.

605
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,670
All right. I wish it did that
earlier. I wouldn't have been as um,

606
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,860
I can't help thinking that
this arrangement would
descend very quickly into

607
00:37:23,861 --> 00:37:27,790
mutual resentment and unhappiness
and would eventually be a detrimental

608
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,010
environment for the kid apps.
A fucking lutely.

609
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:34,420
I live with friends in the past and if a
dirty kitchen cook can cause irritation,

610
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,530
I don't know how shitting drooling
a shitting, drooling screaming baby,

611
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:40,210
we'll fly under the radar.

612
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,230
I want to move somewhere close by so
I can share their parenting duties.

613
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,440
But I don't see how moving
in is a better solution.

614
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,250
She is also asking for financial
support to the tune of half,

615
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,740
which the Shit I've spelled out
above surely makes this impossible.

616
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,933
Okay.

617
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,013
Um,

618
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:06,010
she's tit deep in an already blossomed
career and I'm doing my best to stay away

619
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:10,030
from the Dole or as
Americans say, welfare. Uh,

620
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:13,180
so I'm asking advice on two things.
How do I re

621
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,800
how do I relay my moving in doubts to a
hormonal pregnant woman without hurting

622
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:24,100
her feelings or making her feel
like she has to go, go at it alone.

623
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,930
And how can I spell it out to her that
I won't be able to be there for the baby

624
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:32,320
financially in the way she
wants Jesus Christ. Dude,

625
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,300
what else and how do you fucking
jumped to the moon? Uh, by the way,

626
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:42,220
when she told me about the pregnancy
in old Jesus arrived fully formed in my

627
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:45,030
mouth, go fuck yourself count. Um,

628
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,610
you just have to have an adult
conversation with her. Just be like,

629
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:55,070
look, who's kitten? Whoa. We're
not in love with one another.

630
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,890
You're not my soulmate.
I'm not your soulmate.

631
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,710
But we're both adults and we did this,
so we have to take responsibility. Okay.

632
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,963
Um,

633
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,430
I would still like to meet my
soulmate and I imagine you were too.

634
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,940
And we're not going to be
able to do that if we're,

635
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:16,980
if we're basically pretending
to be a couple, which we're not,

636
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,620
we're not. Okay. Uh, just look
at the baby like we both, we,

637
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:26,460
it's like a timeshare condo.
Sorry.

638
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,380
Um, no. Just to tell you, you,
you, you're not gonna move in.

639
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm not moving in with you. I'm going
to support you 100% with the baby. 100%,

640
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,410
but I'm not moving in. And when
she says why, I just be like, oh,

641
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,410
cause I'm not in love with you.

642
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,310
Okay,

643
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,750
we're not,
we're not getting married.

644
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,350
We screwed up and now we're
doing the right thing.

645
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:53,070
But um, yeah, I'm not moving
in. And what's she going to
do? Grab you by the throat.

646
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,890
Make you move in. No. Fuck this. And the
fact that she's making these demands,

647
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,770
she wants half of your money.
Well, this is the deal, dude.

648
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,170
You knocked a girl up and
now you got to fucking,

649
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,240
you got a kid coming so you got
to go make some money. All right.

650
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:10,710
And you do have to support the kid.
Um,

651
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,230
this is one of these fucked up things.
If she's got a great career,

652
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:19,150
why does she need half of your salary?
You know what I mean?

653
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,550
If you had a great career,
she wouldn't even fucking work.

654
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,990
Why don't you say this? All right.
How about this? Why don't I be Mr Mom.

655
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:30,940
I'll stay home with the kid and you go
out and work and you support me. I'll,

656
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,870
I'll wear a fucking apron.
Have added Lady,

657
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,730
go put on your Nancy Reagan power suit
and fucking have added. Yeah, Dude,

658
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,590
look what, what, what do you,

659
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,590
I know you got the double whammy
here. I, this is, I wouldn't,

660
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,120
I wouldn't do a double header here,

661
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,930
although the conversation
might go in that direction,

662
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:54,960
but I would definitely not tell her that
I'm, um, I'm moving in with her. Does,

663
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:59,370
there's no fucking way. There's no
way that that's happening. All right?

664
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,820
There's no way that that's happening.
Um, cause I'm not in love with you.

665
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,850
Okay. And let her ham, let her hall, let
her cry, let her scream, but a throw shit.

666
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,720
Let her do whatever the fuck she wants to
do. Yeah, you're not moving in with her,

667
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,720
sir. All right. Don't do it.

668
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,330
Yeah.

669
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:23,130
No, go to bed with the price
on your head. No, don't do it.

670
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,510
I'm sorry Beretta. Don't
fucking do it. All right.

671
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,530
And then as far as like a,
you know,

672
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,890
supporting your kid,
you got to do it.

673
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,610
You got to give her the money. You
can't have that, this kid. Okay.

674
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,810
Isn't an unbelievably unf unfortunate
situation and you have to make the best of

675
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:45,080
it.
And you guys have to be friends.

676
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,560
And that's another reason
for not moving in. You know,

677
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,400
w what are you gonna sleep in the
same bed? Like you're married.

678
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:57,910
Like you love each. I mean,
you can't fucking do it, so,

679
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,060
okay.

680
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,290
Um, I dunno, but as far
as the money thing, yeah.

681
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,690
You got to go out and start making some
money and if you have to sleep on a

682
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:11,650
Fuckin futon or whatever, believe me,
that's going to be better than having,

683
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,580
you know, some 18 year
old kids someday who, uh,

684
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,380
had a shit childhood because of you.

685
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:20,350
And then you got to deal with that and
then try and put the pieces together when

686
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:22,750
you're on your fucking death bed. You
don't want to do that either. But uh,

687
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:27,550
as far as moving in,
fuck that move close by and uh,

688
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:30,490
that's it. It's not up
for discussion. Okay.

689
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:32,090
And she can make all the fucking demand.

690
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,550
She wants to demands fucking dope.
You made a,

691
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,080
she made a mistake to, to fuck. She'd make
it demands out of you four. Furthermore,

692
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:44,230
why the fuck you? Why you? Why
you worry about it. All right.

693
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,820
She can't force you to move in. So fuck
her. All right with a condom next time,

694
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:50,380
sir.

Um, is that it? Is that it for the,

719
00:44:12,821 --> 00:44:15,160
I think that's it for the ad stuff.
Here's something I saw.

720
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,540
I was trying to get something to
talk about on the podcast here.

721
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,700
Um, so I looked up to drudge
report cause I always here,

722
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:27,830
this is like something that people look
at and they were talking about newt,

723
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:33,030
Newt Gingrich's ex wife unloads
on camera network debates,

724
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:38,661
the ethics of airing what she said about
her former husband before the South

725
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,150
Carolina primary.
Okay.

726
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:45,300
And you guys know like when I talk about
hockey and you have no idea what I'm

727
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:50,040
talking about. This, this is my version
of South Carolina primary for what?

728
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,960
What is Newt Gingrich running for?

729
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,100
Mayor of South Carolina or senator?
Is that what it'd be?

730
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,210
I don't pay attention to the
shift. Um, so anyways, it gets,

731
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:05,211
his is Marlene Gingrich has said she
could end her ex husband's career with a

732
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:08,880
single interview.
Oh Hell hath no fury.

733
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:13,530
Just take the fucking alimony. What
did he, oh Denny Denny do something.

734
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,800
Wasn't she sick in the hospital?
And he kind of tagged somebody else.

735
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,400
Why did he think he could get away
with it? With a giant head of his? Um,

736
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,270
anyways, earlier this week, she
sat before ABC News Cameras.

737
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,960
She spoke to ABC News reporter Brian
Ross for two hours in her explosive

738
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,790
revelations are set to rock the trial.
What trial?

739
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:44,140
I don't fucking know. It's just another
ex wife. Just going. Absolutely. Why?

740
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,340
Why would you do that?

741
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,160
Don't you biting the hand that feeds
as much as you hate this guy and he was

742
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:55,750
probably a piece of shit to you. I mean,
you really going to affect his ability.

743
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,390
If he doesn't win that political office,

744
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,110
how can he pay for your Mercedes
with all that fucking hush money?

745
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,250
All the bribe money he's going
to get. You know how cow can,

746
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:11,120
how are you going to afford to get your
hair and nails did every fucking two

747
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:13,070
weeks,
you know,

748
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:16,310
if he doesn't have a job where he gets
to look the other way as people pour shit

749
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:17,180
in the water supply.

750
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,200
Okay.

751
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,660
For God's Sakes, woman had, have
you, have you thought this through?

752
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,720
I don't fucking know. All right,
what am I doing here? Is that,

753
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:27,750
is that all the advertising?

754
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,110
I got to make sure I didn't miss any of
the fucking advertise and they always

755
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:32,760
end up flipping out at me. Oh, you know,

756
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,020
he's supposed to read it and you didn't
read it. You just go through the,

757
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,560
couldn't you read it earlier?
I think that was it. All right.

758
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:45,500
That was it for the other than the
Amazon stuff. And I say that every week.

759
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,250
You know what? Where am I in the podcast
right now? 46 fucking minutes in.

760
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,870
Look at me wheezing across the
fucking finish line this week.

761
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,430
You know what? I actually had a
great week. Really built. Well,

762
00:46:58,431 --> 00:47:03,020
it hasn't translated into a great podcast.
You unfunny cons, right? I know, I know.

763
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:07,460
It's been a little lack luster.
Little Fuck and lack luster.

764
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,540
Um, dear billion, I know
this is last minute. Oh,

765
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:13,910
I didn't even tell you guys
why I had a great week.

766
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:16,940
I went out and I did a bunch of stand up
in this bill was like four things that

767
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:20,630
I've been working on meticulously
crafting in front of tourists down at the

768
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:23,390
comedy store.
And uh,

769
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:29,170
I suddenly I figured out a through
line where it all connected. Like,

770
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,780
give me that shit. When people
say, you know, you don't
know how to write a script,

771
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:33,940
just start writing a bunch of themes,

772
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,510
just write little vignettes and then
somehow they all stick together,

773
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:41,830
which you never fucking works. Um, that's
like you're trying to build a house,

774
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:45,950
just start hammering shit.
Um,

775
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,710
but it actually worked out with the
standup thing. I have a nice through line.

776
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,230
I have a new chunk of shit
that I've strung together,

777
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:57,790
like some cheesy thing with a bunch of
beads and some native person that was

778
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,910
supplanted through genocide is now
sitting on the fucking curb out.

779
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:05,490
Now what does it Honolulu is that
when I saw them, um, supplanted,

780
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,800
is that a word?
Relocated Valentine's Day advice.

781
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:13,660
Billy by deer is billion.
I know this is last minute.

782
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,090
I had a question about Valentine's Day.

783
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:19,420
I am a single guy in my
mid twenties rejoice,

784
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,440
okay,

785
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,970
dude,
I'm going to tell you right now,

786
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:29,140
if you're a single guy in
your mid twenties and you
live in America and you're

787
00:48:29,391 --> 00:48:31,580
living on your own,
please

788
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,580
drop to your knees and thank whatever
God you pray to every day because you're

789
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,140
never going to be freer in your life.

790
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,840
I know you'll probably get student
loans and blah, blah, blah.

791
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:45,500
This stress and all that
bullshit. Fuck that. Okay?

792
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,960
Did never going to be freer in your life.

793
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,210
Go get three years supplies of condoms,
okay,

794
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,500
and bang away my friend. Maybe you
don't need to do it for three years.

795
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:00,180
Maybe you're one of those
guys for only three weeks,

796
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:03,660
but you need to get it out of
your system. All right? He says,

797
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:07,500
I never really had a girlfriend
for whatever reason. Oh,
Jesus Christ. All right,

798
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,080
we'll go on the whole other other way.
Truth be told,

799
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:14,010
my friends could name numerous
reasons why I don't have a girlfriend,

800
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,070
but that's an entirely different issue.
Well,

801
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:19,560
Jesus Christ as a fucking can of worms.

802
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,613
They could.

803
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,420
You don't seem defensive or argumentative.

804
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,750
So I don't know if it's an anger
issue that look well, I'm so,

805
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:33,200
I'm so sick of trying to be fucking
Hannibal Lecter here to try to guess what

806
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:37,580
your shoes look like with w with the
way you're right, you know. All right.

807
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:39,980
I'm just going to read the rest
of this shit. Uh, as of right now,

808
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:43,490
I am currently sleeping with three
girls off. Oh, so you're fucking,

809
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:47,060
you're good knocking it out. I thought
you'd like never had a girlfriend like,

810
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:49,760
and you'd never bagged
anybody. All right. My fault.

811
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,600
All right.

812
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,330
Do go fuck yourself.

813
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:57,760
You're a guy in your mid twenties and
you fucking three girls right now and I'm

814
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:01,380
on this. You need advice? Uh,
keep doing what you're doing

815
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,140
anyways, depending on what day of the
week it is and how much I've drank. Okay.

816
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:10,230
That depends on how many
girls he's banging. Ah, I've
never lied to any of the,

817
00:50:10,231 --> 00:50:15,231
any of any of them about where
our relationship is going.

818
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,670
And although they never met each other,

819
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:23,220
each of them has an idea that I'm seeing
other girls. It's kind of a don't ask,

820
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:28,100
don't tell policy. Uh, yeah dude and
I, you got to come with that. You know,

821
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,460
you can open with that. You know,
what are you doing? I'm dating,

822
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,940
I'm playing the field.
Find people you date right now.

823
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,990
A couple of people kind of see
it just having a good time. Well,

824
00:50:39,991 --> 00:50:42,600
I don't do stuff like that.
Well there's the door sweetheart.

825
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,750
Okay.

826
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,530
Then they'll respect like that.
The honesty of that. Some won't.

827
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:50,420
Some will actually have
self esteem and walked out,

828
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:53,720
but a lot of them they'll hang
around eventually the tire,

829
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:57,720
their net gets weak and they'll
fall right in your fucking Dick. Um,

830
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,360
birthdays and Christmas are always a
piece of cake because all that requires a

831
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:06,530
quick text or a phone call or at
the very most drinks at the bar.

832
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,090
But Valentine's Day is tricky.

833
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,900
Our dates consist of bar
hopping and drunk sex.

834
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:16,490
So flowers and a nice dinner would
completely send the wrong message. Dude,

835
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:17,400
you selfish con.

836
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:21,200
Are you asking me how to keep banging
these three chicks while getting through

837
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:22,250
Valentine's Day?

838
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,570
Why don't you just look at the Valentine's
Day like that's your pussy getting

839
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,570
all star break.

840
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,770
Just take three days off the day
before the day after and the day of.

841
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,020
Okay.

842
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,020
Just say a,
what are you doing for Valentine's Day?

843
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,950
Um,
uh,

844
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,000
going to be a Jesus. Where are
you going to be? I don't know.

845
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,280
I don't have a good one for that
one. All right. You know what?

846
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:47,460
I just put myself in your shoes and I
understand your problem now. He said,

847
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:49,050
I got to do a little bit of trouble.
Last year,

848
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,240
one of the girls texted me and said,
you know,

849
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,760
every girl likes flowers
on Valentine's Day.

850
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,940
Okay.

851
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,070
He said, I knew my
response couldn't be. Yeah,

852
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:02,090
but if I get you flowers then I have
to get flowers for all the other girls.

853
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:07,010
So I just pushed out and
responded. Yeah. Well, oh dude,

854
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:08,480
you shouldn't respond to it at all.

855
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:09,930
Yeah.

856
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,870
You know, every girl likes to get flowers
on Valentine's Day. Isn't that funny?

857
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,420
And that has nothing to do with most
likely her having any sort of feelings

858
00:52:18,421 --> 00:52:19,254
towards you.

859
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,620
It's just the bitch next to her and
the other cubicle probably got some,

860
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,730
you know why the girl on their fucking,
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

861
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,150
Some guy broke my balls this
week is fucking hilarious.

862
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:34,020
He was trashing me say come off as a
pompous ass because I always talk about

863
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,460
anybody who doesn't do comedy
works in a cubicle, you know,

864
00:52:38,461 --> 00:52:41,790
and for some reason he decided to take
that seriously and tell me that he

865
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,450
actually works at the UN and
travels all around the world.

866
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:54,430
If that's actually true, sir. How? Why
don't you just get on with doing that?

867
00:52:54,431 --> 00:52:57,310
You work at the UN and you
travel all over the world.

868
00:52:57,311 --> 00:53:00,970
Why would you give a fuck
what some absolute jackass is?

869
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:05,110
Say It on a fucking podcast. How
insecure are you? Your insecurities?

870
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:08,560
Probably a great thing because that's
probably the thing that drove you to be at

871
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,090
the UN where you travel

872
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,970
all around the world.

873
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,330
You know what sir? Good
for you. That's awesome.

874
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,430
I hope working at the UN and travel

875
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,340
rolling all around the world

876
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:25,060
fills you up some point where it fills
you up high enough where you don't have

877
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,440
to respond to a silly joke
on some dumb ass podcast.

878
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,740
Um,
I travel all around the world.

879
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,960
Um, you know what? That's
actually a great fucking job.

880
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,640
Do you feel like you get anything done?
You know,

881
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,210
do you sit there wearing that head piece
next to that guy who was wearing the

882
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:50,140
water buffalo hat?
I'd bet there'd be about doing that shit.

883
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,050
And you're sitting there trying to talk
to him about how you can sell your Ritz

884
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:54,220
crackers to their country.

885
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:58,390
Is that what you're doing when you're
traveling all around the world?

886
00:53:58,391 --> 00:54:01,210
I travel all around the world.

887
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,790
I can just see you on the plane
with your fucking dress socks on.

888
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:14,680
You have a dash. Oh,
just sitting there. Well,

889
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:18,980
what movies am I going to watch on this
flight as I travel all around the world?

890
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:24,780
Um, anyways. You know
something sir, you had you,

891
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:28,280
you had the James Bond job and then
you fucking, you played yourself.

892
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:30,410
I don't know why you did that.
Why would you fucking,

893
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,380
that's like me responding to people
on Twitter. Why would I do it?

894
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:37,010
I should pretend like I have
better things to do. Um, anyways,

895
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,250
I want to keep seeing all these
girls back to this guy, but this,

896
00:54:40,251 --> 00:54:44,450
but at the same time, I don't want
any broken hearts on Valentine's Day.

897
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:45,760
Yeah.

898
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,150
Oh, to do you know what I did? I don't,
I'm just, what is your problem here?

899
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,040
Okay,

900
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,430
dude. Yeah. You like a Gemini. It's
like you're this fucking lady killer.

901
00:54:54,431 --> 00:54:57,010
Then also you kind of like, you
know, you don't want to hurt anybody.

902
00:54:57,011 --> 00:54:58,840
Should I get her some jam jams?

903
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,013
Yeah.

904
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,690
I can't even,
I went and talked to the fucking UN guy.

905
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:05,040
What the hell was going on here again?

906
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,330
Okay.

907
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,210
Valentine's Day got a little
trouble last year. Well, listen,

908
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,750
you're anticipating trouble. Didn't you
learn anything from last year? You know,

909
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,420
every girl likes flowers
on Valentine's Day.

910
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,000
Yeah.

911
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,690
Um, what, what would I write back?

912
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,760
I know what my response would be.

913
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:27,520
The second I read that if it was just
some girl I was banging and then they

914
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:30,730
wrote that I would get this
awful feeling in my stomach.

915
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:32,780
Yeah.

916
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,410
And I would, I would read it and
as I got that awful feeling, I go

917
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:38,960
and make that noise.

918
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,040
Yeah.

919
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,350
You know that thing like when you're
just banging a girl and then all of a

920
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:44,210
sudden she just fucking
makes that comment.

921
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:45,880
Okay.

922
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,820
You know, you think she's on
the same page as you. When did,

923
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:51,010
she just makes that comment,
you know,

924
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:54,310
I was thinking about you today and you
just feel that feeling in your stomach.

925
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,400
Oh yeah.
Well don't

926
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:05,130
fucking worst. Ah, you
gotta be one and done,

927
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,330
but one had done is scary.

928
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:07,970
Okay.

929
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:11,090
You just gotta be honest. I don't know if
some girls, what would I say? You know,

930
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:13,100
every girl likes flowers
on Valentine's Day.

931
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:21,190
Um, what would I text back? Yeah. You
know, that's what I heard. You know what?

932
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:22,540
I don't, you know what? I
shouldn't give you shit.

933
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:25,060
I don't have a good response to that.
Well,

934
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:27,610
maybe some day you'll meet a
guy who wants to give you some,

935
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,720
you want to get drunk and fuck. Um, yeah,

936
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,460
I got nothing and you can't ignore it.

937
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:36,850
You know what I would've done?

938
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,920
I would have ignored the texts
than I would've called her.

939
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:44,110
But a good three hours later, three,
four hours, three hours later,

940
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:46,930
that's a good one. You call
her, you ignore that text.
Then he called and she goes,

941
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:51,430
hell, ah. And you're like, Hey, what's
going on? What are you doing tonight?

942
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:54,340
I got no plans. Valentine's
Day. What are you doing?

943
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,310
And he just started with
that. And then she, well,

944
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:02,710
when he went again, and she'll be seen,
if you're gonna take it and some romantic,

945
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,873
you know,

946
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:10,070
direction and you don't,
you just keep it in the fuck buddy.

947
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,850
So I figured we'd go down to why meet
hammers, whatever the fuck he call,

948
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,190
we go down to, uh, take it the face.

949
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,340
I have a couple pitchers of
beer and see what happens.

950
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,753
Yeah,

951
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,730
Dude, you know what? You're, you're,

952
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,010
it seems to me you're not
just fucking these girls.

953
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:31,740
You're actually having like these
mini relationships with them.

954
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,430
You don't.
The the key to have an a fuck buddy is,

955
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:43,390
is the time between fucking him and I
don't give a shit how much a woman says

956
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:49,310
that she can handle it. Most of
them can't. Most of them can't.

957
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:53,220
If you fucking come on over there and you,
and it just,

958
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,320
eventually they're going to get feelings.
They're more,

959
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:00,560
I don't know if they're more mature
or if it's a defect. It's just,

960
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,200
I just respect the fact that
that's how they're wired. So you,

961
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,930
if you have a fuck buddy, okay, let's,
let's just do the math. Okay, now,

962
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,040
now February is a very short month here.
So let's just say right out of the gate,

963
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,930
you fuck her on February 2nd

964
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:16,580
okay.

965
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,220
All right.

966
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:22,220
You shouldn't come around again till at
least the 17th and progress you fuck and

967
00:58:22,981 --> 00:58:26,120
you leave f and l,

968
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,800
you fuck them and then you leave.
You don't bang her on the second.

969
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:33,140
You Bang it on the second and then you
bang her on the seventh year in a fucking

970
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:34,970
relationship in their world.

971
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,573
You know,

972
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,400
unless you literally this second
you have an orgasm as you're coming,

973
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:46,800
you're scooping up your clothes
and you walk out like half naked,

974
00:58:46,801 --> 00:58:50,550
then you just bizarre is another
good way to keep them at bay.

975
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,270
And why don't I just read
the rest as to see what it,

976
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,950
what is questioned is here he says,
I want to keep seeing all these girls,

977
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,870
but at the same time
I don't want to break.

978
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,450
I don't want any broken hearts
on Valentine's Day. Yeah,

979
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:03,900
you want to keep fucking all of
them now do what you have to have.

980
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,180
You have to have a road evolving door.

981
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:10,170
You have to have a stable of women if
you're going to live this life or you have

982
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,680
to give into fucking rubbing one out,
all right?

983
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,950
But you can't be a relationship guy
with three different women cause you are

984
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:19,800
going to end up hurting them.
So what you have to constantly be doing,

985
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:22,850
you gotta be like a college.
All right?

986
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,400
Every year you lose some top prospects,
but you're out there recruiting. Okay?

987
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,650
So you, so you maintain, but it's
never ending. It's fucking exhausting.

988
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,470
But if that's the game you want to play,
that's what you have to do.

989
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,900
So that girl who says,
you know,

990
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:43,760
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's
Day right there, you put on waivers,

991
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,290
okay, for a fucking piece
of ass to be named later,

992
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:53,240
you guys got to get rid of her,
okay?

993
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,920
And you got to look,

994
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,510
go back and analyze what the fuck you
did wrong that she felt it was okay for

995
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:03,290
her to text you cause you fucked up.
That right there shows that you fucked up,

996
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,430
that she felt that she could send that to
you if you think you just fuck buddies.

997
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,480
All right? So anyways,
he continues. He says,

998
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:14,720
I know that likert or not,
this shit is important to women.

999
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,490
If I take one girl out on playing
favorites and setting a bad precedent,

1000
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,140
plus if she does that, check in Shit
on Facebook, I'm completely fucked.

1001
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:26,990
Yeah, dude, you're doing dirt bag shit.

1002
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,820
If you're a single guy and something
could happen that fucks you on Facebook,

1003
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,720
you're leaving these girls on anyways.
He says,

1004
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:38,390
if I take none of them out or do nothing,

1005
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:42,290
I have three irritable ladies on my hand.
Dude,

1006
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:46,190
are you gonna marry any of
them? No. Well then let them go.

1007
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,060
Why don't you have the balls to do that?
You know,

1008
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:53,930
when a team halfway through the season
just realized, do we? When in the shit,

1009
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,160
just pull a fucking Marlin's.
Just get rid of everybody

1010
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,710
and then you have fan bases
your Dick and they're gonna.

1011
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,940
He's gonna be pissed for awhile.

1012
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,690
Um,
but then you build it back up again.

1013
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,740
Build it back up again. You know, I dunno.

1014
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,590
Look through it. If you want to
be in a fucking relationship,

1015
01:01:19,591 --> 01:01:22,440
you know there's other ways about
going about it than doing this,

1016
01:01:22,441 --> 01:01:25,820
but you're trying to have your cake
and eat it too. Did you get you,

1017
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:28,620
you got three women right now,
your bang in three different women.

1018
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:31,050
Where's your confidence?
You know what you're doing.

1019
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,103
All right.

1020
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,630
Dump to keep one at bay
and then get two more.

1021
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,550
Then dump the other one to get
the other one. Just see them.

1022
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,990
You don't even dump them. You just
phase them out, phase them out.

1023
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,500
But the new recruits that you get in,
you gotta be straight up honest with them.

1024
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,400
You know, unless you actually feel
fails, you've, you feel are no feelings,

1025
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:56,920
you know, don't keep coming back fucking
him unless you know, you get that 15 day,

1026
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:58,820
okay,

1027
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,000
you fuck I'm on the second.
You fuck them on the 17th.

1028
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:03,920
Okay,

1029
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,360
then you're into March and
then bang her on like the 11th.

1030
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:08,660
Okay.

1031
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,170
All right. And even then, they
can't catch feelings doing that.

1032
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,720
But before you know it,
you know,

1033
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,170
okay,

1034
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:19,380
that's like 14, 15 days out of
the year taken up. You, well,

1035
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:21,630
you got to bank somebody.
This is such, this is,

1036
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:24,780
this is really should be eye opening to
women that I'm actually saying this is

1037
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:29,480
really a, this is really awful.
Not, I'm speaking this out loud. Um,

1038
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,780
he says,
in a perfect world,

1039
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,830
I'll take all of them out at once and
have the force and I've been chasing after

1040
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,410
my entire life,
but we don't always get what we want.

1041
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:41,220
Any advice from the lovely Nia
would be much appreciated as well.

1042
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:45,480
Love the podcasts. Go
Fuck Yourself. Uh, yeah.

1043
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:48,060
She probably wouldn't have been
his, uh, understanding as I was,

1044
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:52,470
even though I gave you a
lot of shit. Um, anyways,

1045
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:55,950
that's the podcast for
this week or a buddy. Um,

1046
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:01,770
and I don't, I don't have any, I'm
fucking tapped out. Tapped out.

1047
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:03,360
It's been fucking three
days under a truck.

1048
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:04,890
Okay.

1049
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:08,910
Not really doing anything. Just watching
Titus do the whole fucking thing.

1050
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,140
Um, anyways, uh, thanks to
Christopher Titus for, uh,

1051
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:14,940
helped me with the brakes on my truck.

1052
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,600
Thanks everybody who's been a
continuing to download my special,

1053
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:23,130
which is a tremendous and a,
if you want to help out somebody,

1054
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:27,270
uh, or just check out something great,
uh, please check out a sound city.

1055
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:30,780
The new Dave Grohl, um, documentary.

1056
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:32,930
I cannot recommend it highly enough.
Uh,

1057
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,140
it's 12 bucks off his website
and money well spent and a,

1058
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:39,540
when that fucker comes out on DVD,
I'm going to buy it.

1059
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,430
I like having the gold behind my money.

1060
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:43,320
I don't like downloading
shit and then just,

1061
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:44,873
you know,

1062
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,020
then it's just on this thing

1063
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:51,550
and then this thing dies and
then that thing fucking crashes.

1064
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,550
And then I don't have it anymore. You
know what I mean? I don't like that shit.

1065
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:59,320
All right, I'm rambling. Go
fuck yourselves. I'll talk
to you next week and, uh, oh,

1066
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:01,360
I know why. There's nothing to
talk about. Football's over.

1067
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:06,540
It's fucking over. It's fucking over, man.
