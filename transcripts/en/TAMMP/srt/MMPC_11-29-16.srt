1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,151
Hey,

2
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:05,600
what's going on is bill burn is time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:08,660
November 28th,

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,580
2016 and I'm doing on November 29th
at Tuesday. What's going on? How, why?

5
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:18,200
Yeah. Um, I am okay. Case. You
were wondering. I got a little,

6
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:18,981
uh,
I don't know.

7
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:22,130
I got a little s I've been fighting off
this cough for like two fucking weeks.

8
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:25,580
Who's kidding? Who? Right.
And I, uh, you know,

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,100
I was fighting off and it was
getting worse and he kept going.

10
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:32,540
Why don't you take some medicine? Why did
I say take, take some of this new youth,

11
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:36,080
the next, all right.
Holy Shit. Half fucking,

12
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:39,290
my hat's off to anybody that can get
fucking drunk off their, that stuff.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,490
Jesus Christ.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,040
That's like peppermint Schnapps
Times fucking 20. Really?

15
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:50,030
It's Musinex. It's like schnapps
on steroids. It's just, you know,

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,110
one of the,
you know,

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,400
the other ones of these dumb champ
challenges like the mannequin challenge.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,140
I don't understand.
What is the challenge?

19
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,230
Just hold still has somebody
pans around the room.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,900
That's a fucking challenge. How the fuck
did we go from faking a lunar landing,

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,200
faking that,
faking out the whole fucking Russians.

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,640
And they got so freaked out that day day
when they went on a hissy fit for the

23
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,930
next fucking 30 years before they finally
went broke. Right in the early nineties

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,010
cause we, we accepted the challenge
of the faking of the lunar land.

25
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:27,960
Maybe we even got there, the Lunar Lander
Atlantic challenge. Now we're fucking,

26
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:30,580
oh, the mannequin. Oh, planking. Yeah.

27
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,430
I lay face down and somebody
takes a picture of me.

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,360
Oh Jesus Christ.

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,100
I don't know what the
f you know what it is,

30
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:44,020
is he's fucking Goddamn cuts young people
these days, you know, no offense, right?

31
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,063
God blushes.

32
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,700
Let's say fucking spend their whole
lives with these fucking reality,

33
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:52,540
virtual reality. God Damn things on
their head. They're playing video games.

34
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,770
They don't have any skills to second,
you take the fucking laptop,

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,560
you take the fucking laser tag thing,
the pink gun,

36
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,840
whatever the fuck technology
is. The thing that, you know,

37
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,580
that new thing that they're trying to
get old people into the virtual reality,

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,060
like, like live in a fucking
life is it isn't enough.

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,030
Like I want to leave this
fucking world. Really. You

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,840
wrote of both through the fucking
canal. You haven't done shit. All right,

41
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,720
so this is the deal. They don't fucking
know how to fucking do anything.

42
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,240
This is such an old man rent not to do
anything that just fucking literally

43
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:35,520
laying face down in the road, you know,
and somebody takes a picture is, is this,

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,630
it's epic. It's fucking
epic. Now granted in the 70s,

45
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:43,810
they did have pet rock, so I might be
full of Shit. But you know what it is,

46
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:47,230
the great thing about being
old is you lack perspective.

47
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:51,820
When you talk about anything new, you're
just like, that's different. It scares me.

48
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,430
Um, I don't get the mannequin
challenge. I don't, you know,

49
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,070
and that, that was like
the hell. So had the, uh,

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,420
whatever the Harlem shake was initially
it was a dance and then it was just that

51
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:09,190
stupid youtube. They, the ice
bucket challenge, all of that shit.

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,170
You know, if your instincts
aren't immediately to not
be part of the group. Um,

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,930
I don't know what that says about you.

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,080
I don't want it says about me that I
immediately ice buck or everybody's doing

55
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,550
it.
Well then fucking I'm not doing it.

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,380
Anti social sick. Freckled headed bald
current. What's wrong with you today?

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,990
Hang on a second.
Rico law.

58
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,030
Yeah. So I've been fighting this fucking
thing off. You know, I have a bad feeling.

59
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:43,870
It might be one the cigar that I
got that there's something in there,

60
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,940
some sort of bacteria because I was fine.

61
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:50,941
And then I smoked with first he on his
birthday and then I smoked with Bobby

62
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,990
Kelly had fucking comics come
home back to back nights.

63
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,800
And then I just had this fucking
cough. You know, it's Nike Inhale,

64
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,380
the Goddamn things. It's not like
I smoked one every fucking day.

65
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:06,130
I smoke one like once every two weeks or
they've been a little bit of a bender.

66
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:10,600
Okay. Um, so anyways, so Sunday night,

67
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,740
you know, it's been a good 15 days
since I smoked. All right. I'll smoke.

68
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:18,310
Another one went down with my buddy.
We watched the Broncos chiefs game,

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,580
arguably the greatest Sunday
night football game ever.

70
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,270
I lost track of how many fucking
lead changes there were. Um,

71
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,950
just, you know, and I wasn't drinking.
I haven't drank since thanksgiving.

72
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,920
I kind of bottomed out thanksgiving.
Right. You know, a speck.

73
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,450
I had a great thanksgiving, by the
way. Great fucking thanksgiving. Um,

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,990
we ended up day. Talk about that
already. I think I already did.

75
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,820
Maybe it didn't. I don't remember. Or I
started Taco. I hadn't gone to it yet.

76
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,980
That's right. That's what
it was. Listen to this shit.

77
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,450
We went to somebody else's for
Thanksgiving and everything
was fucking delicious.

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,990
Every side was fucking not only delicious.

79
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:03,580
It was a home run set. Best thanksgiving
I've had since I've been a kid.

80
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,450
When I eat my mom, my parent's
house, you know, my mother cooked.

81
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,660
So it just automatically taste right.
Cause that's the only thanksgiving,

82
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,980
you know. Right. But at once you move out,

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
you're eating other people's
food and no matter what,

84
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,590
it's always a little bit different.
It's not quite the same.

85
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,650
You get that feeling of, fuck, it's over.

86
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,430
I have to pay rent now I'm
going to get old, right?

87
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm going to be that person.

88
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:32,610
What happened to him and then I fucking
die and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

89
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,140
and all that bullshit. Right? So anyways,

90
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,240
we had a great fucking Thanksgiving and
I had this fucking bottle of Bourbon

91
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,200
that I brought. That was my
responsibility. When the fuck is my phone,

92
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,810
I got to give this thing shout out man.
And you know,

93
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:51,400
they say you can't judge a book
by, by it's fucking cover. Um,

94
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,150
I actually judged this bottle of just
by how cool the fucking bottle looked.

95
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:58,370
So let me scroll through my, it was
called angels and something or other,

96
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,171
by the way,

97
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:03,380
it rained like a motherfucker out here
and I have water collecting up on my roof.

98
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:07,130
Again, fucking cons. It's unbelievable.

99
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,340
It's just fucking, it's just,
it's just not even right.

100
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,630
So I got to get the third fucking people
out here to see if they know how to fix

101
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:19,260
it. Ah, God damn. And I thought I took
a picture of it. Nah, I got to find it.

102
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:23,610
Hang on a second. You know
what, me hit pause. I'll hit
pause. All right. I found it.

103
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,070
Angel's envy. It's a
Kentucky Bourbon. God Damn,

104
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
it was that delicious.
And I'm me and two other people.

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,360
We finished the bottle and uh, I
dunno, I got like two, my last one.

106
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:39,790
And I was just like, you
know what? I think this, uh,

107
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,290
I think it's time for me to shut it down.
You know,

108
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,880
maybe once in a while that drink and just
gets a little bit too fucking far and

109
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:52,350
then I just shut it down. So I walked
away cold Turkey, thanksgiving night,

110
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,960
cold Turkey. I fucking
walked away from it. And um,

111
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,983
you know,

112
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,310
not gonna lie to you. I miss
it. It's only been four days.

113
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:06,720
I'm still thinking about you sending
it letters and shit. Um, yeah,

114
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:08,910
I'm just going to shut it
down probably until, um,

115
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,770
I'd say maybe the Rose Bowl New Year's
day or whatever. I already got it,

116
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:16,500
shut it down and get a fucking kid
coming so it's over. You know what,

117
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,560
you know what people, I gotta
be honest. I had a great run.

118
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,470
I got the stories, you
know, I spent a few,

119
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,520
a few hours in jail. I mean I've done,
you know, went to court. I had the whole,

120
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:32,160
you know,
had to apologize to people.

121
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:36,060
I had a very full experience with alcohol,
you know,

122
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,530
talk to some chicks that were way
out of my league. You know, I,

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,020
I did it. I had the whole thing, you know,

124
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,560
stayed on the outskirts of bar fights
to make sure that I didn't get pummeled.

125
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,020
So that's it. So anyways, um, believe
it or not, as bad as my cough sounds,

126
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,880
it's way better than it was
fucking yesterday. I was going to,

127
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,980
wasn't going to put you through that
shit. So anyways, so Sunday night, yeah,

128
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,140
smoked it on one of those
cigars and yesterday I woke up,

129
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:09,690
but just so was having a fucking coffin
fit. Granted I was already run down.

130
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,810
So yesterday, um, I didn't
do shit. I got to tell you,

131
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:18,750
that was like the greatest six
hours of my life, not doing shit.

132
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,580
But somewhere in that six hours after
the six hours I was going out of my

133
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:27,450
fucking mind. I don't know how you
guys do it, you know, not you guys.

134
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:30,810
Just whoever the fuck is out there that
just can just truly take a goddamn day

135
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:35,370
off I go fucking nuts. After six
hours was great. I laid there,

136
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,940
I watched like two,
three episodes of um,

137
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,570
Westworld getting caught up.
I'm up to like episode six,

138
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,610
I'm going to watch today.
Right.

139
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,240
And I'm loving that show.

140
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:52,710
Although he can't watch more than two
or three a day. It's just too much man.

141
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,990
It's like you just gotta be you.

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,490
It's a lot of shit going
on to kind of take it.

143
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,900
And then also having now doing my own
little show, that's only a half hour.

144
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,340
When I look at that show I just think of
like how fucking long did it take them

145
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,174
to do this?

146
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,050
And then I'm going to sit here and I'm
going to watch it in two days and then be

147
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,830
that douche going when season two
coming out. You know, it's like,

148
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:21,150
it's a fine bottle of wine and I'm
just going to Chug the thing, you know,

149
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,810
after the third glass, I'm not really
tasting it anymore cause I'm so hammered.

150
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,310
I might as well be drinking like fucking
red, white and Blue Beers. Some shit,

151
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,330
right. Just doesn't
seem right. So anyways,

152
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,520
that's what I did yesterday and um, I'm
feeling much better. Thank Christ. So,

153
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,070
um, by the way, today's November 29th,

154
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,640
which is the five year anniversary since
the passing of one of the funniest and

155
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,760
greatest people I ever met,

156
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:52,761
Patrice O'neil and speaking of which
there are still some tickets left for the,

157
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,600
uh, the fifth annual Patrice
O'Neal comedy benefit. Um,

158
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,290
all the proceeds after we pay for
the, uh, the venue, of course,

159
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,910
our only expense, um, you know,

160
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,460
it goes to all of his loved ones.
It's been a tremendous success.

161
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:12,740
And this year we have, we have, um,

162
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,930
let's get the whole lineup here
for God's sakes. For God's sakes.

163
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,250
We've got Leslie Jones, we've got
rich foss, we got Bobby Kelly,

164
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,970
Keith Robinson, Gary Gulman, Dan's soda,

165
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,680
so right. And myself. Um,

166
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,490
it's going to be another great year of,
um,

167
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm just getting to see all those people,
you know,

168
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,680
I never get to see them anymore because
I'm always out here gigging on the road

169
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,190
or living out here in la, but pop up up
above. So, um, that's going to be, uh,

170
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,160
Tuesday,
February 21st at the New York City Center.

171
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,500
And um, you know, it's just a,
it's just a great event and um,

172
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,630
thank you to everybody who's come
to it in the past years and um,

173
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,700
you've guys have done a wonderful thing.

174
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,940
I'm keeping all his loved ones comfortable
and I'm very proud of that whole

175
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:10,590
charity thing because, um, you know,
as tragic as it was that he was gone,

176
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:14,550
I'm very proud of the fact that all of
his friends stepped up and that all of

177
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,550
his loved ones are comfortable cause I
know that that's what he would have been

178
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,880
concerned with. So with that, um,

179
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm actually doing another benefit for
those. You can't make it to New York City.

180
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:29,010
If you're in the La area
and you would like to, um,

181
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,860
you'd like to help out on another benefit.

182
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,840
I have another buddy of mine that died.

183
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,290
So what happens when you get into your
forties, man, it's fucking brutal.

184
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,250
Is a couple of your buddies die too young
man, it's awful. This Guy Pete coming,

185
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,350
I started out with him in um, 1992, um,

186
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,590
did stand up with them from 92 to 99
and then he moved on to writing with

187
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:54,520
National Lampoon. He did some stuff for
the UFC. Just a great guy. Unfortunately

188
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,030
he had a heart attack a few weeks ago
and about a month ago. So, uh, Tuesday,

189
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,040
December 6th at the laugh factory,

190
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,790
I'll be doing a headlining set
there and I'm a bunch of pizzas,

191
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,740
friends from back in the day,
a bunch of comics.

192
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,670
We haven't all been on the same
show in forever. Probably 20 years.

193
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,740
We'll be going on, um,
earlier in the night. Uh,

194
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,950
it's going to be a great thing and a,
it's in memory of him. So there you go.

195
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,610
So enough with the friends of mine that
have passed away unfortunately. Um,

196
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,790
and let's talk about some
shit here. I fight. I got it.

197
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,330
Why I to give a shout out to fucking Nico
Rosberg what in his first Formula One

198
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,940
championship,
um,

199
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,420
the final few laps of that
race were amazing. Right?

200
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:44,230
For those of you who are not into it,
basically what the situation was,

201
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,390
Lewis Hamilton had won the last three.
Nico Rosberg had never won.

202
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
They both drive from
Mercedes. Okay. So Nico's,

203
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,960
the young upstart Lewis
is the grizzled vet,

204
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,340
even though they're both fucking young.

205
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,650
It was kind of like
days of thunder of both.

206
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,060
Both people look like fucking Tom
Cruise is basically it, right?

207
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,070
It's like too Tom, the old Tom
Cruise, right? Scientology,

208
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:12,110
Tom Cruise versus fucking,
um,

209
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,350
what was that movie that they will all in?

210
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,410
Whether they were the socials in the
greasers the fuck was that movie called?

211
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:21,250
I knew that one.

212
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,010
Okay.

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,910
God dammit. What was it
called? Matt Dillon was in it.

214
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,570
Emilio Estevez as Steph says,
uh,

215
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,440
the dirty dancing guy, roadhouse
guy. The karate kid was in it.

216
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,910
Tom Cruise was in it.

217
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,210
Who else was in that fucking movie?
Everybody was in that fucking movie.

218
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,810
Everybody like there was like nine people
in that fucking movie. They'd all went,

219
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,750
uh, see Thomas Howell, they all went
on to star and movies that made,

220
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:53,130
I would love to see how much
fucking box office, every,

221
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,110
every guy that started as a greaser in
that movie ended up making. You know,

222
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,950
he got to hate being the one fucking
grease or that didn't make it right.

223
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,380
That's when you just got to
look at yourself like, dude,

224
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:06,190
what the fuck everybody
in this ensemble cast?

225
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,210
I got to find out what it is
now. All right, Tom Cruise.

226
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,340
I am DB.
How do you spell Kruze Rung?

227
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,720
I somehow spelled it with to use a yos.
Tom fucking crows.

228
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:23,200
Toyos. All right. There he is. Smiling,

229
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,640
looking sort of normal, as
normal as he possibly can. Well,

230
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:31,750
what the outsiders,
the outsiders.

231
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,630
All right, here we go. Let's, let's
this, this is the fucking line up.

232
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:40,240
See Thomas how Matt Dillon,
Ralph Machio. Patrick Swayze.

233
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,890
Rob fucking low.

234
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,000
Emilio Estefan is Tom Cruise.

235
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,690
Okay.

236
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,190
All right. That alone right
there. One, three, four,

237
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,630
five,
six.

238
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:58,631
The first seven guys all
went on to star in movies.

239
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,430
Tom Cruise alone has done billions
in box office. Matt Dillon,

240
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:08,540
the amount of money he's
done, Ralph Macho, the fucking
karate kid, Patrick Swayze,

241
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,800
dirty dancing alone. Forget about ghost
when they were in the claymation class

242
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,900
and what he did. And he comes up
behind her and they go, oh wow.

243
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,960
The time of my love,

244
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,680
Whoopi Goldberg grabbing your tits.

245
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,180
I swear Emilio Estefan is right.
He was in stake out.

246
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:33,650
He was in fucking, uh, the breakfast club.

247
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,970
MMM.

248
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,250
He was in the cowboy movies, right. And
he played Billy the kid come, you know,

249
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,730
all these fucking people are,
and you've got a guy like Glen Withrow.

250
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,230
The fuck happened to him. Diane Lane. She
was in a bunt, Leif Garrett. Jesus Christ.

251
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:52,250
He sold a bunch of albums.
Tom Waits was in that fucking movie.

252
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,590
Then there was a William Smith who plays
the store clerk. You went by William,

253
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,830
if you went by will, you know,
could've been a whole different story.

254
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,450
So anyways, I didn't know
what the fuck I'm saying. Oh
yeah, so Nico Rosberg, right?

255
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,560
So here's the deal.

256
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,280
The way the points worked out was Lewis
Hamilton had the wind. The fucking race

257
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,540
provided Nico didn't crash. All right?
If Nico is gonna finish the race,

258
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,570
Louis had to win the race and Nico had
to become in fourth place or worse,

259
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,720
and then Louis would have won
his fourth in a row. Okay.

260
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,980
But a lot of three peat and
out there for not nobody.

261
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,250
Who the fuck does four in a row?
You never see that shit. Right?

262
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,290
So it comes down to the La.

263
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,230
All Nico had to do was finish in third
place and no matter what Lewis Hamilton

264
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:44,120
did, the shit was over. So you get
down to like five fucking laps to go.

265
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,230
Nico Rosberg, he's in third
place, he's a fucking lunatic.

266
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,070
He passes. And then it was a
red bull car. And all guys,

267
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,080
I love the guys who announced it.
They're always so fucking,

268
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,400
oh like whenever there's
a pass. Oh Jo. Oh God.

269
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,700
They're always doing that shit. It's
like, dude, do you have money in that car?

270
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,680
Is that your son in there?

271
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,330
I mean after reasonable watching
this shit is to see him crash.

272
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:11,120
It's like watching hockey,
half bits to watch the game.

273
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,630
The other half is to watch somebody beat
the fuck out of somebody. I want to,

274
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:18,530
I want to see somebody spin
around a little bit. You
know, I want to see a fender.

275
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,350
Right. So anyways, uh,

276
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,010
so it gets down to the last five laps.
Nico goes around,

277
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,720
whoever the fuck was in second place.

278
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,600
How can burger or fucking one of
those other guys are Timo Nikunen,

279
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,760
Timo, Salani. I don't know any of the
end of the year, the other drivers yet.

280
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,330
It's my first year watching it.
Right. He fucking passes the guy.

281
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:44,360
Now he's in second place. So now
Louis is like, what the fuck?

282
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,540
So Lewis Hamilton starts slowing down
trying to let the third and fourth cars

283
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:54,120
catch up, which they're doing. All
right. Now there are a fucking team.

284
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,640
They're on the same team.
So evidently,

285
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,070
yeah,

286
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,570
when the head dude and Mercedes, you
know, if you're on the Mercedes teams,

287
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,700
if you're a team,
calls you and tells you to do something.

288
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:07,220
He not supposed to disobey a direct order.
I'm telling you,

289
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,470
this is like top gun and fucking

290
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,640
days. The thunder, sorry. It's just a
little touch of a bowl of people, right?

291
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,430
So he gives look that they give Lewis
the direct order to go and Louis, uh,

292
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,440
you got to drive faster here.
Come on. We want to win this race.

293
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,010
And Louis just says,

294
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,910
he just says back into the radio on TV,

295
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:34,420
basically said, um, well, um,

296
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm still in first place and I'm
comfortable with my current position,

297
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,151
basically.

298
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:43,420
Meaning like I'm not going to drive any
fucking faster and I'm good enough that

299
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,960
even if Nico's right on my ass, I know
he's not going to try to go around me,

300
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,400
you know,
risking crashing because he's got it.

301
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,570
So for the last five fucking lapse you,
I just on the edge of your fucking seat,

302
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:59,530
like is this guy in third place
going to go around Nico Rosberg um,

303
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,790
he didn't Lewis Hamilton
disobeying a direct order.

304
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:08,410
I believe Robert Duvall came out in the
end and started screaming at somebody.

305
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:12,970
I can't remember, but, um, it
was kind of funny, like whenever,

306
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:16,480
like they're both on the podium,
which was almost every race this year.

307
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,390
Nico and Louis like wouldn't even look
at each other. It was fucking like,

308
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,570
oh my God, I'm not even talking
to you right now. I'm like,

309
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:26,410
so like not even talking to you right now.
Like it was that whole fucking energy.

310
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,010
So when Nico,
when's the thing,

311
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,340
they actually shook hands and there was
some fucking clown interview and I'm

312
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:36,910
going, oh, I kind of blocked the shot.
Can you guys do that again? It was great.

313
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:40,990
And then they just sort of begrudgingly
shook hands or whatever and the guy just

314
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:43,990
goes, oh, that's great. It's a, it's
all good again, or something like that.

315
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:47,170
It's like, dude, it's very far
from all good again. So, um,

316
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,630
I believe the season starts up again,

317
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,270
either the end of March
or the beginning of April,

318
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,320
and I jumped on this year after they
raced in Monaco and I had a great time

319
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,071
fucking watching it.

320
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,160
And I actually started to think of the
sheer amount of fucking money it must

321
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:04,720
cost to have a Goddamn to
run a Formula One team.

322
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,170
I can't imagine how much fucking money
you got to ship that car around the

323
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:12,120
fucking world like nine times.
And you know,

324
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:14,190
you've got a couple of other
cars you've got to bring with it.

325
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,200
It's got to cost you $1 billion.
It has to, does it bill?

326
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,340
Have you ever tried to ship even your
fucking Prius to Connecticut now?

327
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,640
So then you really don't know how much
it costs. Ah, you got me. Whatever.

328
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:29,670
I know it's got to cost a lot
of fucking money there, right?

329
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,310
So anyways, anybody watch
Ohio State, Michigan? I know
this is kind of old games,

330
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:38,040
but I don't give a fuck.
Did you guys watch that?

331
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,490
It's one of the best games I've seen
between those two in a long fucking time.

332
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,920
And, um, Michigan just kept
fucking up when they got the ball.

333
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,100
They had the Goddamn game one. Do you
notice how, what's his face there?

334
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,680
The whatever reason,
I can never remember their last name.

335
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:57,240
The fucking coach and Michigan.
Jim Harbaugh.

336
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,980
Do you notice he was wearing
the woody Hayes glasses?

337
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,530
I actually had a theory that if they won,

338
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,480
he was going to take the glasses off on
their fucking logo on the 50 yard line

339
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:11,080
and steps stomp on him. You know,
like after Jewish people get married,

340
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:14,220
they step on the fucking glass. He was
going to do that with the fucking his,

341
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,000
his woody Hayes glasses. And I loved
that he called out the referee and,

342
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:19,930
and all that shit.
You know,

343
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:23,890
I'm not saying I 100% agreed with them
and all that shit, but uh, you know,

344
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,720
I thought they got to call
right on their first down.

345
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,940
I stood up too when I saw a
live action. It was like, yeah.

346
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,470
And then I saw a fuck. He got it.
I thought he got it. Anyways. Um,

347
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,500
but all my Michigan Buddies,
they were all texting me.

348
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,470
That was a home job and all this type
of shit. So who do you like guys?

349
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,180
It's probably going to be
Alabama, right? That had a nice,

350
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,840
had an easy time with fucking Auburn.
She,

351
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,850
the kicker for Auburn,

352
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,100
he grew up in an Alabama family
roll tide family in Alabama.

353
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,650
Didn't give him a scholarship. So he, he,

354
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,660
he goes to fucking Auburn now and his
grandfather calls him turncoat fucking

355
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:05,740
lunatics down there. Right? Scary
Danielson. The whole gang keeps going.

356
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,390
It was turncoat kicking it for three.

357
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,260
I didn't think this podcast
is remotely funny, but maybe,

358
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:18,030
maybe just laughing at me. Coughing
up a fucking lung here. Um,

359
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,280
anyway,
so it's going to be Alabama

360
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,670
and I'm going to say it's going to be
Ohio state for the championship and he has

361
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:34,840
old Billy red face. Having only watched
about 15 college games this year,

362
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:38,650
having never played beyond the third
grade level. This is my prediction.

363
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,380
All right. Organized. Anyways,

364
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,310
I played enough pickup football for the
first time ever throw up my back was

365
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:49,770
playing fucking football and uh,
it's never been the same, you know?

366
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,030
No,
it's not the first time.

367
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,970
First Time was when that kid put me in
the figure four leg lock and fourth grade

368
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,150
outdoor recess.
That's the first time I threw it out.

369
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,770
The next time was playing football.

370
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,840
And then the third time was
another wrestling thing.

371
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,090
I tried to lift my younger
brother up over my head,

372
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:08,440
like Tony Atlas and the the
upper third of my spine folded.

373
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,270
It felt like, and uh, you
know, that's giving me problems
ever since then. You know,

374
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,430
it's probably why I leaned on the mic
stuff. Anyways, plowing ahead here.

375
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,180
I think it's going to be, it's going
to be fucking Ohio state, Alabama.

376
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,020
Obviously I'm picking the number
one and two teams and I think, uh,

377
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Alabama Beats Ohio state this time simply
because I thought Ohio state had a lot

378
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,980
of problems with debt defense
there in Michigan. Um,

379
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,340
and I think Alabama's defense is even
better and Alabama's offense is not going

380
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:46,100
to make the fucking mistakes that
Michigan's, um, offense made.

381
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:46,580
You know,

382
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,940
you don't watch an Alabama team and they
fumble a fucking snap on the one yard

383
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,970
line. They just don't do shit
like that. You know what I mean?

384
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,810
Cause what's his face? Nick
Saban, that Luna ticket,

385
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,470
he probably fucking waterboard
you. How angry it dude. You know,

386
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,990
that guy makes me feel good about
my anger when I see that guy.

387
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,520
I was joking about this. I did, uh,

388
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,720
Jeff's a as podcast and we
will fucking joking about,

389
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,900
my favorite fucking thing to do is to
watch Alabama going in like down by seven

390
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:18,290
at halftime.
I love when the halftime report,

391
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,440
it comes up and starts
talking to Nick Saban and the,

392
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:23,960
the look of fucking anger on his face.

393
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,520
All he wants to do is go into the locker
room and call everybody's mother a cunt

394
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,130
that's wearing his uniform, right? And,

395
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:34,130
but he's got to sit there and talk to
some chicken. The sidelight go. I like,

396
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,240
so why do you think it is
your dad by eight to me?

397
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,510
I said, just sit there. You know,

398
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,960
he just wants to slap the wig right off
her fucking head. But he doesn't do it.

399
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,790
He doesn't know it.
He sits there with his fucking,

400
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,700
I dunno what it is on his head,
you know,

401
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,090
he makes Donald Trump look like fucking a
Fabio.

402
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,400
I'm trying to think of
somebody who has good here.

403
00:24:57,401 --> 00:25:00,620
Who the fuck he been has good hair and
you never even know anymore, right?

404
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,250
Everybody goes around, they get, they
get the troops from the back, you know,

405
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,980
peeling. But the potatoes get put
out right up on the front line.

406
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:09,080
Now there's now what they do.

407
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,490
Then everybody goes swimming and nobody
knows what's going on, right? Tell you.

408
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,270
It takes a real man like myself to
walk around looking like Charlie Brown.

409
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,500
I'm telling you. Redheaded,
Charlie Brown. Um. Anyways,

410
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:23,810
let's read some advertising
here for this week, everybody.

411
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,070
Let's see what we got here on the docket.
How about those Bruins?

412
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:29,360
Finally winning the game, right? Second,

413
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,340
I started watching and they go into
a three game fucking skin. Okay?

414
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,030
Just to let you know what a big boat.
A big,

415
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,710
you cannot put a price
on what does it dino,

416
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,410
Ciara brings to this Boston Bruin
defense. All right, a frame bridge.

417
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,740
All right.
If you previously listened to this show,

418
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,070
you've heard me talk about
frame bridge. Hey, relax. Okay?

419
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,700
Some people fast forward through
these things that they made.

420
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,320
They make it super easy and affordable
to cuss to custom frame your favorite

421
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:01,760
things. You got a nice Dick Pic.

more to go. All right. Fuck this dude.

523
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,150
Fuck this. Okay. Let's
plow ahead. Where are we?

524
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,040
32 minutes in. Was there anything
else I wanted to fucking talk about?

525
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,130
Uh, oh dude, I started going
through my shit cause I'm, I'm,

526
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,750
I'm selling my Prius,
right?

527
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,440
So I'm going back and I'm trying to
find the title to my car and of course I

528
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:25,950
can't find this fucking thing.
And I find the title to my wife's car,

529
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,200
to my car and my old truck.

530
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,090
And I also found a copy of a
title to this 88 Honda accord.

531
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:35,310
I had like fucking 15 years ago

532
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,000
I had the DX Lx,
the LX five speed manual transmission.

533
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,930
What a great fucking car that was.
God Damn it. I loved that car. Um,

534
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,130
I found a copy of that,

535
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,910
but nothing for the Prius and I gotta go
fucking to the DMV and get a copy of it

536
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,430
and all that bullshit. Um, ended
up getting rid of that shit.

537
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,790
Move on with my fucking life. Um, yeah.

538
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,800
Get a fucking God damn conference
call coming to Pune. 10 minutes.

539
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,420
I'll have to finish the rest of the
podcast later. I apologize. You know,

540
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,960
it's what it is. Patriots,
jets. Did you watch that?

541
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:15,470
How fucking awful that our defense look
in the first fucking half. Good Lord.

542
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,940
Um, I mean, I know were banged up
and everything, but uh, I don't know.

543
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Remember that time when we traded Richard
Seymour long time ago in every Patriot

544
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:29,840
fan was like, dude, what
the fuck did we do that for?

545
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,660
And then the people who were
kind of paying attention
and we're like, well look,

546
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:35,300
it was a deal. Next year he's
going to be up for free agency.

547
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,120
He was going to ask for a zillion dollars
and we knew we weren't going to give

548
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:40,010
it to them and then we would
have gotten nothing for him.

549
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,490
So we traded him the year before I went
on this website and they showed all the

550
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,300
trickle down from that thing,
that trade,

551
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,690
um,
and all the players we got,

552
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:55,130
how we could be more aggressive because
of what we got from Richard Seymour.

553
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,540
I'm hoping the same thing is
that happened this year with a,

554
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,770
I didn't know if we traded Chen Chandler
Jones and we lost him to free agents,

555
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,090
free agency. But, uh, they're fucking
dude that we sent to Cleveland,

556
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:12,560
which I keep with Jamie Collins. Maybe
that'll turn into something, but, uh,

557
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,330
I dunno, it's unhealthy as we
are. I'm not, I'm not, I dunno,

558
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,390
I'm not giving up. I never came up. I'm
just saying, you know what the fuck.

559
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,680
It's the God damned jets.

560
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,250
They will fucking go and crazy
to every fucking play they made.

561
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:28,460
They were going fucking nuts.
You know,

562
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:32,270
like they just fucking like, that was
their playoff game, which I respected.

563
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:37,190
They fucking came to play. But
anyways, so this whole fucking weekend,

564
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,650
all I did was watch football and I,

565
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,550
and I was looking for that title and in
the process of looking for the title,

566
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:46,610
I cleaned up a bunch of my shit and I
was kind of thinking with a kid coming

567
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:51,260
along, um, I'm not going
to have time to do shit,

568
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,060
but life is going to keep hitting me.

569
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:56,240
So I want to know where
all my insurance forms are.

570
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,950
We're every fucking piece of legal
shit that I need. You know what I mean?

571
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:02,690
Like the lengthy tracking
number and all that.

572
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:05,180
I'm getting all of that
stuff organized and um,

573
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,940
I had all these fucking
shit that I held on to for,

574
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,240
I had like fucking my insurance auto
insurance contract from like 2007 until

575
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:17,180
now. And I'm like, it expires 12
months after you get it. Bill,

576
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,420
you've held under this shit for
nine years longer than you need to.

577
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:24,140
So I shredded a lot of shit,
but a underrated,

578
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,520
just finally going through your
office and just organizing everything.

579
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,130
I kinda know where like everything
is now. And uh, I want to,

580
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,550
I want to do that kind of
for everything that I have.

581
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,790
So when my kid comes here and then
take some marker out and draws all over

582
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:41,910
everything, I'll know where the fucking
insurance shit is. All right, let's,

583
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:45,480
let's read 'em. Let's read some, uh,

584
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,370
some questions here for the
week. Stan. Hope special is,

585
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,510
is somebody writing it about the
great. Doug Stanhope said, Hey,

586
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:59,511
bill used your promo code to sign up
for CSO so I could watch stand hopes new

587
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:03,060
special. I've heard nothing but
great things. He said, Holy Shit,

588
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,750
you're still my favorite bill,
but Stan hope is a genius.

589
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,670
Why do you guys always have to do that?

590
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,000
You still going to take the piss out
of me? I know. He's fucking tremendous.

591
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,390
You know, why can't you just say, this
guy's a great comedian. I'll dye it bell.

592
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,280
I it, but this guy over here. Yeah,

593
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,830
everybody in the Internet's got to
do that. If you have a good band,

594
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:26,040
someone's got to just sit there
and be like, dude, I love you guys,

595
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:30,540
but it's fucking Doug. Stan
Hope, man. He's a fucking,

596
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,620
I know he's a genius.

597
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,140
You didn't have to take the piss out
of me and he's fucking better than I am

598
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,310
fucking cunt. Um, he said, I
wish more people knew about them.

599
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:42,600
I felt the same way about you years ago
when you were just a comedy baby. Uh,

600
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:46,890
tell you people at Netflix
to give them the Chappelle
treatment. Uh, love you, man.

601
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,700
Um, yeah, I've heard nothing but
great shit about that. I'm sorry.

602
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,630
That's the last of the, the,
the Ricola eaten on the mic.

603
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,490
Kind of a fucking amateur am my, um,
all right, well what you're telling me,

604
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:04,330
every comedian has known about Doug Stan
hope since probably the late nineties.

605
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,920
And um, Doug is, um,

606
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,110
ever watched those cop movies.
You know, when you know that guy,

607
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,810
he always has to turn in his badge cause
he's doing shit outside the system,

608
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,710
but he's got a good heart and in the end
he arrest the bad guy and it's all good.

609
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,810
That's who Stan hope is.
Right.

610
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,960
But the entertainment industry
hasn't figured that out yet.

611
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:28,070
But eventually he will be standing on
their fucking city hall steps as they give

612
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:31,120
them the key to the city.
I'm hoping, but, um,

613
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,400
my rule with all of these guys is I don't
watch this standup special just cause

614
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:41,760
I can't have an hour and an hour and a
half of this shit floating around in my

615
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:46,080
head because it'll influence, you
know, I'm of two paranoid about that.

616
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,980
But my rule is that with all
these guys, Rogan, Stan Hope,

617
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:51,120
Louie Chappelle,

618
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:56,121
all of these guys that if they come
into a comedy club that I'm at and,

619
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:59,520
uh, they're going to go do a set, I
will watch them. That's how I do it.

620
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:04,500
But I don't watch their specials cause
I'm too paranoid about any sort of

621
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:08,400
overlap or whatever. But,
um, having said that,

622
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,590
every time Doug stand,
hope's specials come out always,

623
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,250
always, always for like three
to six months afterwards,

624
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,930
comics had just taken me aside and go,
dude,

625
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:23,820
have you seen Stan hopes new
fucking special? Um, yeah,
he's fucking incredible.

626
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,930
And um, I don't know. Well,

627
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,940
I dunno why. I Dunno. Why, what
it is about comics like that,

628
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,180
that they just,
uh,

629
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,260
I dunno if the industry
just won't give the same,

630
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,280
I don't,

631
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,560
you know what it is at the end of the
day where if you ever have a question

632
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:45,760
about an artist you like,

633
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:50,770
just imagine Doug Stan hope on TV
trying to sell your Ritz crackers. Okay.

634
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,120
How long could he talk about those
crackers before they would have a major

635
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,820
fucking pro? And I think that's
what it comes down to. All right?

636
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,520
There's the people that
are truly are the greats.

637
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,140
And then there's the people that are
really good, but they won't fucking,

638
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,410
you know,
they can sell a box of Ritz crackers.

639
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,290
That's what it kind of comes down to it.
Doug.

640
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,260
Stan hope is one of those fucking
guy is what makes them great.

641
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,710
So maybe that's what it is.
I liked that this guys like that.

642
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,830
You got to have the fucking row guys.
You know what I mean?

643
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:28,120
You can't have everybody just fucking
hanging out with a, I don't know,

644
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,290
Eddie show Biz, you know, at a fucking,
you know, in an election party.

645
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,820
You know what I mean? And
talking about issues, hi,

646
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:41,800
I'm fucking sandy sands, Sam cakes and
I'm here to talk about the fucking, uh,

647
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,470
the slaughter of baby seals
and all of that. You know,
that main stream, like, um,

648
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,480
step off your private jet.

649
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,280
Take the time to give a fuck for 20
minutes before you go back to yelling at

650
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:57,630
your personal assistant.
There's that level of uh,

651
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,970
connecting with people and then
there's what Stan hope does,

652
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:05,020
where he fucking goes, where they're
at. That guy is literally played,

653
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,320
I would say,
you know,

654
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,380
let's say there's 10,000
comedy clubs in this country.

655
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,250
He's played at least 9,998 of them.

656
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:19,180
That fucking guy has played as much
as I've done a bunch of [inaudible].

657
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,380
That guy has been fucking
everywhere and that's why,

658
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,090
that's why he's as good as he is, that
his work ethic, he's fucking prolific.

659
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,710
He's one of my favorites of all time.

660
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:34,711
So I wish I knew what the name of the
specialist maybe I can like go to look at.

661
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,790
I'll look that up. You know
what? I got to hit pause.

662
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,770
I got this fucking conference call.
I'll be right back.

663
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,870
And I'll also have the name of the
special. What do think about that?

664
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,200
And this will be like fucking like
an eighth of a second year life.

665
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,530
Just like those fucking millennials.
What? They're virtual reality glasses.

666
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,020
What's that over there in la,

667
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,620
which I fucking hate that commercial
where the kids are sitting there freaking

668
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:57,100
the fuck out. Like they don't
realize that it's not a real world.

669
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,940
And then the greedy corporate constant,
what do they got to do?

670
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,270
They've got to have the old curmudgeon
guy like me actually older than me.

671
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,830
And then what are you kids do?

672
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:10,510
And then he puts it on and then of
course he's completely enamored, right?

673
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,020
And now he's going to be into the shit.
Get the fuck Outta here.

674
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,660
Fuck those glasses.
I swear to God man,

675
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,560
like the amount of people that are going
to get mugged while they have those

676
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,930
fucking things on in public.
Cause I'll tell you right now,

677
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:24,730
these fucking kids are so God damn stupid.

678
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:28,390
They're wearing one of those and like on
a city bus and just fucking have it on

679
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:29,620
there.
You know what I mean?

680
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,980
It's like walking into why
Cornell's little fucking baskets

681
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,371
with what?

682
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:38,300
Cobra in there and you stick your head
in with your virtual reality glass

683
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,920
glasses and he can't see the snake
anymore because you're in fucking a middle

684
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:47,270
earth. Ah, the old man's coming out of me
this week. All right. Hang on a second.

685
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,650
All right. And I'm back just like that. An
hour of fucking conference calling. Huh?

686
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,640
Don't you wish you were me?
Is there anything better
than a conference call? Hey,

687
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,190
let's get on and make a
call and have a conference.

688
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,100
Everybody can talk and share ideas.

689
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,900
Have another hour your life go by that
you're never going to get back. All right.

690
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,800
You know, this is how old I am. You know
what's on my Christmas list this year?

691
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,050
You know it,
this pajamas,

692
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,640
I've had the same pair of fucking
pajamas for like, I don't,

693
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:24,320
I don't even know how long.
Like, I dunno, maybe, uh,

694
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,530
early two thousands, you
know, I'm trying to think.

695
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,220
All this shit that I've watched on TV and
these jam jams and they've just had it.

696
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:36,250
It's fucking over and
I've actually dropped.

697
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,630
Not even the hint I just demanded.
And you get to when you get to be my age,

698
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:42,250
cause no one gives a
shit about you anymore.

699
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:45,940
You can't ask for something for Christmas.
You got to start.

700
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:50,590
You got to make demands with like a
touch of a threat. Okay. I'm just saying,

701
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,390
okay, just throw, putting this out there,

702
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,720
but we'd be in everybody's best interest
if I've got some new pajamas this

703
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,800
Christmas. That's all I'm saying.
Okay. Huh? You like where you live in,

704
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,423
you liked it.

705
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,490
There better be some jam jams
under the fucking tree. Um,

706
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,860
anyways and then no matter what,
then you end up being wrong.

707
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:18,050
Like I had a fucking argument with my
wife this week about the way she fucking,

708
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:21,380
you know, stacks up the dishes in
the sink. You know what I mean?

709
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,790
I don't know if your wife does this shit,

710
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:27,791
but there'll be like a pot sitting in
the fucking sink and then they have a

711
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:31,070
plate. Right? What did they do?

712
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,210
They stick the plate on top of the thing
and then they take another bowl and

713
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,780
they stick it on top of the plate and
then he just got this leaning Tower of

714
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,060
Horse Shit and you fucking sink.
It's like,

715
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:45,020
why don't you put the plate underneath
the pot and then just see if the pot can

716
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:45,720
fit in a ball.

717
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,250
The ball can fit in the fucking pot and
then it takes like a third of this space.

718
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,880
You know, you haven't take a
door to that fucking Jane can,

719
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,340
you know, make, rather than
make it look like this,

720
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:03,070
10 weeks of fucking dishes here.
This is like two meals, you know,

721
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:03,741
one of those fucking,

722
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,130
one of those fucking dumb arguments
where you end up getting in your car and

723
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:10,910
driving away and then afterwards you're
just sitting there going, what the fuck?

724
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,920
I'm literally driving
down the street right now,

725
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:18,320
contemplating giving this woman
everything that I own in moving into a one

726
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:21,440
bedroom apartment over the way.
She stacks dishes in the sink.

727
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:25,280
But I'll tell you when you live with
somebody, it seems so fucking important.

728
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,290
All right, time off. Dear Billy
body, I think you're awesome.

729
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:32,780
Thank you.
And I have a crush on you and I'm,

730
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,810
hey,

731
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,730
hey, you go at that. The left term
was going to be, and I'm a dude.

732
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,050
I love that you take care of yourself
and are always striving to be better.

733
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:46,200
If this is great, you know what, if I
were you guys listening to this right now,

734
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:50,580
I would be highly suspect of whether or
not I actually wrote this in my husband

735
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:54,120
and I haven't seen you live yet.
And we want,

736
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,470
we want to this year. If you happen
to be coming back to Wisconsin,

737
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,980
well where the hell were you
a few months ago? You know,

738
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:06,240
when did you develop this crush in
October? I was there in September. Uh,

739
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,740
do you think you'll be touring as much
or will you be taking the year off to

740
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:15,690
spend time with your newborn?
Love you and I love Nia. Um,

741
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,470
oh, I'm totally going to be the absentee
father. I already have that worked out.

742
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,630
You know, we're going to be doing
like 56 weeks on the road. No,

743
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:26,650
obviously my schedule would
be a little bit different. Um,

744
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,040
be honest with you. I'd, I don't
know. Um, I do know, however, that,

745
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,440
um,
you know,

746
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,250
when I was getting ready to do my special
rather than doing one night in every

747
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:41,770
city, you know, when I did that little,

748
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,220
I played a smaller theater
and I spent a week in Durham,

749
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,610
like just Thursday, Friday,
Saturday. And I, it's,

750
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,170
it was so much more enjoyable way of
doing the road rather than doing one night

751
00:45:53,171 --> 00:45:56,470
in Durham one night and fucking
Poughkeepsie one night here.

752
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,670
It just becomes a fucking thrash. And
when you were an older fellow like myself,

753
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,680
you know, I liked going to a
place, hanging out with the people,

754
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:09,040
seeing where they eat, going to a game.
That's how I always fucking did it.

755
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,540
So I'm going to try to do more of that.

756
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,610
And I was just in Madison and funny you
should bring up going back to Milwaukee.

757
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:20,590
Uh, uh, Wisconsin was, I haven't
been to Milwaukee and um,

758
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,060
well I guess it was October of, it's
amazing. I can always remember this.

759
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,790
It was like October of
2015 so it's been a,

760
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,330
we'll call it December at this
point. So it's been 14 months. So,

761
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,990
um,

762
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,990
definitely in 2017 not only will
I be coming back to Milwaukee,

763
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,950
uh,
I plan on spending like three,

764
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:49,951
four days there because that Milwaukee
had not only a great cigar bar,

765
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,460
it had the best fucking steam
of any place I've ever been to.

766
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,510
And it was at a hotel called the Pfister.
I swear to God,

767
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,290
it the hotel is called
the Pfister. It's P, f.

768
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,700
I. S. T. E. R. If you add Milwaukee,
dude, I'm telling you man, Milwaukee,

769
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,210
don't sleep on Milwaukee.
Great people, great food,

770
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,290
great fucking Lake Front
property for a song, right?

771
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,680
And the sickest fucking steam room
you're ever going to go in to,

772
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:22,460
you get your own private like lifestyles
of the rich and famous fucking, it's,

773
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:26,460
it's unbelievable. So, um, no,

774
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,970
when you get to be my fucking age,

775
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,840
that's the type of shit appealing to
you on the road. You know what I mean?

776
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,110
It's not like God, Dude,
you got to go to Miami.

777
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:38,920
They got all these hot chicks down there.
I'm a fucking creepy old married guy.

778
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,750
Where is there a steam room?

779
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,510
Listen to me. I got to Berkeley. Losis

780
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,480
okay.

781
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,080
I ain't got time for the
WHO was, um, anyways,

782
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,240
so yeah,

783
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:58,260
tonight I'm actually doing the Steve
Allen Theater and whenever the fuck they

784
00:47:58,261 --> 00:48:01,320
calling it now, and I'm just
basically running my whole new hour.

785
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,670
I'm so fucking excited.

786
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,170
I've gotten past the whole mourning
period of missing my old jokes, um,

787
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,730
past the hole. Now I'm not as funny
as I was on stage. Now, you know,

788
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:15,890
I took all the bullets out of the gun.
I'm shooting fucking blanks up here. Um,

789
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,120
this is my favorite
fucking thing in the world.

790
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:21,110
I'm so excited tonight about the show.
Um,

791
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,490
and just seeing where it goes.

792
00:48:23,491 --> 00:48:26,400
And I've got a couple of buddies of
mine coming down who were musicians,

793
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,700
so they're going to get to see that whole
fucking, because I already told them,

794
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:31,580
I was like, all right, you guys
want to come down. This is gonna.

795
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,190
This is gonna be the real deal.
This is not the old tried and true.

796
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:39,560
They're all right. Coping
with being single. Uh,

797
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,460
oh, I already liked this right here.
Hey Billy, master of fuck. It's,

798
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,210
um,
I've been single my entire life.

799
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,800
I'm into my later twenties
and still haven't found any
lady that I really hit it

800
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:55,920
off with. I've struggled with
being single for a long time,

801
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,440
but had been working through it.
I'm okay with it,

802
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:01,860
but I still have my dark moments.
My question to you is,

803
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:06,720
when you were single for all those years,
did you ever get lonely or feel alone?

804
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,990
Uh, did you ever think
you'd be single forever?

805
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:13,710
What helped you to endure through those
times and how did you cope with it?

806
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,750
Yes to all of that. Yup. As
I figured some things out,

807
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:22,890
I've been doing bucket lists, types of
stuff that helps me get through it. Yeah,

808
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:24,690
dude, that's a great thing
to do when you're single.

809
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,040
Go do all that shit you want to do cause
a, you know, you meet somebody else.

810
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,520
Yeah. You know, you
might not have the time.

811
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,960
This person says, I've gone to see
some of my favorite bands play live.

812
00:49:36,961 --> 00:49:40,440
I've traveled a little and I've been
working towards finding a career path that

813
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:44,190
I really enjoy.
So I believe I'm doing some good things,

814
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,970
but I still have my days when I
suffer through it a little. Uh,

815
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:51,630
but I've learned to sit in that
pain for a bit and find good things.

816
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,430
Uh, saying something dumb at
work. Oh, that's the next one.

817
00:49:56,431 --> 00:50:00,970
I thought that was the guy signing off
or the woman, whoever the fuck this is a,

818
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,990
all right. My question to you is,
you've been single all those years.

819
00:50:03,991 --> 00:50:06,360
Did you ever get lonely or feel alone?
Here's the thing,

820
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,270
I was never lonely for the first,

821
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:12,900
I don't know how many years am I in life
until I had a girlfriend and then lost

822
00:50:12,901 --> 00:50:16,560
my girlfriend. And then after that,
that's the first time I felt like, oh,

823
00:50:16,561 --> 00:50:18,300
I don't have a chick.
It's weird.

824
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,570
Okay.

825
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,420
I didn't have my first serious
girlfriend till I was like 23,

826
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:28,070
something like that, 22,
23 years old. So I was fine

827
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,550
with being single. And that thing lasted
like, I dunno, like eight, nine months.

828
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:32,683
And uh,

829
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,500
I ended up breaking up with her and that
was right before I started doing stand

830
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,040
up. And, um,

831
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,270
I remember the first six
weeks of being like, fuck,

832
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:48,170
how long is it going to take for
me to get over this person? And um,

833
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,390
it's weird, man. Like getting
over a person, it's like,
it's like Quintin, the booze.

834
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,780
It's a habit. They're a
habit. You know what I mean?

835
00:50:56,781 --> 00:51:00,860
I always call them at this time. Then
he got to fill up those fucking times.

836
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,990
But you just can't fill him up.

837
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,530
You of got to go through the mourning
of them not being there anymore and then

838
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:11,600
you start filling them up with other
stuff. But like, dude, I think travel,

839
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,060
seeing bands and everything,
the great thing is too,

840
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,760
the fact that you aren't lady,

841
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,320
the fact that you're single and you
feel alone is a very healthy thing.

842
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,211
You know what I mean?
Now,

843
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:28,211
if you were totally fucking single
and you didn't feel lonely at all,

844
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,230
well I guess maybe,
you know,

845
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:32,720
maybe you're just a fucking someone
who doesn't want to be with anybody.

846
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,730
That could also be because as long
as you're not out killing people,

847
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,760
you know what I mean? As long as you
don't feel the need to hunt your,

848
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:39,710
you're not feeling that.

849
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:42,220
And as long as you're all right
with whatever it is you're doing,

850
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,410
then you should be fine too. During your
fucking late twenties through, trust me,

851
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,910
someday you're going to be married,

852
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,960
you're going to have a fucking kid coming
like I got right now and you'll all of

853
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:53,060
a sudden all your drum
videos you thinking,

854
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:54,410
I'm going to guide you gotta
gotta get rid of those.

855
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,550
I got to get rid of all his shit.

856
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,970
I got to get rid of all of this stuff
and there's this feeling that I'm having

857
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:01,370
right now.
Will I ever played drums again?

858
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,170
But fortunately I married the coolest
woman ever so I just was able to sit down

859
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:06,861
with her.
This,

860
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:09,800
this might help you if you're afraid
to get in a relationship cause you feel

861
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,150
like you're going to
lose all of this stuff.

862
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,140
You just let the person you're
with know what's important.

863
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:20,840
I already said to my wife, I said,
listen, here's the deal. Like once a week.

864
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,090
Okay.
You pick a day,

865
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,440
once a week when this kid is not sleeping
through the night and you can just go

866
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:30,680
somewhere, get a massage or just
go someplace and fucking sleep.

867
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,750
Or I'll take the kid and go drive around.

868
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:35,540
I'll let you sleep for fucking hours and
hours, whatever the hell it is. Okay.

869
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,580
All you gotta do is let me keep playing
drums, taking drum lessons in that shit.

870
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:41,630
That'll be my spot thing.

871
00:52:41,631 --> 00:52:44,870
Cause I don't really need to
sleep cause I'm a fucking lunatic.

872
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:50,350
And also I'll still get to do the
road twice a month and you know,

873
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:52,610
I'll use that time to sleep.

874
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,410
I'll do my shows at night and then I'll
go right to the hotel and I was sleep

875
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,400
till the fucking cats come home,
the cows come,

876
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:01,520
whatever the fucking animal is
and then I'll come back recharged,

877
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,470
you know what I mean?
But we,

878
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:06,880
we make sure that we kind of worked
that stuff out with each other. So, um,

879
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,200
if you're afraid to get in a relationship,

880
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,560
just know that there's a cool
people out there as long as you, uh,

881
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,410
I dunno. Yeah. You never hear me say this,

882
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:19,070
but women in general pretty cool if you
just tell him what the fucking deal is.

883
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:24,470
Um, but I have issues with
women. So even as I said that,

884
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:26,070
just picturing how many women just

885
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,830
went like, oh my God, yes.
That like, that annoyed me,

886
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,300
even though they were agreeing with me.
It's weird. I got a lot of fucking issues.

887
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:35,910
So, um, yeah, I definitely felt, I felt
like I was never going to meet the one.

888
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,660
I felt like there was something wrong
with me and all of this type of shit.

889
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:40,494
Just know this.

890
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:45,620
Every one of your friends that's in a
relationship is secretly envious of you,

891
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,560
even if they're with the right person.
That's how much fucking work it is.

892
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,900
You know, every once in a while, you
know, I look at fucking, um, you know,

893
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:59,040
I look at it, I'll look at a playboy
like Joe de Rosa and I'll be like,

894
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:03,330
God damn it, man. What the fuck did
he's got? He's getting always key skis,

895
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:06,990
living the life, you
know, but then, you know,

896
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:09,420
you come home and your wife make
some fucking cookies. You're like,

897
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:13,070
this is pretty cool too. All right,
saying something dumb. It works.

898
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:15,540
So what I was saying to this
person, you, you, you fine dude,

899
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,210
you're in your late twenties.
I'm

900
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,590
the same way that you have goals with um,

901
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,630
your career in bucket
list stuff should have,

902
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:28,380
she should have some goals about the
kind of person that you want to be with

903
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:31,200
like a women after you
actually do shit like that.

904
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:34,320
Women actually sit down and think
about the kind of, guys don't do that.

905
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,190
We just sort of Ping Pong and wrong. I'll
stick my fucking Dick in that. You know,

906
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:42,930
we're idiots. But if you
actually, you know, get a little
bill Bellacheck, you know,

907
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:47,190
see what's missing. You know, from
your half, see what you're looking for.

908
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,080
What do you want? You know, do
you want a woman that wants kids?

909
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,920
Do you want a woman that can cook a, your
traditional, do you want a career woman?

910
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,780
Like, what do you want? You
know, I can tell you right now,

911
00:54:57,781 --> 00:55:01,080
if you want a woman that can cook,
we'll actually sit down and cook. Woo.

912
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,240
Tell you right now that's like a,
I dunno,

913
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,630
you know like every, once every,
I don't know how many years they,

914
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,510
they have that and that 1983 draft,

915
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:14,430
like women do not foe women's
do not be cooking anymore.

916
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,020
All this feminism shit. It's really
a sad thing. But men have, you know,

917
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,850
it's our fault because we
didn't put a value on it.

918
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:27,530
Great. I'm out there busting my ass. You
Ain't here pickling cucumbers, right.

919
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,560
Just gave him shit.

920
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,950
Making a meal for somebody who's one of
the nicest things she could have a do,

921
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:36,300
you know? But what happened?
How we talk, shit we gave,

922
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,880
we didn't give him a fucking respect him.
Now look up. They don't want to cook up.

923
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:39,714
Be Mothers.

924
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,020
They're out there running around Willy
Nilly wearing pantsuits running in,

925
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,060
running for president
of the United States.

926
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,890
I mean, you know that. That's a man job.

927
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,500
Okay.
You know,

928
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:54,470
the funniest fucking thing ever is
how sick you have to be to want to be

929
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:57,110
president. The fact that Hillary
Clinton is depressed right now,

930
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,010
that she didn't get a job where she was
going to have to put her head on the

931
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:05,090
pillow every night knowing she just
made a decision that bombs would just

932
00:56:05,091 --> 00:56:09,710
dropped and possibly landed on
somebody's baby and she, she's,

933
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,950
she's depressed that she didn't get
that fucking job. It's unbelievable.

934
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,930
What do you think are pajamas look like?
She definitely has the fucking guy once,

935
00:56:17,931 --> 00:56:19,700
right?
Like the flannel ones

936
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,840
wearing the pants suits.
Um, I liked the pant suits.

937
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,330
I don't know why everybody gave a shit
about it. And I always liked Rhoda,

938
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,550
you know, Rhoda, Mary Tyler Moore, they
fucking fill those things out, you know,

939
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:37,840
walking around with the little bungees
up against that Rayon. All right.

940
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,980
Say something dumb at work saying
something dumb at work. Okay.

941
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,790
What do we got here? Um, yeah. Fuck you
guys. Mind if I just do the last bit of,

942
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,170
you know what,
that's a country move.

943
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:51,160
I'll read this and then I'll do the
advertising. Hey Bill, longtime fan.

944
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,060
Probably listened to you too much. Once
again, you start with a compliment,

945
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:56,980
then you give me the old
fucking Shank to the kidney.

946
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:02,170
Longtime fan probably listened to you
too much. All right. Too. Too much.

947
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,760
When it's too much. That's, that's
two o's. All right. All right.

948
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,940
Here's my problem. I was
at, I was at Work Party,

949
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,900
I think you mean at a work party?
Talking to my colleagues.

950
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,590
I work as an RN in an ICU.
Okay.

951
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:20,660
That's a registered nurse in
an intensive care unit. Uh Huh.

952
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,820
I have some nurses in my
family. Uh, we have a new

953
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,810
to our unit higher joining us,

954
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,930
but she's worked as a
nurse for 25 years already.

955
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,630
My friends said she's joining my rotation.

956
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,900
I say out loud in my typical
bill blurp burn a inflection. Oh,

957
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:44,320
Jj [inaudible]. No. How Ge is
another old broad in our line there,

958
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:49,710
several colleagues heard this and now
every day is some new twist on my comment.

959
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,620
Some chirping is fine,
but half the unit is over 50.

960
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,660
I want some joke comment.

961
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,920
I don't want some Joe comment to
hope haunt me for years. Bill,

962
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:04,040
how do I get this to go away? Thanks. Um,

963
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,430
I would just say it with them. I, I just,

964
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:15,850
I wouldn't back off and I would just
keep doing the Archie bunker and she's

965
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:19,270
another little broad on a line there.
And then when they, they, yeah,

966
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:22,550
this lady to World and Oh God, all
of you with your menopause, the,

967
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,370
but you can't do that at work now.

968
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,000
You can't do that work now because
you're not making it a safe place.

969
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,460
This is a safe space.

970
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:32,883
Ugh.

971
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,470
Oh my God. That alone, that alone
gave Trump about 200,000 folks

972
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,290
fucking adults saying,
you're not making this a safe space.

973
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,890
I just fucking did.

974
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:53,850
They all have a meeting and they came
up with that fucking horrific that,

975
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,850
that what was the second choice?
I just don't understand that.

976
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,750
Uh, you know something, I
have to be honest with you.

977
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:03,820
I don't know how you get out of that.
And right there.

978
00:59:03,821 --> 00:59:07,240
That's why I do what I do for a fucking
living because there's no way I could be

979
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:10,940
in that level of a childish fucking
environment that people, oh,

980
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,250
what did you mean about that?
What are,

981
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:14,440
what about how many fucking thoughts
have you had in your head today?

982
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,850
Your old fucking bag.

983
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,480
Then if they were publicized that you
would even still have a job as a nurse.

984
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:20,470
Get the fuck Outta here.

985
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:22,380
Okay.

986
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,780
Yeah, you don't, you know, just, just,
you know, women like sweets just coming,

987
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,720
just bake a fucking pie or some shit.
Anyways.

988
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,250
Um, I'm sorry, going through
that. I'm sorry you were
quoting me, but you know what?

989
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,000
You also kind of blamed
me a little bit there.

990
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:37,620
We say you listen to me too much or you,
you,

991
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:40,340
you were throwing a little bit of blame.
You want a little Peyton manning there.

992
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,060
We had protection issues as what
you just did to me there. Um,

993
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,420
I dunno how much just be, you're
still bringing that. Yeah,

994
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,470
he's still bringing that up.

995
00:59:50,471 --> 00:59:52,630
You should have heard what I said
this morning or something like that.

996
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:56,890
I would just do that.
Um, it is kind of funny.

997
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,190
Who gives a shit?

998
01:00:00,191 --> 01:00:04,840
Do you like the job but all depends on
how much you liked the job with her watch.

999
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:09,770
She's old. You're all old. I wouldn't fuck
any of you, you know. I Dunno. I Dunno.

1000
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,070
I don't know how to get out of that.
Um,

1001
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,340
if anybody has any suggestions tweeted
at me and I'll fucking retweet it.

1002
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,710
Maybe this person follows me on
Twitter and you can help them out. Uh,

1003
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:21,860
would it help if I know you are a man
or a woman? I have no idea. All right.

1004
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:24,770
Dollar Shave Club. Um, I'm guessing a man.

1005
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:25,820
Okay.

1006
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,820
If you're a woman, you're the coolest
woman over that. You said that. No,

1007
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:31,190

1010

But razors aren't the only
thing you need in the bathroom.

1011
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,040
What about some shower stuff?
Huh?

1012
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,040
What about when you wash
it off the old teeth?

1013
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:48,740
It turns out dollar Shave
Club thought of that too.

1014
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:51,110
They just came out with a
new line of shower products,

anything on the market.

This men and Cedar Wood bodywash is
amazing. It makes you smell incredible.

1021

It's like you're eating an ice
cream next to the fireplace. Um,

1022
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,430
you got to give it a try.

What the fuck is so great
about Mitt and Cedar Wood Body?

1024
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,870

Oh Jesus. Satan naked coming here
for all the good questions out there.

1062
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,700
He's a saint,
but he doesn't care about Muslims.

1063
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:55,680
Jews are fucking a Buddhist people,
right? What about all those,

1064
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:59,400
uh, aboriginals? Whatever
the fuck they worship, Huh?

1065
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:02,790
How come Santa Claus doesn't go to them?
You know why? Cause they'd be like,

1066
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,170
oh my God,
it's another white man.

1067
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:08,220
And they fucking put a poison dart
and it serves them right. You know,

1068
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,460
it served them right. Even though he
didn't do anything. He'd be a martyr.

1069
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,390

1071
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:21,690
I'm surprised that government has never
tried to set up Santa Claus by sending

1072
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,390
them into some area with
his indigenous people.

1073
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,900
Just set them up for a fight the way
we did when we took over this fucking

1074
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:28,591
country.
You know,

1075
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:32,040
so we could justify the genocide of those
wonderful people that when they killed

1076
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:35,070
a squirrel, they used all of it.
Unlike us. What do we do? Huh?

Fun Times in Syria.
Billy the cunt.

1108
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:21,160
It's Martin from Sweden. Thank you
for this podcast. No worries. Uh,

1109
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:25,720
it's been more than 10 years since I was
almost raped in Syria. What the fuck?

1110
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:31,130
Although time passes,
the story seems to never get old.

1111
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,683
All right.

1112
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,750
You know, I, I, you really just going to
fuck with me on this God damn level here.

1113
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,210
Am I supposed to believe this is true?
How time flies? It's like you're,

1114
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,470
you're looking back fondly on this.
This is weird.

1115
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:49,030
I was 17 when me and my class
went on a school trip to Syria,

1116
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:53,860
puts in parentheses, Middle East.
Go Fuck yourself, Jason. I know,

1117
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:57,250
I know American. I know
we're serious. All right.

1118
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:59,800
One day all of my classmates
were out snorkeling.

1119
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,970
I stayed in the hostel
bed because I had a fever.

1120
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:09,360
Two aspirins later I found myself
out looking for my class in Sana like

1121
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:14,380
temperatures with a foolish mindset.
My blonde, blue eyed nature,

1122
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:17,740
fig figured the aspirin
had cured my fever.

1123
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:23,010
So I was in quite good spirits for about
seven miles of searching for the other

1124
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:26,320
Swedes. This is creeping me out. Now.

1125
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,710
The fever was kicking back
and in at this point, uh,

1126
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,250
and I'd given up my
endeavors of snorkeling.

1127
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,940
I didn't know where I was or how to
get back to my hostel. At that moment,

1128
01:07:36,941 --> 01:07:40,270
a taxi pulled over. The driver
asked if I wanted to get a lift.

1129
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,000
I said I didn't have any money to offer,

1130
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:47,710
but he insisted that no money was needed
for the ride. Oh, Jesus is right. Yes.

1131
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,100
High fever and good amounts of gullibility
led me to step into the cab and off

1132
01:07:53,261 --> 01:07:58,030
we went. Hi, welcome to Siri. The
taxi guy said, you are very beautiful.

1133
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,820
I didn't want to be rude, so
I said, thanks back at him.

1134
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,800
Then he asked me if I liked women.
Sure.

1135
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:07,330
I replied that he asked if I
liked big women share. I said,

1136
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,700
he said, ah, you like big because

1137
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,650
same with your Dick.

1138
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:15,043
He said,

1139
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:20,180
what? At this point I regretted
getting to the what the fuck? Ah,

1140
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:24,770
you like big because same
with your Dick. He said, okay.

1141
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:29,450
I thought this was a woman, so it's a guy
and others, dude. Oh Jesus. Here we go.

1142
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:30,261
At this point,

1143
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:35,030
I regret getting to the taxi very much
in the moment after he was reaching for

1144
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:37,880
my package while he was driving,

1145
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,320
oh two that's,
oh you in the front seat.

1146
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:47,090
That's when you got to do, what was
that fucking Schwartzenegger movie?

1147
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:51,120
Or he gets on the plane with that guy
and he pretends to tie his shoe when he

1148
01:08:51,121 --> 01:08:52,310
comes up with the elbow,

1149
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:56,360
a death and drives this spine of his
nose into his brain and then puts his

1150
01:08:56,361 --> 01:09:01,250
little fucking a Tommy Bahama ad over
his face and he goes, don't disturb him.

1151
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,270
He's dead tired. That's what you
needed to do was that rod deal.

1152
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:09,440
I think he needed to go rod
deal there anyways. I say,

1153
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:13,940
no stop. I said, but the tracks,
he driver was very persistent.

1154
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,810
He wondered why he couldn't touch my
penis. Like I owed him the right to do so.

1155
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,270
I was feeling extremely vulnerable.

1156
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,620
Being a teenager foreigner and
having a high fever and all.

1157
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,840
I shouted at him to stop the
car, but he kept on going, dude,

1158
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:30,290
you got to start going Dave.
The Hammer Schultes here. Right?

1159
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:35,750
You got to fuck. And he got to start
swinging, man. Uh, but he kept on going.

1160
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:40,010
I thought about jumping out of the car,
but I was, it was going way too fast.

1161
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:44,570
I also didn't want to start a fight
and risk crashing the car. Ah,

1162
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,440
Jesus. At some point, dude, you got to
pick your poison. Did it have airbags?

1163
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:53,180
Picture pictures of Taliban
rape Cade's with pulp fiction.

1164
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,220
Kim's suits and gag balls was entering
my mind as the taxi car continued to

1165
01:09:58,221 --> 01:10:02,930
drive on without any intent to pull over.
This is really happening.

1166
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:04,730
Oh my Lord.
I thought to myself,

1167
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,630
luckily we came to a traffic light and
I managed to get out of the car and on

1168
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:13,550
the pavement. I started running
when I heard him screaming at me.

1169
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:18,950
One Syrian pounds,
Mr Oh God.

1170
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:20,090
Now you're going to get paid for forget.

1171
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:21,680
You got to pay him from
moving less than you.

1172
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:23,900
I got over the experience pretty soon.

1173
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:27,050
[inaudible] have not affected
my life to any extent.

1174
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,030
No fucking way.

1175
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:34,270
People sometimes want me to tell the
almost raped story and given pressures of

1176
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:35,390
the taxi driver.

1177
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,650
I can't help to think how of unfunny it
would be if I were a girl almost getting

1178
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:42,570
raped in Syria. Yeah, but you're
a guy so it's fucking hell.

1179
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:45,140
Everything that happens to a guy's
hilarious. Nobody gives a shit.

1180
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,710
My question to you is,
why is this kind of a,

1181
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,550
why is this story kind of funny if it
happened to men but awful in every way,

1182
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:56,960
if it happened to a woman, you're thoughts
on that after you go fuck yourself.

1183
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:58,880
PSA hide a lovely new,
um,

1184
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:03,020
this is why it's funny because
you're able to fight them off.

1185
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:08,270
It's a guy with an accent grabbing
your Dick when you tell this story. I,

1186
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:12,830
my friend, my friend, just like your Dick
Beep beep, right? It's just hilarious.

1187
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,140
I remember one night we were
down in the comedy cellar.

1188
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:18,390
We were all telling stories
about getting molested as kids.

1189
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:21,180
And it was one of the
funniest nights I've ever had.

1190
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:25,290
It was so fucking Cathartic and
we would just cry and laughing.

1191
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:30,260
And I remember all the comics
where, you know, I dunno,

1192
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,270
had a different upbringing.
We're looking at it like it was fucked up,

1193
01:11:33,271 --> 01:11:37,440
but it was fucking hilarious to me.
Um, and if you told me this story,

1194
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:39,880
I would be laughing my ass off.
It's still knowing that you,

1195
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,860
you probably have some sort of fucking
issue and all depends. It all depends.

1196
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,400
You know, if that was the first person
that ever touched you, you know,

1197
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,960
no girl ever.
He gave you a hand job.

1198
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:51,000
The fact that it was the first
guy that ever did it, you know,

1199
01:11:51,001 --> 01:11:54,690
his Harry fucking hand coming over, you
know, they could possibly fuck you up,

1200
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:59,110
but you know, okay, he had a little bit
of sexual activity. Maybe it doesn't,

1201
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,400
you know, it's kind of like, you know,
if you're a relief pitcher and you,

1202
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:04,540
you got to, he got some saves on your
belt. You let up a home run. Yeah,

1203
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:07,690
give me another fucking ball. But if
that's your first fucking pitch, I mean,

1204
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:12,690
that could fuck with. Yeah.
Um, why is it not funny?

1205
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:17,160
Uh, when it happens to a woman's a same
reason why it's like watching a guy get

1206
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:21,500
punched in the head is fucking funny.
You know, if he was like talking shit,

1207
01:12:21,501 --> 01:12:26,220
it's fucking funny. You know what I
mean? But like, you know, kids, women,

1208
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:29,430
animals like this, just never anything
funny about watching them get abused.

1209
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:33,200
But there's just something
hilarious about guys.

1210
01:12:33,201 --> 01:12:37,370
I would say the reason why you get having
your Dick grabbed and getting molested

1211
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:42,860
is funny is the same reason why the
three stooges is funny. You know?

1212
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,240
Imagine the three stooges,

1213
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,280
if it was women grabbing each other
by the hair and slapping each other,

1214
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,740
the faith, maybe that'd be a little funny.
I Dunno. It's just like a guy thing.

1215
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:57,290
We like slapstick and there's
just something funny about
him grabbing your fuck

1216
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:01,730
stick in some car and then he charged
one Syrian pounds,

1217
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,273
you know.

1218
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:08,350
Well it really comes down to is I
imagined being gay is not accepted even

1219
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,260
remotely in serious.
So this guy thought like all right,

1220
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,800
even if this doesn't go
down or if it does go down,

1221
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:19,490
this story leaves this country
and goes back to Sweden. Uh,

1222
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,660
so in the way I'm going to say the
cab driver was the victim and not you.

1223
01:13:22,661 --> 01:13:24,730
And stop being so selfish.
Now I'm fucking with you.

1224
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:29,390
I'm sorry that happened to
you. Um, well you do. I mean,

1225
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:34,310
I mean you were kind of asking for, cause
you were on cold medication. You know,

1226
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:38,160
I'm going to blame the victim here.
Well, I mean, what were you wearing? Um,

1227
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,610
I dunno dude. That's one of the more, uh,

1228
01:13:40,611 --> 01:13:43,680
I want to say that's one of the more
fucked up stories I've ever heard. But uh,

1229
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:47,370
yeah, that, that's just goes into that
file. I've heard enough of those ones. Um,

1230
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,860
yeah, that's why it's not funny. Um,

1231
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,740
so I would actually say
that you are fucked up.

1232
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:57,030
There's no way you're not fucked up cause
that happened to you. And there's, um,

1233
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,430
there's that feeling where it's just like,

1234
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:03,480
why is that funny when that happens to
a guy and then you feel like you can't

1235
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:08,180
fucking a, that you should
should just, yeah. You know,
I'm over it. Like why would,

1236
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:10,010
that's a horrific fucking
thing that happened to you.

1237
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,160
And I'm even like over the whole thing,

1238
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,850
cause it's a guy like, hey, you know,
fucking shake it off, shake it off.

1239
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:16,900
And that's part of growing up.

1240
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,240
It's always meet you have a paper
route or something like that.

1241
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:21,880
There'll be some Weirdo come
in at your junk at some point.

1242
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:30,510
But that's just how it is. I remember
when that fucking, I'm that lady.

1243
01:14:30,511 --> 01:14:34,830
Cut The dude's Dick off and put it in
the garbage disposal. One of those shows.

1244
01:14:34,831 --> 01:14:38,340
It's not the view. I think
it's the talk, the Asian Lady,

1245
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:41,910
she was reading it and as she was reading
the details, they're all snickering,

1246
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:42,744
laughing.

1247
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:43,980
Okay.

1248
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,860
And I remember the bid I was doing one
of some guy cut a woman's tiddy off and

1249
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,570
threw in the garbage disposal.
I mean,

1250
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:51,030
they would have done a week long special
on that and they would have tried to

1251
01:14:51,031 --> 01:14:54,900
help the lady out raise some money to get
her a prosthetic. You know what I mean?

1252
01:14:54,901 --> 01:14:57,690
So a broad wouldn't be all lopsided.
That's what the fuck they do.

1253
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,240
But it happens to a guy.
It's just fucking hilarious.

1254
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,990
And I also think that that's
why guys are so fucking funny.

1255
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,130
Yeah.

1256
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:08,910
You know, cause uh, you know,

1257
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,800
if a woman gets molested, it's a tragedy.
If it happens to a guy, it's a sketch.

1258
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,630
We really don't have any options.
You just got to shake it off, man.

1259
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,360
You know, having said all that,
dude, I'm sorry that happened to you.

1260
01:15:23,361 --> 01:15:25,490
I'm sure you're emotionally
fucked up about it.

1261
01:15:25,491 --> 01:15:28,640
But I would love to hear that story one
time cause I want to hear you imitating

1262
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:32,690
the guy, you know, and then listen to
everybody get interrupted. So wait,

1263
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,230
how fast were you going dude?
You could jump on in the car.

1264
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:39,380
He's grabbing it day and then
everybody be laugh ago. Yeah,

1265
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:42,200
but if you jumped out then he'd
be like holding onto your Dick.

1266
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,740
Like Steve has happened, the
car half part of the car, right.

1267
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,230
Stretching out your deck,
you know,

1268
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,300
then you have one of those needle dicks
cause it's not going to give you any

1269
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:51,860
more girth.
He's just going to weed out.

1270
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:53,810
That's what the whole
fucking thing would be.

1271
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:57,170
And then all your friends would
laugh and say that you wanted it.

1272
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:59,900
You know what I mean? Why don't you
sit in the back like a normal person?

1273
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:02,210
Why did you sit up front?
You know,

1274
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,160
that's what guys would do and
they would laugh. You know,

1275
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:06,920
you'd just laugh your way through it.
So anyways,

1276
01:16:06,921 --> 01:16:08,780
I guess I'm going to stop there on the,
uh,

1277
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,710
I can't, let's stop on
something positive. Once again,

1278
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:16,370
I have two benefits that are coming up
to two friends of mine that are no longer

1279
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:19,610
here. Um, Pete Coming, um,

1280
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,000
memorial is going to be December
6th at the laugh factory.

1281
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:25,550
I will tweet that link
and the Patrice O'Neal,

1282
01:16:25,551 --> 01:16:30,320
the five year anniversary of
his passing is today. And um,

1283
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:35,200
the one truly positive thing that came
out of that is we get to remember him and

1284
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:38,080
we get to see our friends and we get
to raise some money for his loved ones

1285
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:39,041
every year.

1286
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:44,041
And it's going to be February 21st a
Tuesday 2017 at the New York City Center.

1287
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:50,260
Um, thank you to all who, uh, take the
time to check it out and buy some tickets.

1288
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:54,610
It means the world to me. That's it.
Go fuck yourselves. Oh, by the way,

1289
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:58,630
if you want to donate to this podcast,
uh, and not have to give any money,

1290
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,700
if you're doing some
Christmas shopping on Amazon,

1291
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:03,520

1292
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,810

doesn't cost you any, any extra money.

1293
01:17:07,811 --> 01:17:11,110
I just get credit for driving traffic
there. If you want to do it, I get it.

1294
01:17:11,111 --> 01:17:12,820
If you don't, I understand. That's it.

1295
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:16,450
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
