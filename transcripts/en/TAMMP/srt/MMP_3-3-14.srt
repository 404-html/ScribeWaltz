1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,790
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:07,791
It's bill burr and this is the Monday
morning podcast for Monday match third

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,730
2014.
I am recording.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,770
I'm recording live as I always
do. Um, live to tape here.

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:20,670
Live to digital, whatever the fuck
it is. I'm here in Toronto, Ontario.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,180
And that person yawning in the
background like a fucking old man.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,240
I was his New Jersey.
The Pride of New Jersey,

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,190
Paul Versey. What's going on brother?
That's up math. It's going on.

9
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:38,170
How are you enjoying, uh, how
will you join enjoying a so well,

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,370
you know dude, the food right? We were
talking about the food here has been,

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,200
whenever you heard me say, I got to tell
you, put New York aside. Cause you know,

12
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,700
I'm a big New York food guy.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,990
I mean the food here has been knocking
out of the Park Mattson been incredible.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,490
Yeah. And Moncton and a in Halifax. We uh,

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,850
one of them was that, that
Ale house place. Um, oh,

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,240
the first place we went to the
pelvic triangle triangle. Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,800
We went over there for lunch. Well, first
of all, let's just back up for a second.

18
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,801
One thing I did want to bring up was
what's been fucking hilarious is Paul

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,340
Versey going through Canada, eastern
fucking Canada. We're literally,

20
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:21,570
we're driving to Moncton and Halifax.
I've never seen this in my life.

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,370
Like instead of a school crossing,

22
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:27,810
they literally had that same yellow
sign with the fucking Moose on it. Yeah,

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,210
I've never seen that.
Okay,

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,350
so typical Paul Versey
typical fucking New Yorker.

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,730
You just go places and that never done
this guy has been trying to order an

26
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:43,490
Arnold Palmer
everywhere we've gone.

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,573
Yeah.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,640
And what's funny is you've
gone from saying confidently,

29
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:54,620
can I have an Arnold Palmer to now
you're just describing the ingredients.

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,740
It just does stare. They started off
like, can I get an Arnold Palmer?

31
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,600
And they would be like, what?
And He'd be like, I did that.

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,050
And it'd be like an Arnold
Palmer. I'm sorry, I don't know.

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,790
You know a ice tea lemonade, Arnold
Palmer. And they're like, no we don't.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,580
I have that. You got to an ice
tea. No, we don't have that either.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,840
So then the next time you
ordered it, um, they're like, oh,

36
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:19,870
what do you want for this? And then we go
to Halifax and you ordered it this way.

37
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:24,360
You Go, yeah, you got Arnold
Palmer, you know. Oh, well Palmer.

38
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,660
So I was squinting my eyes
like to yet lemonade thing.

39
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:33,430
You did that and then downstairs
in Toronto you just go, yeah.

40
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,750
I was wondering, um, do you
have lemonade and ice tea?

41
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,840
And you could maybe put those together
and they're like, yeah, no, no, we don't.

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,770
We don't know. I, I'm, I'm over three. I'm
all for three with the, all of the power.

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,340
So if you know that as I do,
why don't you order a stand?

44
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,860
Makita has probably some sort of fucking
drink up here and they absolutely,

45
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:53,320
of course we do. Yeah.
I'm just, I give up.

46
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:57,820
It's just going to be lemonade or ice
tea from now. I just fucking hilarious.

47
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,360
You have ordered everywhere
the first time when you said,

48
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,420
do you have an Arnold Palmer?
They like, well, yeah, yeah,

49
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,800
mostly lemonade and then just a splash
of ice tea. And I'm like, all right,

50
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,740
you hang out with law ahead.
Cause that's how law had,

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,840
well he gets more lemonade
too. Yeah, that's actually,

52
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,660
that's the one knock I'll give Canada.
That's the food's been great,

53
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,970
but not having lemonade.
It's unacceptable.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,540
Fucking a letting and not have
lemonade because it's sub zero up here.

55
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,360
That's like some, some
summertime shit. Oh,

56
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,570
lemonade lemonade's year round lemonade.
It's incredible.

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,230
I'm not saying it's not good
fall. Yeah. With the first lady.

58
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,500
Did you see your face when you, do you
have stock in the lemonade? Do you like,

59
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,580
but lemonade is year round. Let me make
wonderful kid up the kid in a hell no.

60
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,110
The, the, the girl in mocked and I go,
can I get an Arnold Palmer? And she lived,

61
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,910
she froze up and she goes, UN UN Arnold.
And that's when I realized, dude,

62
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,520
you're out of the country,
man. You got to, yeah.

63
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,660
And then you kinda just
smirked and put your head down.

64
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,810
[inaudible] I knew you were like,
this is going to be a disaster.

65
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,370
Like they don't even golf up here.
They don't have golf up here.

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,380
If you notice there's no golf courses.
Yeah,

67
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,650
I guess it was a little crazy hilarious.
We drove by one the other day.

68
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,740
People golf up here like they
know who tiger woods. No they do.

69
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,940
But it's just funny that I use an American
golfer as a drink thinking that some

70
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,350
kid and in a waitress would know and
an American golfer from like the 60s,

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,380
that would be like somebody from Canada
go into like South Carolina in ordering

72
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,450
a rocket.
We showered 19 year old Canadian waitress.

73
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,040
Oh I bought the little stuck up.
Ah Shit.

74
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,430
Get the fucking airport this morning
in Halifax had in like the one,

75
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,420
the one jerk we've met in Canada. How nice
to the people in eastern Kansas. It's,

76
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:38,560
it's beyond are unbelievable.
They're over the top. Nice. Uh,

77
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,180
they've been great and I agree with you.

78
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,460
You know what you said something and I
didn't say it cause I thought you were

79
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:46,080
going to be like, you know, fucking
Versie complaining, but she, you know, I,

80
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:49,540
I you ordered a juice and then I ordered
one and I asked, how's the root beer?

81
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,870
I mean, how's the ginger one member?
I go, how's the Ginger Hammer?

82
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,750
And she just Kinda just goes, she goes,
she's looked at me, Derek. She goes,

83
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,970
I don't like ginger, so
you know, I don't like it,

84
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:01,690
but if you like Jennifer and I was out
right then I was out when she said that.

85
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,561
Yeah, no, she didn't.

86
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:05,500
She went and immediately detects
thing and I just started thinking, oh,

87
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:08,560
she must ain't even see your
text. Uh, she wasn't at one point.

88
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,670
She's one of those board hot chicks.
She's working at the fucking airport.

89
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,300
She's done. Yeah, it's over.
She looks in the mirror, she
goes, I'm better than this,

90
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:19,060
but I can't figure out a way
out yet, you know? Yeah. I mean,

91
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,070
there's gotta be addicted, jump
on or or, or something. Right.

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,580
She's probably going to,
what?

93
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,940
She's probably going to start fucking
stripping out there in eastern Canada.

94
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,230
What's a good name for a titty
bar? And he's can Canada Caribou,

95
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:37,000
clam shack,
whatever.

96
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,050
But dude, it was, you will fucking
hilarious when we go. Well, we first,

97
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,970
first of all,
I flew into,

98
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,370
I flew into a Halifax Moncton first night,
Moncton,

99
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,980
um, which is Mon C. T. O. N. I
finally can fucking spell it.

100
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:01,430
I hope I did it right though. From
La, right? Yeah. And this fucking,

101
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:05,300
you want to talk about having
tourettes I land in Montreal.

102
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,540
All right. And I don't know
if I mentioned it last week,

103
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,310
but I actually brought my hockey stuff.

104
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,170
I brought my hockey bag with
my fucking funny, my book,

105
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,840
because I set up a bunch of ammo.
I tweeted that I was,

106
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,280
I wanted to play when I was
up here. So all these people,
you know, come here, play,

107
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,840
come here, play. And everybody's going,
hey, I got stuff you can use stuff.

108
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,900
Don't worry. We'll buy it. We'll
buy you a new Jaque. And I'm like,

109
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,470
that's fucking disgusting. I'm
going to lug my shit up here. Right?

110
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,250
So I'm thinking all you gotta worry about
is I'm going to drag it out of the car

111
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,620
at lax as stick it on one of those
little fucking $2 things, right.

112
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,570
Wheel it to some guy.
He takes it and then I'm done.

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,730
And then when I land in Moncton,
I just fucking throw it on another one.

114
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,520
It's, it's not going to be that
big a deal. It's, it's annoying,

115
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:56,060
but it's not that big a fucking deal. So
what happens? I get to Montreal, right?

116
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,790
There's no cart anywhere.
I'm fucking,

117
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,820
I got the hockey bag on top of my wheelie
bag and I got my computer shift all my

118
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,810
mixer and the podcasts looking like a
complete asshole and in Montreal, right?

119
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,770
Oh No, no way in Montreal. The switch you
have to do. I figured I, I'd, you know,

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,920
I'd land in Montreal. I go through customs
and then I jump on a fucking plane.

121
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,200
You got to claim your fucking
bags. Uh, I dunno why.

122
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,580
I was like,
I guess it's like,

123
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:25,460
do you think I assembled a fucking
bomb when I was on the plane?

124
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,503
So I had a claim,

125
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,130
both those two asshole bags then drag
them back over to someplace else. Right,

126
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,790
and that part wasn't too bad. That's
still sucks. No, it's that. No,

127
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,670
but then I got back upstairs. I had to go
back through security again. It's like,

128
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:41,660
did I assemble a fucking gun on the plane?
Now he,

129
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,440
they admitted that to me there that,

130
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,740
it's funny you said that because
I said when I had the connection,

131
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:50,330
because I flew from New York to Montreal
and Montreal and I said to the guy who

132
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:53,450
I don't have to go. He goes and I said
he was really cool to teach the the,

133
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,120
I guess Tsa, I don't know. But
he goes, he goes, yeah. He goes,

134
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,760
our systems kind of screwed up here
that we don't have it right here yet.

135
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,280
That's what he said. Oh. He said, no. He
said that. He was like, and I was like,

136
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,870
Oh yeah, cause it doesn't matter.
What am I going to do from,

137
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,180
from the Tsa guy was cool with me too.
When I went there,

138
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:08,150
I actually had the paperwork. What are you
doing up here? I go, I'm doing stand up.

139
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,900
And he goes, yeah, the paper and gave
it to him. He goes, he just goes, great.

140
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:14,930
I wish everybody was like this
cause I'm doing just for laughs.

141
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,020
Suggest for lapse is like
the comedy thing of his.

142
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:19,460
So they know exactly what
you're supposed to have.

143
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,580
So it was so nice to come
to this country and not lie.

144
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,820
Cause I always lie when I get it. What
are you doing here? I'm visiting friends.

145
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,560
Yeah. Where do they live?
Near the stadium I got.

146
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:35,450
So I always do that because I don't
want to deal with, cause I, you know,

147
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,390
I never have the right paperwork that
happened to me when I was fucking going

148
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:42,500
into Scotland. I downloaded everything and
God knows, you know, I'm fucking it up,

149
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:47,030
but I'm blaming my, my reps,
you guys didn't show me the
right stuff. Yeah, we did.

150
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:50,900
We sent it three times.
So I always lie when I go into a country,

151
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:54,290
I'd just say I'm visiting friends.
It's weird when you're by yourself,

152
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,080
but if you say you're visiting friends,
um, and then they go, where do they live?

153
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,430
And all you need is a fucking address.

154
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,650
But I had that backfire because
I came up with a comic. I would,

155
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:06,770
I came up to do the comedy nest up
there. Jim Bo's room and uh, you know,

156
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,860
I probably should mention as an
act, it's fine. It's this rule man.

157
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,000
It don't matter if they're going
to see the warm socks, right? No,

158
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,950
it's a great room.
It's actually when you did a festival,

159
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:17,280
you work out there and stuff. But uh,
we went there, we went there to me,

160
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,100
what a host. We went there and
uh, we went there and they go,

161
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,980
what are you doing here? And a comic.
I'm with ghost. You just, just let me,

162
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,491
I'll just,
you know,

163
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:29,070
we're telling you all have visited
friends for the weekend and they go, yeah,

164
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,710
all right. Just wait here. Came back,

165
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,290
got the websites online,

166
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,090
saw that we were working at
the club and you're fucking,

167
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,030
how did they sat that called him and said,
next time you're not getting it.

168
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,710
Don't lie. Figure that out.
Typed in the name bullshit. Well,

169
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,070
I swear to God,
why don't you guys said it's not just oh,

170
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,730
typed and typed in the name
and then saw it and goes, Huh.

171
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:54,150
That's pretty all you know,
because anytime it's so fucking annoying,

172
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,470
can't get away with anything anymore.
I mean,

173
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,150
Jesus Christ back in the day you
had to do some Peter Falk Shit,

174
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,600
but I gotta just tell you, listen to this
and I just not adding up for a second.

175
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,840
Do you mind just standing? I mean,
I might be crazy, but they did it.

176
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,390
It's something, they look at your
shoes and they could figure it out.

177
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,870
You will fucking line. And now they just
say they have the answers to the test.

178
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,700
Paul, we're coming to your
country and enjoy ourselves.

179
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,870
You know that went the fuck.
It's like, you know, Hey Paul,

180
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,670
God forbid you come to Canada and
they don't squeeze a couple of Nicola.

181
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,520
You know what? Fuck these people
thought I was having a good time.

182
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,540
You know why I'm bringing
my American when I was just,

183
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,020
you're lucky you bringing my
dick jokes up to your fucking

184
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,630
frozen Tundra. So anyways,
so I land the night before,

185
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,790
um, land the night before
anyways, and uh, in Moncton.

186
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,020
And then the next day, uh, a buddy of mine
that I met at the Mario Lemieux things,

187
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,130
uh, camp said, if you have a
fucking come up here, I'll,
you know, I'll take you out.

188
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,810
And uh, went up and played
the middle of the day. Dude,

189
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,750
I've never done that on the road. Played,
played a pickup game, a hockey, right.

190
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,100
Right.
In a course I was,

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I was such a fucking nonfactor
in the game as I always am.

192
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,220
I can skate. Okay, now
you could skate. Good man.

193
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,820
I could skate good compared to you, but
I'm not compared to a fucking Canadian.

194
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,750
I can't, no, dude, I you,
you're fucking, I got to just
talk. I don't want it. Let me,

195
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:16,900
let me finish real quick, just real
quick just to tell the people listening.

196
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,140
So I was such a nonfactor second to last,
you know,

197
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,470
time I'm out on the ice.

198
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,980
I actually blocked the shot just so I
would somehow have some positive thing in

199
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:34,120
one shift and I took it right off
the toe. Dude, you showed you my toe.

200
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,610
I'm going to put a post,
a picture of it by my hotel was purple.

201
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,810
Now part of that's because I'm a redhead
and I got an alabaster feet here so it

202
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:46,860
really shows up with your Greek skin.
I don't think you'd notice it as much,

203
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:50,610
but dude, it's like, like they
should for in medical school,

204
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,320
like if they ever just want to show like,
you know what do call it,

205
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,630
a contusion or a bruise,
whatever the fuck they want to call.

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,080
They should punch a redhead because
all the detailed comes out man.

207
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,570
Well, no, you're pale white.
So when you were like,

208
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:06,920
I got to show you the tow yesterday
house, he's like, let me first, let me

209
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,930
just, I'll, I'll look at it
but let me eat. But uh, no, I
just, I can, horrific brass.

210
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,970
Wanted to tell your listeners that the
size of bills hockey bag is so funny that

211
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:22,680
like you travel with this, you
know, we're, we're out here.

212
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,400
Hockey bags are just in general,
a gigantic, you have that.

213
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:29,460
Like you brought the equipment like
you care that much. And I love that.

214
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,130
I love that. Cause you got to do it to
have fun. I mean no, this is a thing too.

215
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,430
I have the number,
some old school podcast listeners.

216
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,920
Remember I used to advertise
skate fenders on my, Oh,

217
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,160
is that right on my podcast.
And as he's, you know,

218
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,390
it's one of the few places you don't
have protection if you get hit by the

219
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,650
fucking puck. Um, if you were in the
whole bird cage thing is, is on your feet.

220
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,090
And this guy did a study where like all
these, like how many manpower games,

221
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,010
you know,
um,

222
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,950
how much manpower you lost per game in
the Nhl due to foot injuries and people

223
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:04,190
getting hit with the puck. So we came up
with these things, scape fenders and uh,

224
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,270
they basically fit right on the side
of the plastic thing. And I just,

225
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,620
I brought him and I psyched
myself up going, I don't
give a fuck. I'm a comedian.

226
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,300
I can't be limping around on stage.

227
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,900
I'm not trying to get anywhere in
this sport and just having fun.

228
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,660
I'm wearing these things. And I got there
and I fucking gave into peer pressure.

229
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm like, nobody else has them on.
I've never even seen anybody with,

230
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,100
I guess some people in the Nhl where him,
so I don't, where the fuck are things?

231
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,680
I've never taken a shot
like that off my foot ever.

232
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,380
Did it hurt when it happened or did
it hurt after? Like it was weird.

233
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,010
It hurt like hell and then all of a
sudden it felt really warm and it actually

234
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,630
felt kind of good.
Yeah,

235
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,230
I finished my shift and then I fucking
sat down and then I was thinking like,

236
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,950
is this thing going to make
me limp? Fortunately I haven't
went, but uh, you know,

237
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:49,270
my, I could bend it and everything. It's
fine. It's just, it's Barney the dinosaur.

238
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,490
Purple Gross. Yeah. Yeah,
yeah. That's fucking bad.

239
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:54,900
So I wouldn't have worn them either.

240
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,010
I would have done what you did if
I saw nobody with the guards. I'm,

241
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,280
I'm not put this fucking box analysis.
Yeah.

242
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,790
And then on top of that I was in
another country, so it's like, oh these,

243
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,930
it was pussy Americans. They fucking
come up dead dress like Lindy rough.

244
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,210
Um, that's funny man. Hang on a second.

245
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,190
I actually for should have
said fucking off Samuelson.

246
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:17,400
He used to wear the most fucking peds.
I just remember long time ago Fred Cusack.

247
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,260
So we gave Lindy referred cheap shot
and on the Bruins and it's an even,

248
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,160
it was such a fucking cheap shot that
even the color commentator had to be like,

249
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:29,370
wow, you know, that was kind of
cheap. And then Frey Cusick goes,

250
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,380
well you have to hit him.
He's so well protected.

251
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,471
So anyways,

252
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:36,970
we're up here and I'm trying to see how
much time we're doing cause I got to

253
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:40,530
know when to fucking read. Yeah. I got to
read a little bit advertising here. Um,

254
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,460
well when, when, when we come back from
the advertising, I'm going to talk to a,

255
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,300
we're going to talk about Paul Versey
actually bought a pair of skates up here.

256
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,160
Uh Oh yeah. All right. Hang on
a second. Hang on, hang on, hang

257
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,240
on. Okay. Where are we? Paul, you
ever heard me read out loud before?

258
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,730
No, this is bad. Oh, maybe I'll just let
you know. It's all your respect for me.

259
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:02,780
It's going to go out the window.
All right.

260
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:07,370
stamps.com everybody getting your mailing
and shipping done can seem like a no

261
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,390
win situation.

262
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,530
Going to the post office takes up
valuable time leasing a postage meter,

263
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:16,430
expensive with the multiyear. Come with
multiyear commitments and hidden fees.

264
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,030
Luckily I know a better way.
What is it?

265
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:24,440
stamps.com stamps.com buy and print
official US postage for any letter or

your own computer and printer.

267
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,730

You can't find it.

268
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,160
The post office plus stamps.com is more,

269
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,900
is more powerful than a postage
meter at just a fraction of the cost.

270
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:43,250
You can save up to 80% compared to a
postage meter and you'll avoid those time

271
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,320
consuming trips to the post office.

272
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,760
I use stamps.com for all my DVDs that

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,450

there, Paul? Oh man, that's tough. Huh?

319
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,210
What is that? What would that be?
Paul? Come on. You're good at math.

320
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,070
That's like four under 80 it's like,
it's like,

321
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,450
what is it like 67 76 18
times. Wait, what'd you say?

322
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:52,451
18 Times three times four is the 76 well
18 times 20 would be 80 minus eight.

323
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,180
It'd be 72 [inaudible] 72 but you
know, whatever. Yeah. Just shoot.

324
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,000
What the fuck dude, what do you
care who? I mean, who are you?

325
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,090
I mean who am I am just uh,
Johnny Sanchez.

326
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,740
Oh. So anyways, hey, I got, I got to
do it. I called it this week. Oh yeah.

327
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:12,080
What was it say going to mean Shit to you?
Cause it's not sports,

328
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,940
but it's a different thing.
It was a drummer.

329
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,260
I've been telling people for years to
watch this guy, Mike Johnson's, uh,

330
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,210
Mike johnston.com Mike's lessons.com.
Sorry. Um, his drum lessons. He was just,

331
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,420
he was the best guy right out of
the gate when Youtube started.

332
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,630
He just immediately had the best,
like most informative,

333
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,100
explained it the best,
played the best as far as the instructors.

334
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:36,230
The guy was just head and
shoulders above everybody.

335
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,700
And I've been telling people
to go to this guy's, you know,

336
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,080
website and sign up for
his lessons and all that.

337
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,920
And this month he's on the cover.
Oh, modern drummer magazine.

338
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,970
They've never had, they've never
had a drum instructor on the cover.

339
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,240
That's a good camp. I called it
ever that you go look at that Paul.

340
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:56,570
It's not just with sports. That's a good
dude. I called it and is even better.

341
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:01,400
So I get the issue and I, uh, you
know, I, I of course, you know,

342
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,890
opened it to read the whole article on it.
And as I'm going through,

343
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:06,260
I see this other article and I'm
looking at this guy's face go,

344
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,700
and I know that fucking guy.
Who was that?

345
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And it was sandy genero now
sandy genero taught at the,

346
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:17,930
uh, he's laughing about something else
he taught at or it's still teaches at the

347
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:20,690
drummer collective. And I took
lessons for him like 10 years ago.

348
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,090
Big Time Yankee Fan.
I was taking lessons with them.

349
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:27,230
My Oldest Sandy Gennaro would you say?
I Dunno, I dunno how old he is, Paul.

350
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:30,890
You don't do that in show business. He
looks phenomenal and he plays even better.

351
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,680
He's a great guy,
despite the fact that he's a Yankee Fan.

352
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,110
So I used to take lessons
from him this not long ago.

353
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:41,111
It was like I was taking lessons with
them with Don Zimmer tried to attack Pedro

354
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,810
Martinez and he grabbed fucking dawn
by his head and just use this momentum.

355
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,960
The ground. He did not
push that man. That's still
fucking, that's still a little,

356
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,140
what was his, what was he supposed to do?
Paul? Just step out of the way, you know,

357
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,230
and then what guy by his
head and then what he puts,

358
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:00,280
she pushed him down on
the nice soft grass.

359
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,760
Did you ever see that grass,

360
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,300
that grass at Fenway park is a
blend of Kentucky blue grass.

361
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,360
What would you have? Argentina. Green.
What would you have done if Paul Zimmer,

362
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,171
we'll, I'll, I'll do,

363
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:17,290
I'll do the bit that I was doing back
in the day and I used to do this in New

364
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,350
York and it would kill front of Yankee
fans. All right. I'll say, Oh man,

365
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:24,850
you see what Pedro did to Don Zimmer
and that'd be a Booboo, and I was,

366
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,880
I would say that it was a red sox fan
and this is how I explained it. I said,

367
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:32,140
look, went don Zimmer ran at
him. He had three options,

368
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,740
either one runaway and then he's the pussy
that ran away from an 80 year old man

369
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,230
to punch the guy in the face,

370
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,380
which you're not going to do that because
then you punched an old guy or three,

371
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,820
grab him by his Macy, Dave head and just
sorta guide them down to the ground.

372
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,530
You saw him afterwards.
Yeah,

373
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,830
on simmer was crying saying he shouldn't
have done it. He lost his composure.

374
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,030
Now he did lose his composure. That
was, he looked like a of old bulldog.

375
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,120
If you took his chew
toy. Yeah, that was bad.

376
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,440
You know what the whole thing was bad
because Don Zimmer, he's basically,

377
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,120
you know from the top of his head to
his toes, his baseball. Did he get,

378
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:19,090
he got married.
How cool is his wife?

379
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,610
Like he got married
like at a baseball park.

380
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:25,060
Like they were walking like
all the players were standing
there with bats making

381
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:28,690
like an arch and he would walk in
underneath it. So that was the bad thing.

382
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:33,190
But you know his legacy after that many
years though is the Pedro Martinez.

383
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,070
It is. It's throwing. No, but
they've, I mean they talk about it.

384
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,170
You can't let it Don Zimmer without
thinking that I do. Cause he also,

385
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:45,840
he coached us, he played on the bumps
that want it and 55 you know, Paul's,

386
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:49,270
you know your history. I don't know
if you know your sports history.

387
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,710
You always give me shit. Well, I was
born in 68 how the fuck would I not,

388
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,150
how would I know the 55 Brooklyn Dodgers?
How would I know that? I, you know,

389
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:00,250
I'm one of those guys that
I guess I just cared after.

390
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:04,830
I just cared when I was
able to watch selfish. Yeah.

391
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,120
Anyways, so I read through and
I see Sandy Gennaro. I'm like,

392
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:13,720
Holy Shit, this is the guy I used to
take lessons with. He's such a great guy.

393
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,390
He's the first guy that showed me a
technique to try to do some of that.

394
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,620
Those bottom triplets. Just
a fucking great guy. Um,

395
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,970
journeymen drummer, who's,
he's played with everybody.

396
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,080
He's fucking play with every,

397
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,050
his first group he started off with
the lead singer was Michael Bolton.

398
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,930
It was like a rock group. I forget
what they words wisely. Yeah.

399
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:34,210
They got some of their
videos up there and, uh,

400
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,680
and then he became like a hired gun,
uh, pat Travers band. Cindy Lopper,

401
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,630
the monkeys, like all
that pops. He's done.

402
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,100
Pat Benatar was a Pat Benatar,
Joan Jett. I can't remember.

403
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,070
He's got a bunch of great
stories or whatever. So, um,
so anyways, so I'm like, Oh,

404
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,630
Fuck Sandy. Gennaro. I gotta, I
gotta watch some of his videos.

405
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,290
So I look it up and I find this
fucking video that I sent you.

406
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,820
This is why Paul is laughing.

407
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,570
When I brought up Sandy Generra because
sandy is from Staten Island and this,

408
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:09,320
this guy interviewing him
from Staten Island. I gotta,

409
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,680
I gotta put this video up
there because when I have to,

410
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,800
when I think of a stereotypical New
Yorker Dude, it sounded like too,

411
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:19,640
is that kid Bobby a on an SNL,
Bobby Moynihan,

412
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,400
this like right in his wheelhouse,

413
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,290
like this is a character he would
do and that was all excited.

414
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,070
He was so excited to meet Sandy Gennaro.
This is how he does the interview.

415
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,510
He goes,
oh my God,

416
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,410
I'm standing in Santee genero this guy,

417
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:38,240
he's played with everybody. Sandy to
tell us about some of the interviews,

418
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,074
get

419
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,040
he ends his question going,
Gad, get everything he said.

420
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,220
So when you were like coming up in rock,
you know when rock and roll and who,

421
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,750
which drummers really
influenced you again, guy. Yeah,

422
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:56,720
I think he only said it once, but I
was like, when I saw that, I was like,

423
00:24:56,721 --> 00:25:01,721
Bobby Moynihan would take that little
little thing and we would turn that until

424
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:05,980
I told you Monaghan did guy Fieri. I got
to see the diner's dives and whenever,

425
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,920
yeah,
that's it.

426
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,640
He's got the hair spiked back and he was
like at the chin hair and he does the

427
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,160
whole, you got this guy and
he's got the enthusiasm.

428
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,710
That's my favorite thing that
Bobby did was when he was doing,

429
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,040
they were showing the different kind of
drunk people at, at the concert. Oh neat.

430
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:25,160
Did the drunk point and guy and they
started playing the song ants marching,

431
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,020
that dat, Dat, Dat, Dat, dat, Dat, dat.

432
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,880
He was doing it then when he's drunk and
he was like pointing towards the stage.

433
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,930
It's a fucking visual. You've got
to see him do it. And you know,

434
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:37,490
it's funny as I've been to a zillion
concerts and seeing that guy and I never

435
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,680
really thought about it,
but when he did it,

436
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:43,010
I fucking died laughing going like I've,
I've seen that guy a zillion times.

437
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:47,830
So anyways, so there you go Paul. That's
my big, my big, my big weekend in my,

438
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,250
my hobby there. The drum world. I got
to uh, well I came into your little hot,

439
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,080
you got me into this hockey
thing this week, man.

440
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,400
To you fucking buying those
skates was the funniest shit ever.

441
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,650
It was like my wife trying
to find a pair of shoes.

442
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,580
This fucking guy tried on like you
supposed to, well first of all,

443
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:08,360
only Canada has a, has a selection
and a wall like that. We go into the,

444
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:11,390
and that was a shit one two cause they
said the best one was down in Halifax.

445
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,210
That was a shit one. Well they would,
shit is fucked. You know what it was,

446
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,590
it was a shit time to go in
because it was, it's almost spring.

447
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:18,381
It's fucking hilarious.

448
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:21,140
It's like minus 30 out here and
it's like springtime for them.

449
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:26,120
They had a wall top to bottom,
every brand and it was $700 skates there.

450
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,120
There was $700, $300. And I'm like, look,

451
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,770
I haven't been on skates
and I'm 11 years old.

452
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,200
So I'm thinking I'm going
to go in and get like $60

453
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,120
and you kinda like you kinda you.
I hope my wife doesn't listen to this.

454
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,980
I spent a little money. Uh,
but she goes, I fucking with
dude, whatever. I'm kidding.

455
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,460
I'm, I'm that one. I'm afraid
my wife, right? Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,440
The support your Freddy away if that's
okay. You don't have to back pedal line.

457
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,681
No,
but listen,

458
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:53,370
it is kind of crazy to spend money on
skates when you haven't done it, you know,

459
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:56,850
in, in how many years and
then you're going, listen,
you're good. You got, you got,

460
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,550
you could, you didn't like peer
pressured me into it, but you just go,

461
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,410
those are good. They'll last
forever. And in my mind I'm like,

462
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,540
I'm going to have these for 20 years.
So then I was like, get me this,

463
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,510
get me this pair.
And they didn't have my size.

464
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:09,600
And then I finally got these and you
were giving me shit saying I was being a

465
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,970
diva, trying to get a
pair of ice skates. But

466
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,880
one thing he and I had to literally walk
away because I'm one of those people,

467
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,530
Paul,
like the second I finished a meal,

468
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:22,350
I get up and I leave and I've
been working on doing that.

469
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't know if you've noticed on this
tour that I've actually sit there like,

470
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:30,800
dude, I'm scattered brain. Like I'm
already, I'm like finishing my last bite.

471
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:33,690
Stacy says I get up and leave and she
goes, can we enjoy this? Our water?

472
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,240
Can we just enjoy the rest of this? And I,
but I like to sit to now. Oh okay. Yeah.

473
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:41,970
Yeah. So I'm trying not to do that
shit. So I'm seeing you just keep like,

474
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,900
like some wine connoisseur keeps
sending these fucking skates back.

475
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:47,910
So I literally,
and I'm,

476
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:51,180
and I want to get down to Halifax because
I got something that's another place

477
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:54,000
where I can skate. Cause my old
things, I'm not going to booze.

478
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,320
I'm going to skate on this fucking thing.

479
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm actually going to lose weight for
once and not become Billy fat face on the

480
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,020
fucking road. You could do
that having a couple of drinks,

481
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:04,240
but we'll talk about that. A hilarious,
Paul's trying to twist my arm. I've,

482
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,280
I've got, I've got, I got 35 days
in pork. I'm, I'm 53 today. Okay.

483
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,840
I haven't hit my wife in seven weeks and
you're going to have to go back to the

484
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:13,674
drink.

485
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,200
We can't not how so anyways,
so I literally,

486
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:24,030
I'm walking up acting like I'm
checking the car to make sure nobody in

487
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,840
unbelievably friendly Canada
is going to steal that.

488
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,190
Well either you go first,
you go out,

489
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,910
we're going to go check the car and
then you go, no, the car is fine.

490
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,120
You even said no, the car's fine.
And then when the third pair,

491
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,820
when I had to change the third paragraph,
I'm going to check the car.

492
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,380
It's always a deal. So I come walking
back in and I'm literally just going,

493
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:48,000
all right, stay calm, stay calm, don't
lose your shit. Don't pressure this guy,

494
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,870
he's buying skates. He's going to fuck
up his feet if he buys the wrong ones.

495
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:55,470
Don't be a selfish Dick Cause you want
to drive down to Halifax. Who I now,

496
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:58,560
so I come walking in there and you
have on another pair of skates and I'm

497
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:01,290
thinking like, okay, he looks
pretty happy. I'm like, I'm like,

498
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,870
how do they feel Paul? And you're
like, you know the right ones. Good.

499
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:07,530
But the left one is there's something
that's pushing against my toe.

500
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,200
It's kind of there was pushing
against my toe, but he even felt it.

501
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,540
And he went in and he said they're
all like that. And he goes,

502
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,130
they're all like that. And he
goes, put your heel back there.

503
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,990
You've got to slam your
heel down and then tight,

504
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,210
tight right around your
ankle and your toes.

505
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,780
Your toes supposed to be feathering the
end. There we were. That's what he said.

506
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:23,730
Don't let your toes for how
excited where we walk in.

507
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,610
Because also that was then
we'd drive down to Halifax.

508
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm driving fucking versing
nuts cause I'm doing,

509
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,740
what did I do on like 140 kilometers?
Who speed 140 kilometers in? Uh,

510
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,480
what kilometer zone was it?
I don't know.

511
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:40,020
But you were speeding and it was snowing
out and we even saw a truck fish till

512
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,490
you were scaring the shit out of me.
Oh yeah.

513
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:46,990
There's always a guy in a pickup who
fucking goes off the road always in pickup

514
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:49,300
because I've got four wheel drive,
no worry about it.

515
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:50,980
And he went right off
pay you at one point.

516
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:54,280
I got you fish tail one at one time and I
go, man, you gotta. Yeah, that wasn't me.

517
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:58,560
That was the snow. That was
dumb when I just said, yeah,

518
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:01,700
that's way not supposed to be speed and
you fucking idiot. You even said you.

519
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,020
I could feel your nervous as I was
scared, man. Now you have a way.

520
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:08,800
When I'm driving too fast,
you have a way about you.

521
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:13,000
You sit in this fucking way
where you don't grab your leg,

522
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,370
right, but you put your hand on
the side, that's fovea leg in you.

523
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:20,470
All your fingers are all spread apart.

524
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:24,100
Like you're getting ready to fucking
squeeze the material and I pants pants on

525
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,120
an airplane to like,

526
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:27,850
it's going to matter like the
grip or my hand is going to stop.

527
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,540
I slowed down to about 120 kilometers.
You, you were like in a row. You were,

528
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,660
you were in a rush to get to hell because
the public skate was at four o'clock

529
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:41,800
and then we had two shows. So we
show up down in Halifax, right?

530
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,760
Get another fucking unbelievable meal.
Unbelievable fucking fit.

531
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,790
And it wasn't even the best place. Now
let me tell you something, since it was,

532
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,490
the fucking hotel place was incredible.
Let me tell you something right now.

533
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,620
If you guys are ever in Halifax and you,

534
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,880
and you stay at the Atlantica Halifax,
it was the best.

535
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,560
What one wants the Atlantic? It was
the Atlanta, Atlanta in Halifax.

536
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,010
It was the best fucking seafood
chowder I've ever had in my life,

537
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,540
in my life. I couldn't believe what
I was eating. I couldn't believe it.

538
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,790
I was eating. I told you, I said if my
dad ever bit as he'd start crying. So he,

539
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,440
yeah. And I, I had scallops or something
like that was an unbelievably fresh,

540
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:21,490
right. So, ah, so then we'd
go down to the, the, the, the
front desk and I go, yeah,

541
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:25,150
we wanted to escape. I'm waiting for them
to laugh at US thing. I, yeah, I go where?

542
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,850
How do you drive? There they go. It's
right over there. He can walk to,

543
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:30,700
it was right there pointing across the
fucking go there with thinking it's going

544
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:35,380
to be an indoor rink. It's sleeting
outside, not sleeping. It was more no one.

545
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:35,870
Right.

546
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,700
So we fucking walk down there and all of
a sudden I just see in the distance out

547
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,970
in this field is fucking Zamboni
driving around and I'm going, Paul,

548
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:47,510
I think it's a, I think it's outside.
And you're like, no, no, no, no.

549
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:49,150
It's inside, it's inside. And I'm like,

550
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:51,660
I don't think that guys like fucking
doing donuts with that thing.

551
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,340
I was in denial about it. I go,
maybe there's one next to it inside.

552
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,860
I know you didn't have gloves or anything.
It's fucking hilarious.

553
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,830
So we go down there and says giant oval.
Yeah. Giant House. Cool though. Man.

554
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,930
I just wish it wasn't snowing cause
the ice stumps like a race track.

555
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:07,870
It wasn't like a big open rank.
Yes. It was like you go around,

556
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:10,020
it was like it like in the Olympics,
the speed skating thing,

557
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,930
it was fucking unreal. I was nervous
so I was nervous because like,

558
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,050
you know when you go inside with a rink,
I could fall into the boards,

559
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,320
I could skate into the boards of grab it
and then I knew that there was nothing.

560
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,810
So that's why he's supposed to skate
on the outside. That's what he said,

561
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:25,930
skate on the outside because they had
the railing and I felt good. But uh,

562
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,530
I was joking last night on stage I go,
I go burrs one of these guys, you know,

563
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,450
he's not admitting he's
good. I go to me, can I go?

564
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,850
He was spinning around like
Dorothy fucking Hamill out there.

565
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,890
I picked it up though, right? Yeah
you did. You did grab by the first,

566
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,120
your first time out there you are great.

567
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,910
I told you I was glad I didn't have
a helmet because I felt, I was like,

568
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:45,770
don't crack your head.
Don't crack your head.

569
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:49,850
And if I had a helmet I might be like,
well I spent, I spent $80 on a helmet.

570
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:55,130
You know what, you're going to use
it right now. It's been good so far.

571
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:56,260
So I got a,

572
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,670
I got a couple more games lined up
a pickup games, which is the shit.

573
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,460
Um, well I'll watch it.
I mean I'll, I'll, I'll,

574
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,520
I'll go skate in the corner like that,
you know, I'm the one. Yeah. You know,

575
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,790
go watch me fucking play hockey with
people who actually know how to play and

576
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,590
you'll see that whole Dorothy Hamill,
uh,

577
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,820
idea that you have of me is going to be
out the fucking window fall on my face.

578
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,910
What would happen if you gave me a stick
and I had to concentrate on a puck?

579
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,120
Be a nightmare. Well at least you
probably wouldn't fall down as much.

580
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,440
You didn't fall down at all.

581
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:26,870
But then if you've got the stick
that kind of helps you stay up. Yeah,

582
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,650
I got him admit it's weird
skating without a stick. Oh. Like,

583
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:34,280
I don't have confidence skating backwards
without a stick to something about it.

584
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm just used to that.
Yeah. I don't know why.

585
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,980
And having all my stuff on. So if I fall
down, I know bruise like Mike, Mike,

586
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:47,720
my toe. You know how bad a fucking, how
about that guy who was dressed nice.

587
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,960
Oh, the guy looked like he
was going out to the club.

588
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:53,960
Guy looked like he was going to a wedding
reception. He was so good at skating.

589
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,130
Oh,
he looked like he was going,

590
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,860
he had like nice pants on and he
was just whipping around there.

591
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,740
He wasn't sweating it off.
No,

592
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,340
probably it went right to the club got
blown and that fucking left showed up to

593
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:07,580
the club holding them. Exactly.
Hey, by the way, that we, uh,

594
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:10,780
we want to thank everybody who came
out to the show so far on this tour. A,

595
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,460
we're having a great fucking
time up here. And, uh,

596
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:17,690
even the New York or Paul Versey,
he's saying that he loves Canada.

597
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:21,050
We're having a great time up here. Um, a
lot of people make fun of this country.

598
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:22,790
I don't know why I like them.

599
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,080
You know what I like about these guys is
Russia's going into the Ukraine and you

600
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,780
can, you know, and they can sit here
and shake their heads like, wow,

601
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:33,280
we don't approve of that, but they're
not going to be like, you know,

602
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,480
Canada never really has gotten involved.
Right.

603
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,630
Canada has never been one to get
involved on how well they'll,

604
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,440
we drag them into our fucking message.
Like a bunch of their guys have gotten,

605
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,530
I've gotten killed over
and the Middle East,

606
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,710
if you watched the hockey night in Canada,
Don Cherry shows him all the time.

607
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,770
It's fucking brutal. Yeah, it
was. They actually show him,

608
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:56,771
we don't show him down there because
after they all the college kids protested

609
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:01,100
Vietnam and you know, they'd
figure it out. Well don't
show this shit on the news.

610
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,620
So they just, you know, and
then this rag him, that's funny.

611
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,500
They're like the neighbor that like is
laid back and doesn't want to go out to

612
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:09,680
the club and we're like, no,
just, yeah, no. Starting to fight.

613
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:14,630
We start a fight like right Paul White
Canada. You think that too, right?

614
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,560
Yeah. I mean Kinda, I don't know
if we had to resort to violence.

615
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,280
Yeah. So anyways, uh, how far into this
thing am I? Can I get in with the, uh,

616
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:29,060
the questions here? What do we have any
other stories? Were about 35 minutes then.

617
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,290
Hang on one second. I appreciate you
doing this fucking video. I mean,

618
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,800
video the fucking podcast here because,
uh, telling you, man, I fucked up my,

619
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,890
Oh, this road rage yelling
last weekend. I fucked it up.

620
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,160
So I'm trying to avoid
here. Um, all right,

621
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:48,110
let's get into the questions
here for this week.

622
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,853
Uh,

623
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,500
alcohol and cardiac health. All right,
so here it is. So, so far. So by the way,

624
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,610
this is a perfect topic. It is, isn't it?
Yes. It's a pleasant topic because, well,

625
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:03,410
this is the lungs and the longest have
hung out with you without absolutely

626
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,130
destroying my liver. No, I was just on
the phone. My wife and I said, stays.

627
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:11,540
Not one drop of alcohol, not one gene.
She believed, you know, she goes, yeah.

628
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,030
And I go and I go, not only
that, I had seven fucking salads,

629
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,980
I said I've eaten seven salads,

630
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,090
I've eaten seven salads and
I've had not one drink alcohol.

631
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,300
I haven't had a cigar. I have
been an angel. But you know what?

632
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,750
The buck stops here. Okay,
I'm telling you right now,

633
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,510
devil is tossed one of the greatest lines.

634
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,380
One of the greatest lines ever said.
We were out,

635
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,160
we were smoking a cigar without booze.
Zoe weren't, no we weren't. We weren't.

636
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,910
We were, we were driving out to
the fucking Gig and Long Island,

637
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,210
we've always before the cigar,
we're driving out to a giggle long tent.

638
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,140
We had the, uh, the, the
Westbury music fair. And,

639
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,430
and we're sitting and we're talking about
how we haven't drank and we're talking

640
00:36:49,431 --> 00:36:53,240
about cigars. And a bill starts
the sentence with this. He goes,

641
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,560
but poor man, I gotta tell Ya. And I'm
thinking the next thing out of his mouth,

642
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,490
I feel great. I don't want
to drink anymore. And he
just goes, I gotta tell you,

643
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:02,324
man.

644
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,230
Okay,

645
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,290
the devil inside of me is
tossing and turning. And I said,

646
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,920
that is a fucking movie
line. I said, Scorsese,

647
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,230
fucking terantin.
I'll have to hear that.

648
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,680
The devil inside devil
tossing and turning.

649
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:19,840
You know the devil tossing and
turning. Ah, great. Lion Brewery.

650
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,990
Like I said yesterday, I go are two devils
are in some room right now. Just going,

651
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,510
what the fuck?
Let us out.

652
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,670
We've had,

653
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,670
we've basically been up here on a kind
of a mandate is what we've been doing so

654
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:38,510
far. It's been fucking ridiculous. Reading
Salad. I'm going to bed at like fun,

655
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:43,130
gone a better only drinking
water. I'm drinking water
like it. It's just, you know,

656
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,160
you know it was hilarious was when we
went into that bar after in in Moncton

657
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,240
nightmare. Like how hammered
those people got. Oh my God.

658
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,960
And seeing how drunk I know and I
don't judge them because I look and go,

659
00:37:56,961 --> 00:38:01,400
that's what I do. But you never get
locked. I've done that. Oh No, no.

660
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,110
They were friendly. Drunk.
They were friendly. Draw
people touching you shoulder.

661
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:06,860
No, I don't like that. No, no, no. I yell.

662
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,060
I can yet like there's a point
where I get drunk. I'm a,

663
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,950
I'm a happy drunk but if I get
drunk in this, somebody that just,

664
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,590
I dunno what they just fucking,
no,

665
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,360
you turn it to bleacher creature fan
when you get like really that supporting.

666
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,853
Yeah, you're a yeller. Hello?

667
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,920
Like you yell, he does every
syllable at the Alabama Lsu gets

668
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,460
the dream ends tonight and all of these
like Crimson people who were wearing

669
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:39,760
dockers and like are looking at them
going, what is he talking about?

670
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,130
I didn't know what there was.
I didn't know the sec was like that.

671
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,380
I thought they will fucking, I
didn't realize it was such like, no,

672
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:45,700
you said something about someone's,

673
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,340
they're so quiet at one time you cause
you never, you never sent it to bear.

674
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:49,941
But one time you,

675
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:52,660
you said something about someone's
like a mother but you didn't say about

676
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,570
someone's direct mother. You were
just like Jesus. No, you were like,

677
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,210
fathers are good now you said
something about that like,

678
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,420
but not like direct and one guy just goes,

679
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,130
well like they just
looked at you like that.

680
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:07,150
There were so horrified there was so
horrified. It was so funny. And then,

681
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:08,090
and then the time you,

682
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,510
you actually made me embarrassed
and blush almost when you,

683
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,390
what you did to the kicker of the Miami
Dolphins, that Guy Carpenter last year.

684
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,070
Like, I'm, I'm sitting there, I'm
sitting there. I'm the comic. I get,

685
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,670
I think things are funny.
I'm drinking and you're just relentless.

686
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,720
Hey, carpet, carpet there.

687
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,080
Everyone was at the
Cincinnati Bangles gaming.

688
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,810
Everyone's looking at bill and I'm
leaning away from him and value

689
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,410
carpenter. You're a liability
carpenter. Yeah. That field goal kicker.

690
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,340
Get your real estate license and
you had half the people laughing

691
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,170
and I'm going, bill is fucking,
it made the Bengals fan said,

692
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:50,130
get on that guy carpenter. He said, he
said yeah. And it was a close game. So,

693
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:52,680
you know, no, they were all into
it, but I was like, oh my God.

694
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,840
He was the chairman for the home team.
He's going in.

695
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,510
Oh, that's too bad. I say, that's why
I gotta be honest with you. Like I, uh,

696
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:06,870
I'm liking, like live in like this. I'm
going to fuck it up tonight. Tonight,

697
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,380
we're actually in Toronto and we're
going to the maple leaf's game. Um,

698
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,040
and I've been trying to explain to Paul
what an absolute honor and privilege it

699
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:18,150
is to somehow score may believe
tickets because I have hookups.

700
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,260
Um,
like literally NHL Office,

701
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,220
I blogged for them so they still know a
couple of people over there and I never

702
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:27,570
hit him up for tickets or whatever.

703
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:32,571
But like the maple leafs are the
only ones they don't give a fuck.

704
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,170
Like they just like, yeah, no, there's
no tickets. No. Somebody told me,

705
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:40,020
have you been to a cat? Have you been
to a hockey game in Canada before?

706
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,550
And I said No. And they go,
it's another, it's a whole
other level. Oh, it's awesome.

707
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,490
Like it's fucking awesome. They
go not really. And they, they,

708
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,550
they obviously it's their game.
They know the game.

709
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,340
They won the men's and women's gold.
Oh we talked yesterday.

710
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:56,280
Being in Canada lets me know when
a son and father escaped together.

711
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:59,580
It's like the equivalent of a father and
son throwing the ball in the backyard,

712
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,260
playing baseball. Like, you know,

713
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:03,390
I've never seen a store that has that
many hockey skates. Like everything has,

714
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:06,030
hockey was that oval thing. I've never
seen anything like that. That was all,

715
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,490
I thought that was the coolest fucking
thing ever. Like I always like,

716
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,120
like that's the kind of shit.
Like if I have a move back east,

717
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:15,200
I would build that in my bag.
I would build a backyard hockey ranked.

718
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:16,260
There's no fucking way.

719
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:19,710
I wouldn't goddamn global warming
by the time I fucking do it.

720
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:23,280
I'm not going to be able to have to
fucking live in the Yukon to do it. Um,

721
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,150
all right, let's do, uh, let's
do some, uh, some questions
here for this week. Uh, ALC.

722
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,120
Yeah, this right. And that's
what set this whole thing off.

723
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,640
Alcohol and cardiac health.
Hey,

724
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:39,590
Billy cream tits
insult me every week.

725
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,930
This is the worst thing that they like me,
uh,

726
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:46,130
for a couple of years in a row during
lent, I abstained from alcohol.

727
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,110
It sucked, but it felt good to challenge
myself. I did this because all my life,

728
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:55,370
I've always heard that total abstinence,
abstinence is the best health.

729
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,360
However,

730
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:01,160
recent research has shown that moderate
drinkers actually have reduced risk for

731
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:05,600
coronary heart disease up to
29% lower than total abstainers.

732
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,010
Although researchers aren't clear
as to why it's food for thought.

733
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,210
If I were you, if I were you, I would
have a damn drink. If, if you want one.

734
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,820
I know it's tough sometimes
to drink in moderation.

735
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:20,240
I simply try hard to not binge anymore.
Having said that,

736
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:23,990
you are probably healthier having the
occasional cocktail rather than the

737
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:27,890
occasional cigar. Uh, you might
actually live longer. Loved the show,

738
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:31,750
have fun in Canada, come back to the
bay area and go fuck yourself. Um,

739
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,810
that's not a new study.

740
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,800
That's a study that they've been
saying forever that you know,

741
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,660
one glass of wine is supposed to be good.
And I agree with that 100%.

742
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:42,680
That's the carrot cake we had. You know,
that's the carrot cake. You got to do it.

743
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,410
You got to do it, you know,
because then you binge.

744
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,050
Are you going to explain to the
listeners with the carrot cake was

745
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,490
oh yeah. So sorry. So I'm
like talking to, you know,

746
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,250
the carrot cake was when
we went to that place,

747
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:56,920
when we had that ridiculous
lunch and mocked in the
first day we were there. And,

748
00:42:56,921 --> 00:43:00,120
um, I asked for the Arnold pulses and
when we went skating together, no, no, no.

749
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,880
This is what we had carrot cake
together. This the spinner trip, dude,

750
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,170
there's no fucking ridiculous.

751
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,130
I'm starting to become this guy that
needs a dessert with the next SIG free and

752
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:14,080
Roy, no, you're not like this.

753
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:16,900
You're not a coffee dessert guy.
But as I'm getting older,

754
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,090
I don't know what it is,
but after I eat a good meal,

755
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:21,520
I need a piece of chocolate or something.
My Dad was the same way.

756
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,220
So we go to this bar,
we eat this great food,

757
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,400
and I saw angled triangle thing and I say
to the lead trying to, and I said, look,

758
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,970
let you know, do you have
something? And she goes, well,

759
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,600
we got this carrot cake and I'm at an
Irish pub. And I'm like, you know what?

760
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:35,110
Everything was great. I bet you this
is great. This is delicious. So I go,

761
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,110
all right, bring the carrot cake over.
She gives a big piece. I go, Bill,

762
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,300
you want half of this thing? I don't
want any adult thing. He goes, sure,

763
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,170
we bite this fucking thing and I'm going.
And then afterwards you go, yeah man,

764
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:46,090
we were really healthy except
for the carrot cake and that,

765
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,340
that question is right. That
question is 100% right. You

766
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,490
got to do it, dude. How about
the fact that it was homemade?

767
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,110
It was deleted desserts. A
homemade, sorry, that's my
fucking phone. It's delicious.

768
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,980
And I, she's come on, come on enough.

769
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,810
I'm sorry. Yeah. So I agree with the
occasional, you know, the wine a day,

770
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:09,230
a couple of drinks. Look, if we go out
and have three to four cocktails tonight,

771
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:13,160
okay, just stay clean and next
thing, you know what I mean? No,

772
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:17,090
I don't know what you mean because I do
that and then the next time I go on a

773
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:18,950
nice little run I'm not
drinking is like two,

774
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:23,780
three years later because I
just, you know, you can't,

775
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:26,030
you can't, you don't have a couple
of new in this tour is over.

776
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:30,110
Go back on the thing.
I mean that hasn't been my pattern.

777
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,130
I enjoy it Paul. And what? I'm at a point
now where I haven't done it in a while,

778
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:40,040
so now I'm kind of enjoying not doing it
and I'm afraid to go back to doing that

779
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:40,681
now cause I'm not,

780
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:44,490
cause I'm literally an alcoholic just
because of all the extra fucking bullshit

781
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,160
that comes along with it. What you
do, although whatever, who's, well,

782
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:50,461
I'm not,

783
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:52,830
I'm not gonna fucking dwell on this shit
anymore because I know I'm going to go

784
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:55,710
back to drinking. So what the fuck
[inaudible] against the gars dude,

785
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:58,710
I gotta tell you something right now.
A Segarra week is not bad for you.

786
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,960
I'm going, I'm going to say
as a cigar weeks and up fee.

787
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,450
And you can say that without doing
any research. I love it. No, no, no.

788
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,430
That's 52 cigars a year. It's
a joke. What does that, well,

789
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,630
I'm not inhaling anything. I'm going to
do what you're putting into your mouth.

790
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,790
Right.
And then I wash my mouth that it's like,

791
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:15,090
it's like 10 cigarettes for your mouth.
That that study's horseshit.

792
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,120
It's not a study. My dentist
said it to me. Oh, okay.

793
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,000
So then the taste is kind of in
the medical field. I mean he,

794
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:22,170
maybe he knows a doctor.

795
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,530
Where can somebody say not inhaling a
cigar is like smoking 10 cigarettes.

796
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,510
No, no, no, no. He said for your
mouth. He's saying you're not,

797
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,160
it's not bad for your lungs.

798
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,720
Look to Michael Douglas was a big
time cigar smoker and that guy,

799
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,320
he had throat cancer.
He had that Paul,

800
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:40,950
you're putting fucking smoke in your
mouth. But I mean sports a nigger,

801
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:45,000
they say smokes like four a day every
day of his life. He's fine. You know,

802
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:48,240
I told you, that's why I think
you got to do it for a while.

803
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,270
That Guy Hamo in Boston. Oh my
God. Showed you the picture of him.

804
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,980
This guy designed it was this
guy designed a cigar jewelry.

805
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,470
Was it north end? Is
that Boston? Yes. Yeah.

806
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,600
So the north end of
Boston now only has the,

807
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:05,220
only has the only cigar bar lounge in
Boston now because they closed the other

808
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,820
one. So it's the north end and
it's a great place. And He,

809
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,540
the mayor of Boston was in there.
All these politicians were in there.

810
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:16,680
It was hysterical. And that the owner
has the fake Tan and Pinky rings.

811
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:18,240
And how you don't hate it,
he's kissing, you know,

812
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:21,360
he's kissing guys on the cheek like,
and it's so funny how he and Glenn,

813
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,980
thank you guys. Thank you guys for coming
out. Did you, did you enjoy? So yeah,

814
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,220
I to go, oh, come, this is the
place you come to this place.

815
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,300
And then he's got this little friend
named Hama and he goes and I go, hey,

816
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:34,530
what's that man? Is that hey,
they sell jewelry here. It's
my, it's my, it's my, uh,

817
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:38,430
you know, I don't own, I just own
this here. And he had cigar cufflinks.

818
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,650
He had a cigar.
Everything was cigar.

819
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:44,980
He had a cigar ring and it was a
diamond ash tray with, uh, with, uh,

820
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:50,250
a white gold cigar on it in a Red Ruby
to indicate the lit that it was lit and

821
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:53,530
the cigar and I go use when he
goes, everything's, I'm not,

822
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,350
I'm not joking or trying to be fun.

823
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,230
He goes every month I was there with
the matter reason. My brother, he goes,

824
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,380
everything's a guard.

825
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,150
He said to the three things you'd like
to go to my kids plussy [inaudible] and

826
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:08,970
it was the funniest and he
was dead serious. And he
goes, he goes four to five,

827
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:12,030
minimum day, six minimum because
I smoked nine a day bill,

828
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:16,140
he pulled out the sixth, one of the
night, his, I go, how am I going to do,

829
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,710
how many is that for you?
He goes, this fix, right?

830
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,360
I swear to God it was a size of a fucking
cucumber and he's just smoking it and

831
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:27,120
he's going, you want, you want
to $80 a stick. You want it.

832
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,460
This is the best is to vest.

833
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:33,370
I saw a guy outside of firehouse on
eighth avenue when I was in New York.

834
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:36,280
I walked by and I know I smelled this ago.
I always get to turn my head like, God,

835
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,930
Jesus Christ. It's good.
Let me get to the point.

836
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:41,680
It's like here in high heels on the
floor, you just have to look, you know,

837
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,420
and now when I smell the cigar,

838
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,570
I got to look to see like look at the
band to see what the stuff, I looked,

839
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:50,410
this guy, it looked like he
was smoking a pickle brown.

840
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,100
It was like he could, he couldn't
put it between his two fingers.

841
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:58,060
He had a hold it like serious, like a
fun. I never seen anything like it. Wow.

842
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:02,350
Fucking, I even know how he lit
it to fireman. It's fucking elite.

843
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,120
Probably lit it at his
last fire and like I said,

844
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,540
like a house had to be on fire so we
could actually like this fucking thick.

845
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,450
I would seek to those guys
are bad. I would think that
those guys have a problem.

846
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,750
He's probably thinking I'm fighting fires
and breathe in this shit in any ways

847
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,070
that God knows to. Would you come up
to a building, God knows what's in it,

848
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,970
what's on fire or what,
what was deemed safe? Yeah,

849
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,500
just don't light it on fire cause
immediate, all that computer shit,

850
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:34,170
plastics and all that stuff
becomes carcinogens, doesn't
it? The second it starts

851
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,740
in the air. What's the
most about Jesus? I Dunno.

852
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,460
What's the most of guys
you ever had a day?

853
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,800
Have you ever had two or three in a day?

854
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,310
I've had two back to back and then
somebody said to me one time, I said, hey,

855
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,110
you want to have another
one? And he goes, you know,

856
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:50,440
I never found the second set guard
to be better than the first one.

857
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,050
And it's just like, you
know, that's a good point.

858
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:56,510
So I always kind of keep it in that too,
but you know, I smoked them dude off.

859
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,040
Like I smoke them all the way
down to my fingers. Yeah, well no,

860
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:03,250
I thought I was telling somebody that's
strong. One that we had in New York.

861
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,540
I said when birth first lit, the strong
one, he goes, Oh man, this is strong.

862
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:10,060
And I'm thinking since I've been smoke,
cause you know when law had was in town,

863
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,820
Lloyd goes versus you got five and
two days like you've got to calm down.

864
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:16,330
I was going so I thought you
actually handled that one better.

865
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,720
You got it down to the thing. I couldn't
handle it. I'm like two years old. Yeah.

866
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:23,820
I felt like I was hot. No. Once I got
it going, I I you got it down to the,

867
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,290
you got it down under the
thunder, this stuff. But I wasn't,

868
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,240
I wasn't huffin aren't at the way I use.
A lot of that was burning. So I kind of,

869
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,300
I got along longer time out of it. But
when I went to light that thing, dude,

870
00:49:34,301 --> 00:49:36,460
like I swear to God,
if I had a couple of scotches in me,

871
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:39,820
I probably would have puked. I felt like
I was sucking on the tailpipe of a car.

872
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,630
It's not like it didn't, it didn't
have a good flavor. It was just,

873
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:46,240
it was like a week, 10 years. It was like,

874
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,910
it was like you're eating a piece of
cake that just know. It was like Paul,

875
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:52,000
it was like putting smoke in your fucking
mouth. You know, it's bad for you.

876
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,220
It's just 52 times a year. I stand by
in a bus. It's delicious though. It is.

877
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,370
It is. And we're going to do
it. Hey, you know, my, uh,

878
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,030
my wife recently diagnosed
me with having fucking aid.

879
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,350
She's told me forever that I have add and
I never bought into it and she finally

880
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:12,220
went to the website and she read all
the things dude. And it was just like,

881
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,670
they might as well just had a picture
of me sitting there not listening to

882
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:20,260
somebody's focusing. It's on some
ant walking across the table, um,

883
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,270
before looking at something else. Do
you have that problem? I think a lot of,

884
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,640
a lot of myself and a lot of my comedian
friends have that. Yeah. I think it's an,

885
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,660
do you think that that's why we
think in bits rather than script?

886
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,260
I think it's because I think our
minds constantly are going, you know,

887
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,750
our minds are constantly going,
whether it's trying to be creative,

888
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,270
whether it's thinking of this,
whether it's being upset, we're just,

889
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:46,850
we can't concentrate what I was a student.

890
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:52,020
I would say we're no different than
anybody else who's scatterbrained,

891
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,830
which is funny. Scatterbrained
maybe. You know what I mean? Yeah.

892
00:50:55,831 --> 00:50:57,300
It may cause they always try to attribute,

893
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,620
like they had something recently where
they tried to say that, uh, you know,

894
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,490
they did some study.
You know who the,

895
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:09,170
nobody knows who the fuck did it was
starting to say that, uh, you know,

896
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:11,660
they interviewed all these Comedians,
you know,

897
00:51:11,661 --> 00:51:14,720
for this study to figure out
what makes comedians funny.

898
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:19,740
Now immediately I'm thinking any comedian
worth anything is not going to be

899
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:22,850
participating in that fucking thing.

900
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,280
Or if the new one that's struggling,

901
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:28,850
they'll participate and they're going
to give bullshit answers just to make

902
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:30,920
their friend laugh for themselves left.
Right.

903
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,260
So they came up with this
whole thing that, you know,

904
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:37,180
comedians are all sociopaths or some
fucking, oh, I saw it. I didn't like it.

905
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,610
That's ridiculous.
They,

906
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,440
it is because I'm not saying there
aren't comedians who are sociopaths,

907
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,050
but there's firemen,
there's mother's Day,

908
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,980
there's all kinds of people that as does
leaders of the world who are sociopaths.

909
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:53,660
It just what it is is the,
I think it's people who aren't funny.

910
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,830
Only somebody who was not funny
would try to figure out do that.

911
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,480
Why the fuck something's funny?
Absolutely. Like I wouldn't even know.

912
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,370
I wouldn't even like when you were talking
about that guy at the Yankee game who

913
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:10,830
kept yelling out, they had this commercial
where it was a bunch of Yankee fans.

914
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:14,000
You was saying that had spelled out
Yankees across their chest and they were

915
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:17,270
wrong. Yeah, and they were hammered or
whatever. Right. Or they just were wrong.

916
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,540
They were just in not organized where it
said Yankee. So it's an ant ski and ski.

917
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:26,030
So this guy at the game and a time,
anytime there was a lull in the game,

918
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,130
wouldn't it? No, it would.
It would. There'll be a lull
in the game and he would go,

919
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:33,080
Hey,
what the hell is that ski?

920
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:37,340
And everybody would just start laughing
and he knew when to do it. Yes.

921
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,610
Like that guy, he had it and
now that guy was not a comedian,

922
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:43,910
but he had that comic timing when
there was a lull on the game,

923
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,550
he knew it wasn't
important time in the game.

924
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,720
He knew probably wouldn't if there
was a TV time out. Yep. You know,

925
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:55,010
and he wanted to keep the excitement
going in people's focus like that you just

926
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,790
did.

927
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,730
It's like when I look at people who can
like just fucking play an instrument,

928
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:03,410
unbelievably played by ear, you know?
Um, that's obviously just a hobby for me.

929
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,560
So I have a tremendous amount of respect
for people who could do that shit.

930
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,290
But like they could never just
break down that. He was like,

931
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,840
would you just sit there and be like,
no,

932
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:16,190
look what makes this guy be able
to play the guitar like that.

933
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:19,820
It's just like this. They're good at it.
It's an envious nerd who can't do it.

934
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,810
That's what it is.
It's somebody who wished maybe,

935
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:23,180
maybe they wish they could do comedy,

936
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:26,430
but the fact that somebody would do a
study, comedians are all sociopaths.

937
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:29,850
That person never picked up a microphone
once in their life and maybe they,

938
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,980
maybe they had an issue with a
comedian. No, I'm not saying that.

939
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:35,820
I'm not a sociopath, but you, you know,
you're a family man. You got two kids.

940
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,490
Listen, you seem all right.
Listen, I use psychopath.

941
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,010
Comedians might be narcissistic.
Sociopath.

942
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,620
I looked up the definition of sociopath.
Okay.

943
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,610
There was like 11 things or something
like that that you could add to.

944
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,650
Let's look this up. Go it up right
now. One thing I know for a fact,

945
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,510
antisocial parents is one of them. Okay?
Parents, but like, I mean, antisocial,

946
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,410
the world's out to get, you
know, we're not going over
there. Hey, think this of us.

947
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,280
We're not going over. All right,
check, check one for me. What?

948
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,260
My parents were like, Hey, can
I go on this field trip? Nah,

949
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,540
Christ had a patient in the other day.

950
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:13,500
He went on a field trip and he fell
off the bus. He's gone. He's gone.

951
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,610
There's nothing you can do about it.

952
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,180
That was where my first jokes I did in
my attic. Whatever you wanted to do.

953
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,470
My Dad had a patient in the other day and
the kid died from it. Oh, that's funny.

954
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,840
Yeah. He didn't want to drive.
It's over to do it on my dad.

955
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,620
My Dad would now by look at it.
It's fucking hilarious.

956
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,210
I wouldn't do it either with one kid.

957
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:33,240
Forget about Evan fucking all
the ones he yet. Hang on a sec.

958
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,010
How the spot associate with sociopath,
uh, sorry. With the bed. Mike here.

959
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,160
Sociopath. Um, uh, traits

960
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,870
which I misspelled.
Sculpt traps.

961
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,900
How do identify as sociopath telling
signs and be, oh, what the fuck?

962
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:56,210
Why won't this work? Come on, man.
My Dad used to say people what?

963
00:54:56,211 --> 00:55:00,420
He'd disagree with that they were
crazy. There we go. Crazy. They crazy.

964
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:05,490
He's a sociopath. All right, here we go.
What is it? Sociopath. That gives a fuck.

965
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:07,230
Common traits.
All right.

966
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:11,400
The common characteristics and personality
traits of sociopaths are based on the

967
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:15,820
criteria used by clinicians who
use the Dsm map. That what? That,

968
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,260
don't they realize morons want to
read this? I don't give a shit.

969
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:23,040
Just make a list. Yeah. They
should be just a list there.
This should dumb it down.

970
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:25,920
Right. One of the most common
personality characteristics,

971
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:30,270
sociopath is their grandiose
sense of self entitlement.

972
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,520
Now I don't have that and
I go the other way. Um,

973
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,950
sociopath off also often
display a lack of remorse. Yep.

974
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,800
And most have a very manipulative
personality covered by superficial charm.

975
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,190
Um, Jesus, I know a couple of those suit.

976
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,000
I know a couple of these guys
too. All right. Now wait a minute.

977
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,620
So I'm not no dude, you're a
narcissist who has add. Yeah,

978
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,920
I wouldn't be that. Yeah, I
would go with that. That's yeah,

979
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:06,610
I would totally go with that. Dude. That's
hit shit. That's hit men. I don't have,

980
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,360
I don't have a sense of
self entitlement. No. Dude,

981
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:11,790
I hit me and blow someone's brains
out and goes eat a sandwich.

982
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:14,860
That's a sociopath. He gets mad that
he got blood on his shirt, right? Yeah.

983
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,210
That was, that was that
thing in Goodfellas wins.
I'm sorry about your floor.

984
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,280
That's, that's it. That's what it is.

985
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,250
I didn't want to get blood on the
floor cause sociopaths. All right.

986
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:29,251
Friendships and romantic partners are
often frequently disregarded and replaced

987
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:33,670
when the relationship no longer
suits their self centered needs.

988
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,550
The emotions of associates.
Nobody even like the guy.

989
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:40,270
I was just thinking about
Bob being a sociopath. Um,

990
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,040
he doesn't have that.

991
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,370
Well I guess can you have like
most of it and then be a sociopath?

992
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,290
What do you think their doctor Versie
not doctor Versie I talked to by not

993
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,420
doctor [inaudible]. No,
I think what's it called?

994
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,450
I think that it's the remorse thing and
I definitely think it's the first thing

995
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:58,300
you said. The sense of entitlement.
Like this is the cool one here.

996
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:02,050
Look at this one. Jesus Christ. Cool.
Like in like a Reptilian, scary way.

997
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:06,100
The emotions of a sociopath may
appear to be sincere on the surface,

998
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:11,350
cleverly disguised by super
superficial charm and feigned interest.

999
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:12,851
Jesus Christ.

1000
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:16,990
That was me and every class classroom
I ever was in sitting there acting like

1001
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:18,880
you were interested so they
wouldn't fucking calling you.

1002
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,960
Many sociopath's use manipulative
measures to draw others to them.

1003
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,130
Chronic lying as a characteristic
of nearly all sociopath's,

1004
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:31,810
recklessness and aggressive behaviors
are other characteristics as well as

1005
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,840
impulsivity.
A lack of remorse.

1006
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:38,500
He already said that or what is
generally term conscience is typical for

1007
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:40,390
sociopath.
Sky's repeating himself.

1008
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:46,120
The combination of at least three of the
common sociopath characteristics paints

1009
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:50,280
a pretty good description
of the common sociopath. Um,

1010
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,570
I dunno, I actually lost interest
halfway fucking through that. All right.

1011
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,300
They did. They, I didn't,

1012
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:04,330
it wasn't even trying to be
funny that came out of my mouth.

1013
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:06,720
Then I realized that just did
that again. Well y'all, well,

1014
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,880
why don't you look up to look up
a narcissist, see the difference?

1015
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,800
Because narcissist is a selfishness,
but it's almost like a good guy. Yeah,

1016
00:58:13,801 --> 00:58:17,530
but dude, I'm, I'm a Gemini so I
have like, I can be really like,

1017
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:23,530
I mean I think my son's a gem and a Lucas,
mainly a narcissist,

1018
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,120
but then I could be like really
considerate and generous. Dude,

1019
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:31,330
Lucas, my son Lucas is a gem and nine
he's got, when you look at what a gem,

1020
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:33,400
a Geminis traits, sorry dude,
he's, he's every one of them.

1021
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:38,650
She says Christ when he taken
out the crystal ball. All right,

1022
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:41,620
hang on a sec. I love how I
brought up fucking crystal ball.

1023
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,730
I love how I brought up Geminis and then
you start talking about signs and then

1024
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:49,540
I act like you brought it up. Oh, all
right. Hey, how do you spell narcissist?

1025
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,610
Go on Paul. Let's show our
dummy. R N A R narcissus.

1026
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:57,040
Narcissus. I was saying an Ar, maybe what?

1027
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:01,600
Ca Maybe I would've gone with that
if the right spelling didn't come up.

1028
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:06,730
Narcissistic traits or
BBL Scott behaviors.

1029
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,390
Nice assistive behaviors. All right, cool.

1030
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,050
Narcissists have remorse.
Absolutely. Yeah, I think so.

1031
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,250
They feel bad. They suck. Oh, here we go.

1032
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:24,430
I find I found one that's dumbed
down red flags of being a narcissist.

1033
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:27,350
Here we go, Dad, dad,

1034
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:28,790
go ahead.

1035
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:33,400
All right. All right. You feel
on edge around this person,

1036
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,570
but you still want to,
but you still want them to like you.

1037
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,123
What is this?

1038
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,090
Okay,

1039
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,820
wait, so let me, if I gotta figure,
what the fuck. Who is you in this?

1040
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,820
So what's the difference about this list?
Well for one,

1041
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:49,300
it's specifically about relationship,
but it's also about you.

1042
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,380
Each point requires interest
section and self awareness.

1043
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,230
Because if you want to spot toxic people,

1044
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:01,390
you cannot focus entirely on their
behavior. That's only half the battle. Oh,

1045
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:02,224
that's pretty cool.

1046
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:06,940
He wants to also come to recognize the
looming red flags in your own heart.

1047
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:10,620
All right, so this is saying if you're
in a relationship with a narcissist, it,

1048
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,300
they don't have a list,
then I'll just go, Hey Paul,

1049
01:00:13,301 --> 01:00:17,050
I'm trying to make it easy here at
30 lists, like 30 things, nothing.

1050
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,200
Um, well maybe we can actually
use our brains. It just
figured this out here with,

1051
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,630
okay,
you feel on edge around this person,

1052
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:30,870
but you still want them to like you
to use his sex as a tool for control.

1053
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,570
CREEPO that's sick.
Plasters,

1054
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:38,650
your Facebook page with compliments,
flattery songs and poems.

1055
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,280
They text you dozens if not
hundreds of times per day.

1056
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:47,440
You come to rely on this
over communication as a
source of confidence. Wow.

1057
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,440
Oh, so they give it to you
then they take it away.

1058
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,410
You're not texting me four times a day.

1059
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:57,850
Did I do something wrong then I was up
there doing. Yeah, I'm not that. No.

1060
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,410
I can't spell enough words to text
more than 30 times a day. All right.

1061
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,770
Quickly declares you their soul mate.
I don't do that.

1062
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:10,870
Compares you to everyone else in their
life. You just like my mother, uh,

1063
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,530
lies
me,

1064
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:19,110
my uncle Petey lies and excuses.
Why isn't excuses?

1065
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:23,890
That's everybody. No,
no startle response. I,

1066
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,010
you know, what the fuck can you just
have a one for dumb people? All right.

1067
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:32,210
Here we go. Red Flag, narcissistic
behaviors. Jesus Christ.

1068
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:36,250
Look at the bitches fucking picture
on this. Holy Shit. Is this about her?

1069
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,190
She gonna tell me.

1070
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:39,643
Okay.

1071
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,200
Extreme infatuation with one self,

1072
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:45,800
self centered expects to
be recognized as superior.

1073
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:51,170
All right,
now you're getting warm was at you.

1074
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,210
Now you're getting warm. No, I
don't. I don't want to be sure.

1075
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,970
Period. I mean, you know, extreme
infatuations with one's self.

1076
01:01:56,971 --> 01:01:59,440
Self Center expects to be
recognized and just pictures.

1077
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,340
Somebody combing their main in the,
with a mirror,

1078
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:09,600
uh, is preoccupied with fantasies
of unlimited power, success,

1079
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,210
brilliance,
beauty or ideal.

1080
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:17,100
Love sees himself as special.
Do this.

1081
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,240
It should only have to affiliate.
Oh Shit. This is a good one.

1082
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,490
It's a great one.

1083
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:32,620
Sees himself as special and it should
only have to affiliate with others of the

1084
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:36,990
similar stature. I should
be friends with that. Obama,

1085
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,590
I can't believe we hasn't called me yet.

1086
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,860
That's fucking funny man.

1087
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,490
Vantage of others takes advantage
of others to achieve his needs.

1088
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,990
Demonstrates as an ugly one.
The other one's a funny one.

1089
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,910
It was one takes advantage of
others to achieve his needs.

1090
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:56,620
I don't like that one and that other shit.

1091
01:02:56,621 --> 01:03:00,250
Just staring in the mirror thing and
you should be friends with everybody.

1092
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:05,470
It was big. Demonstrates a constant
need for admiration or approval.

1093
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:10,600
Uh, you know, my dad used
to, we'd be upstairs shaving.
Yeah, it was sort of a joke,

1094
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:12,370
but he wasn't joking,
but he was, it was funny.

1095
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,120
We'd be downstairs eating breakfast to
south to be up there getting ready for

1096
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:17,650
work and he'd be shaving in the mirror.

1097
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:20,950
And then when he finished you just
hand me, be like, go look, it's a

1098
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,670
batch. And My mother would
always laugh and shake her head,

1099
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:29,850
but I think that's more, she just liked
a confident guy or something like that.

1100
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:32,970
So thank you. That sounds kind
of like a gel. Like a habit.
It's a joke. Yeah. Yeah.

1101
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:34,320
He's played,
he's saying it out loud,

1102
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:38,100
but I actually I do that makes me laugh
all the time. I'll do it. I'll do that.

1103
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:42,670
Right. Um, I'll just be like, God damn it.
I'm a good looking guy. I'll just do it.

1104
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:46,770
Yeah, I'll shut up,
right? Yeah. There we go.

1105
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,070
That'll be a reason a texted me. What
a fucking ugly bastard I am. Like,

1106
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:52,160
I don't know that already.
Fuck yourself. Um,

1107
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,990
demonstrates a constant need
for admiration or approval.

1108
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:58,890
Exaggerates personal achievements
while minimizing those.

1109
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:05,040
That's fucking hilarious. I want to
be around this guy. I'll tell you,

1110
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:08,550
you know, it's great. It's great the
way you came up with a game plan,

1111
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:12,880
but it's just good the way I
was cheering crowd. Oh Dude.

1112
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,460
I got this chant going. I tell you,
I could see it in Tom Brady's face.

1113
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:21,360
He knew, he knew by what I
was doing in the crowd. Yeah.

1114
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,430
And then he tries to knock the other
guys changing. He keep, keep calling.

1115
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,970
He called an audible, you know,
which I wouldn't have done.

1116
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,420
I would've stuck with
the play and then no,

1117
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,970
but then it says he diminishes the
other guy. The guys chant was all right,

1118
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:35,670
but I got more of them
going. Yeah, I got it.

1119
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,670
And that guy came up to me at the
end of the game was just like gray.

1120
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,410
I don't usually say this,
but you were amazing.

1121
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,340
You go with this list is great.

1122
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,290
You know why this is is because this
reminds me of so many guys that I used to

1123
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:54,980
hang out with and gamble with and all
that type of shit. Like all these guys,

1124
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:59,180
like this is a brutal, if you're a
narcissist, you walked into a fuck casino.

1125
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,350
It's fucking brutal.

1126
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:03,470
Cause you're gonna walk in thinking
you're James Bond and you have this system

1127
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,750
and you're going to take the
whole fucking house down. Yeah.

1128
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:08,510
I gotta tell you there's nothing funnier
than that one that you read that said

1129
01:05:08,511 --> 01:05:09,740
that they think they're superior,

1130
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:12,050
so they should only be hanging
out with people that are superior.

1131
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:15,690
That it's so fucking funny and
hilarious. Yeah. Oh, um, all right.

1132
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:19,550
Is convinced that he slash she is unique.
Yeah.

1133
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,510
I liked how that just suggests. That
just takes it, we're all special.

1134
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,310
This websites like, no, you're not,

1135
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:29,620
feels entitled to special treatment and
that rules frequently don't apply to him.

1136
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:34,310
Um, I don't have the first half,
but I have the second house I have,

1137
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,310
I have problems with authority.
I definitely do.

1138
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:37,790
Okay.

1139
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:41,630
I told you that story right where I
didn't if I told you that fucking story,

1140
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,180
right? Oh yeah. I didn't
get caught either.

1141
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,240
My proposed love and marriage within
only a few weeks might I'll may propose

1142
01:05:49,401 --> 01:05:50,920
love and marriage with only with,

1143
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:54,590
but then only a few weeks of starting a
relationship that definitely wasn't me.

1144
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,830
Very charismatic and charming at first,

1145
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,360
but can quickly switch from doctor
[inaudible]. Hi, this is fucking ladies.

1146
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:06,140
These are all just the same thing over
and over again. Oh wait, panics. Cries,

1147
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:11,060
begs and becomes emotional. If he
anticipates an end to a relationship,

1148
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:16,400
that's not, I swear to God, I'll pay
attention to you more. I was wrong.

1149
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,370
What do you want me to show you?
I was wrong.

1150
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,370
May Harass or stock you
if you do break up. Oh,

1151
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:27,830
cause he wants to be the one who breaks
up or she quick to anger or feeling

1152
01:06:27,831 --> 01:06:32,150
salted or slided rages with anger or
inflicts the Silent Treatment went upset.

1153
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:36,140
A Ding, Ding, ding, Ding, Ding. I
got that quick to anger. I got that.

1154
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:41,710
I wouldn't stock somebody denies he
slash she has issues to work to work on.

1155
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:46,490
That's fucking sees himself
or herself as nearly perfect.

1156
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:54,520
I fucking love this guy. What are
you talking about? He talk already.

1157
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:59,840
That's so funny. Maybe you want to
work on yourself. Adapt around me.

1158
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,800
Drives recklessly in a way too fast.

1159
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,360
Exaggerate this exaggerates
the truth or blatantly lies.

1160
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:14,150
Dude, I want to be around this guy and
just listening to him tell stories.

1161
01:07:14,151 --> 01:07:18,230
This is the funniest shit. Rarely
treats anyone with respect or kindness.

1162
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:19,503
Does it exist?

1163
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:24,170
College doesn't acknowledge
or respect others' boundaries.

1164
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:28,550
Always wants to be in control. May
drink and drive regularly. Yeah.

1165
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:29,930
Cause he doesn't give a
fuck about other people.

1166
01:07:29,931 --> 01:07:34,280
His slash her need for attention,
time and space and matter. Um,

1167
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:35,840
okay.

1168
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,100
Oh, his need for ty for attention,
time and space matter. Yours.

1169
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,320
Your needs do not.
Um,

1170
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,460
let me just read one more of
these before this gets boring.

1171
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,900
Uses sex as a weapon through withholding,
controlling,

1172
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:54,620
or being overly demanding.
I said socket,

1173
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,590
the best dick ever
doesn't appear to have a conscious,

1174
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:05,120
does not take criticism well and becomes
easily defensive as easily hurt and

1175
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:10,070
insulted Jesus Christ. That's what,
that was a fucking hilarious list.

1176
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,540
Oh really funny. I love
that is funny though. Huh?

1177
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,100
Sees themselves as superior and should

1178
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,300
only be hanging around superior beings.
That's all right. Let me, let me read.

1179
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,750
I got to do a little, I got
to do the other fucking, uh,

1180
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,433
okay.

1181
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:26,590
Advertising here.
Where the hell am I?

1182
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,560
Yeah.

1183
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,240
All right. I got two more, right? Two
more. Two more on to ready break. Okay.

1184

Okay,

1272
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,420
let's go. Let's go here. Time travel.

1273
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,523
MMM.

1274
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:46,760
Time travel. Billy thrills. Um,

1275
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:51,790
if you could travel to any time period
period prior to 1900 but you were forced

1276
01:13:52,311 --> 01:13:56,030
to live out your life there and you
couldn't come back to the present,

1277
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,770
where would you choose to go?

1278
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,800
Keep in mind anything before 1900 means
everyone probably smells and dies it 40

1279
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:06,830
years of age. That's not true. Not
if you have money. You live long.

1280
01:14:06,831 --> 01:14:10,790
Ben Franklin look for a long time and
he was a fucking booze bag out there.

1281
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:12,130
Flying.
Is Kate in the rain?

1282
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:17,350
Did he live long? Yeah. Yeah. He lived
to like be like 70. Oh Wow. Yeah.

1283
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:21,100
And he went out there with this kite in
the rain and he was fucking shit faced.

1284
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,530
So he got his house
keys tied to the thing.

1285
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:27,900
That's the real story of how we discovered
electricity was fucking hammered you

1286
01:14:27,901 --> 01:14:31,780
serious? Yeah, he was out of his fucking
mind. And if he was actually stone sober,

1287
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,440
he probably would have died because
he would attend stuff when he got

1288
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:38,590
electrocuted. But cause he was drunk,
he was all relaxed like hey man.

1289
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,500
And he just rolled down the hill,
landed on his ball.

1290
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:44,380
That's actually how he went bald.
He went down the hill,

1291
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:47,750
like one of the lightning struck,
they hit the Keenan boobs.

1292
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:53,160
It's off his head off. What new
studies have shown all of this. Oh,

1293
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:58,150
I thought it was just fucking male pattern
baldness. No, that's he got elected. No,

1294
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,720
like 30% of people, this is the
worst thing they never talk about.

1295
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:05,230
If you get struck by
lightning like you Amit,

1296
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:09,340
that blows off that top
part. You serious? Yeah.

1297
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:14,680
And it doesn't come back either.
It wouldn't make a difference with me,

1298
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,740
but that's why Mike Michael
Bolton does that cherry.

1299
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,210
He does that charity thing for a,

1300
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,720
don't tell me he does a charity for
people that get struck by lightening.

1301
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:23,580
Got their hair blown.

1302
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,600
I can't believe you believe in this shit.
I'm just making all this up.

1303
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,470
The fucking top of the head. You know
it doesn't, but does he have a charity,

1304
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:37,140
Michael Boat? Yeah. Yeah,
but not for that. No. Oh,

1305
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:40,660
I fucking committed to
that. I did. All right,

1306
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,553
let's continue.

1307
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,110
Dude, that was getting so deep. I
couldn't keep a straight face. I'm like,

1308
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:53,440
there's no way he's believing this one.
All right, this one, get it down the hill.

1309
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,650
I said, that's how he went bald. And they
go, no, no, wait, here's a better life.

1310
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:01,630
You still like really? Is that
what happened? Jesus Christ.

1311
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:04,060
Paul, what's the world
coming to? All right Paul,

1312
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:08,380
if you could live any time period
before 1900 anywhere. Anytime.

1313
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:13,300
Oh Man. Where would you go? I don't know.

1314
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:17,780
I would go somewhere where there was
a war, but wait, but in the question,

1315
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,250
can I take things from present?

1316
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:21,120
Okay,

1317
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,640
well, let's see. You could
time travel to any period. 1900

1318
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:28,010
so what the fuck would you bring here?
The second you pulled anything out,

1319
01:16:28,011 --> 01:16:29,720
they think you were a
witch and they kill you.

1320
01:16:29,721 --> 01:16:33,050
What I'm saying is I would go to there
with like shit that they don't have now.

1321
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,140
That's what I'm saying. Like in a
war though, and I fucking just lace.

1322
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:38,000
Like if I took a side,
you know,

1323
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:41,080
you go with a couple uzis or a fucking
machine gun. He just fucking lady.

1324
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:44,720
You wouldn't, you'd be a fucking God
forever. It'd be a hero. You know?

1325
01:16:44,721 --> 01:16:46,250
You'd be like, you'd be
God, what are you gonna do?

1326
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:49,580
You're just going to walk out in the
field and use Nike fucking sweatshirt.

1327
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:53,960
It Jordan's. Yeah, just walk out dress
like this. And they would be like,

1328
01:16:53,961 --> 01:16:56,750
you know when they were packing muskets
and doing the whole thing and I'd be

1329
01:16:56,751 --> 01:17:00,320
like, no, not all guys. I got this
what year? What year? I just fucking,

1330
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,440
and they would be like, oh my God,
but just be the fucking man forever.

1331
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,390
That'd be the man forever.
You imagine that?

1332
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:06,691
Yeah.

1333
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:10,580
I'm trying to wrap my head around where
they're not completely freaked out by

1334
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:15,440
you. You're going to go
first of all, first of all,

1335
01:17:15,441 --> 01:17:19,550
what year are you going back to? Well,
he said why? He said prior 1900 yeah.

1336
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,530
So what year are you going
back to the pack and Musket?

1337
01:17:22,531 --> 01:17:26,660
So what are we talking here? Well,
there was a couple of one there. Oh,

1338
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,130
what is it like 18 like 1817 1870s right.

1339
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,190
Well by 1870s they had like
the Winchesters and those
repeating rifles and that

1340
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:39,080
they actually had their first
machine gun in the civil war,

1341
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:41,910
I believe Spanish American.
Anyways, we had the little frank,

1342
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:44,750
if you fucking mowed them down,
I go before that time then.

1343
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:49,280
So you're talking like I, if I was
you I would go early 18 hundreds okay.

1344
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:52,880
So I'd go early 18 hundreds yup.
And I would bring some sort of,

1345
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,420
who are you going to mow down?
Um,

1346
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:59,570
what if you went in the French and Indian
war and you actually found on the side

1347
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:03,980
of the Indians what year was just
mowed down? A bunch of French people,

1348
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,930
whichever side.
I decided to choose,

1349
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,740
like when I got there and they saw that
I showed up from a time machine, right.

1350
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:13,160
One group's going to be
nicer to me right now.

1351
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:15,190
They're all going to be
completely freaked out by you.

1352
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,650
There's going to be to you as a threat
and you'll probably have to turn your Uzi

1353
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:21,740
on them.
Then you'd have to steal their clothes

1354
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,820
and then try to fucking do an accent.

1355
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,250
I would choose a side of the
people that were the nicest,

1356
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:31,340
warmest to me when I got there, and then
I would fucking become their savior.

1357
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:33,890
Nobody's going to be nice to Paul.
You understand that? If I did it,

1358
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:37,490
they would rewrite the book on me.
They would. They would be a mythical I,

1359
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,910
they would kill you. No, I would, they
would kill you, Paul. They would kill you.

1360
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:43,380
They would tell Steve what
happened to Jesus. No, they would.

1361
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:48,440
What happened to Jesus? They
got crucified. Okay. So yeah,

1362
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:51,980
but you're going to run out of bullets.
So now, but I'm just in the question.

1363
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:54,830
It doesn't specify like what I'm
coming with. I'm going to go prepare.

1364
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,440
How big is this fucking time
machine? No, no, no, no.

1365
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:01,370
I'm going to go with like a bunch
of clips and a couple of Uzis. Okay.

1366
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:05,480
And they're gonna write fucking stories
about me being be mass murdering psycho

1367
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:09,460
from the fucking future. And it go
some mythical wearing lazy, close,

1368
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,200
lazy at the close though.

1369
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:17,060
Some Italian do front of you or they're
not even know what New York is. Oh,

1370
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,660
actually maybe the other [inaudible] yeah.
Do you, you're not listening. You Paul.

1371
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:25,660
This is the key. They wouldn't all kill
me, but Paul is saying, I'm here to help.

1372
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,670
Listen, listen, I got, I came
to this, I can't listen to
what I would tell him. Okay.

1373
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,380
And then you tell him what
you'd say. I say, look,

1374
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:33,530
I came from the future to help you.
This machine brought me here to help you.

1375
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:36,570
I'm going to solve your problems. And
then I would fuck a pull out. Okay.

1376
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,780
And let me ask you this, wealth
live this. Let's do this.

1377
01:19:38,781 --> 01:19:41,510
Let's say fucking after this tour,

1378
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:46,640
you can't sleep one night and you look
out your back yard and you see this

1379
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:50,990
fucking thing appear out of nowhere and
this guy gets out and starts walking

1380
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:53,660
towards your fucking
house from a time machine

1381
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:59,450
and let's just say you have a shotgun and
this guy walks up. He goes, no, no. Hey,

1382
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:00,171
listen,
listen,

1383
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:05,171
Paul Paul and he's wearing these weird
workout clothes from 300 years in the

1384
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:07,500
future. Listen, I'm here to help you.

1385
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,630
I'm here to do things
that you're going to like.

1386
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:10,850
You're going to fucking trust this guy.

1387
01:20:10,851 --> 01:20:13,350
I don't know because I was
sleeping in my bed and and I'm not.

1388
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,930
I'm talking about I want
to show up into a conflict.

1389
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:20,880
I want to show up to the moment of a
conflict and fucking take a side and when

1390
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:23,550
it, I want to win the game for
the team. This is what I'm saying.

1391
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,610
It's a very narcissistic
behavior here, Paul. You know,

1392
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:28,680
you think he's just going
to show up on a battlefield.

1393
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,580
They're going to be like our brain show
up and you fucking walk out of this

1394
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:37,530
thing with yet, but he's sweatshirt
and a fucking Uzi and the, no,

1395
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:41,580
the, the union army and the rebels are
not like one of them is going to win.

1396
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,230
One of them's going to embrace you.
Yeah.

1397
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:45,780
One of those groups are losing
fathers and sons and I go,

1398
01:20:45,781 --> 01:20:50,700
I got this fuck the musket and I just
fucking, I just fucking lays out an army.

1399
01:20:50,701 --> 01:20:53,100
They're going to look at me like, dude,
this guy, where are they going to do?

1400
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:58,050
They're going to go that we've been saved
this. Once they realize you are mortal,

1401
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,350
they would fucking,
probably they would.

1402
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:05,070
They would take your weapons is what
they would do. How they getting to you?

1403
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:05,701
Is He from me?

1404
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:08,880
If they're fucking packing a musket and
they have knives because what are you

1405
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:11,460
talking and Paul, because you're going
to have your fucking back to him.

1406
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:16,080
If he's shooting at the other guy,
Paul, you know what they're going to do.

1407
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,170
They're going to probably at nice to you.
This would be okay.

1408
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,560
And then what they're going to do is
they're going to try to figure out where

1409
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:23,910
the fuck you came from.

1410
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:28,390
They're good immediately confiscate your
fucking time machine and they're going

1411
01:21:28,391 --> 01:21:30,100
to try to see if they can duplicate it.

1412
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:33,950
Salts weight so they can
run the fucking world.

1413
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,720
How are they going to confiscate the time
machine from me when I'm the one with

1414
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:40,440
the ammo? I'm the one with
the semiautomatic weapons.
I'm the one who's just say,

1415
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:43,770
well, are they going to do, what
are they going to do? Paul is,

1416
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,890
they're gonna fucking put an all points
bulletin out on every fucking Goddamn

1417
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:51,780
tree out there wanted
sweatpant guy from the future.

1418
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:58,250
This man alone has been in this time
zone is error for fucking 20 minutes and

1419
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:04,000
it's already killed
600 feet.

1420
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,391
No,
but here's the thing.

1421
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:08,790
The question was where would you
go and if you couldn't come back,

1422
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:13,470
if I survived this all did you, did
you, did you see? Did forget about,

1423
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:18,420
I know you didn't read
anything in history. Let's
just, let's just talk. Okay.

1424
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,480
Yeah.
World War II.

1425
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:23,850
There's muskets in 1870
fuck packs and the guns,

1426
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:28,360
I mean in 1870. I just laughed.
So hard to see in dots. No. Um,

1427
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:31,080
world war two I read about,
I read about shit.

1428
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:37,040
You literally sound like you sitting on
a stoop right now. I know stuff. God,

1429
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:41,400
what was the question?
I was going to ask him.

1430
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:44,010
I was going to talk about people in
history, but how about let's just,

1431
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:48,240
we'll go with movies. All right.
Right. You saw there will be blood.

1432
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,350
Yes. Okay. That's based
off like the robber barons,

1433
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:57,470
uh, of, of the fucking,
you know, 17, 1800. The uh,

1434
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:01,770
the people you've got involved in oil
rig, the railroad guys, the Rockefellers,

1435
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:06,100
the Vanderbilts, the fucking people
who like fucking at all. Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,780
They came over here. Right. They
fucking got it. You know, they just,

1437
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:13,920
it was wide open. You could do
whatever the fuck you want and they,

1438
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:18,700
they did it right. All right.
This is funny. I've made
fun of you for being stupid.

1439
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:20,440
I can't even explain this.
These guys,

1440
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:24,040
the JP Morgans and all
these types of fuck guys.

1441
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:29,041
When you show up with this machine
where they can fucking change the past,

1442
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:33,070
they can change the fucking future.

1443
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,180
These sociopath psychos
are not going to let you,

1444
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,400
Paul Versey. Once they fucking sit
down and they talk to you, Paul,

1445
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:45,850
take day.
See where the fuck you're at.

1446
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:51,000
They will pretend to be friends with
you and when the second you set down you

1447
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:56,070
your Uzi to have a little bit of mutton
with them at the villa for us today with

1448
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,450
cut you ear to ear. Oh
No, no. First of all,

1449
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:01,770
I'm too fucking street smart to ever
put my o down and let them find,

1450
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:04,480
start fucking drinking tea
and crumpets with these.

1451
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:07,630
I don't like how you think you're street
smart and every fucking error like you

1452
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:11,800
know what the signs are in 1812 you think
I'm going to leave my fucking Uzi down

1453
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:14,530
when nobody's got one that's gold to
those people. That's, that's, that's,

1454
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,540
that's ends, that's ends
problems. I would never do that.

1455
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:17,830
So you going to become
friends with these people?

1456
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:20,750
Always having a gun trained on them.
That's what you're telling me. I said,

1457
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,300
how about this?
This is what I could also do.

1458
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:26,020
I could get there in my time machine and
I could befriend one person and I could

1459
01:24:26,021 --> 01:24:29,070
let them know that I'm here to help them
if they need and tell them what I could

1460
01:24:29,071 --> 01:24:32,110
do. And then maybe they can say, hey
listen, when we get into, you know,

1461
01:24:32,111 --> 01:24:36,610
when the rebels come, I've got a guy,
you know what, I wasn't listening.

1462
01:24:36,611 --> 01:24:38,890
I was thinking about what I
was going to do. All right,

1463
01:24:38,891 --> 01:24:42,640
well what would you do this,
what I would go back to once in 1900,

1464
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:46,090
I would go back and keep in
mind anything before eight,

1465
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:51,460
prior to 1900, I would
go back to 1899. Okay.

1466
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:56,080
Cause I want the most up to date and
medical fucking shit available for when I

1467
01:24:56,081 --> 01:25:01,000
come down with polio. Whatever
bullshit that's going to hit me. Um,

1468
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:01,601
I would,

1469
01:25:01,601 --> 01:25:06,601
I would do is I would try out and make
a major league baseball team and I would

1470
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:11,200
fucking destroy them with my, uh,
with my knowledge of nutrition,

1471
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:15,670
my a hundred 120 years in the future.
If my knowledge of nutrition,

1472
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:16,211
you know what I would do,

1473
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:20,230
I would take some PE days back with me
before they even know how to test for it

1474
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:24,500
and I would fucking roid
up fucking just give I,

1475
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:29,610
Bruce and I would try out for the Boston
Red Sox and we would win it for every

1476
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:32,800
fucking year, right through the
twenties. That's a great idea.

1477
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,560
And that's what I would do. But you'd
have to go back with sterile. Yeah.

1478
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:36,320
You'd have to go back.

1479
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,140
You'd have to convince these
people that you're going to inject.

1480
01:25:38,141 --> 01:25:40,750
Still don't think I could
hit a curve ball. Huh?

1481
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,850
I still don't think I could
hit a fucking curve ball,

1482
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,970
but I just figured if I went back to
the fucking, I couldn't make them.

1483
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:49,510
I couldn't make a major league baseball
team in the 19 hundreds but I think I

1484
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:53,850
could make one in the 1890 so just I
would have me go back. When did it start?

1485
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,860
1880 join the fucking Phillies.

1486
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,480
I wouldn't want them to win a
championship, but who I want what?

1487
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,170
Whenever the one of the fucking red
sox come around, there was the first,

1488
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:06,740
see the red sox came around in what
the and the 18 early 19 hundreds

1489
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:08,800
okay.

1490
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,970
I'd like to play whenever they,

1491
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:14,250
they built Fenway in 1912 I would just
like to come up to bat. God dammit.

1492
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:17,710
I couldn't do it so I'd have to go back,
but I'm my age now.

1493
01:26:17,711 --> 01:26:19,060
I'd be too fucking old by then.

1494
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:21,220
Okay.

1495
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:24,040
Fuck him. He can still kill it
though. This is what I would do.

1496
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:28,330
I become totally fluid in the Latin and a,

1497
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:31,660
I would fucking go back and I'd
watch a game at the Roman Colosseum.

1498
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:36,790
That's fine. I'm trying to sports related,
I would just take my chances with,

1499
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:40,060
I would just go with the heavy artillery.
I would be, I would be a defense.

1500
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:43,540
I would be, you know, I'm going to Ronald
Reagan route, just spend it, all of them,

1501
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:44,440
all the money on defense.

1502
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:49,450
I would hope that they would utilize
me that way as an asset military wise.

1503
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,380
You know, dude, you're out
of your mind dude. Why?

1504
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,400
Like just me going back thinking
that I could fucking make a team.

1505
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:01,480
Cause I looked at Benton, those 1890s
like did, they were like softball teams,

1506
01:27:01,481 --> 01:27:04,510
so just hadn't ringers there. That's, you
know, all those guys didn't stretch do,

1507
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,210
but you know, you just went up
to your neck in a wild west days.

1508
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:10,510
They fucking went outside and they
went back to back and then 10 paces.

1509
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:14,890
I fucking get rid of that man. I'm talking
about, I have everything. I'm an ass.

1510
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:18,940
Don't have anything. Paul, what
you have is a gun and bullets.

1511
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,910
You have the best gun,
right? With the best bullets.

1512
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:26,830
But you're ignoring the fact that an
entire army is going to go after you,

1513
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:32,860
that they're not going to allow,
they're not going to allow you.

1514
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:37,460
They wouldn't allow you to take power.
By the way,

1515
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,640
for the way that you seize power.

1516
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,920
As you assimilate and you work your way
up through the ranks and then you have a

1517
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:48,220
you,
you and you strike when the time is right.

1518
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:52,150
That's how you try and start
your own shoe. Come in,

1519
01:27:52,151 --> 01:27:54,640
they're all rogue and I was like,
listen,

1520
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:59,050
I have better shit than you guys could
ever dream of having, but don't worry.

1521
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:03,290
I'm your friend. These fucking paranoid
assholes, these control freaks, this,

1522
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,750
they want that you could not live.

1523
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:09,150
They would be smearing you in in the the,

1524
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,440
the paper with every fucking day.

1525
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,560
Just talking about this reminds me of
that shoe or a big of a threat than the

1526
01:28:14,561 --> 01:28:17,590
savages that need to be
clear. They, they, they would,

1527
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:20,380
they would put you above getting rid
of native Americans at that point.

1528
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,540
You would have to be eliminated,

1529
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:27,790
but not before they found out how took
apart the gun to figure out how it works.

1530
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,370
Tortured you for all the fucking,
um,

1531
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:35,280
knowledge that you had an and grilled
you about that time machine to figure out

1532
01:28:35,281 --> 01:28:37,150
if you built it or you
just fucking used it.

1533
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:39,340
So what if I lied to him and I
said I could get more of this.

1534
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,140
I got a time machine.
Nobody knows where it is,

1535
01:28:41,141 --> 01:28:44,110
but I could go back and get more of
this like, so if they knew that I could,

1536
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:46,540
I could, you know what I mean? If
I lied on that, that's the best.

1537
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:47,860
That's the best move.

1538
01:28:47,861 --> 01:28:50,900
You've said out of all of this
scenario where maybe you know, you,

1539
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:55,480
you could do a play on their greed
and their desire to have more.

1540
01:28:55,481 --> 01:28:58,210
That's actually a smart fucking move.

1541
01:28:58,211 --> 01:29:01,030
But if you just think that you're just
going to show up with your fucking cigar

1542
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:05,940
and your Uzi and come walking out
on a battlefield, do this sketch,

1543
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:10,410
I'll just want to do this and just change
the course of history depending on who

1544
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:14,880
was nicer to you. What if the Germans
were nice view and World War Two. I mean,

1545
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:17,760
you know they had nice uniforms. Paul,
you're going to sign with them. It would.

1546
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:18,660
How funny would it be?

1547
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:22,650
Just watching me going there with
air maxes on Nike Air Max is honest,

1548
01:29:22,651 --> 01:29:25,590
the Gar and it's the white chair
and I'm like, listen, sit down.

1549
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:30,210
I got a gun that could solve it and
I just show the guy I would love to.

1550
01:29:30,211 --> 01:29:34,170
I would fucking love to see the looks
on their faces and then all of a sudden

1551
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:37,380
they rebelled against me. I think
if, I think if you actually,

1552
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,770
if you actually went out there and you
mowed down the whole other side with what

1553
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:42,780
you had. Yeah, that was my original.

1554
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:46,980
That's what I would think
that if I was on the,

1555
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,340
on my side. Are you on your side? Yeah.

1556
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:54,030
I would slowly be backing away as you
were doing it and then I would slip into

1557
01:29:54,031 --> 01:29:57,420
the woods and fucking run
away is what I would do.

1558
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:00,590
I would get the fuck away
from you because I don't pull.

1559
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:05,230
You understand what the fuck I'm seeing.
Okay.

1560
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:10,320
You can show up in your space
close with your fucking ray gun.

1561
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,040
I mean, it's just like I'm out of
there. I'm fucking out of there.

1562
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:18,420
I'm going to leave and if you come
towards me, I'm going to shoot. I mean,

1563
01:30:18,421 --> 01:30:21,870
if a fucking alien landed and I had a gun,
fuck his ray guns.

1564
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:26,040
Fuck all that bullshit. If it starts
coming towards me, I got to shoot at it.

1565
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:26,761
If that happened,

1566
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:30,120
I'd be living in the biggest house in
the 18th so I'd have all the women would

1567
01:30:30,121 --> 01:30:33,680
be fine. I would be the fucking Jesus
there. They would fucking draw pictures.

1568
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:34,680
Do you know what it is,
Paul?

1569
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:39,210
This is your own little narcissistic
head trip and that's the exact thing that

1570
01:30:39,211 --> 01:30:40,740
would bring you down.
You know something?

1571
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:43,500
I think that this is a great answer
to your listener. As questionable.

1572
01:30:43,501 --> 01:30:45,330
You're acting. You aren't in
love about all of this, Paul.

1573
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,440
You're acting like you know
how to make a fucking Uzi. No,

1574
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,340
I'm saying what time machine
you're going to bring one.

1575
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:53,850
So he did was bring it and they're going
to figure it out because the scientists

1576
01:30:53,851 --> 01:30:55,800
back then were just as
brilliant as a scientist.

1577
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:58,260
Now they just don't have the
information that the ones do today.

1578
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:03,470
So they would immediately break down
your fucking what you are that you're a

1579
01:31:03,721 --> 01:31:08,700
stand up comedian. That's what they
would do. Well, what are you going to do,

1580
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:12,150
Paul? What are you gonna do for food?
You're going to Uzi at deer. Okay.

1581
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:15,500
And then do you know how to start a
fire without some wood prominent ticket?

1582
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:17,400
You know how to do that?
Yeah. How do you do it?

1583
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:20,790
You know how to start a fire without
matches. Yeah, I mean I've seen it done.

1584
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:25,140
I've watched it on TV. I've seen it on the
fucking, I've seen it on youtube. I did.

1585
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:27,990
I fucking see it on youtube when we
ran a matches at the house one time.

1586
01:31:27,991 --> 01:31:29,970
I swear to God, I was watching a
clip. Yeah, I've watched it too. Yeah,

1587
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:34,230
the guy sat down, yet he gets to
the driest, whatever they call it,

1588
01:31:34,231 --> 01:31:37,530
the grass or the dry fucking Paul.
I'm gonna tell you this right now.

1589
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,950
If you can make, if you could start
a fire and twist the thing, right?

1590
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,240
If you could start a fire tonight.
All right,

1591
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:49,530
we'll go to the Toronto Central Park. If
you could start a fight, a fight, a fire,

1592
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,670
I'll give you all the money.

1593
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,910
I'm going to make it on this tour with
don't watch the youtube video again.

1594
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:56,760
I want to see you start this fucking far.
Okay.

1595
01:31:56,790 --> 01:32:00,460
And if you don't some wood or is down,
if you don't,

1596
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:03,310
then you have to walk into the fucking,

1597
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:06,910
into the Lake Ontario with
the Jordan Song 30 and shit.

1598
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:09,010
Well that's the point I want.
You don't want you to stop.

1599
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:16,560
You're hilarious. You're like, yeah,
you did see it. Wow. All right,

1600
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:21,590
let's go with baby names
named Jesus Christ. This is
becoming a long one here. Um,

1601
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:27,060
all right, baby names.
Uh, dear Billy trimester.

1602
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,970
My wife and I are
expecting our first child.

1603
01:32:29,971 --> 01:32:31,830
We don't know whether
it's a boy or a girl,

1604
01:32:31,831 --> 01:32:33,540
but we're starting to talk about names.

1605
01:32:33,541 --> 01:32:37,830
My inclination is to go with the name
that's not trendy, but not super common.

1606
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,400
Like Mike, she's whoever
wrote this. I like, uh,

1607
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,980
but part of me is like, Eh, fuck
it named the Kid Hendricks or wolf,

1608
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:51,750
something he can take to the playground
and build a reputation around, uh,

1609
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:56,040
what would be your strategy? Oh, you're
the parent. Paul, what do you think?

1610
01:32:56,610 --> 01:33:00,390
Uh, what she said about the whole mic
thing is exactly what me and Stacy said.

1611
01:33:00,391 --> 01:33:03,960
You know what he said? Well,
what he said, um, my, uh,

1612
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:07,560
when my wife was pregnant with
Lucas, you know, I didn't want,

1613
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:12,930
I just didn't want George
Mike, you know, Joey Anthony,

1614
01:33:12,931 --> 01:33:16,800
I just didn't want that.
You know, I wanted something
different and uh, I agree.

1615
01:33:16,801 --> 01:33:20,970
I mean, wolf and Hendrix is a little
much, you know, calling your kid wolf,

1616
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:23,760
he's going to get fucked. You know that
they mean it's, it's, it's a bad ass name.

1617
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:26,250
But if he's not bad
ass, it's fucked. Like,

1618
01:33:26,251 --> 01:33:30,970
if he's in percent IOM or if he's a
fucking, his name is wolf. Yeah, no,

1619
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:35,330
you can't have a singer named Wolf, you
know, fucking it becomes an opera star.

1620
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:39,930
He had the fucking Wolf Gang
Fun. Um, I like that though.

1621
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:44,470
I don't like super common, but I
don't like, you know, you know what,

1622
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:49,290
what's her name? Gwyneth Paltrow.
Apple or fuck cocoa or something crazy.

1623
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:53,100
So I think it's something respectful,
really nice, you know? Uh, yeah,

1624
01:33:53,101 --> 01:33:57,690
but the thing is you got to make sure
you pick the right one where you know,

1625
01:33:57,691 --> 01:34:01,710
like, I remember for a minute, remember
those, those Dylan Dakota years,

1626
01:34:01,711 --> 01:34:06,540
everybody was naming and the kid
said, bullshit. Takota fucking Tanner.

1627
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,190
Tanner.
It was a little bad one.

1628
01:34:08,191 --> 01:34:11,670
What was what Tom Tyler and I don't
know if Tyler's Tyler is fine.

1629
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:16,800
Tyler's all right. But uh, how about
one of those? We didn't get Bryce.

1630
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:21,760
I hate, I hate to be once that me too.
I don't like him. No. Yeah, me too. Oh,

1631
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:25,610
I am one. I'm a mainstream one. I
don't mind bill Bob that bullshit.

1632
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:30,540
But like I, it was like, who the fuck does

01:36:56,221 --> 01:37:00,750
Zuma is the name of a beach in Malibu.
That's lovely.

1671
01:37:00,751 --> 01:37:02,460
But it's also a computer game.

pilot.

1681
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:46,140
How do you not just be an arrogant
ass if your name is pilot? Is that it?

1682
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,810

All right. Somebody named the Kid

01:40:18,701 --> 01:40:21,010
idolized American gangster culture.

1722
