16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,070
it's one of the most favorite things
I've ever done in show business.

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,140
It's just a, you know, it's
everything you want to see. You know,

18
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,310
it's a,
it's,

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,340
it's conflicting groups of people duking
it out with not a lot of skill and you

20
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:26,240
just get to sit there and enjoy it.
Um,

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,050
I'm thinking this is going to
be a lot of maniacs there. Uh,

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,360
as you know, Youngstown
is no joke. All right?

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,020
And I can't wait to be there and not
fight anybody like the coward that I am.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,440
Having said that, let me be, uh,

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,850
let me live my best life.
Let me be a hero to myself.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Michael's for the second half of
2018 is to be my own personal hero.

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,170
Okay.

28
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,930
These fucking social media people.
Have you ever like,

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,510
there's nothing, I don't know. I
didn't know where to begin with this.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,850
If I see one more fucking fat,

31
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:12,851
miserable loser was wearing a tee
shirt that has some sort of self help,

32
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:19,390
advice to me, like they've reached
the Mecca of peace and happiness.

33
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:23,080
It's just like, Ooh, is that fucking
tee shirt for yours? Is it for me?

34
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,940
You know,
I just saw this,

35
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:31,670
this fucking miserable looking person
sitting down in the airport, you know,

36
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,510
tens and tens and tens of fucking pounds
overweight eating shit food with a tee

37
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:41,360
shirt that says love yourself.
You know what I mean?

38
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,500
And all of this fucking crap now where
you pat people on the back because

39
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:49,700
they're fucking up their lives, but they
still feel good about, you know what?

40
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:53,630
I like who I am. I'm not saying
you shouldn't like who you are,

41
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,660
but you got to look at yourself in the
mirror at some point and just be like,

42
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:00,570
dude, the fuck are we
doing here? You know,

43
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,210
not saying I'm perfect.
I'm not a perfect person,

44
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,690
right? But I'm not, you know, sitting
around here like calling myself a hero,

45
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,820
you know,
based off of all my fucking

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,010
short comics,

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,470
Hollywood puts pressure
and fuck he did it tonight.

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,390
Is that a Hollywood?
Hollywood gives people what they want.

49
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,200
All right?
You fucking constant.

50
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,020
So sick of everybody
blaming this innocent town

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,440
we hear in all he would happen
to be some of the, the most,

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,300
uh, dependable, loyal, honest you
would be eggs you ever going to meet?

53
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,920
Yeah. I could even get through without
laughing. Whatever. Fuck you this car.

54
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,830
This time we'll give you
whatever the fuck you. Bye. Okay.

55
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,610
And you've been looking at fucking abs
and big tits since the second they had

56
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:07,350
moving pictures. So I don't want to
fucking hair these fucking assholes,

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,793
you know?

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,510
Okay.

59
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,440
And I like those other people.
The fucking fat guys with the, uh,

60
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,650
with the tough guy. Shit
on this shirt, you know?

61
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,590
Do I look like I give a shit?
You know, that's no, no,

62
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,800
you don't. Yeah, I would believe that.

63
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:30,520
You don't give a shit about anything.
All right.

64
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,440
With your fucking fungus.

65
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,300
Riddell toenails while wearing
your little fucking flip flops.

66
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,820
Oh my God. Do you ever see
people there? Their toe nails,

67
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:45,630
they look like fucking petrified wood and
they're literally walking around just,

68
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:46,464
you know,

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,370

70
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,030
I guess living their best life, but making
you look at them. I swear to God, man.

71
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,870
I saw somebody in airport recently
that had these flip flops.

72
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:59,750
It also had like this toenail flap on it.
Joe Is really excited,

73
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:03,620
but I hear stomping feet. That
can only mean one. Yeah. Ah, oh.

74
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,010
Hey Buddy,

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,970
Said he's in there making a fool
of himself. No running in here.

76
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:13,804
Come on.

77
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,493
Come on.

78
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,010
Well,

79
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,320
Oh, come on. Come on buddy. Do
it. Your mom says, trust me.

80
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,740
I've tried it the other way. It
doesn't work. No, not by, come on.

81
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,280
All right.
The Monday morning podcast has been

82
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,230
briefly interrupted.
Oh, somebody is tired.

83
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,850
Why? By, Oh, you want to say hi. Can we
give her a hug? Hang on again. Any paused.

84
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,990
All right, I'm back. Crisis averted.
The fuck was I talking about

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,080
how great people are in
Hollywood? How we are, you know,

86
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,180
there's a couple of bad apples.
I'm not going to lie to you.

87
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:05,740
There's a few people out here. You know,
I might be one of those people who knows,

88
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,150
you know? Um, anyways,

89
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,390
what was I talking about? Dog
Gone It. Ah, Jesus Christ.

90
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:20,170
It just interrupted Christ.
It fucked up my whole flow.

91
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,420
I Dunno what I was talking. Who
gives a shit? Right? What do I pit?

92
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:29,480
Stop and go back and fucking
try and listen to it. Um,

93
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,200
anyways,
I have no idea what I was talking about.

94
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,080
Let me plow ahead here.
As I always do,

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,000
I swear to God, this fucking house,
I swear to God, this fucking house,

96
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,220
if it's not one thing,
it's another.

97
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,640
Every time I get something
fixed, something else
breaks. You know what I mean?

98
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,240
Okay.

99
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,840
This can't be what owning a house is
like. I just, I had to have bought up,

100
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,970
there's gotta be some
sort of fucking lemon law.

101
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm fucking,
it's UN fucking believable.

102
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,100
Well, those people that
have a lawyer on retainer,

103
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,350
that just means a constantly
getting in fucking trouble.

104
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,150
So they're just constantly
paying the fucking guy.

105
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,120
I should have a plumber on retainer.
I know what that means.

106
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:24,170
What the fuck does that mean? It just
sounds cool. I have a lawyer on retainer.

107
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,620
Okay. Oh my God. Oh my God.

108
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,050
Give me an idea what the fuck my dad does

109
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,560
that has got it.

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,480
I still cannot get over the fact that
an adult said that to another adult.

111
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,780
Do you have any idea what
the fuck my dad does?

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,110
You know, it's like, it's you like
your there and the other guys there.

113
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:51,580
You guys are facing off with each other
and then the fuck another du grabs it by

114
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:51,970
the throat,

115
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,630
throws him down to the ground and
then he stands up and all he has is,

116
00:07:55,631 --> 00:08:00,490
you're fucked. You're fucked.
And I evidently, he walks
away to go get his dad.

117
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,470
The kids in his twenties.
Dad,

118
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,291
what's the matter?

119
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,860
Is that 35 year old across the
street picking on you again son?

120
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,913
Um,
anyways,

121
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,930
I went down to a comic con all freckles
who's done nothing but make fun of comic

122
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:23,090
con, um, forever.

123
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:27,140
I went down there on Thursday because,
uh,

124
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,440
Vince and all the guys at better call
Saul were nice enough to ask me to a

125
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,220
mediator, is that the word? Basically
host the panel, the better call Saul,

126
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:37,760
uh,

127
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,760
to promote the season premiere August
6th on Amc a season four premiere.

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,470
And, uh, and after that, the 10 year,

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,590
um, breaking bad reunion 10 years
since their first episode debuted,

130
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,400
I would think 2008. And, uh,

131
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,010
I went down there and there was all
these people dressed like superheroes.

132
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:01,180
Most people are not dressed up,

133
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,150
but there's enough people that
dressed up that it was cool.

134
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:07,960
And I went down there and I gotta tell
you I've really liked those fucking nerds,

135
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,150
man.
They were really cool people.

136
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,810
I only teased at one time cause I was
saying something that was a spoiler and I

137
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:17,680
was like, hey spoiler alerts, everybody
saw the last season of better call Saul.

138
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,950
You saw what happened in the last episode
and this dude down front was like,

139
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,990

141
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,860
I have to fucking read
this shit or something like
that. And everybody laughed.

142
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,590
Everybody had a good time with
it. I wasn't sure if, you know,

143
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,540
the self sabotage MV wanted to walk
out and opened with I had doe and you

144
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:42,070
fucking nerds, but I just didn't want
to bring them back to high school.

145
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,630
I figured I was in their Dojo. I'm going
to be polite. You know what I mean?

146
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,570
Is Fun as it is to do what that fucking
guy on Fox News did that one time when

147
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,500
he went on that show with Barbara
Walters, you know, remember that.

148
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,280
And half the fucking crew
from walked off the stage,

149
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,270
I can't remember anybody's
fucking names anymore. Anyways,

150
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:08,500
I was down there and I had a great time
and I flew a with my instructor down

151
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:11,830
there and an our 44.
It's the first time I've flown.

152
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,090
I hadn't flown since the end of
May, you know, it was overseas, uh,

153
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,530
you know, doing gigs and celebrating
my birthday probably far too long,

154
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:22,990
admittedly. And then the last
week of June, I, you know,

155
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,960
in the beginning of July I had to get
caught up with all the work that I lost.

156
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,310
I missed, I mean, sorry. And, uh,
I flew and a I did all right man,

157
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:31,530
you know,

158
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,620
a little rusty at first and then it
all fucking came back and I had my best

159
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,210
effin landing

160
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,570
I've ever had as far as uh,
you know,

161
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:46,060
not having to look at my instruments
too much and just feeling,

162
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,910
just failing at being common one
with the fucking machine there. Uh,

163
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,260
it was getting dark out.

164
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,550
We came back to Burbank and
we will listen to the atus,

165
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:01,990
which is just the information
did every hour for the airport.

166
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:05,850
You have to listen to it and
it's some computer voice.
You know, we're in Chicago,

167
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,850
girl driver, a girl, your wire up
here for a measured mark arcade.

168
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,280
So then you get on with Burbank,
tell you like Burbank Tower,

169
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,400
helicopter Blahblahblahblahblah
bulb blew it.

170
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,570
The helicopter had fucking
Hollywood reservoir,

171
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,500
a requested full stop at
Atlantic with information Yankee.

172
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,110
So they know you've got the
latest information. Then
they tell you what to do.

173
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,690
A Dow,
there was a bunch of traffic coming in,

174
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:28,960
so they told us to hold over old Maaco,
which is his fucking hunk of shit.

175
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:32,950
Macy's off the one seventies that they're
finally redoing and he just fucking

176
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:36,820
orbit over there to all the big boys
go in and then they say, you know,

177
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:41,821
helicopter Blahblahblah cleared for
landing runway eight west of Delta Eight.

178
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,360
So then you just say all that shit back.
So I said all that shit back. I come in,

179
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,190
they got the uh, the fucking
whatever. They go, well you
know those, those fucking,

180
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,010
the power lines there.
Chop your head off.

181
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,520
I flew over the tower like you
supposed to, not over the wires.

182
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,020
And then I was coming in at the right
speed because it was a jet behind me. Um,

183
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,600
but I was a little too high,

184
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:08,930
so I just banked it really hard using
my gs to make the fucking helicopter

185
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:12,620
heavier. Don't ask me how physics.
Right. And then it fucking came down.

186
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,220
I was going to come down
with like 600 feet permitted,

187
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,410
which as long as I'm
moving forward is fine.

188
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:22,190
But as I slowed down and got it down to
300 commercial fucking landing right in

189
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:25,490
the fucking glide path, right. And the
numbers and Fucking Bang, a left on Delta,

190
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:29,150
8:00 AM my instructor goes, that's
the best lesson that you've over done.

191
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,520
The becoming one with the helicopter.

192
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,000
And I turned around and my wife's in the
back in her headphones weren't working

193
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:38,570
and she didn't hear it. And you know
what? I hate to say it. So it was like,

194
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,404
it never happened.

195
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,040
And it was literally sitting there like
a five year old talking to my mom going,

196
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,970
dad, did you hear that? Did
you? And she was like, wow,

197
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,463
you know,

198
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,120
there's a part of me that
actually thinks she did here,

199
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,780
you know,
but to keep me in fucking line to keep me,

200
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:02,720
keep chasing the fucking cared.
She acted like she didn't hear it.

201
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,930
So anyways, um, moving along,

202
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:14,931
I want to thank everybody on the cast
of breaking bad and better call Saul for

203
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,970
doing the heavy lifting and telling
the stories and all that. I mean,

204
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,280
I was having like a,
you know,

205
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,490
nightmares about hosting that and meet,

206
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,170
turning into the real version of Chris
Farley. You know that that character,

207
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:32,040
he would do a Paul Mccartney.
You remember when you and John Lennon,

208
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:36,000
you guys wrote to the white
album? Uh, yes Chris. Yes, I do.

209
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,650
That was awesome. Like I was worried
that I was going to be doing that.

210
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:44,970
I'm not going to say there wasn't a couple
of moments of that, but uh, you know,

211
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,190
the whole time I was up there I was like,

212
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:51,750
why didn't they get Jimmy Kimmel to do
this? That was my first fucking thought.

213
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,790
Cause I remember he did. Um, he did the,

214
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:01,740
uh, when they had the
final episode in, in La,

215
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,770
they did this thing at the Hollywood
forever cemetery and they showed the,

216
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:08,310
uh,
the final episodes.

217
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,610
You could sit outside and fucking with
all these other breaking bad fans.

218
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,160
It was really a fucking awesome night.

219
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,290
And Kimmel hosted it
and he did a great job.

220
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:21,291
So I imagined the reason why he didn't
do it was because he had to host his own

221
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,960
show. And uh, yeah, that
makes sense. All right.

222
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:29,700
He had the host his talk show tapes at
five and that was going to be from three

223
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,260
to five 30 down in San Diego.
Oh, there we go. Hey, hey, go.

224
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,390
That's why all freckles got
called up from the mine. Ah,

225
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,680
for a cup of coffee,

226
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,730
speak in a cut and called up from the
minors and a cup of coffee and all that.

227
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:48,960
I'm back into watching the red sox a
very, at least paying attention, man.

228
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:53,290
I'd started with me trying and like using
listening to baseball as a way to not

229
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,980
flip out and traffic and um,

230
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,800
you know, and just settling in to just
not, I just stopped fighting the city.

231
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,960
Just like, yeah man, this is
going to be a lot of traffic.

232
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,590
There's going to be a lot of people doing
things that I'm not going to like and

233
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,750
I just need to just,

234
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,400
I'm just gonna sit there and watch it
happen and just sort of inch along as I

235
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:20,401
listened to five innings of a baseball
game and go maybe three quarters of a

236
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:23,550
mile, that's what I'm going to do.
And that's what I've been doing.

237
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,410
And I just listened to the red sox games
and, um, the Red Sox, I'll tell you too,

238
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,860
they were on fire.

239
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,320
I was worried that the all star
break was going to slow them down.

240
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,600
Date one 10 out of 11. Um, I'm sorry.

241
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:41,710
They want 11 out of that 10 outlet.
They want 11 out of 12

242
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,290
as right. Cause they went 10
and older than the last one.

243
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,700
And then they won a ripple
of the all star game. I know.

244
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:50,880
I sound like the fucking rain man.

245
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,550
Then we just took two or three from the
tag is, so we went 13 out of the last 15,

246
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,140
uh, and the Yankees just keep winning
too. Um, but I gotta tell you,

247
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,020
I watched a little bit of the Astros
two them and watching those guys,

248
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,140
I still think they're the team to beat.
Um,

249
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,610
they had Verlander they got
a great picture of staff
and they, they got the bats,

250
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:13,820
they get the whole fucking thing and they
want it last year and nobody's really

251
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:16,250
talking about and everybody's
all excited for fucking Yankees,

252
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:21,050
red sox and uh,
this is what I think.

253
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,890
Alright. Yankees, bullpens,

254
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:27,200
socks that's going to come
back and bite him in the ass.

255
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,650
And uh,

256
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Chris sale is our guy and

257
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,140
you know, as much as I
love David Price, you know,

258
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:44,141
he had a really rough outing against
the Yankees in New York and uh,

259
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,930
him curse [inaudible] Dennis Eckersley.
I don't know.

260
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,670
I Dunno that I was like, oh,
that's a hall of fame of man,

261
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,740
you don't curse out a
fucking hall of Famer.

262
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,930
So I'm worried that that
guy's a little, uh, you know,

263
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,020
what, are you a little
shaky between the uh, the,

264
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,810
is there little Odell Beckham there?
Right.

265
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,930
You know, I don't know. I hope
he is because if he isn't,

266
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,450
we've got to beast.
He is a beast.

267
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,450
But I'm just worried that when he went
down to New York and all these people,

268
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,950
it's fucking stupid.
Fuck me kind of imploded.

269
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,950
Rather than being like,
I'm going to ruin that fat man.

270
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:33,960
Titted singing fucking jackass,
Yankee Fan,

271
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,760
they still do that roll call thing.
It's like Jesus Christ.

272
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,630
I always feel like a musical is
going to break out after that. Um,

273
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,590
yeah, they do have a lot of that
and then they do the YMC a thing.

274
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,590
I mean it's just, you know, and every
time you think that's the worst thing,

275
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,200
then sing sweet Caroline.
It's just,

276
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,970
I don't know what has happened
to both of those franchises.

277
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,070
It's so weird how so
much shit just got nicer.

278
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,210
But people are so much meaner in a way,

279
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,340
you know. Thank you. Go to New York
City, like fucking Yankee stuff.

280
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,250
I went to a game in 1983 there,

281
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
the whole family went down there and
it was like taking your fucking Louis

282
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,233
Woodward Day game.

283
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,590
Okay.

284
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,550
And as you got to New York,

285
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:23,720
there was literally cars just burned out
on those side of the fucking highway.

286
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,670
And I don't mean in the middle of nowhere
on some side road on the side of the

287
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,430
highway,
like burn to the fucking ground.

288
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,570
I remember that was one of the
things when Giuliani got an office,

289
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,790
it was one of the first things he did was
he got those things off of the highway.

290
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,150
That was such a bad
fucking look for New York.

291
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,260
Or maybe it was a good look because it
was warning terror at terrorist tourists

292
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,750
about what they were about to
experience. But, um, I don't know.

293
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,950
Everybody was getting Giuliani credit.
Who is the head,

294
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:58,520
the chief of police there that he fired
along the way so he'd get all the credit.

295
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,550
Oh, Bill, do you always
have to be a con? Yeah, I to

296
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,250
Julie,

297
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,400
Aye.

298
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,120
Chief of Foley's fired.

299
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,420
Let's see what this guys come on.
Come on.

300
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:19,680
Slow Internet ease bill burry as
the slowest Internet in Los Angeles.

301
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,153
Yeah,

302
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,160
it's still fucking gone.
Um, and now I'm in,

303
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,360
I like, I don't even know. I don't
even know, like a sporting event.

304
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:33,250
There used to always be
like an element of, hey,

305
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,500
keep your head on a fucking
swivel and Jesus Christ,

306
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,820
you have no idea what you're going to see.

307
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:39,040
Like people acted like fucking animals.

308
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,650
There was fights in the stands
and all that type of shit.

309
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,310
I'm not saying obviously that
I wanted to go back to that,

310
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:49,480
but somewhere along the line like it just
became like, it's like, it's just weird.

311
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:53,900
It's like you go into a Chucky cheese,
um,

312
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,150
it's still loading by the way.
Still loading.

313
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,460
That's probably because I take the
Giuliani and something negative. That's,

314
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:07,320
that's my guess. I'm going to go with
the whole conspiracy theory here. Um,

315
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,110
yeah. Anyways, I dunno if you
go to sporting events now,

316
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,610
it's like every time
there's a stoppage of play,

317
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,740
then something happens up
on the fucking flat screen.

318
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:18,840
Everybody just stares at it
with their mouth hanging open.

319
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,850
And I really think that
that's like this thing.

320
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,530
So people like don't fight
and behaved themselves.

321
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,211
You know,
you know,

322
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:31,140
you get that camera on your flat screen
TV and all those fucking nerds at the

323
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:35,310
best buy sit there watching you jerking
off to the fucking Charlie's angels on

324
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:38,710
me TV, whatever you're
doing. Right. But you know,

325
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,520
in between those times when they waiting
for you to fuck your wife or whatever

326
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,960
those fucking nerd perverts I doing
down there that for some reason it's not

327
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:50,190
fucking enforced.
You know what I mean?

328
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,960
You got all this fucking
me too shit happening.

329
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,130
And meanwhile these fucking nerds
are watching you in your living room.

330
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,310
It's, I'm not making this shit up.
Like they'd gotten busted doing it.

331
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,990
I don't know why they admitted to it.
They were like, are you doing that?

332
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,360
They're like, oh yeah, no, we're
not gonna say we're not. Um,

333
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,910
I dunno anyways. Yeah. And
they just sit there fucking,

334
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,630
okay.

335
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,490
I mean, if you're gonna, if you're
gonna go after the, the pervert.

336
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,650
Okay. Giuliani renews ties
with police chief. He to

337
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,420
in 1995 William Jay Brandon
left in New York City,

338
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,580
New York City police commissioner with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The two men.

339
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,350
Okay. Yeah, that's the guy. From
what I've heard. Now granted,

340
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:45,420
this might have been
people that hated Giuliani,

341
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,070
which God knows a lot of people do.
MMM.

342
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,390
This might be bullshit, but I don't
know what it was this coming from.

343
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,280
This is the New York Times. All right,
so they hate Giuliani. All right.

344
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,370
The two men, Rudolph Giuliani and
his former police commissioner,

345
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:04,340
William Jay Brandon had not
spoken to each other in 10 years.

346
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:05,480
This is from 10 years ago.

347
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,930
This was written when they had crossed
paths as social gambling exchanged little

348
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:10,790
more than IC nods,
but time,

349
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,660
tragedy and presidential campaign
has started to change all of that.

350
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,360
Uh, all right. I don't even,

351
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:22,570
what the fuck it is. I think that was
the guy that really turned it around.

352
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,130
That started on the road where
it's now like, it's weird.

353
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,200
It's like,
uh,

354
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,660
my father in law said and came down and
he was standing in Brooklyn cause she,

355
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,580
wow, this is like a, it's
like a theme park, you know,

356
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,110
it's like people riding bicycles
along the river and all this stuff.

357
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,190
It's sort of like a, uh, it's
sort of like if you have money,

358
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,650
yeah,

359
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,950
it's become this utopia
or something. I Dunno.

360
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,050
When does the pendulum swing back?
That's what I want to know. Jesus Christ.

361
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,810
Because I imagine

362
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,750
in the 70s when New York
almost went bankrupt,

363
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:09,510
there was a bunch of old people got map.
But when this place was a dre bled,

364
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,170
what was that grandma back when white
swirl only allowed to play baseball back

365
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,360
when Hitler was walking the earth.

366
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,010
Yeah.

367
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,510
Well, I suppose shows change
weren't right, but, uh,

368
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,950
you could leave your door unlocked.
Um,

369
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,040
that is the thing.
Then anytime you say good old days,

370
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,350
there's always some fucked
up shit going on. Right.

371
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,483
Okay.

372
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,790
Yeah. Bill. Yeah. That, that really
wasn't anything deep. I didn't say.

373
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,470
Okay.

374
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,130
All right.
So what been doing lately?

375
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,700
A Speyside not boozing

376
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,340
tell you right now. All
fucking uh, or freckles. He,

377
00:23:56,341 --> 00:24:01,280
I haven't drank all this month. It's
been great, man. It's really been great.

378
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:05,040
I'm still fucking tired though. I
haven't a kid. You still tired? But, um,

379
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,590
I'm but like,

380
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,590
I remember one day waking up when I was
on the road anticipating a hangover and

381
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:17,490
not having one and I was like, wow,
that's pretty awesome. You know,

382
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,310
I'm trying to eat. Well, they're
going to talking to a nutritionist,

383
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,540
you know what I'm saying?

384
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,540
I got to get the answers to the test here
rather than listening to fucking every

385
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:33,600
Tom, Dick and Harry, you
know, Dean del Ray knows what
the fuck he's talking about,

386
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:36,540
but I'm getting bored with the Diet.
I got to add up the shit and, uh,

387
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,250
want to add some vegan
meals, you know, you know,

388
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:44,550
not because I want to go
vegan just because I know if
you eat them then you know,

389
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,890
your stomach is flatter. Just give
my body a break from, you know,

390
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,300
beef Bourguignon Skirt steaks
and all of that shit. You know.

391
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,030
Um, I saw this thing, the
other dance, like he just,

392
00:24:57,031 --> 00:25:00,480
you don't even know who to fuck to
belief. Like, one of the things, you know,

393
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:05,430
when you look at Vegetarians and you
look at Vegan people, uh, you know,

394
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:10,431
this is an astounding level of fleshy
fat people that don't eat meat,

395
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,540
you know what I mean?

396
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,100
And they'll eat French fries because
it's made from potatoes and they're a

397
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,220
vegetarian, but it's fried.
And they'll say, you know,
potatoes on good fee anyways,

398
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,440
as far as I know, I'm, man,
I shouldn't even say that.

399
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,650
I don't want to be all opera here and
get people to stop eating potatoes.

400
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:30,420
And then the whole fucking potato farm
farming industry sues me here at the

401
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:31,790
Monday morning podcast.
Um,

402
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,210
okay.

403
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,080
But there's just a lot,
you know,

404
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:39,650
the like fucking just all
carbohydrates and shit. Um,

405
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,510
and they just stay away from me. Uh,
I think a lot of people love animals,

406
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:48,511
but they hate reading is what I've sort
of learned from looking at Vegetarians

407
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:52,540
and Vegan people, you know,
so they don't eat meat,

408
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,880
but then they don't really know
what the fuck it is they're doing.

409
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,280
But the people that do take
the time to do it, right?

410
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,080
Like nobody who lived in this house
for a hundred fucking years, evidentaly

411
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,130
took the time to do something.
Right. I didn't do that.

412
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:12,470
And it's called it fucking
friend of fix it, didn't it?

413
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,963
Okay,

414
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,890
fuck it. A permit. Fuck
it. Somebody licensed.

415
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,460
Fuck all of that.
What did they do?

416
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,490
They just fucking lived here. They
had a problem. They asked a friend.

417
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:29,950
And I think a lot of vegans
and vegetarians do that.

418
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:32,410
They fucking talk to
people rather than reading.

419
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,330
And that's what I do because it's easier.

420
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,790
It's easier than sitting down and
actually doing the fucking work. So,

421
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,430
you know, I see that, you know,

422
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,780
like can anybody if
Gundy your fucking head,

423
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,350
can anybody tell you whether
having an egg is good for you?

424
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:55,000
A bad at this point eggs had been good,
bad,

425
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,010
good.
And now they're starting to be bad again.

426
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:59,440
While people who was saying
that good a fucking, you know,

427
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:01,960
they too can have this like the
rubber match, the rubber game,

428
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,560
whatever the fuck it's called.
Right. Um, so I'm going to,

429
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:08,590
I'm going to talk to a nutritionist
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you know,

430
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,780
try to read up on it, but
it's, it's really dry. And
if you actually look up shit,

431
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,140
okay.

432
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,100
On becoming a vegetarian or
eating a little like that,

433
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,840
like a Vegan or something,

434
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,730
it's just Hatfields and McCoys and
is between the fucking meat eaters to

435
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:32,540
carnivores and the vegetarian people.
And there's a lot of money at stake,

436
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,170
no pun intended. Sorry about that. Um,

437
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,300
so I think like the big farming cattle,

438
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:45,420
fucking people,
you know,

439
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:50,190
they're trying to have all this shit
come up first and then all the the tree

440
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:54,030
hugger and like, hey man, like you know,

441
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,580
trees are alive man.

442
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:01,050
Those fucking people are trying to
say that, you know, eating meat is,

443
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:02,910
is like, like I saw this thing, right?

444
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:08,150
What they were saying that this guy
was trying to say that like animals get

445
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:14,400
protein from eating plants and when you
eat an animal it's an indirect protein

446
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,300
because she should just gone directly
to the plant and it's like both then

447
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:22,620
explain tigers and they're fucking,
you know,

448
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,640
Mister Universe physiques
as far as I know,

449
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,550
which is, I don't know shit.
So I should shut up right now.

450
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,130
And Google what a Tiger Z.

451
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,693
Yeah.

452
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,710
What do tigers eat?

453
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,370
Okay.

454
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,360
Meet only when they're
always in a bad mood.

455
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,230
I can't even take a shit Siberian.
The species died.

456
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:52,120
Ordinary consists about 50% wild boar
meat. Doesn't that sound delicious?

457
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,980
If they cannot get their paws on some
wild boar, they've been known to eat elk,

458
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,800
deer in legs. They're like, well,
what do we fucking with me for a man?

459
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,150
I didn't do nothing.
And sometimes even bears.

460
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,520
Oh my God. What size? Jesus Christ.

461
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,290
That's a big thing in Asia.

462
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,070
Putting like a bear and a tiger and
a fucking cage and just filming it.

463
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,170
If large sources of meat
are not readily available,

464
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:30,910
Siberian tigers will eat rabbits,
fish and any rodents they can get to.

465
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,190
Let's see.
Okay,

466
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,420
well there's no meat in that due to,
and that's the first thing I saw.

467
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,600
Do Tigers
plants.

468
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,210
What do tigers eat? Siberia and the
species side consistent. Still this.

469
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:53,970
Okay.

470
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,380
Uh,
tiger's diet,

471
00:29:55,381 --> 00:30:00,381
eating tigers eat a variety of prey
ranging in size from termites to elephant

472
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:05,730
calves. All that would break my heart to
see a baby elephant get killed. However,

473
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,480
an integral component of the
Diet, Laura, are large body,

474
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:14,400
pray weighing 45 pounds
or larger such as Moose d.

475
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,400
What do we fucking mean? Moose and
bear, where the fuck are those things?

476
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:22,140
I thought they were the most were
only over here. Deer species,

477
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,340
pigs, cows, horses, buffaloes and goats.

478
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,590
Yeah. Well, they have a different
digestive system of evidently,

479
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:33,740
cause if you just fucking
hate that, that's they're
basically on the Atkins Diet,

480
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:35,410
right?
Yeah.

481
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,030
He's much fucking bacon as you want
taiga is looking at you like yeah,

482
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:44,920
I realize that. I realize
that. Um, so anyways,

483
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:48,340
I'm going to try to
fucking, uh, I don't know.

484
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,230
I'm going to talk to a nutritionist,

485
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:53,800
somebody who read all the shit that I'm
supposed to read and maybe try to get

486
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,950
them to tell me some, a pill. And you
really gonna buy books on nutrition.

487
00:30:56,951 --> 00:31:01,240
Like you're going to fucking read them.
Do they have a lot of pictures?

488
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,310
Um,
anyways,

489
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,770
I should probably read some advertising.
I don't feel like fucking doing that.

490
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,970
Hey, I'm almost like
halfway through this season,

491
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,960
six of a 77 sunset strip.

492
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,750
Um, and evidently see, I, as I said,
season six, you gotta watch it.

493
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,050
It's on at 4:00 AM on me TV.
Just take the fucking thing.

494
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,650
How about getting more people to watch
it because I'm worried because I found

495
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:33,160
out that they started broadcasting all
the episodes back in November and I

496
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,600
missed the first five seasons.

497
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,370
And we're getting towards the end here
of season six because they didn't do a

498
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,730
full season. They got canceled like
three quarters of the way through. Um,

499
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,440
and I'd like to see the original ones
because I'd like to see what La look back

500
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,880
then. You know, hopefully
they do some exterior's,

501
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,020
although I know most of it
was formed on the back lot,

502
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,300
filmed on the back lot in Warner brothers.
Um,

503
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,380
but,
uh,

504
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm loving this season so I'm worried
that the other one is going to be a little

505
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:07,140
hokey because I guess a lot of people
didn't like season six. First of all,

506
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:11,940
they fired the whole fucking
cast as a bad shoot. Sorry.

507
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:12,990
Um,

508
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,440
but I also didn't realize that they made
Efram Zimbalist jr his character a lot

509
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:19,800
more surly and uh,
but I'm loving them.

510
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,090
So now I'm worried that I saw the season
six first and if I go back and look at

511
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:27,440
the others, and I'm not going to like it
the show the same way the other people,

512
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:29,660
cause I get, you just get used
to how the guy behaves, you know.

513
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,870
But some of the lines, man, some of
the shit that people say on there,

514
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,880
here's some ex in like, you
know, women are, are, are uh,

515
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,490
are talking about how behave around them.
You know,

516
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,360
like in some of the shit that they
say, it's like Jesus Christ. I mean,

517
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm sure that guy's out there,
but what the fuck, you know,

518
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,230
sunset season six of
[inaudible] 77 sunset strip day.

519
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,240
It sounds like what some of these women
are describing is some of the shit I

520
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:03,400
heard them say guys saying to
women on that show pipe down,

521
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,193
shut up.

522
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,390
Not to mention after that from tries to
bang his fucking secretary tried to look

523
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,830
up or dress one ups. I'm just sitting
there and this guy would get me too.

524
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:20,500
It's so fucking fast. It have his
full head of hair spinning. Right.

525
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,900
And then my favorite one
ever favorite one ever,

526
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:26,870
as I mentioned on another
podcast is when he sat down in

527
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,690
this episode with the actor that ended
up playing the professor or Gilligan's

528
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:36,610
island. Sorry, I'm talking
through yawns right now.

529
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,190
Yeah,

530
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,500
the accident played the professor
in Gilligan's island. And the,

531
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:44,200
the guy was three drinks in
and AV firms meeting him.

532
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:47,740
It's the middle of the day and
the guy orders his fourth drink

533
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,450
and a afro goes, you got a pretty active
elbow for lunchtime. You on the sauce.

534
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,950
Okay.

535
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,950
That is the one thing also
that I love about that show.

536
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:06,490
It makes you feel better about
drinking and smoking cause uh,

537
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,270
that from Zimbalist almost made 90

538
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,470
and there's barely a scene.

539
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:15,320
He's not smoking a cigarette
and he's really smoking it too.

540
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:18,350
And that's just on the tape that they use.
So who knows?

541
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,370
I'm all right with that.

542
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,980
Should it read a little bit of
advertising? Yeah. Why don't I do that?

543
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,380
77 sunset strip.
Uh Oh Jesus.

544
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:34,250
Here we go. There's somebody
new mint, mobile, mobile.

545
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,720

546
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,980

for a lot of things. Big Contracts,

547
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:48,010
big bills and big fees like a t and
t's new $800 million administration fee

548
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,920
increase. Wow. They're just
making up phase now. I know.

549
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:58,460
I love when they do that because they
think that you don't have a choice.

550
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,690
What big wireless doesn't want
you to know that there's a what?

551
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,770

guys out of the business and then they

558
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:24,340

usually what happens. But right now,

580
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:55,360
And I can tell you I'm with
Verizon and these fucking cunts.

581
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,020
My bill always ends up going up
to like 300 bucks for no reason.

582
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:01,120
And then I'm like, why is it
300 bucks? Oh an actual year.

583
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:03,710
That year and a half I'm like, damn,
this dude institute. Which way,

584
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,790
but bug can do that now.

00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,403
they know

586
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,660
and then it fucking goes back up again.

587
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,980
I pay so much money for fucking
cell phone and fucking direct TV.

588
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,390
You know someone who was telling me if
you just call up direct TV or something,

589
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:23,790
you'd just tell him you're
going to fucking get rid
of it. I'm like, all right.

590
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,800
All right. All right. It's not 150 bucks.

591
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:30,120
It's 45 cause I think they're just
losing it with the, the cord cutters.

592
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,410

and why? Oh, I guess that's for me,

615

that you can only get at my shows,

which I did not have in Minneapolis
and Detroit. Unfortunately,

652
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,190
because the ones I got were
the leftover ones from Dublin.

653
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:47,400
And by the time they got here,

662
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:17,990
You are are. Hey, by the
way, you know what? I got a,

663
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,050
I got an email from a Darren king,

664
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,320
credible drummer.
Uh,

665
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,110
one of the best drummers I've
ever seen to be honest with you.

666
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,050
And I had no idea that he
could sing and play guitar,

667
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,970
but he did a cover of Richie. Uh, Oh my
God, I'm a saber. Is it Richie havens?

668
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,920
They make sure I have this right.

669
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,840
Yeah.

670
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,800
Uh, yeah. Let me, yes, I was correct.

671
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:48,940
Richie havens does a song
called freedom and um,

672
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,510
he did a cover version of that that
then goes into something else that is

673
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:53,710
fucking incredible.
Ah,

674
00:42:53,711 --> 00:42:58,660
I tweeted out the video and we'll
have a link to it on the podcast. Um,

675
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,670
Jesus Christ,
you know,

676
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,700
I like watching how talented that guy is.

677
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:08,330
I don't even know what the fuck I'm even
doing in this businessman. Incredible,

678
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,060
incredible monster
talent. Uh, check it out.

679
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:14,120
And I heard he has a solo album coming up.
People were alluding to it.

680
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,160
I hope he does.
If he does,

681
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:19,340
we are going to promote it here and
I hope you guys buy it because, uh,

682
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,320
he is the real deal. Um, all
right, let's check out some,

683
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:27,650
uh, am I going to read
some stories? You know,

684
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,490
you know what I'm actually going to do.
I actually came across this foot.

685
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:34,820
Could think it says news is bad for you.

686
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,930
Okay. This is from something
the guardian.com says,

687
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,500
news is bad for you and giving up reading
it will make you happier. All right,

688
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,940
now I'll tell you right now, I didn't
need this fucking article to tell me this.

689
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:54,910
I just realized it. I figured it out after
I went down a rabbit hole of fucking,

690
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,003
uh,

691
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,750
you know, conspiracy theory,
you guys remember that?

692
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,410
People listen to the podcast 10 years
ago. I mean, I was fucking, I was, yeah,

693
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,600
I was mystic, you know,
chem trail guy, you know,

694
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,100
how's that guy saying you got to shut
down the Federal Reserve and I had no

695
00:44:11,101 --> 00:44:15,330
solution to do like what would what
you would do after that, you know,

696
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:17,940
I'm sure people that are well read
on it had the solution, but I didn't.

697
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:21,630
So I was just walking around freaking
people out. I was a cunt basically.

698
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,650
Um, so anyways, it says
news is bad for your house.

699
00:44:25,651 --> 00:44:28,230
So I just stopped watching the shit.
All right.

700
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,990
I'm just banking on the,

701
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,760
that there's going to be some smart
people with a good heart that,

702
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:38,850
that are,

703
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,270
that are going to lead us out of this
fucking mess because I don't have any

704
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:44,760
solutions. All right? I go on stage,

705
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,990
I jump around like a monkey and I
make you laugh. Okay, that's my lane.

706
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,370
And it's a rock used to say, no,
you roll and shut your mouth.

707
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,450
So I'm staying over there. I
tried to watch the news, I try,

708
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,820
I can't, you know, it's the weirdest
thing going from Obama to Trump,

709
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,190
go from Obama where all they did was
lick his balls for eight years and then

710
00:45:06,191 --> 00:45:09,210
they go to Trump and it's just like,

711
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,340
all they do is shit on the
guy the entire fucking time.

712
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,720
And they're both kind of doing,
you know what? The foreign policy,

713
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,440
the same fucking shit, although I
don't, Trump is like a fucking lunatic.

714
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,620
You know what I mean?
I, you know, I heard,

715
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,190
I was just in the Howard stern show
and he went on this fucking rant about

716
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,660
Russia. It W it was just not talking about
the fucking people just talking about,

717
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,980
you know, uh, of laddy
daddy over there. He goes,

718
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:40,700
I'm sick of people fucking talking about
Russia, you know, like, like the dead,

719
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:43,940
not that bad. He's like, dude, they
fucking, you know, they kill gay people.

720
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:48,390
They kill reporters just for having
a difference of opinion and the,

721
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,890
and he's right. He's fucking right. Um,

722
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,910
I dunno, I once that his, his,

723
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:03,370
his fucking wife wore that coat when he
was going to go visit those kids that,

724
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,130
that she was going to go visit those
kids that they had stuck in cages and she

725
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,340
wore a jacket that said, I don't really
care to you and then turn it. Oh.

726
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,500
Then had to do with fake news.
It's just like,

727
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,150
it's literally like listening to a
toddler lie and I, God bless you,

728
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:23,350
if you could still watch that and try
and stay politically active because I

729
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:25,820
don't know it, it's, it's
just too fucking depressing.

730
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:30,470
I can't fucking deal with it.
So I choose not to watch.

731
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,240
And the last presidency, you
know, I just, I just, it was,

732
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,780
I couldn't fucking, yeah. You know,

733
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,010
I had hope and then I was just like, oh,
this is going to be more of the same. Oh,

734
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,230
bankers don't go to jail.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:48,320
Insurance companies could do whatever
they, whatever they fucking want. And uh,

736
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:48,921
yeah.

737
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:52,190
We're not going to
constructively criticize our
foreign policy and we're just

738
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:55,250
going to stay the fucking chorus and
shut down the government every fucking

739
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:58,190
August for a week. And our solution
is always going to be to say, well,

740
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:02,480
what if we raised the
debt? Right? You know,

741
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,440
and then meanwhile,

742
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,920
everything that his wife did was just
considered like angelic and it's just was

743
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,060
the whole fucking thing was annoying.

744
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,600
That was like when he was in office
was like watching a fucking award show.

745
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,510
Everybody's just walking around,
blowing each other,

746
00:47:16,511 --> 00:47:19,830
talking about how fucking
brilliant they are. And then this,

747
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,170
we went from an awards show
to a fucking train wreck.

748
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,030
I honestly don't know how people
have the stomach to pay attention.

749
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,420
Like you're a, you're a whole other level
tough mentally than I am. So anyways,

750
00:47:32,421 --> 00:47:35,110
his, his, his whole
fucking article here says,

751
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:39,430
news is bad for you and giving up reading
it will make you happier. All right.

752
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,560
In the past few decades,
the fortunate,

753
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,480
fortunate among us have recognize the
hazards of living with an over abundance

754
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:49,420
of food, parentheses,
obesity, and diabetes.

755
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,480
And having started to change and
have started to change your diet,

756
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:57,400
but most of us do not yet understand that
news is to the mind which sugar is to

757
00:47:57,401 --> 00:48:00,520
the body.
News is easy to digest.

758
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,390
The media feeds a small bites of
trivial matter tidbits that don't really

759
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:06,700
concern our lives and
don't require thinking.

760
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,550
That's why we experience
almost no saturation.

761
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,510
Unlike reading a book or a long magazine
articles which require thinking we can

762
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:16,330
swallow limitless
quantities of news flashes,

763
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,000
which are bright colored
candies for the mind.

764
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:24,370
Today we have reached the same point
in relation to the information that we

765
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:26,980
faced 20 years ago in regard to food.

766
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,370
We're beginning to recognize
how toxic news can be.

767
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,560
I agree with all of this, but everybody
can't stop paying attention or else,

768
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:39,240
you know, somebody has to pay attention,
right? Somebody's gotta be like getting,

769
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,630
just can't put it on cruise control.

770
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,400
So I don't know if I hundred
percent agree with this,

771
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:45,400
I just know I'm not going to be the
Gandy that leads us out of this,

772
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,510
you know? So as long as I
know that, I mean I will,

773
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:56,440
abuse can be content to listen
to Howard in the morning.

774
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:58,630
And then I listened to
fucking baseball at night.

775
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,480
That's what the fuck I do. I don't
pretend to know things. All right.

776
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:09,070
News misleads all my God. Wow.
Take the following the event.

777
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,010
A car drives over a bridge and
the bridge collapses. What does,

778
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,340
what does the news media focus on the car,

779
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,730
the person in the car where he came from,
where he planned to go,

780
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,250
how he was he transitioning,
how they didn't say that,

781
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,460
how we experienced the crash
parentheses if he survived.

782
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,340
But that is all irrelevant.
What's relevant?

783
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,740
The structural stability of the bridge.

784
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,610
That's the underlying risks that has
been Larkey and could lurk and other

785
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:34,090
bridges.

786
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:39,090
All they get to that after
they go painstakingly
through the horror of the end

787
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:44,890
of that man's life or life
altering injuries and then
they get to his family and

788
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:48,970
they're all crying and all
of that shit. Um, you know,

789
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:53,530
as much as a moron, as as I am, I
always turn that shit off. You know,

790
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:58,320
like out here we had a hostage
situation at a trader Joe's and um,

791
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,270
the people I was with were just watching
it and watching and watching it.

792
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,400
It's like, like, just out of curiosity,

793
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:06,820
what are you going to do with this guy
just runs out in such shooting people in

794
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:08,590
the fucking head. Like,
you want to watch this?

795
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,500
These people in the store
are fucking terrified.

796
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:14,680
This is the worst fucking
moment of their life. All right?

797
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,360
The news eventually is going to tell you
what happened and they're going to give

798
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:22,870
you an edited version so you don't have
to see people's brains getting blown out,

799
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,210
you know? And why, you know,

800
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,430
they literally had like the
were crying and a lot of shit.

801
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:31,840
And then I found on the end, you
know, some poor woman died. It was,

802
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,300
it's fucking terrible.

803
00:50:33,301 --> 00:50:38,210
The one way I'm just going to sit at home
watching it for hours, ordering food,

804
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:43,520
you know, going online. Are they
tweeting from there or what's going on?

805
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,010
Then all these fucking
assholes on Youtube,

806
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,250
a youtube on Twitter
or these social media.

807
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:53,840
If you're going to go on and say the
obvious, oh my God, this is so sad.

808
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,890
I'm like freaking out right now. I love
that. Oh, is that what you're doing?

809
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,840
Are you freaking out? Or
the safety? Your own home.

810
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,920
Why don't you make this about yourself?
You'll fuck oh Jesus. Social media,

811
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:08,450
but is people's a lot of shit that says
that's depressing too. But you know what?

812
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,210
Podcasts actually feed the soul.

813
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,320
Believe I'm part of the problem.
News misleads bill Burmis leads. Uh,

814
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,520
anyways, plowing ahead. We
are not rational enough to
be exposed to the press.

815
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,410
Is he this guy saying we're all dumb?

816
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,400
Watching an airplane crash on television
is going to change your attitude toward

817
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:31,400
that risk regardless of
its real probability.

818
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,580
If you think you can compensate with
the strength of your own inner con

819
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,800
contemplation,
you are wrong.

820
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,770
I think the subtext of this is you dumb
fuck bankers and economist who have

821
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:47,771
powerful incentives to compensate for
news born hazards have shown that they

822
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:53,531
could not the only solution cut yourself
off from the news consumption entirely.

823
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:59,210
News is irrelevant of the approximately
10,000 new stories you have read in the

824
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:00,170
last 12 months.

825
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:04,760
Name one that because you consumed it
allowed you to make a better decision

826
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:08,750
about the serious matter affecting your
life, your career and your business. Well,

827
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,520
I would say anything
about the environment.

828
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:16,580
You know Jesus had skies
chip off the old block here,

829
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,300
paint with a broad brush.

830
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,710
The point is the consumption
of news is irrelevant to you,

831
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:25,710
but people find it very difficult
to recognize what's relevant.

832
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,920
It's much easier to recognize what's new.
All right,

833
00:52:28,921 --> 00:52:29,860
I think we get the point here.

834
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:34,861
I news has no explanatory power news
items or bubbles popping on the surface of

835
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:40,470
a deeper world. Ooh, that's
deep. That sounds like a
fucking progressive rock band.

836
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,300
Like a line in the song.

837
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:43,960
Okay.

838
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,080
I'm in [inaudible] seven four I imagine
will accumulate facts that help you

839
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:52,580
understand the world. Sadly, no,
the relationship is inverted.

840
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:56,660
The important stories are non stories.
I would agree with that slow,

841
00:52:56,661 --> 00:53:01,370
powerful movement that developed below
journalists radar but have a transforming

842
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:04,430
effect.
The more news factoids you digest,

843
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,800
the less of the big picture you
will understand. Well, maybe this,

844
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:09,540
why everybody's yelling at each other.
News is toxic to your body. This is,

845
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,770
I'll just read the headlines here.
News increases cognitive errors.

846
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,770
News inhibits thinking.
News works like a drug.

847
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,030
News waste time and news makes us passive.
Well that worked with me.

848
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:24,530
News kills creativity. Uh, well
there you go. Jesus Christ.

849
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:27,720
That's pretty negative, Huh?
Let's get to some positive shit.

850
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,540
I gotta I gotta fucking note from
a possible visit to dove, Ron,

851
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:36,030
Vic brava. Roves nick though, Bro,

852
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,440
leave Croatia my friend.
Uh,

853
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:45,430
while you're checking where the
hell I'm contacting you from, uh,

854
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:50,520
let me jump you with invitation.
Invitation to my country. Slash. City.

855
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:55,590
I run brewery and we are in debt at the
moment. So don't expect this is money.

856
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:56,970
Interesting invitation.

857
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,920
This is opportunity for you to check
out crazy side of Buckland's and getting

858
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:06,450
hours and hours of future material.
By the way, you're funny. Well,

859
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,940
thank you sir.
Uh,

860
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:12,690
that read like a fucking ransom note from
eastern Europe and I would be lying to

861
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:15,030
you if I wasn't a little
afraid to go to your bar.

862
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,460
I need a couple of those in there.
You know,

863
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,770
while you're checking where I got
the hell I'm contacted you from,

864
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:27,771
let me jump in with an invitation
that'd be jumping with invitation.

865
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,610
Uh, you, you fucking
talk like Ivan Drago. Um,

866
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,840
listen buddy,

867
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,410
I'm going to try and get as close to
dumb Bruv nick as they possibly can.

868
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,660
I wish your bar was making more money.
Uh,

869
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,820
and I'd love to go in there and help
you out with your fucking monthly rent.

870
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,700
Buy Booze and my face off,
but I don't, I can tell you,

871
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,430
I don't think I'm going to make it there.
Uh,

872
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,400
Eastern European toward Jesus Christ.
This is all I'm getting.

873
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,440
This is all east eastern Europe
where Eastern European tour.

874
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,960
Dear Billy Ball Burger. Oh, come on now.

875
00:55:01,961 --> 00:55:05,640
When I was feeling I was
feeling good about myself, uh,

876
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:09,580
I'm a huge fan of your comedy and F is
for family is my favorite thing on next

877
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:11,220
flicks. Well, thank you
very much. Therefore,

878
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:14,130
I am very excited that you're
thinking of visiting Prague,

879
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,930
Czech Republic comedy scene in
Prague is pretty much nonexistent.

880
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,070
Oh geesh. So I'm sure you would
kill with your knock knock jokes.

881
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,560
Um,
if you are interested,

882
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,130
pint of beer cost between
one to $2 and it's delicious.

883
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:32,250
He also have to try
traditional alcohol drink

884
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,830
Slivovo vis.

885
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:40,800
It's made from distilled plums
and has about 51% of alcohol.

886
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,690
Okay.
I'm in.

887
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,260
You could visit the Czech hockey hall
of fame or you could go to cr Mayor Yara

888
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:50,880
placed some second division hockey.
Oh, that would be cool. Shit,

889
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,620
I'm probably only going
to be there for a night.

890
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,310
I think this is going to be a
a bunch of one nighters here.

891
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,440
A while back you mentioned you saw the
movie anthropoid about a checklist of Aki

892
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:05,550
and paratroopers assassinating
high ranking German Nazi official.

893
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:08,790
I love that movie. The movie ends
with the final shootout in the church.

894
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:11,730
You can actually go to the crips of the
church and see the bullet holes from the

895
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,070
incident.
I'm fucking doing that.

896
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:20,070
IOP decide to come and share your
Merkin wisdom with us savages.

897
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,610
Thanks. And Go make love to your
lovely wife. Oh, thank you. Bless you.

898
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,350
Go Fuck your wife. You fucking read
it. It prick eastern European toy.

899
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,550
Hey Bill.

900
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,980
I've just wanted to say that I know a
lot of people waiting for you to come to

901
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:36,000
Poland.
Oh Great.

902
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:39,750
I guess your agents already figured out
that Warsaw seems the most logical place

903
00:56:39,751 --> 00:56:43,110
to do your show as it's the biggest
city in the capitol and it's located

904
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:44,280
somewhere in the middle of the country.

905
00:56:44,281 --> 00:56:47,700
So most of the people from outside Warsaw
like me will be able to come and see

906
00:56:47,701 --> 00:56:50,970
you live. I'm 100% sure you'll
sell out all of the tickets.

907
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:54,600
Plus Warsaw is a great place to visit
because of its history and of course all

908
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:55,950
the cool stuff going on there.

909
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:00,030
I guess people from the states think
you'll see white bears and trams and horse

910
00:57:00,031 --> 00:57:03,600
drawn carts on the street. But that's
not the case. I didn't think that.

911
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:08,940
I just thought I'd see four people trying
to screw in a light bulb. Ah, sorry.

912
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,770
Just like everywhere else. We've got
hipsters and Starbucks, moderately fat,

913
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:17,490
lazy fucks in shopping malls and generally
people wasting their lives on social

914
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:20,970
media. Yeah, yeah. That's, that's
a reoccurring thing. Anyway,

915
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,820
my friends and I can't wait for your
show. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Yeah.

916
00:57:23,821 --> 00:57:26,880
Everybody's staring at their phones is
a big thing and I do that all the time.

917
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,320
Uh, persistent cold. You
may have walking pneumonia,

918
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,870
go see a doctor when you get
back to la. I need a doctor. So

919
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:42,210
soft tires and Nazi symbolism. I
love this guy. This guy is just,

920
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,610
he's just doing the whole gamut,
isn't it? Um, running the gamut. Hey,

921
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:50,130
let's look that up.
Let's see what the fuck that means.

922
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,000
How did that expression come about?
All right.

923
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,110
Run the gamut.
Origin meaning the entire range.

924
00:57:58,111 --> 00:58:03,111
The word Gamet traces its origins to the
Middle Ages in a system for designating

925
00:58:04,411 --> 00:58:07,500
musical notes around the turn
of the second millennium.

926
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,010
The fuck you mean the second millennium?

927
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:15,580
I thought this was the second
millennium. 2000, right?

928
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,400
Is it a millennium? A thousand years.
I'm an evil monk. Developed a system.

929
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,553
Jesus.
Bill.

930
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,160
Yeah.

931
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,630
I, you know, just gets to the
point like I try to be informed.

932
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,160
Okay,

933
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,130
I see the second you're going
to bring up a fucking monk.

934
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:39,710
Around the turn of the second millennium,
Guido of our Arizona,

935
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,390
a medieval monk

936
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,000
developed a system of Psalm Ization.

937
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,870
I designating musical
notes by syllable names.

938
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:54,010
While today we are familiar with
the song syllables, doe ray, me Fa.

939
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:58,720
So La ti back in Guido's time,
he died in 10 50.

940
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:04,170
They had a hex tonic scales six note
and he used the symbol earth's re me FA,

941
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,990
Sol and La

942
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,010
and La,

943
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,300
the represented the lowest
note [inaudible] La and ah,

944
00:59:19,451 --> 00:59:23,020
I can't get this white
drums and tell jokes. Uh,

945
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:28,021
ut represents the lowest tone
recognized in music theory at that time.

946
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,470
The second g below middle c.
What the fuck?

947
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:35,700
I don't give a fuck about what you say.
What is the gamut? The range of notes.

948
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:42,520
Okay. Building on this denotation
destination. I don't know.

949
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:46,680
Gammon eventually came to mean
the whole musical scale. Oh,

950
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:51,580
so you're running the whole fucking
scale. Okay. Jesus Christ. All right.

951
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,930
Hey Bill, soft tires and Nazi
symbolism by the way. Hey Bill,

952
00:59:55,931 --> 00:59:58,960
I think I can answer both of your
questions from Thursdays podcast.

953
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:03,250
I'm in law school and a motor
sport fanatic. So the questions,

954
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,660
these questions are right
in my wheelhouse. All right.

955
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,700
What did you were in law school? What?
So you know about Nazi symbolism?

956
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,300
Do you prosecute hate crimes?
I hope a number one.

957
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:20,040
Why the soft tires and Moto
GP? Uh, principally you,

958
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:23,670
you're right. I know at the tires to
grade towards the end of the race.

959
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:27,120
So it makes sense to use harder
ones to get consistent performance.

960
01:00:27,121 --> 01:00:29,820
Especially now that's slightly sliding.

961
01:00:29,821 --> 01:00:32,340
The bike is the quickest
way around the track.

962
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:35,640
How the fuck you learn
how to do that is crazy.

963
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:36,580
Yeah.

964
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:40,690
I mean I've seen people do that in
cars, you know, drifting, but you know,

965
01:00:40,691 --> 01:00:43,270
you're on four wheels.
Like the level of balance at scale,

966
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:45,510
they'll be ability become
one with the machine.

967
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:48,760
It's judge other jewelers oleds
are work of art and Germany.

968
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:53,570
Lorenzo used a soft front tire
while mark is took the hard one. Uh,

969
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,490
for the rears.

970
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:59,491
Lorenzo was on a medium tire and Marquez
on the soft Marquez is a special driver

971
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,490
and tends to get a better feeling
for the bike with a hard tire.

972
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,660
The sidewalls simp simply
don't wobble around too much.

973
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,860
Lorenzo's bet was to use the
superior pace of the soft tire,

974
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:16,330
more grip to build enough of an advantage
to win. This is fascinating. Marquez,

975
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:21,280
meanwhile expected a tight field and
wanting to nurses tires while keeping with

976
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,173
the pack.

977
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,140
Thus having enough tire left for the
last lab and a final attack for a wind,

978
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,480
which is exactly what he did.
Simply put,

979
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:32,250
the drivers have to decide between
an early pace advantage and therefore

980
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:37,270
superior track position was soft tires
and the consistency of the hards add,

981
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,610
add changing conditions,

982
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:43,780
different writing styles and bikes to
that and you'll see how hard it is to pick

983
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:46,180
up a winning package.
Well,

984
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,660
yeah,

985
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,920
my thing is,

986
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,830
is there a way for him to know what
Mark Marquez is going to be running

987
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,770
considering he's the best writer
out there? As far as I can tell,

988
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,960
no disrespect to Jorge Lorenzo. I know
he's one of the couple of times, but um,

989
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,630
the championship, I believe
he's won two of them. Um,

990
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:09,280
no matter what tire you're going to have,
you're not going to open up this like,

991
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:10,560
okay,

992
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,790
insurmountable lead.

993
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:16,420
So I just think eventually that soft tire
is going to fucking wear out and then

994
01:02:16,421 --> 01:02:17,260
mark has his behind.

995
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:20,720
He's going to overtake you and then he
then can ride hard for the first time in

996
01:02:20,721 --> 01:02:21,554
the race.

997
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,080
Okay.

998
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,700
He'd beat the shit out of those tires,
but by the time they get fucked up,

999
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:29,780
the race is going to be over
before that happens. I Dunno.

1000
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,590
But thanks for that. That is, that
is fastened cause everybody's lives.

1001
01:02:33,591 --> 01:02:37,820
You Watch racy, she's bunk people
driving around John Brown track,

1002
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,270
driving around in circles, stock car
racing. You're like, do you need to know?

1003
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:46,200
Go turn left. Um, yeah, that's
all you need to know. Bandit,

1004
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,210
Nazi symbolism. Um, I'm enrolled
in one of the best schools.

1005
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,240
I love how people are too
dumb to understand racing
and then they sit there and

1006
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:55,130
they shit on it.
Uh,

1007
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,690
I'm enrolled in one of the
best law schools in Germany
over here displaying Nazi

1008
01:02:59,691 --> 01:03:04,670
symbolism is punishable with up to five
years in prison in the context of the

1009
01:03:04,671 --> 01:03:08,420
whole legal system.
It's quite an unusual article of the law.

1010
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,660
Usually this is amazing. So he, cause
cause you're a lawyer in Germany,

1011
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,960
usually the political background of an
opinion is irrelevant to the criminal

1012
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,400
repercussions to avoid discrimination.

1013
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:23,480
Usually objective factors are
used instead of political ones.

1014
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,980
It was discussed whether it banning and
punishing Nazi sympathetics displays his

1015
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:32,810
constitutional. It is an infringement
on the freedom of speech. Yes it is.

1016
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,920
Um, and it also lets you
know who the Nazis, uh,

1017
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:39,580
the one argument that
won in court was this,

1018
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:44,300
this was the historic significance in
Germany. Uh, the constitution with,

1019
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:47,210
by the way, I'm loving all these,
these letters from around the world.

1020
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:50,040
This is fucking incredible. If I
could just get some women to write it.

1021
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:53,090
I know I'm off putting lays,
but you know,

1022
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,730
that kind of gives you an
opportunity to put me in my place,

1023
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,920
which is one of my favorite things.
You hear when my wife saw here,

1024
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:01,610
she shits all over me. I love
it. Giggling like a schoolgirl.

1025
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:06,790
The constitution was put into place in
1949 while most cities still look like

1026
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:12,700
downtown Baghdad circle 2004 a and when
the ovens of Auswitch had just cooled

1027
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,860
down, Jesus, uh,

1028
01:04:15,861 --> 01:04:20,861
the content of the constitution is an
answer to all the shit that went down

1029
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:25,430
between 1933 in 1945.
Yeah,

1030
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:29,810
Pres. Most those lunatics
died or were put to death.

1031
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:33,550
And then some more rational
people like, hey, yeah,

1032
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,350
let's try to prevent that happening
again. I look at the city, God,

1033
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:38,000
this is amazing.

1034
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,900
You can see all the way to the other
city because there's no cities left. Um,

1035
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:48,490
anyways. Um, so the constitution
is the answer to, that's really,

1036
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:53,491
I know you don't see a lot about
Germany other than 1933 to 1945 or the,

1037
01:04:55,161 --> 01:04:57,340
she'll shit about, you
know, World War One,

1038
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:03,850
but they don't show about the steps
that they took afterwards to ensure that

1039
01:05:03,851 --> 01:05:06,610
this wasn't going to happen again.
Uh,

1040
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,460
I'm sure there's a nice book on it that
I could sit down and read if I wasn't

1041
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:10,294
such a moron.

1042
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,530
And he was denying support of that regime
is part of the constitutions inherent

1043
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:18,420
character. I agree with that. The
problem, it doesn't change anything.

1044
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:22,770
It's symbolism. We can now point at
our laws and tell other countries,

1045
01:05:22,771 --> 01:05:26,520
see we learned and what
do the Neo Nazis do?

1046
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,880
They use fucking code,
which is not forbid,

1047
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,150
such as 88,

1048
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,740
I guess that means Heil
Hitler or H K N K R Z shirts,

1049
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:42,950
which in German is recognize
is saying Hakan crudes,

1050
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,730
which equals swastika. I swear
to God, those fuckers parody,

1051
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:53,060
the run DMC logo with
Hkn Space K R Z shirts.

1052
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:57,090
I had no idea.
Wow,

1053
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,960
thanks for the podcast.
They keep me laughing during exams.

1054
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:04,650
Looking forward to your German European
tour, you freckled con, you know,

1055
01:06:04,651 --> 01:06:08,490
that's gotta be the fascinating Shit
I've heard about Germany since, you know,

1056
01:06:08,491 --> 01:06:13,350
the same shit that they
show a zillion times on, um,

1057
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:16,900
on the history channel. I mean, obviously
you've got to show that. So, you know,

1058
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,040
hopefully that never happens again.
Um,

1059
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:24,180
but they should probably shine a light
on this to know that that is going down.

1060
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,260
I don't know. It's hard, man. I,

1061
01:06:27,261 --> 01:06:31,460
I believe looked like the Nazis Xix dick
kind of like a fucking think I used to

1062
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:32,151
do a bit on this.

1063
01:06:32,151 --> 01:06:36,290
They're kind of like a band that had a
bunch of hits like fucking 40 years ago

1064
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,880
and now they're coming back and it's just,
you know, there's no original members.

1065
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:45,380
They don't have the magic. Any wishes it's
over. It's over. It's, it's uh, you know,

1066
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,200
it's like, uh, you know, some,

1067
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:52,700
some bands it's just their name
becomes toxic after awhile.

1068
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,170
Okay.

1069
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,003
You know,

1070
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,580
although sometimes it's so bad that they
come back and people love him again.

1071
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,460
I don't know,
it's probably a bad analogy,

1072
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,070
but that's pretty frightening
that that shit's going down,

1073
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:09,110
that people still like,
you know,

1074
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,500
I dunno, I, I've never really been
to a Holocaust museum. It's just, I,

1075
01:07:15,501 --> 01:07:18,050
I just don't think I could handle it.
You know,

1076
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:22,310
knowing that people are capable
of that level of fucking,

1077
01:07:22,311 --> 01:07:25,220
even just literally separating,
you know,

1078
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:30,020
it shouldn't slavery that shit at the
board to separate parents from their

1079
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:34,010
children to sit there and fucking do that.
I don't,

1080
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:38,990
I don't give anybody a pass.
Even the fucking kid down
there like, this is my job.

1081
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:43,550
Quit your fucking job.
I'm not fucking doing this.

1082
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,110
When do you,
when is that Kid's screaming,

1083
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:50,350
crying voice going to leave your
fucking head for the rest of your life?

1084
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:54,130
Oh my God. Especially not having a kid
and no one like how much they need.

1085
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:56,500
Like my daughter just came in,
she was like wine and all that.

1086
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:01,060
For whatever reason, she wanted to
hug me, you know? I don't know why,

1087
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:05,230
but they need just to take that away
from a kid that just, it's fucking,

1088
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,120
you don't always some, I
dunno this getting, you know,

1089
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:14,410
there's gotta be another
way. All right. Anyways, uh,

1090
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:18,770
you sent my brother to the hospital.
The fuck are you talking about?

1091
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:23,340
Can I legally read this without getting
all right?

1092
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,930
Hey Billy Bro. Killer. My brother
and I went to your show early,

1093
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:32,610
your early show in Minneapolis a couple
of weeks ago. And as we were leaving,

1094
01:08:32,611 --> 01:08:36,750
he was complaining about his back and
shoulder hurting being the Douche. I am.

1095
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,390
I assumed he was whining
about the uncomfortable seat.

1096
01:08:39,391 --> 01:08:43,140
So the next few days he started coughing
and hearing a rattle in his chest. Yeah.

1097
01:08:43,141 --> 01:08:46,230
Okay. Well go to the doctor. He went
to the doc and as we were cautioned,

1098
01:08:46,231 --> 01:08:47,880
it turns out at some
point during your set,

1099
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:53,120
his right lung made like the
Falcons and Superbowl 51 collapsed.

1100
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:59,830
Well that's not from laughing. That was
like, you know, you went there. Yeah.

1101
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,370
This is probably everything he
did up until that point. Um,

1102
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,031
he spent,

1103
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:08,230
I would love to take credit for any
jokes being funny enough to make some of

1104
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:12,920
these lung collapse, but I
think your, uh, thank uh, uh,

1105
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,550
yeah, you're looking at the ass
end of the problem there, but he,

1106
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:20,480
he spent the next six days in the hospital
and had to get a tube stuck through

1107
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:24,980
his rib cage, like Carl weathers
deaths, the death scene in Predator.

1108
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,040
Then they hooked that
shit up to a dust buster,

1109
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:33,041
sucked out the air that was outside
of his lung and sold the whole shut.

1110
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,880
That's fascinating. He finally got
out of the hospital and is doing fine,

1111
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:40,430
but I just thought you'd appreciate
knowing you're at the level where your

1112
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:40,851
comedy,

1113
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:45,710
because someone's Oregon to explode like
the God damn deathstar keep this up.

1114
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:49,370
You'd be well on your way to fixing
the overpopulation problem anyways.

1115
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:53,210
Can't wait for you to get come back to
Minnesota so he can finish the job and

1116
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:56,740
get his left lung. Hope all is
well with the family. Thinks. Ah,

1117
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,410
glad you guys came out and are glad
your brother's doing all right. Um,

1118
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,940
all right. I think that's the, uh,
I think that's the podcast here,

1119
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,080
uh, for this week. Um, all right. I think
there was a Formula One race today, ag.

1120
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,960
I'm taping this Sunday night.
I got to a sit down and watch that,

1121
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:18,050
but I got so much shit to do.
Um,

1122
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:21,490
is that it is, do I
have anything? Oh yeah.

1123
01:10:21,491 --> 01:10:26,230
This weekend I'm going to be with
Nate Kraig and Houston. All right.

1124
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:31,060
Houston, Texas. In July
as a bald, redheaded male.

1125
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,640
And then I'm going to be in Dallas.

1126
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,220
I don't know how many shows him fucking
do it. Yeah. Let me check it out here.

1127
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:38,710
All right,
so here's the deal.

1128
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:43,711
Thursday I got a show at
revention music center in Texas.

1129
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,200
Friday I have a show at prevention
music center in Houston,

1130
01:10:49,331 --> 01:10:53,680
Texas. There's still tickets
to Thursday, Friday sold out.

1131
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:58,300
And then I got two shows in,
uh,

1132
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,320
the pavilion

1133
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:05,310
up in Dallas at the Toyota music factory.
Um,

1134
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:09,900
also I added a show right before
the rough and rowdy in Rochester,

1135
01:11:09,901 --> 01:11:13,110
New York, right outside of Buffalo,
which I haven't been to in a Zillion,

1136
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,040
um,
Rochester,

1137
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:22,041
former home of the Rochester royals that
then became the Cincinnati royals than

1138
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:25,500
the Kansas City Slash Omaha kings.

1139
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,720
Then the Kansas City kings and then
the Sacramento Kings. Hey Bill,

1140
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:31,171
why would they,

1141
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:34,230
Kansas City and Omar King spoke cause
they used to split their home games

1142
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:37,770
between both those cities.
Seeing which town gave a fuck more.

1143
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,150
Kansas City didn't have any
college football. Omaha did. Well,

1144
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:46,410
I guess it's in Lincoln, Nebraska,
right? Where is university? Nebraska.

1145
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:49,650
I only went to a fucking game out there.
I always forget where it had said. Um,

1146
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,920
and then he became the sacrament of kinks.
I'm into that shit.

1147
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:57,790
I'm going to pass tissues. You want to
hear a couple of cool ones? All right.

1148
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,480
Here's a good one.
Kansas City Scouts,

1149
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,230
NHL team moved to Colorado,

1150
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:07,620
became the Colorado Rockies
and then moved to New Jersey,

1151
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:12,540
became the New Jersey devils. Okay.
I can't do all your homework for you,

1152
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:16,590
but I can do some of it. All right.
The original Washington senators,

1153
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,400
1901 to 1960 they left and became the
Minnesota twins and then the senators came

1154
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:26,520
back briefly in Washington,

1155
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:30,870
almost like they retained the name like
the Cleveland browns and there was a

1156
01:12:30,871 --> 01:12:35,871
second incarnation of the
fucking Washington senators
and they also failed and

1157
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:42,120
then they moved to Texas and
became the Texas Rangers.

1158
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:47,100
All right.
You want to hear some more?

1159
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,350
What else do I got? All right. The New
York Yankees, who were they originally?

1160
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,150
The Baltimore Orioles.

1161
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,590
1901 to 1902 then they became
the New York islanders,

1162
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,700
1903 to 1912 then they
became the New York Yankees,

1163
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:07,740
1913 to present,
not the Baltimore Oil Orioles.

1164
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,710
I knew they were the
old Saint Louis Browns,

1165
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:12,570
but I didn't realize they were the first.

1166
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:16,500
They were the Milwaukee brewers in 1901
than they were then Saint Louis browns

1167
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:21,420
1902 to 1953 and from 1954 till
now they became the Orioles.

1168
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:25,620
All right. That's it can, I don't want
to talk to you guys anymore about this.

1169
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:28,770
What the Oakland A's, is that, is that,

1170
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,710
is that what you were asking about where
they were the Philadelphia athletics in

1171
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:36,711
1901 to 1954 than the Kansas
City athletics to 1955 in
1967 and then they will,

1172
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:43,670
the became the Oakland A's 1968 to 1986
and then the oath and Oakland athletics

1173
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:48,060
in 1987 to present. I don't know what
that means as far as I'm concerned.

1174
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:50,850
They've been the Oakland A's or the
athletics and 68 but that's what this

1175
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:55,050
fucking thing said to me.
You know, and you know, I
learned about all of this shit.

1176
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:59,820
A lot of teams have passed through Kansas
City, started there, gone through there,

1177
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,350
and then that they just fucking,
you know, Kansas City Scouts,

1178
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:09,150
Kansas City kings,
Kansas City athletics,

1179
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,500
if had a lot of people come and go,
you know,

1180
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:17,940
and there's only one solution that
I can think of. There's a lot of,

1181
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,260
and Kansas City. All right, go fuck
yourselves. I'll talk to you on Thursday.
