1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
Going on. It's bill burr and his
time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:07,740
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast and just checking in on you.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,840
This is not an official podcast.

4
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:11,760
This is where it just checking
in on you on a Thursday.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,350
I see how you fucking work week is going
at most times what? You know the deal.

6
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:21,120
I do it by myself. I lay
around, I shoot the shit. I
say things. People hear things,

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,690
they think that it's about them and
who is or isn't in the White House,

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:29,460
who the fuck knows? But every once in a
while I bring on a guest and when I do,

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,110
I don't just bring on any guests.

10
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,750
I bring on some of the most talented
people out there and some of my great

11
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,180
friends and today this is no different.

12
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:40,980
I have the great Ben Bailey from cash cab.
He's got a new special,

13
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,260
he's got a bunch of short films.
He's got a new website.

14
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,200
It's got a bunch of shit he wants to
talk about. Ben Bailey. What's up man?

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,940
How the fuck are you? Good to see you now
have, when was the last time I saw you?

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,020
It wasn't last November.
Oh.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,340
Might've been once since then,

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,970
but we had to have some sort of
festival. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe out here.

19
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,180
But you're talking to walking
by to some social media tent.

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,020
You're talking about a Madison
Square Garden? No, last November.

21
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,820
Was that a year ago already? Yeah,
it was. Who was the, uh, shit,

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,570
the no longer Toyota comedy festival.
Oh really? Is it done or it's just,

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,860
isn't it just in New
York, New York? No. Yeah.

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,780
Do you remember how many years
when we were in New York?

25
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,570
I came to New York and
like 95 I believe in, uh,

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,640
just a couple of years after me. I started
out here and then went back there. Oh,

27
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:26,971
okay.

28
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:31,290
And we did like what we did like maybe
four or 5,000 shows together or something

29
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,920
like that.
I literally sat down one time,

30
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,700
and this is 15 years ago now, or
maybe like 12, somewhere in there.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,760
And I tried to sort of have,
you know,

32
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,790
add up some idea of how many
standup shows I had done.

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,230
What did you think I came up with
10,000. Yeah, that was, you know,

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,180
at least 10 years ago.
Probably more.

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,530
And you count a show is
every time you go on. Yeah.

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,170
Just and he said I did anywhere.

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,840
That's fair because anytime you go up
God knows what the fuck is happening and

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,600
it doesn't matter if it's
for five minutes. Yeah.

39
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:04,860
Somebody can still have plenty of time if
you kept something thrown at you. Um, I,

40
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,140
you know something, I remember I kept
count until about like 26 to 30 maybe,

41
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:11,250
and then I just lost it.

42
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,070
But I remember you got to keep a
track of how many you had done.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,710
I probably did too. I don't even
remember it, but I probably did too.

44
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,640
I was always jealous of people
that did that cause I'm sorta like,

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,920
like I like I hate stats and like
trying to figure out what people,

46
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:25,980
where people are socially. But I
loved them in sports because they're,

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,970
they're like, they're kind of fact as
far as like how many home runs you hit,

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,500
you know, that's like a ladder to it
gives you some something to go up against.

49
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,810
Yeah. But the, I don't buy into
the bullshit like you know,

50
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:40,050
do all we're doing when it's raining
out and we'll bubble with what that when

51
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:43,200
you get to that shit, like I'm more into
the how many yards did this guy throw?

52
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:45,570
Four. How many of you run in
or whatever. Stuff like that.

53
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,710
Not in specific situations. They do break
it down a little too far. You're like,

54
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,960
what the fuck? It's the, the reason,

55
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:56,490
cause we have like nine 19 maybe 24 hour
sports networks plus Internet plus shit

56
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,080
heads like me and all that.
If the whole thing,

57
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,290
it's just way too much information and a,
what I was trying to get to was,

58
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,770
do you remember when the Toyota
Comedy Festival first came around?

59
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,930
It was the funniest shit ever.
It was just this,

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,910
they would say that it was the festival.

61
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,820
There was like nobody I ever
met that was connected with it.

62
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,620
They would just hang a banner. It was
just a banner at the regular clubs. Yeah,

63
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,820
and it was all the same
regular performers.

64
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:22,690
There was no industry and it would just
be, let them have SD would leave on this.

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,920
We can do, you have the
Toyota comedy festival and we
have Ben Bailey, Bill Baer,

66
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:30,280
Godfrey who was all the same fucking
people except it was a banner we used to

67
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,120
have.
It took us like,

68
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,910
we were all so excited cause we had
nothing going on in our careers.

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,590
We were like,
oh I'm part of the festival.

70
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,500
And it took about three years before
somebody finally just said, you know what?

71
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,280
What is this shit beyond the volt?
This is every,

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,150
this is a regular Wednesday. Right. And
somehow though that and morphed into a,

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,480
an actual festival into the New York
comedy festival, which is, I think,

74
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,840
you know, there's a lot of festivals, you
know, out there, but like New York City,

75
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,830
you've got to have a big comedy
festival. I think so. I think it's great.

76
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,690
I was actually, I had been
a part of it really. Uh,

77
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,420
but I'm supposed to be next year lays
the groundwork for the first nine years

78
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,840
when it was just the banner.
That's right.

79
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,660
That was a part of it for the first nine
and then they started booking people

80
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,840
and I missed the cut or some shit.
I don't know. Yeah. You and me both

81
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,300
the New York underground comedy festival,
I don't think I was a part of it.

82
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm sure I submitted a VHS tape to it.

83
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,780
The joke was that it was so underground
that literally no one knew about it.

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,830
Was it down at like surf reality?
It was the same thing. It was like,

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,550
it was like a banner ad, a couple
of clubs, you know, and some guys,

86
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,250
some guy had a bunch of money.
He was like, I'm going to
have a festival, you know,

87
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,370
that's a great way in from La and stuff.
And these guys would come in,

88
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,320
they're like, Yo, we're here for the
festival and we're all like, Whoa,

89
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,310
what are you talking about?
I'm sure we greeted them warmly.

90
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,630
Fucking assholes.
Well the last time,

91
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,160
well I guess sort of meandering my way
towards was that Toyota comedy festival

92
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,840
then morphed into the New York comedy
festival and that's what that they, uh,

93
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,890
Msg Gig was last year. And as I mentioned,
as I mentioned to you guys, you know,

94
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:10,780
obviously that was a nerve wracking
gig and um, I just, you know,

95
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,300
I don't,
I can't remember how the fuck came about.

96
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:15,460
Probably from doing the goddamn comedy
jam or whatever. I was like, uh, I,

97
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,180
I've asked my agent, I was like, hey
wait, we paid to rent that thing all day.

98
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,014
Right.

99
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,710
And considering 90% of the money is going
to go right back to renting that giant

100
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:27,490
fucking place. I go, yeah. I said,
can I like rent a drum kit first?

101
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,730
I was just going to run a drum kit
and just jam with my, you know, my,

102
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,690
my music by myself. Typical comedian,
totally isolated, but because of Josh,

103
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:37,600
Adam Meyers in the goddamn comedy
jam, so like the people, they're like,

104
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:41,070
we're going to be in town.
So I rented all this gear and um,

105
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,860
there was this running thing with me
and Ben were for about eight years.

106
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,630
We were trying to get together
and play music. You play drums.

107
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,960
I play guitar and we're going to
get together every fucking time.

108
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,620
He'd come out here to la and it's like
he's running around, he's got meetings,

109
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,580
he couldn't fucking make it.
And then I get to New York and he,

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,270
you're out in Jersey and that's just
when you don't have a fucking car.

111
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:04,860
It's like, oh my God, what a, I'm
going to get on the path train to,

112
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:07,040
we'll fucking anybody
to come out gypsy cab.

113
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,610
So finally like we're just like,
um,

114
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,990
I had come to town and we were going
to jam and then that's when I, I,

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,540
we finally solidified it and I was
going to drive out to your place so,

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,760
and you are all excited cause you, you've
made it built and everything. I'm like,

117
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,100
oh we're finally going to play
in it and he's all amped up.

118
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,860
Tell me how great his fucking studio is.
And I was like, ah, I don't know man.

119
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:32,440
I think I got a better place.
And you're like, I got a
better place. I'm like, yeah,

120
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,290
what the fuck? And I just said,
I tend to give you the idea.

121
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:40,730
I think I told you it was MSG. I finally,
I wrote back where like that was like,

122
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,450
it must be someplace good.
Yeah.

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,870
He's not just slamming my home studio
that I built without having seen it yet.

124
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,870
It must have some good fucking venue
and then I know you cause up MSG.

125
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,150
Monosodium glutamate

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,200
can be fucking Madison Square Garden Man.

127
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,420
That I knew when I said
I have a better place.

128
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,750
Your next text was going to come back
in all capitals because Ben doesn't take

129
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,740
any shit from anybody and he's actually
big enough to beat the fuck out of me

130
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:09,470
and about 20 other people. So He's, what
the fuck? I totally insulted a studio.

131
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,750
So when he hit me in a better place.
Yeah. So we ended up coming down and um,

132
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,410
as I mentioned before, is that my phone
APP, Jesus Christ. Bill, can you feel,

133
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,750
it just makes it real.
It makes it real to the listeners.

134
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,330
People feel like they're actually in
the studio witnessing how unprofessional

135
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:33,110
this is. How many of them like
jumped up and looked around? I know,

136
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:36,270
cause I do have, when the phone rings
they're like, Oh, it's, oh no, that's,

137
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,310
that's the standard one.

138
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,780
Like if you ever hiding in the closet and
there's a serial killer walking around,

139
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,640
there's a chance when your phone rings,

140
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,340
he won't know what shoe
he'll think it's him.

141
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:49,620
He gets his phone for a second and maybe
you can drop on them, run out money.

142
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,810
When he goes to look at it, you fucking
smother them with your pj's. Oh,

143
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:58,370
it's a great scene in a film right there.
Oh, there you go. It's killer checks,

144
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,180
his own phone. He's like, God dammit.
Yeah. Could you want to do life,

145
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,090
be professional speaking
to play in music is,

146
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:07,220
I have like the hearing
damage that I have,

147
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,040
which is inevitable if you play or you
do this fucking rate of the hearing

148
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,710
damage that I have is I
actually got my hearing checked.

149
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:16,280
Like I still can hear everything but I
have a little bit of displacement as to

150
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,000
where it is.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,690
Like it'll be to the right and I start
going to the left and my wife just for

152
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,660
stigma and just laughs at me.
Yeah.

153
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,390
And as long as it stays of disappointing
is from doing stand up and like playing

154
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:29,450
music and yeah,
having these things I know.

155
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,990
Oop from our opie and Anthony says my
ears are shot because what happens is it

156
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:36,170
is your ears get tired and you know,
you keep turning up and turn it up.

157
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,830
It's all about the
duration. All right. Yeah.

158
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,450
You guys do like four hours a day
and I try to be conscious of it,

159
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:44,000
but like I fucked my years up in the 80s.

160
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
One of my ears I got that Tinnitus
just rings it a real low level.

161
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,320
Well if I'm really hung over,
but I mean I don't have like,

162
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,980
like to the Pete Townsend level,
but uh, so anyways, getting back to,

163
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,950
so at Johnson right, he had to
quit. I know there was a DC right,

164
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,810
but not from the music. From race.
Car driving was just like what? Oh,

165
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,930
is that what it is from? Yeah, that's what
they said. It wasn't, you know, he's in,

166
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,010
it has been an ACDC all these years.
Like the loudest fuck band. But no,

167
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,500
that's not why his ears or damaged.
It's from driving race cars.

168
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,590
One of my first times I really fucked
my ears up as I saw them on the, uh,

169
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,300
what was it? The heat secret
tour. Oh No, I saw him.

170
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,080
I saw him at the Boston Garden. Nice.
I think Cinderella opened and, no, no,

171
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:28,800
I saw him down in Providence.
Was it different tour? I
saw them a bunch of times.

172
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,990
Who made, who heat seek her
out during that whole period?

173
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,340
I used to go see him and,
uh, I didn't have earplugs.

174
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,870
And as loud as that was the
fucking dude driving home,

175
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,200
he had the fucking thing turned
all the way up to fucking 10.

176
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,740
I remember just like sitting in the back
just taking it rather than asking him,

177
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:46,620
Hey, can you turn that down
yet? You're making all of it.

178
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,610
I had like the German Irish, just
like, yeah, don't complain, complain,

179
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,530
suffer in silence. It'll,
it'll be over soon. So anyway,

180
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:56,400
when you're in the back of a car and
the guy's driving like a fucking maniac,

181
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,490
and I'm, I'm like being
polite. Yeah. I'm like,

182
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't want to offend him by
asking him to slow down or whatever.

183
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,250
I'd rather just risk my own death.
Hey,

184
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,390
not trying to be that guy that's trying
to be that guy, but, uh, I'd like to live.

185
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,870
I'd like to survive this ride. I don't
want to be in a halo at the end of this.

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,160
But anyway, so we finally ended up
getting to play at Madison Square Garden,

187
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,130
which I think it was worth
the fucking wait. That was,

188
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,870
that was our Chinese democracy.
And Dude, I gotta tell you, man,

189
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,890
I wouldn't change a thing. You fucking
can play. Oh, you can really play a man.

190
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,410
I was really like, you're telling
me it was crazy and I got to,

191
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:32,190
I got to show that to a, you know, a
bunch of people. When I got to do a,

192
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:36,330
the tonight show, I showed it
to a quest and Fallon and stuff.

193
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,730
I think I showed you. I showed it to
them and they were just like, wow, man,

194
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,320
you should've given us,
you know, Jimmy's all,

195
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:42,330
he should have given us the video we
would have played. It was just like,

196
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,340
all right, dude, it's not that good.
Quite on that level I'd like to have.

197
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,300
It's so fun, Dude. It really was.

198
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,100
It really wasn't just going off and
surreal day. Yeah. And I hit my, my, uh,

199
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,460
then every, every so many people play
too. Like my, my agent went up and played.

200
00:10:56,461 --> 00:11:00,240
He almost didn't go. I had to twist
his arm. Yeah. Yeah, go up there.

201
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,450
I helped it drag him up there.
I was like, come on dude. Well,

202
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,080
little wing or Michael O'Brien that he
fucking ran up. I was like, Hey Mike,

203
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:11,140
you want to, and he just ran right
up. He was great too, man. So, um,

204
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,660
that was a fucking great day dude.

205
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,620
And your show is awesome and I didn't
know anything aboutF is for family before

206
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:20,280
that night. Oh, you guys
played the preview of it.

207
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,380
That was the first time when
she was like, Holy Shit, man,

208
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,170
this is going to be awesome. I
didn't even know. Yeah, great.

209
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,690
Well we've got another, uh, 10 episodes
of that coming out, but we're here.

210
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,100
We're here to, uh, promote your stuff.
Let's start with your website. Um,

211
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,170
the Real Ben bailey.com that's you're
relaunching your website or you just,

212
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,610
I'm relaunching it. It's been kind of
just, you know, very basic for a log time.

213
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:42,510
And I was like,
you know what,

214
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,170
it's time to just start making my own
stuff and putting it out directly to

215
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,320
people. Cause there's no reason
to go and try and sell, you know,

216
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,260
like there's two short films on there,
uh, that I made that I really love.

217
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,930
What's the one would Judah
Freelander that you made a while ago?

218
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,950
I'm dying to see that. It's funny. It's
a, it's called meet me at res. Right.

219
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:04,951
And we made it like way back in
like 2002 or something or 2003.

220
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,050
And then we're crazy busy after that and
it just sat there and I just looked at

221
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:12,940
him like,
I got to put this thing out.

222
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,170
So it's just about two idiots meeting
up for pizza at Ray's pizza in New York,

223
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,120
you know, but there's, there's
a lot of rays, pizzas, dude,

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,250
you got a little busy at 14 years later.
It's one of the gate newsletter.

225
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm like, all right, let's put
this thing out. And then, uh,

226
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,020
well what happened during those
14 years? It was, you know,

227
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,420
he'd started doing all the movies.
You did the cash cab thing.

228
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,650
That was so cool watching you
guys like a blowing up. Like,

229
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:38,410
I felt like our generation
kind of had like an even thing.

230
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,330
It was just like nobody knew who we were.

231
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,090
And then all of a sudden like everybody
started like just got some inroads.

232
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,100
I don't know what happened. Yeah. He
felt like you were all going nowhere,

233
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,151
you know?
I mean,

234
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:53,110
Jude and I used to sit in his minivan
at the end of Knights of standup in New

235
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,790
York. It'd be like, man, this
brutal. We've got nothing.
We've got nothing going on.

236
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,690
You know,
dude,

237
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,860
I remember being in New York and then
boom and I moved back from La the first

238
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:06,940
time I was out here and I had a,
I lost my booking agent,

239
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,180
I had known manager, I know agent and
I was incorporated as a business and I,

240
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,420
it was costing me too much money.

241
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:17,890
I got unincorporated instead of paying
to be incorporated because I wasn't

242
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:18,580
making any money.

243
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,580
And I went all the way back to square
one and I was living in that walkthrough

244
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,210
bedroom apartment with the guy who,

245
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,560
who was on the lease and it was me
and Bobby Kelly. We had a lot of fun,

246
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:31,750
but there was definitely nights.

247
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,650
It's probably good that I was living with
Bobby cause we'd laugh until, you know,

248
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,390
you know, the late night
and then I man take it easy.

249
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,610
But if I had to go home and
just be with my own thoughts,

250
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,970
that happened that after he moved out
and then I moved out and then there was

251
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:47,860
that period about 2000 to 2004 where a,
yeah,

252
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:52,090
there was a lot of tastes just waking
up going like, uh, what am I doing?

253
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,890
What the fuck? I mean, dude, I had,

254
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,600
I mean from 2000 2004 I think somewhere
in there I did get a half hour.

255
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,220
Right.
But there was like a thousand spur.

256
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,840
I think I came to your half
hour that comedy central
one? Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

257
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,310
There was like a good three year period
there just being like, okay, 33 years old,

258
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,430
34 years, 35, you know, like fuck, this
was not the plan. Am I going to be like,

259
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,830
thought it was okay.
Yeah, it was. Um, yeah.

260
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,770
And then the whole alt scene
was coming up, you know,

261
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,490
and that whole thing blew up. And then we
would just, the fucking house Casco, he,

262
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:25,870
that was,
that was rough man.

263
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,090
When the alternative comedy club scene
developed and then just became this big

264
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,870
thing. You couldn't drag an industry
person. Yeah. We're just in the,

265
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,950
in the mainstream clubs like oops.
Well yeah you could have no idea,

266
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,300
but I'm not going to move to those places.
Yeah. Who a man that was those who are,

267
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,210
uh hey ted, those are rough ones, you
know? But we used to have changed.

268
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,550
Yeah. So you made that thing
like 15 years ago. What,

269
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
what's this movie that you have coming up?

270
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:54,230
Cause I know you go into the
screening here, which is really cool.

271
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:58,580
This one's called blam badly, badly
written action man. Yeah. Yeah. It's just,

272
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,090
you know, action movies,
the action starts with,

273
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,520
they are badly written
in a manner of speaking.

274
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,670
It's got a lot of quality in those,
but they're,

275
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,640
but they're like one liners are
like at least kind of clever, witty,

276
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,050
and even if they're over the
top off some steam. Totally.

277
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,040
So I was like, I just thought, I
thought of this character one day.

278
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,960
I can't remember what
I was doing and where,

279
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,390
but I just like it be funny if you know,

280
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,060
so much of those movies now
are built around those lines.

281
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,440
If when you finally get to the, you know,
one of those lines, it's just awful.

282
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,470
Just no pay off. Yeah. It's just
no pay off at all. You know,

283
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,640
which is like an anti pay off really.
So it's kind of a crazy concept,

284
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:41,060
but it just sort of fell together like,
and how long are these movies?

285
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,470
They're both about 10 minutes.

286
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,050
And this is like the type of stuff you're
going to start putting on the real Ben

287
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:48,930
bailey.com just making, yeah, I think
that's a smart idea because those,

288
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,340
those shorts and get psyched about it,
they ended up turning it into something.

289
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,510
They turn into movies. And, uh, that's one
thing I've learned about this business.

290
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:59,060
This is just like you, when you make
that decision like it, this feels right.

291
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,490
I'm going to do this. So many
people they do at one, two times.

292
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:05,100
And when Spielberg of Oprah doesn't
want to interview you as somebody to,

293
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,990
you're like, well fuck this business
tried. You just got to keep going.

294
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,220
Cause then when one of them hits,

295
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:14,000
then they go back to your whole library
and you got all of that stuff and

296
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:16,620
they'll something we'll uh,
will turn into it. But, um,

297
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,650
I hope you're worried about that dude.
Hey,

298
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:21,800
how long have you been a lot into them?
Boy is about 10 minutes and it's,

299
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,890
and it's, uh, it's badly
written action man,

300
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,140
which was originally badly
written action star. Right?

301
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,560
And in Lenny Marcus and I
were working on writing,

302
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,970
throwing around ideas about it,

303
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,690
and he was abbreviating it when he
wrote back to B was Blas or whatever.

304
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,100
Right? And that may be
going like, oh, maybe,

305
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,310
maybe there's something in the acronym.
Right? And then I was like, Oh,

306
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,620
if I make it barely written action,
man,

307
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,700
then that's blam and that's like
a badly written sound effect.

308
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,770
Oh yeah. Know what I mean? It's like,
hey, did you just kind of fell together?

309
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,990
You know when you feel like
something's working. Yeah.

310
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,640
I had all these ideas and that one went,

311
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,340
isn't that little stuff like that just
moved to the front, so I just made it.

312
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,880
When did you shoot that one? Uh, in
July. Oh, cool. Well there you go.

313
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:07,520
Now you've really stepped it up.
One took you 12 years.

314
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:11,390
This one took about 12 weeks. Yeah,
you're totally right. It's on a tear now.

315
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,380
Jesus Christ. But it's cool. DC Benny's
in it and I love to, he's a guy.

316
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,120
He's a great actor. He's so
good in this. He's so fun.

317
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,810
He's the evil villain and in boy,
Oh man,

318
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,780
I'm going to watch this and this is going
to be on a, it's in it. Vecchione is in,

319
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:30,890
it is a riot.
Masavia us in it savvy and Korea.

320
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,390
Dude, he'd be a perfect
instrument. So yeah,

321
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,930
I'm a Salvia. How we know him. He used
to run the old Boston Comedy Club,

322
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:42,500
which is now you'd fucking,
it was a wine tasting or a wine bar.

323
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,110
It's a wine bar yet.
I walked in there one night just,

324
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:49,160
I had to go in and look at it
and there was all these people,

325
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,190
their twenties you know,

326
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:53,040
prime of their fucking life like we
used to be and I just was going like,

327
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,630
they're like,
can I help you sir?

328
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,680
And I was just like this old man
comedy club and they were like, really?

329
00:17:58,681 --> 00:17:59,700
And I was like, yeah, go.

330
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,650
I watched like a 20 year old Dave
Chappelle right where that to top is.

331
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,460
And that was at first they didn't
give a fuck till I dropped him.

332
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,780
He your pill and they're like,
really? I'm going to complete it.

333
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,560
And I was like all offended. Like how come
you don't know what's important to me?

334
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,700
Totally. I know that feeling. Yeah. It's
just like, well cause we moved on old man,

335
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,930
now I would like Amarillo
or get the fuck out of here.

336
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,190
I'm fucking leaving.
I don't do downstairs of that places now.

337
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:30,810
The zinc bar was used to be called
the beacon cafe. Used to be the,

338
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:34,290
the bag it in the bag in it and we
used to drink in their permit card.

339
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,330
I remember that kid with the glasses,
the kid on the guitar,

340
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:40,890
he come down a fucking like whale like
every Monday night. Colker Holy Shit.

341
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:44,020
That guy gave it coker. Yeah, I've
still been in touch with him, man. He,

342
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,060
we did a SAR for my last special coker
and I wrote a song and did it and play it

343
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:51,750
at the end tack yet cash cab
blues is silly like you know,

344
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:55,050
cash cab blues tune. Right.
Cause I loved poker so much.

345
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,690
He's such a great musician. He really, how
long have you been playing, by the way?

346
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,380
Uh, since I was 12. Yeah, you
can count 12 years old. I,

347
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,150
I uh, the guy that lived behind this
English family moved in behind us.

348
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,040
This is eight weeks and the old deal,
this guy,

349
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,970
the oldest son.
Hello show yard.

350
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,950
It's just your garden. I want a
guy. No, I was talking about that.

351
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,400
My last podcast, like every
fucking ingredients. Spice
they we say differently.

352
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,340
Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot
of little basil, Oregano,

353
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,140
Basil to my girlfriend. You've met
my girl, right? She's Australian.

354
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,510
I have a new bit around one
of those little things that,
uh, that still come up,

355
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,490
these little differences between how they
speak and how we speak. And she said,

356
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,870
uh, talking about my daughter
going horse riding, right.

357
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,880
Am like horse riding.
We say horseback riding.

358
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,060
And then I'm like, why
do we specify? Yeah.

359
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,060
Horse-Riding actually
makes a lot more sense.

360
00:19:57,061 --> 00:20:00,750
They kind of get until he ever ride on
one part of the horse horseback riding.

361
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,200
But she just said horse
riding, get off. It's neck.

362
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,140
Horseneck so I had this
whole bit about it,

363
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,510
but there's so many little things
like that, but, so he's British.

364
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,830
He's British family moves in behind us.
The oldest brother is like, I'm like,

365
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,510
I'm 11. What are the names again? The
Sedgwick's I just want to hear you say,

366
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,520
and through Sedgwick,
Joan's centric

367
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,240
loyalty is with the urgency
of that accident is just
fucking tremendous. I would,

368
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:30,390
let's not fair. Is it the, there's
so much graphic toss. Yeah,

369
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,050
that comes with that accent. It's just
we can't sound so fucking important.

370
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:37,550
Everything. Yeah. So
sorry. No, that's fine too.

371
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,720
So the oldest brother is like 25
or 26 and he's a sound engineer.

372
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,480
So he's got a studio in their attic.

373
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:49,210
He builds a studio in their attic and he's
on doing sound mixing for some albums,

374
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:51,040
like so pretty big stuff like that.
What was his name?

375
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,960
His name was Andrew Sedgwick.

376
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,230
Still is as far as I know,

377
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,440
but so I would go over there and
annoy the shit out of this guy.

378
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,320
It was just a little kid who I was so
curious about it all his equipment and

379
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:06,940
stuff, his studio and everything that he
got fed up with me asking them a zillion

380
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:10,780
questions and he just put a guitar
in my hand here, play with this.

381
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,370
So I started playing with it and you know,
six months later I bought it.

382
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:19,790
I saved up my, my paper route
and I bought his, uh, oh,

383
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:23,080
you gotta paperwork too?
Yeah, yeah. Oh, you say rod. I
say, Bro, look at that route.

384
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:28,000
Route paper. Wait, which one did I say?
You said Ralph? I thought rob was Midwest.

385
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,750
I don't know. We'll see. I have a little
Midwest. I lived in Michigan when I was,

386
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,150
when I was little,
so I have this weird mix of accents.

387
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,720
They lived in the south too,
so I kind of do now. My Dad,

388
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,640
oh, he's a hit man. He's a killer.

389
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,690
So how many times were you a
the new kid in school? Uh, for,

390
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,440
I did it three times. It's
brutal. Fucking brutal. Right?

391
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,050
I still remember the kids
that were nice to me. Yeah.

392
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,170
I still remember when I
moved the last time we moved.

393
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,360
Oh maybe the second time this kid Keith
Hannon, the first recess goes, hey man,

394
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,850
you want to play catch?
And he had a tennis ball and you're like,

395
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:07,510
and I was just like, oh thank
God. Cause he wasn't bad enough.

396
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,470
It was bad enough coming in like we
were like 40 we moved to the town and we

397
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,430
were like four days a week.

398
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,020
It was already four days in
the school year, right? Yeah.

399
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,570
Then we came and I had a very similar
thing man and how they bring you in and

400
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,720
he's like, you don't just shit.
Like I didn't just show up.

401
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,880
I didn't get on the bus
or anything like that.

402
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:27,700
Like we went down to the principal's
office because we were late and everything

403
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:28,534
and they were like,
all right.

404
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,320
And they just walked us down and she just
came walking in and going, okay class.

405
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,580
We have a new student.

406
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:38,581
They're all looking at me like I kind
of like a energy my way through the last

407
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,380
one I hung my coat up like, hey, how
are you? I've made a lot of noise.

408
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,680
I went over and I sat down and
then that's why I just sat down.

409
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,860
I felt like cost my desk. I felt it was
like right in the middle of the class.

410
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,900
I just felt everybody glancing me,
I was like,

411
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,140
I have to sit down with my
fucking orange hair. Like I know,

412
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,360
I know I don't like it either.
Fuck off.

413
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,940
So it's brutal. Being the new
kid is fucking hard. I was Paul,

414
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,080
like I was a big Kid Kinda at that
age in high school I wasn't that big.

415
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,960
Everyone sort of caught up with
me and then I drew again later.

416
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,270
But when I was in fourth grade,
I was one of the bigger kids.

417
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,960
So it seems like it'd be great.
But no,

418
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,710
all the kids who were the bigger guys
want, I had to like fight them. Yeah.

419
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:20,350
I had a fight my way through
first day of school. They were,

420
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,590
people were choosing who I had to fight
on the fucking playground. I'm like,

421
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:27,370
this is not lost. I always
lost. I fought this kid.

422
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:31,230
I remember I thought this kid,
this is sorta Kinda when I look up,

423
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,060
but like it was sort of racist
the way the teacher handled it.

424
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,880
He was the only black kid and
for some reason we fought.

425
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,150
We fought like five recesses in the
road. He kept kicking my ass. Finally.

426
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,070
I remember I was starting to win it.

427
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:45,650
He had these fucking work boots on and
then you just went like Bam, Bam, Bam,

428
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,710
like three times in my shin. I
was like, well I started crying.

429
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,640
I was just sitting there crying.
I remember she fucking,

430
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,980
as we used to say back then,

431
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,260
balled him out is what do we
successfully getting yelled at?

432
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,380
Yelled at him and then came on
and I was sitting there crying.

433
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:01,940
She came home and she like rubbed my head.

434
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,150
She even thought so you
just got away with it.

435
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,150
It's kind of like maybe cause you
lost cause that was so pathetic.

436
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:11,750
Or maybe I just looked like a little,
a little beat up Ron Howard.

437
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:15,470
I don't know what Ralph Malphurs
something ginger. Yeah, she was,

438
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,060
I actually thought about later
like why was she comforting me?

439
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,970
We both got into it every fucking recess.

440
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,300
I was clearly not like trying
innocent too to get away from the kid.

441
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:31,040
I didn't even know why we will fight
neither cause then we ended up being like

442
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,870
friends.
It was just like that little kid shit.

443
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,560
And I still remember somehow I slipped
and fell and when I did during the fight.

444
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,380
Yeah. And then he had this work
boots. I think he fell down to,

445
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,910
maybe we just work with the heel of
his boot tongue sticking out, you know,

446
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,100
little kids when they're really
trying to make an effort. That was it.

447
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,810
Crying
cry.

448
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,680
Even if I won the fights when I was a kid.
Oh cause just the emotion.

449
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,940
I always tell him I was
at a birthday party,

450
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:08,750
we were playing street hockey and this
one kid who played hockey was like really

451
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:08,961
good.

452
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:12,440
He kept lifting my stick and kept taking
the puck and he was like fucking twice

453
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:15,920
my height. I got stuck in your
stickup. Yeah. And I got so mad.

454
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:18,350
I turned around and I just
started fighting him and he just,

455
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,870
he just kind of like,
he like leaned back and kind of like,

456
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,990
let me fucking get like three,
four in like missing Kinda.

457
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,730
And then he just went blam and fast
glass to me in the side of the head and I

458
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:29,511
fell down.

459
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:34,511
I started crying and I walked away and
I just remember screaming the top of my

460
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,150
lungs and I was walk.

461
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:40,010
Cause I used to cut through the woods
and people were yelling from the party to

462
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:43,280
get to school. No know I cut to the
woods to get to my friend's house.

463
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,600
Where were you before?
We played street hockey.

464
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:49,600
So I was already into the woods and
people were screaming guy, come on up,

465
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,310
I'll come back. And I was in the
middle of was very sound going. Fuck.

466
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,620
I think his mother yelled at one time
and I just went home in the woods alone.

467
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,810
And this is the maturity of the other kid.
This is no,

468
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,280
just see a walking through the trail.
Yeah.

469
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,690
Head was always such a real
moment. Yeah, no, look,

470
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,810
I lived the same thing.

471
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,940
And what was funny was I came home and
I told my mother what happened and um,

472
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,690
it never dawned on her to call over there
to drive me all that, all that overly,

473
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,160
just getting involved with Shit,

474
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:24,590
parenting that people have
done it over the last,

475
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:27,980
like whatever since we were kids.
She just was like, all right,

476
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,060
when you get home, yeah, well you
know, I have things to do or whatever.

477
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:34,190
And then that was kind of it.
And I remember the next day,

478
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:38,840
the maturity of the other kid
was, um, when we were on the bus,

479
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:42,050
I was like ignoring them and stuff and
he just kind of yelled at, you know,

480
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,220
everybody stands up. He waiting to
get off the bus, he yell, hey bill,

481
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:46,640
let me talk to you. Uh, when we get
off the bus. And I was like, oh,

482
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,560
we got off the bus. That's cool.
Yeah. This is his fifth grade.

483
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,660
He really just goes like, yeah, sorry
about that. I was that guy, man.

484
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,540
And it was fun. Yeah. I should
have learned that lesson,

485
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,130
but I didn't cause the fuck that kid.

486
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,570
No, I should say his name.
You remember his name? Yeah.

487
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,550
I don't want to say everybody's,

488
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:04,740
and I probably shouldn't say that because
people get all weird and she's still

489
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,100
rather actually real people who are still
alive. Yeah. His first name was Tom.

490
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:11,280
Put it that way. It's a tall
fucking dude, dude. Dude.

491
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:15,030
I was way out of my
fucking way class and he,

492
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,060
and even even the ass kicking
was a gentlemanly as kicking.

493
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:22,830
He just gave me one shut the fuck up
to sit down. Quiet little kid. Yeah.

494
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,090
There was no reason for me to fight you.

495
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:27,270
I was just mad because he was better than
me. It was just, it was really immature.

496
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,900
Even for that age, I'm still ashamed
of myself. So, um, so anyway,

497
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,510
so this guy ended up giving
you a good time. That's for me.

498
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:36,170
That's really fucking cool
car. Yeah, it was so cool. Uh,

499
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,210
I guess she had the
paperwork. I got it. Well,

500
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,760
I mean I could go over there and play it
whenever, but at some point I was like,

501
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm going to save up and buy it. I think
I bought it for like 75 bucks. Did He, uh,

502
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:50,130
he teach you any codes or anything or
was he no, no, he just left me to it,

503
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:52,340
you know, but then I like my girl, uh,

504
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,750
my sister's boyfriend was a guitar player
and he was quite a bit older and like,

505
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,320
so he showed me some stuff. And
pretty soon I was like, you know,

506
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,570
I knew I could figure out some songs.
I always had a decent ear.

507
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:05,890
I could pick stuff out and find it.
But that was the only, that was,

508
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,650
unless you had the money to take lessons,

509
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:10,700
that was the only way to learn back then.
That was it. I felt like lessons, no,

510
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,100
you know, like kids today, the shit
that they could see on youtube,

511
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:18,930
someone will just totally break that thing
down, which is great. Which is great.

512
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,290
And that's why there's so many
monster players out there. But like,

513
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,750
I would suggest if, you know,
as they start to show it,

514
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:27,810
to sort of turn your back to the screen
and see if you can just listen to what

515
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:30,890
he's doing. And it just, just so you'll
always develop in Europe because I,

516
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,340
I wouldn't want to be that guy. Like, you
know, couldn't figure it out. Like, yeah.

517
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:40,290
Well that's like literally in and out.
Yeah. You know, but I also think that, uh,

518
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,300
maybe one sort of downfall of all of
everything being out there for anybody to

519
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,980
learn is you don't develop
your own style of guitar, like,

520
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,490
or whatever it is, right?
Like I play guitar differently
than most people, I think,

521
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:57,150
because no one ever really taught me
how to play, I just started playing it.

522
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,250
Right. So I have little, little things
that I do that are probably unique to me.

523
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:04,770
At least. I hope they are right.
It's a technique that would be like,

524
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:08,100
actually that's a, and that's
wrong. You're holding your
hand wrong or, you know,

525
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,740
you should always still sounds good. But
yeah, they were like, well, but it's,

526
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:15,320
this is what I do. So, you
know, but I think music is like
that, you know, it's, it's,

527
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,140
it's your expression, whatever, whatever
you do, that's what you do. So yeah,

528
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,160
it's definitely a,
it's kind of a great thing for it.

529
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,250
And it's also a weird thing because then
I, I definitely, there's always like,

530
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,720
then there's like the top
like fucking, uh, it's just,

531
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,490
I feel like everybody's influenced now is
whatever subject it is, the first page,

532
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,170
the first three links, right. Becomes
like 90% of people's like consciousness.

533
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:43,320
Because if you look at, I should
probably, cause I even do that,

534
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:46,390
she probably don't want to go on Youtube
next time I go to look something up to

535
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:49,120
try, just click to like, boy,
what the fuck is on page three.

536
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,320
Like I want to get into the
age of 99. What the hell's
on their underground? Yeah.

537
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,460
There's 100,000 pages to
look at most things. Right.

538
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:03,070
100,000 hits on how to
play. You know, I played,

539
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,910
I played right before I came over here.
I'm doing another one of those, uh,

540
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,400
the goddamn comedy jam. So I
have another song. I got it.

541
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,470
I got to try to get together,
which is song or you can't say,

542
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,700
I don't want to ruin it cause it's,

543
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,520
cause it's part of the show when
they get there. But it's a, you know,

544
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:19,210
I always stay pretty much, you
know, seventies and eighties.

545
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,450
I dress up like the drummer
that I'm going to tell.

546
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:25,270
It's just completely ridiculous.
Yeah. Cause it's a want to do,

547
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,770
I want to do one of those with those guys.

548
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,200
I gotta I gotta connect with
them cause they were like,

549
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:31,660
you should do and when you come out
next, but now it's been a year. Yeah.

550
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:33,980
You'd kill it. That'd be so
fun. Dude. I wonder if the,

551
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,520
I don't know if Josh and those
guys came up for the, uh,

552
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,140
the Toyota and now New York comedy
festival. I think they were there.

553
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,860
I think they were in New York for that
dude. I have so much fun with those guys.

554
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,800
And one year I did Montreal
comedy festival just to come in.

555
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:51,250
I played with those guys three nights in
a row. Oh, it's just to do it. And then I,

556
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:55,270
then I did a standup show, but like the
reason I was there was to do the music.

557
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,780
Yeah. Because I played, dude,

558
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,750
I played full fucking like 20
years by myself. Like it was so,

559
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:04,540
uh, two same thing man.
But it was such like a, um,

560
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,490
like a kind of thing of like why I ended
up becoming a comedian because I was so

561
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:11,350
introverted and like it,

562
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,040
like it didn't dawn on me until like the
mid two thousands I started playing in

563
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,780
the 80s. That was just like, hey,

564
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:21,781
kind of the reason for playing is to
interact with other human retain yet to

565
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:25,390
share it with people.
Yeah. Yeah. And then, uh,

566
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,100
thank God that that show came around
than the first time I got to like, well,

567
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,610
I sat in with a few other people, but the
first time I actually kind of came out,

568
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,390
people knew who fuck I wasn't had sit
down and was, it was a really like,

569
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,770
was such a fun thing.

570
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,770
So I'm playing music live is like
different than stand up obviously,

571
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:45,970
but it's so great.
But I think it's just love it man.

572
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,290
It's your fun for us too because we're
not in a band and we don't have to deal

573
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:54,820
with that because I know that uh, guys
have met, there are actually in bands.

574
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,010
It's like the big thing is
how to keep it fun and B,

575
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,160
when it starts becoming a job, like you've
talked with other Comedians, you know,

576
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:03,280
when you told with ca means you're
going to have the substance abuse guy.

577
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:07,210
You got the Pussy Hound,
the late guy, the EGOMANIAC.

578
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,130
Those are all the same guy.
Yeah, that's all Tony Woods,

579
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,210
isn't it? Some tiny.

580
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,880
Tell him I'd have a couple of, we
all have a couple of lows. I'm one,

581
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm a one or two of those guys
from time to time. But yeah,

582
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:26,290
I mean what two are you, would you say
I'm late and uh, what were the other ones?

583
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,090
Substance Abuse. Uh, EGOMANIAC pussy out.

584
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,890
I would say I am,
uh,

585
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:38,110
I'm definitely late and maybe at the
talks of substance abuse, substance abuse,

586
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:41,240
Guy Cigars, drinking. I can you,

587
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,580
I don't know if this makes
me a fucked up or anything,

588
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:47,870
but like I know I could shut it off
anytime I want to. I just don't want to,

589
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,110
what do you mean to the drinking or the,
and he's like, yeah, I could go. I did it.

590
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,690
I did you, I know you went
a few years. I want to like,

591
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,430
I did like a year and some change.
You know, you're in a couple of days.

592
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,290
I was just like,
I just,

593
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,240
I missed it but it's that something
get like completely like ruins my uh,

594
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,320
ruins my, I'm like, I dunno. I mean I,

595
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,730
I know when to do it.
I do it much,

596
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,740
much more controlled than I used to.

597
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,010
Like when I stopped I stopped cause
I was like, Holy Shit, this is,

598
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,810
I'm out of control here. Oh, all right.

599
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,840
I gotta I gotta is way off and
regain my footing. So, oh yeah.

600
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,480
I think that's the difference between
like maybe addicts and like fucked up

601
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:35,150
people like you and I where it's
just like I can just, I just,

602
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:36,400
when it gets out of control I was like,
hi,

603
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,090
well I'm not going to do that for like a
month, you know, stop for awhile. Yeah.

604
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,540
Although this year, you know, I kept
saying that and it was never a month.

605
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:45,680
It was always like three, four days. I
had a really stressful year this year.

606
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:50,600
Just a lot of stuff. It's
just career stuff. Being busy,

607
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:55,040
being busy, being busy, all my
free time kind of fucking, yeah.

608
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,960
Dissolved and uh, sitting there, you
know, writing on a show, it was just,

609
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:00,471
you come home,

610
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:04,220
your brain is fried and I probably
should have picked a better habit,

611
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,270
but it started to becoming, coming
home and having a whiskey. Right.

612
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:10,350
And then it became two
and then it became three.

613
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:13,250
And then my wife is finally like,
ah, hey, you fucking booze bag.

614
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:17,750
What are you doing? Literally called me
a bully bag and then I, then I, uh, I,

615
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,790
I dialed it back and for
me it's just, it's, it's,

616
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,550
could you like laugh when she'd said
that? Oh God, yeah. You weren't like,

617
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,750
that's good. No, my wife is a lawyer. You
know, you've got all mad and be like, no,

618
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,570
wait a minute. I knew
that I was, I did that.

619
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,990
Now that would have been a bad if that's
your reaction and we need to think

620
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,750
about yes. Standing there and I'm like,
yeah, you're right. I need to rate it in.

621
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,730
Sorry. Then you're done. It's cool. Yeah.

622
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,750
I just had a couple of bottles hidden
behind toilets and shit. That's totally,

623
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,150
that's totally normal. No, I think,

624
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,680
I think everybody kind of needs to have
some little shit that's just there.

625
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:55,130
It's like, or like a little thing
that you keep just for, you know,

626
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:56,270
you have to do it right.
You know what I mean?

627
00:34:56,271 --> 00:35:01,190
Like everybody's got a s maybe some
secret little shit. That's whatever it is.

628
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,430
I saw this guy one time, this old dude.
I'm going to move the mic here. I'm sorry.

629
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:07,310
I got to lean back at some
point. Have bad posture. Um,

630
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,880
I saw this one time I was staying
at this hotel. Right, right.

631
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,230
And there was this old dude
standing there. All right.

632
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,250
And like every night like clockwork,
because I would finish the shows,

633
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:19,510
I'd come home, he'd come walking
out as soon as hotels you could, uh,

634
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,870
he had a little dog or whatever.

635
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,390
Nowadays everything's like a fucking
therapy dog so he can get away with it.

636
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,490
It's a working dog working dealt.
You're not supposed to ask. Yeah,

637
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,000
I asked the guy in the airport, he's
like, you're not supposed to ask about it.

638
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,800
Well, I did. I'm like, you know, well,

639
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,170
if he didn't have a sweater
that said working dog on it,

640
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,090
I wouldn't have fucking
asked. Yeah, what's its job?

641
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,650
What's going to major in
business? So sorry. Um,

642
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,900
every night this guy would come out and
he would eat, take out a little pouch.

643
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,130
It was tobacco by the way.

644
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:47,910
He'd take that out and he would roll his
own cigarette and it was, I just saw it.

645
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,350
It was like, this is this
guy's whole ritual, you know,

646
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,000
sat there and he would only
smoke one and he would just,

647
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,150
he would milk it and he would make it
last for like a half hour and he would

648
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:02,130
just sit out there quietly,
no phone, no IPAD, no nothing.

649
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,500
And um, I remember seeing
that going like, yeah,

650
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,240
I get what that guy's doing and
I wish I had the time to do, uh,

651
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,620
to do a little more
that we just have that,

652
00:36:11,621 --> 00:36:14,610
that I think guys kind of need like
alone time. I don't know how women are.

653
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:17,730
Women are a little more social,
but I agree they probably need it too.

654
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:20,070
I have no idea. I shouldn't
speak for them. I don't know.

655
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,220
My girl seems content to just
be together and you know,

656
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,690
and talk and chat about everything
all the time. And sometimes I'm like,

657
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:30,960
why am I getting all cranky
and fucked up right now?

658
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:35,580
And like I just need to be by myself like
I needed. I definitely need alone time.

659
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,190
I think that's why we've got a
million things going on. You know?

660
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:42,900
We also are these careers or are all
consuming if you let them be right.

661
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,210
Cause we don't have an office,
we don't punch a clock.

662
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,030
We don't show up at one time
and then leave at another.

663
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,140
It's just always going on. Right. You
have ideas, you have creative ideas,

664
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:56,160
you have schedule shit that you're
keeping track of things going on.

665
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:59,610
When I shot my special right on
the 21st of October, I was like,

666
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,900
oh this here just shot a new one. Yep.
All I gotta do is just fucking, you know,

667
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,650
edit that thing. Look at it
a couple times, cause I know
what I want and I'm like,

668
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:10,290
and I'm just fucking done.
Then I'm that time to Christmas shop.

669
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,920
I'm going to fucking put my feet up, play
some drums and blah, blah, blah, blah,

670
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:17,340
blah. I mean, I don't know. I don't know
what's happening. I'm fucking more, uh,

671
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,100
more busy than ever. And it's just
like all of these, uh, I dunno.

672
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,290
I just, I, I don't know anything. What's
going to, it's going to take a wild ride,

673
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,820
but I've been able to do at this
time where I sat through and, um,

674
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,260
I watched the whole fucking thing, which
is something I is, you know, it's brutal.

675
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,890
It's you for a fucking hour
and a half and, and the
longer you watch it, you like,

676
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,920
it's not even funny anymore. Yeah. You
can't pick, you're going to get yet.

677
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,540
It's fuck, oh my God, it's an old bid
or fuck. But every time I go to do one,

678
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:49,260
there's like a major, like I say, you
know, you, you donate a kidney. He just,

679
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,620
there's always a chunk. I'm like,
get that the fuck out of there.

680
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,260
And just go right to the
end and then we're done.

681
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:59,310
And today I figured out what it was
and it went from, uh, you know, well,

682
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,110
I felt a little bit too long to now
being like, oh fuck, it's over already.

683
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,720
Which is that sweet, sweet spot. Yeah,
you don't, you don't want to have it.

684
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,400
Um,
it's,

685
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,930
it's about 77 so that's about an hour,
15 hour in 16. But I mean, it was,

686
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,250
it was getting way,
it was getting,

687
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:20,250
like when they took all the footage
from both shows, it was like,

688
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,990
look at hour 38 and like,
all right, there's no way.

689
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:26,210
So we cut it down and then it was like
one 29 and I'm like, but I like him,

690
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,950
but I liked everything. But I'm
just saying, I think you have to,

691
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:31,950
if you'd like release like a concert
movie, I think it's going to be,

692
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,460
I would think like 90 minutes
if people cannot just, yeah.

693
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,530
And it's meant to be a feature.
Uh, I just feel like Netflix,

694
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:41,110
if you're going to go on there and people
are going to sit down and if you're

695
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,410
lucky enough, if you lucky enough that
are actually going to click on your shit,

696
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,860
it's just like you just gotta like,
you gotta go ACDC on him, you know,

697
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:49,990
where they don't play any balance.

698
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,750
You just got to fucking just
walk right through. Yeah.

699
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,370
Unless you're like Chapelle which
Chappelle has that way where he can,

700
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:00,270
he can just really fucking
like bring it that like,

701
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,400
he like just watching him do that
opening monologue on, on SNL. I mean,

702
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:08,170
just like the level of shit
that he's doing effortlessly,

703
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,560
not even consciously the ups and downs,
peaks and valleys in them,

704
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:14,410
the huge laughs and then the
poignant moments and all of that.

705
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,360
It's just like that that was,
you know,

706
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,350
I'd be happy if I could have done in
an hour and a half. What the fuck?

707
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:25,090
He didn't like eight minutes,
that clinic that he,

708
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:28,660
uh, that he put on. So,
um, yeah, he's nice speech.

709
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,900
Amazing super talented
guy. Man. Always was.

710
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,860
I always was when he was standing where
someone's drinking white Zinfandel right

711
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:40,660
now where the Boston comedy club
is. Hey, so what did you, uh,

712
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,950
um, were you shocked
about the election? Uh,

713
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,990
resort? I wasn't that shocked. Uh, I was,

714
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,410
we finally met somebody who called it.
I knew somebody had to bet Trump.

715
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:57,190
I didn't bet Trump, I didn't want
a bet Trump, but I did a tour.

716
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,230
I was on tour in a lot of
southern states for, you know,

717
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:06,340
the month leading up to the election
and nothing but Trump signs.

718
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,240
Right. I mean, that's all I stand on. When
she got to see a single, Hillary saw him.

719
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,000
I saw hundreds of Trump
signs and I was like, this,

720
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,170
this could, this might be real. Holy Shit.

721
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,920
I do never in a million
years than I think.

722
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,390
I thought Hillary was the main person
at the end of the day is going to be a

723
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,350
tour. You know, it's funny, I did it.
I did a Conan the day after the, uh,

724
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,260
the election and like,
you know,

725
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,230
I got so many people like fucking
yelling at me thinking like,

726
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:36,700
how the fuck would you
say this about Hillary?

727
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,200
How the fuck could you
say that about Trump?

728
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,120
Like you can't say anything about anybody.

729
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:42,280
I try to evenly trash both
of them and just say, Hey,

730
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:43,960
it'd be nice to people
stop yelling at each other.

731
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:47,440
Somehow people missed all of that
and they, they, they, you know,

732
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,040
I think especially the Hillary people
because they're so disappointed that they

733
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:51,850
just need somebody at the,

734
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,410
I kind of so much fucking shit from
people and I'm actually just texting me

735
00:40:56,411 --> 00:41:00,520
going like, hey man, I saw you on that.
I go, the guy was like, it seemed like,

736
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:04,270
you know, secretly you voted for
Trump. And then he wrote secretly,

737
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,090
secretly, again twice. And
that was just like, yeah,

738
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,080
like at now I didn't vote
for that guy. No, I didn't.

739
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:15,220
I didn't vote for either one of them.
I couldn't stand them. I like Bernie.

740
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:16,570
Bernie was my fucking guy.

741
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,240
I felt like right after the
election for the first time,

742
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:22,720
I felt like Bernie would've won.
I was like,

743
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:25,480
people really want to change
it. You know? They don't,

744
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,261
they don't know how to get it.

745
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:30,100
And they kind of gave me the same old
with Hillary. Yeah. And if, if I was like,

746
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:32,290
Holy Shit,
if Bernie had gotten the nomination,

747
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:35,370
he would probably be the right now
people think Joe Biden could have won.

748
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,980
I think just like, like I don't, I don't
like familiarity breeds contempt. I mean,

749
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,470
everybody's fucking filthy.
There was just something about like,

750
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,340
I felt myself saying it like when I saw
Jeb Bush and I saw a Kleenex, sorry,

751
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,610
I just can't deal with another Bush or
Clinton. It's such a stupid thing to say,

752
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:50,690
but I was just saying it's true.

753
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:54,020
There's some truth to it because I
want somebody else to lie to me now.

754
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,890
I didn't want anything like this guy.
I didn't want this guy, you know?

755
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,960
I'm not saying Bernie would've
fucking solid everything.

756
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,840
We'll say all this shit that Trump's doing
is fucking hilarious. Where he's like,

757
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:06,440
I'm going to do this. I want to do that.
I'm going to drain the swamp. It's like,

758
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,010
dude, okay, let's just say you actually
go in there and you somehow do this.

759
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:13,330
How slow DC works. Like you're going to
fucking drain the swamp and then what?

760
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,030
Expose all these people and then
they're all going to go to jail and like

761
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,550
they're going to be okay with this.
No,

762
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,340
I'm going to get all the illegal
immigrants out of this country. You're,

763
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,080
you're going to do, how are you going to
do that? How you going to do that? Yeah.

764
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,570
Yeah.

765
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:30,270
I'm going to build a fucking wall from
here to fucking California to Texas a

766
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,370
really, you're gonna, you're gonna do
all of this through. I think there are,

767
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,280
there already is a wall for one,
isn't there?

768
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,200
There's already a fence and a wall
through a lot of it. It's like, dude,

769
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:43,201
he put on at road can't stop people from
coming in by blocking off 3% of the,

770
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,070
of the border.
It's a tiny,

771
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,470
it's like they're coming in
any way they could come in.

772
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,720
My thought he was going to build
the whole basis of the country.

773
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,590
He wasn't an people get to come in
from all over the fucking place. Well,

774
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,510
is how I actually think about
that shit. It's like, um,

775
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,240
there does become the tipping point where
you got too many fucking people. Yeah.

776
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,450
There is that. I mean, back in the
day, yeah. We need him, you know,

777
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,500
we need it all we could get because of
what we were doing, which was underhanded.

778
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:14,740
We need, it's when the, he was great,
but we needed to take all this PA yeah.

779
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,110
Get out there on the front lines and
they would stuck them out west. Hey,

780
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,770
that's your land over there. Go over there
and then provoke them into an attack.

781
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,440
Like what the hell? So fucking thing was
shady. Um, yeah, from the beginning, Eh,

782
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,210
it's not, it goes for elections. Well,
you know, it's crazy. Government,

783
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,540
they've been corrupted and fucked up
since the beginning. I'm not gonna,

784
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:36,350
I'm not going to say the show, but I
recently did a show, right. And uh,

785
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,270
one of the comics went up and this person
went and just trashed Donald Trump.

786
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:45,260
This is after, after the show, after the
election. I want the show after the show.

787
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,810
They went up after the show,
after the election, right.

788
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,220
It was like the full five days after
whatever they went, right. And uh,

789
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,380
went in hard on Trump,
blah blah blah.

790
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,090
He's a sex offender and Anna are all
this type of stuff and graduated,

791
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:00,950
the crowd started booing, right? Half
the crowd after crowd fucking booze.

792
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,980
So then the next person goes
up who is a Trump supporter.

793
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,420
This person goes up and supports
Trump and trashes Hillary.

794
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:12,760
Then the other half of the crowd started
but with them I've never seen like so

795
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,320
divided dude.
It's literally like,

796
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,070
it's like a great SCC football game
where they play in like a neutral site.

797
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,840
Like when Florida plays Georgia and like
it's half fucker bulldogs have gators.

798
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,840
It's fucking insane.
Like I've never just like that.

799
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:29,990
If the country is so completely
divided that it's a little scary.

800
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,990
But the thing that I don't like
is that now the p, you know,

801
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:38,670
whatever side you're on, where you're
seeing the other side as your enemy,

802
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,520
right. When we're not supposed to
be enemies. We're all supposed to,

803
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,260
we all live here together, so
that ship's sailed it. I know.

804
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,781
That's what I'm saying.

805
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:51,781
That's what's shitty news came in
and balanced out CNN by being just as

806
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:56,590
ridiculously far to the other side.
I mean there's those shells, those,

807
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,480
those networks that are hilarious.

808
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,110
Like when on election night what I would
do is I would just, whoever was winning,

809
00:45:02,111 --> 00:45:05,140
I would watch the other network just
to watch some stuff into the sweat they

810
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:08,080
said, yeah, and just go, no, I
just, just for the comedy of it,

811
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,360
because I knew there was nothing.
Not that,

812
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:12,320
I mean I voted for who I wanted to vote,
find new.

813
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,000
This fucking state was going to go
with Hillary Clinton. I mean that's a,

814
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,670
that's a given.

815
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,600
The oceans vote for blue and everybody
else in the middle of votes for red and

816
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:23,140
then it comes down to like fucking Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

817
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,870
Evidently North Carolina,
which I didn't know about that,

818
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:29,080
but what I was happy it was actually was
up to date on all the propositions and

819
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:30,160
voted read them all.

820
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,550
Me and my wife will read them for like
days in front of me and like we're just

821
00:45:33,551 --> 00:45:36,490
laughing our ass off if like, can we sit
in there like reading? They'd be like, uh,

822
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,480
you know, do you not want them to drill
for oil in the middle of your forehead?

823
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,810
And then here's the argument for,
and he'd be like,

824
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:47,140
well that would probably lead to
your death. There is no oil in there,

825
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,540
blah blah blah, blah, blah. And then
it'd be like, the argument gets,

826
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,210
actually it's the complete opposite.
Drilling for oil would actually save this,

827
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:56,410
this, and next thing you know that
you're like, oh, maybe I should vote.

828
00:45:56,411 --> 00:46:00,190
Like I didn't get anything out of those
arguments and then we will just laughing.

829
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,460
We did. You just eventually look
at, well, who supported this?

830
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,030
It'd be like if it was anything
environmentally, it's like Ed Begley Jr.

831
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,250
All right, that guy's been
riding a bike for 30 years. Okay.

832
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:10,120
If he's done with this,

833
00:46:10,121 --> 00:46:13,870
I'm going with that bag is powers whole
neighborhoods by ride Neveah running on

834
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,000
a hamster wheel. You know, it's
funny. I do. Do we know who, um,

835
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,980
what happened with the condoms in
Porno? Did that pass or no? Nice.

836
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,110
Actually a thing. Yes. Keep Porno.

837
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,860
Keeps some jobs here and uh,
in, in the valley, right? So no,

838
00:46:29,861 --> 00:46:32,690
they don't have to work on
them, so no, no. I think that
that was like, if they do,

839
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,330
they do. Yeah, they do. Okay. Oh, this
is classic Americans. We don't even know.

840
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,070
All right, I'll look it up.
We're going to look it up.

841
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,150
I thought it used to be that way
and now that they've taken it,

842
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,210
I had to wear condoms and then they
were having a hard time. I think it was,

843
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,880
you could not be further off the Mike. So
you gotta make a quick point here. Okay.

844
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,390
It didn't pass.
So they don't have to wear condoms,

845
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:57,740
but they can't get permits right now.

846
00:46:57,741 --> 00:46:58,850
They're having a really
hard time getting it.

847
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Okay. So porno permits were
saying that maybe it passed,

848
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:04,400
but they can't get permits now.

849
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:08,930
Jesus Christ shoot things to
vote on other than officers.

850
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,960
We had a vote on whether or not we want
it to allow casinos in northern Jersey.

851
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:18,740
And what'd you say? I said
No. Uh, which, and it didn't.

852
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,050
It was no, it was overwhelming. No,

853
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,510
they're not going to be able to put
casinos in northern jersey, which is,

854
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:27,840
in my opinion, very good. Right? I
don't hate casinos. The Christie's,

855
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,850
but I don't think they should
be everywhere. So just say,

856
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:33,310
Chris Christie is fat and
I copped he's fat enough.

857
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,630
He doesn't mean to get in that dead skin
bag going to jersey. Mike's even more.

858
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,830
And the other one was like,

859
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,820
should we designate the
money from tolls and fuel tax

860
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,393
into

861
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,673
right

862
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,380
trans public transportation, which is
first question to be four to begin with.

863
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:58,950
First question is, well, where's it
going now? Uh, well anywhere else.

864
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,830
I don't know where, why do I really
don't know where? But it was meant to be,

865
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:04,170
be allocated toward that a certain
percentage of it initially.

866
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:06,700
And then that got changed
somewhere along the line. So we,

867
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,470
ours was like voted changed it back was
legalizing weed keeping it illegal or

868
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,810
something like that. It was the condoms.
It was like a, should we repair it?

869
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,680
There was one about building up schools
and everything were initially you're

870
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:18,810
like, yeah, this is a good
thing. And then the whole thing,

871
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:20,460
the whole proposition
was written by these,

872
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,180
this group of people that are builders.
And wait a minute,

873
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:27,380
I like that the contractors
are right. This shit up. So
what's going on with this?

874
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:32,520
Um, they want to be a lot of interesting
shit. Yeah. There wasn't a, yeah, no,

875
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,940
I can't remember how there was like,
it was like at least another 12.

876
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,940
There was so many, any or vote
on every one of them. Yeah.

877
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:39,800
But what was great was we,

878
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,310
we've figured out the best we could what
it was and God knows what is attached

879
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,900
to all of that shit too.
Right. You know what I mean?

880
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:51,420
So I had all my answers before I went in
there. So what was taken everybody like,

881
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:54,540
you know, a good 20 minutes of your
reading it for the first fucking time.

882
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,280
I add them all. So I would just look at
the page. Yes. Was Up. No, it was down.

883
00:48:59,281 --> 00:49:02,610
I would just look at my answer
sheet and I'd be like up,
down, down, up. And I just,

884
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,710
I just fucking throw it. I was great. I
felt like I was cheating on a test. Um,

885
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,250
well let, before we get out of it, we,
we should, we got to get the answer here.

886
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:14,960
What's going on? It did not pass yet.
It did not pass. It did not pass.

887
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,710
But they can't get their permits to make
porn and stuff. Yeah. Even that is comp.

888
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,010
Who's behind? Who's, who's a conservative
behind that, that wants to get porn.

889
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:27,060
A lot of the valley did the Tipper
Gore moved to the valley recently.

890
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,710
Remember her earthy TRC,

891
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:32,760
one guy that wrote it up and if it passed
he would have a job for the rest of

892
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:36,610
his life. Basically making sure there
were condoms important. So he was

893
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,320
so one weight. One guy wrote on it,
one guy that does not sound real.

894
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,080
That's what I could do that.
Yeah.

895
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,090
He's the one guy who supplies
the porn and asked to get,

896
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,470
it's got to get through some sort of
fucking legislative horse shit. Right.

897
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:52,620
Did that get put on a bounce so
he's got money? Yeah. All right.

898
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:55,010
Because I would say then the guy who
said the rent is too damn high. What?

899
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:56,600
He got something done.
Remember that guy? Yeah. Yeah.

900
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,430
In New York when it's too
damn rent is too damn high.

901
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:02,670
I hate it when like he kept getting labs
and kept hanging around and then like

902
00:50:02,671 --> 00:50:05,510
one of those politicians like
I agree with them though.

903
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:08,010
Rent is too darn high.

904
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:15,640
I don't know how those politicians exist
and that level of phony cartoons. Yeah.

905
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,340
Yeah.
Algo was one of the most,

906
00:50:17,341 --> 00:50:20,040
was the one of the worst I saw and that
was the thing I think about Trump that

907
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:24,060
was amazing was watching
him just be beat himself,

908
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:26,730
which a lot of people don't like who
he was, but he was being a person.

909
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,010
A lot of people don't think a good
person, but like he was candid. You can't,

910
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,500
you can't accuse him of not being dude.

911
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:34,880
It was like there was
sitting at the table,

912
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:38,180
but it was politicians and he was the guy
running the table and no one could get

913
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:42,350
them. I couldn't fuck up none. They
could not figure out. They're like,

914
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:46,850
this guy doesn't care about anything.
How do we pin him down?

915
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,480
And he didn't give a shit about what
he says from one minute to the next.

916
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:54,470
He didn't care about care. You'd be like,
oh, she's allowed to talk and I can,

917
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:59,390
I'll great three against one, three, three
against one. But he said that it was,

918
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,190
it was fucking cause it's very ticket,
but it was brilliant. Like do what he did.

919
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:04,431
I mean,

920
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:07,640
I'm not happy that it certainly these
fucking guys that he's putting together,

921
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,730
I jumped to my last podcast,
you know, he was talking to,

922
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:12,800
he's going to have change and everything
that we just go because he's just doing

923
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:16,100
the exact opposite. It's
like fuller house. He's just
bring it back. This old show.

924
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:19,940
I said it was like the expendable version
of the expendables of Republicans.

925
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,550
It's just do it. It's the whole
thing to him was just a game.

926
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,950
It seems if you talk, if you see him
interviewed, no, it's just like he,

927
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:30,440
he's basically like, oh,
I won and that was it.

928
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,510
It doesn't matter how you know,

929
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:34,790
it's just one you don't have worried
about to someone when they're like,

930
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,531
but you're going to,

931
00:51:35,531 --> 00:51:37,310
you're doing all this stuff that you've
just said you weren't going to do.

932
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:41,990
And he's like, well, who else is to do it?
Basically it's like Marx brothers Shit.

933
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:46,070
Like you can't just say who else is
going to do it? That's not an answer,

934
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,450
but it didn't give a shit.

935
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,030
It's like this is the way that's
as good an answer answers.

936
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:50,180
You're cutting so fuck you.

937
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:53,870
But the thing about the media is they
had no followup because they never dealt

938
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:57,200
with a guy like this who would just
admit to you got to get, you know,

939
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,850
their old typical followup doesn't work
because they call him out on it and he

940
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:05,090
just says, yeah, whatever. Who Cares?
And it says something else. Well,

941
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:07,300
the back in the day when
somebody would call,

942
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,810
when they would call a politician out,

943
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:12,230
they try to get out of it and they would
stammer and then they would just keep,

944
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,913
you know,

945
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,820
hitting them with it until just the
whole embarrassment of the situation.

946
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,280
The person would drop out,
he just would admit to it and,

947
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,790
and they had nothing and they're
like, well, when they said, oh,

948
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:26,820
he used to supposed to be
bad. I keep using this as
the example that we like you,

949
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,870
you know, you've said this about
women, you've said that about women,

950
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:31,540
you said this about. And
he goes, Nah, Nah. He goes,

951
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:36,110
I said that about Rosie O'donnell and
it got a huge laugh and then the female

952
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,260
report, it goes like, no, you've said that
about other women too when he just goes,

953
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,980
yeah, he probably right, but
then that's over and it was over.

954
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,890
You made a joke and
she couldn't even like,

955
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:48,500
or anybody in that panel couldn't
have been like, you're probably right.

956
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,050
So you're saying you are sexist.
Is that what you're saying?

957
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,850
Do you think that like,
and I still think because of,

958
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:58,430
of what the fuck he represented, he
could've just been like, yes, I am sexist.

959
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,760
Yeah, I can't believe you're not sitting
here and making me a pie or something.

960
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,430
They get out of here and
let the men handle it.

961
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,010
Clearly people were not put off by that.
I don't know.

962
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,310
But it's so hard to tell what's
what's true and what is it,

963
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,900
anything you read about Hillary in the
last three months or five months or

964
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:18,200
whatever, it could have been
taken out of context. Absolutely.

965
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:20,930
Putting away to make her look, you
know, show her in a certain light.

966
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:21,860
And same with Trump.

967
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,640
It gets to be silly to assume that
one side is doing it in one side.

968
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,040
The other is not. No, they all are.

969
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,620
It's very difficult to tell what the
fuck is real and what isn't. You know,

970
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:35,380
you know, it was fun with that. Their news
from fucking Twitter, guilty as charged.

971
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,690
I know. Me Too, man. Me,
Facebook, all of that. I, I um,

972
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,780
you don't kill me. We'll put Bailey
on Twitter by Real Ben Bailey.

973
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,120
The Real Ben Bailey, B a I l e
y.com, the Real Ben bailey.com.

974
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,983
I,
um,

975
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,380
I was actually amazed at the election
night when they had the pictures of each

976
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:55,500
candidate and was finally one
that the other side hadn't picked.

977
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:58,830
And I was just like, oh, look at Hillary.
She looks like a nice person. Donald.

978
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,860
He looks like a cool guy.
Yeah, they look as Donald was.

979
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:07,070
Donald was always like the scowl and
he had like the thing like that Rudy

980
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,680
Giuliani picture that the left is
using where he looks like he's roaring.

981
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,910
He just came up from the flames of
hell. That thing is fucking, you could,

982
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,360
you could do that to anybody,
especially when you're totally, yeah.

983
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:21,090
When you're that old, you know this,
it's such an effort just to speak.

984
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,280
Your face is going to contort
and they just have to do,

985
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,320
take a couple of pictures. You're going
to look like Satan. And then Hillary,

986
00:54:26,321 --> 00:54:30,060
he always just had that crazy fucking
smile and the bobblehead thing going and,

987
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,840
and really unflattering light. Like
she looked like, you know, I'll do,

988
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:34,890
they did every kind of went toward,

989
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,440
they did everything they possibly
could to both of them. Like Trump,

990
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,410
like his eyebrows by the end of the
election were like beneath his eyes.

991
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:47,160
It's like, well, thank shock. The fact
that he actually has one points out,

992
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,800
the point that he made
repeatedly through the campaign,

993
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:54,130
which is at the whole system is it is
fucked. It doesn't work. Right? Yeah.

994
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,640
But I will tell you all those people
that think that he's somehow going to get

995
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:00,450
them out of that fucking hole is,
that's ridiculous.

996
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:05,040
They don't give it. It's on you. It's on
you. And they try to act like these, uh,

997
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,930
these people are going to save you
fucking ass. They're not. No, they can't.

998
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:15,090
No. And that's the uplifting message.
If this podcast could be worse, dude,

999
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:17,190
there's like,
there's like a billion people,

1000
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:21,850
literally a billion people in China that
live in abject poverty. Oh, totally. In,

1001
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,040
are brainwashed into thinking that
that's, you know, that's their place.

1002
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:31,800
I don't know. It's a billion
people. I know. It's like,

1003
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:34,260
what the fuck?
How would you even begin to,

1004
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:38,620
have you seen this is the thing tackle
an issue like that? Have you seen it?

1005
00:55:38,621 --> 00:55:41,040
No way to do it. It's, it's just
that's how, that's how it is.

1006
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,240
Have you seen those cities?
Like they,

1007
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,840
they have a few cities over there
then I have so many fucking people.

1008
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:50,640
Like it literally looks like there's
a fire but it's just the polluted air.

1009
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,200
It's just the area.
It's just the air.

1010
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:55,890
So like when they were having the Olympics
over there at some point when they

1011
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:59,040
were going to shoot something, you
know, film it for the world to see,

1012
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,870
they told everybody to like not drive
or use any machinery or anything.

1013
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:07,770
God knows what would happen to you if you
did. It felt like, like, I don't know,

1014
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:11,940
24 hours or three days of some shit before
they just let all of that shit in the

1015
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:16,590
air just settle down onto the ground.
Cause that's, that's what it is.

1016
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,750
Yeah. Because it's all
like, even like out here,

1017
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:21,910
like a lot of times people think
they, the haze is smog, but like Hays,

1018
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,950
like smog is Brown.

1019
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,620
But Hays is that clear thing and that
haze is all the dust and all the shit that

1020
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:30,310
we're kicking up driving around. Yeah.
So everybody at bay, I think basically,

1021
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,220
what's that new thing the kids are doing?
You act like a mannequin or some shit.

1022
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,390
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1023
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,080
They made like a billion people or
half a billion people fucking do that,

1024
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,490
do that. And then people
were just like, Eh,

1025
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,460
it is a great place to
have people go swimming.

1026
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:46,630
You guys just have to hold still until
we're done with the hundred meter

1027
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:50,170
backstroke. Well, get out of here dude.

1028
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,580
When oil, there's a couple more things
on there that don't have any lecture,

1029
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,240
any more movies or something like Di.

1030
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,440
Do you know like the next one that you're
going to do? As far as the short film?

1031
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:04,300
I don't, I think I might do
another episode of Blam. I
like it. I like it a lot.

1032
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,240
Uh, and it was really fun and like the
idea was that another comic or you know,

1033
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,710
actor friend of mine will be the be
the villain, probably another comedian.

1034
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:15,620
And so we'll just keep doing those. But
I can definitely see that being a series,

1035
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,230
a web series. It was a niche initially
was going to be a web series,

1036
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,940
but then I made the
first one and I was like,

1037
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:26,140
I dunno if I want to put all that into
this every single time just on my own.

1038
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,270
Right. I might rather try
some other stuff and said,

1039
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,710
I want to see what people like,
you know,

1040
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:33,040
get some feedback once the stuff
is out there. And he'd go, oh,

1041
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:35,740
that leads to something. And next thing
you know, you know you have something on,

1042
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:38,490
you got something on fucking
Amazon or Netflix. Yeah.

1043
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:42,580
Like you're walking down a red carpet.
People yell at Ben, what are you wearing?

1044
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,590
What are you wearing? Oh my God, I
don't know. And then they go back.

1045
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,160
Then they go back through
all your and, and uh, uh, uh,

1046
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:54,870
recently unearthed gem meet
at race and made me a race.

1047
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:00,220
And you sat me also have, yeah, for
12 years now it's a period film.

1048
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,760
Well, I actually was anyway, I want to
see it because I want to see like I,

1049
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:05,370
cause I'm,

1050
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:10,370
I'm one of those guys that I love seeing
New York and any error that it isn't

1051
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:13,210
now.
Like I love seeing it in the nineties now.

1052
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,990
I love seeing it in the 80s I
love seventies of this shit.

1053
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,940
And then the sixties and fifties
when it goes back is like I'll watch,

1054
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:23,710
I watch old fucking
movies for that reason.

1055
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:27,490
Like sometimes I'll watch an old movie
and I'll see a guy driving down sunset

1056
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,050
and you just see how spread
out the buildings are and
how, I mean the shooting,

1057
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,310
so you don't know about the traffic,

1058
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:35,740
but it's just like some of
that stuff where it was just,

1059
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,440
you could just see the hills
and stuff. It's like, yeah,

1060
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:39,850
that back then that's what they had.

1061
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:42,310
Like you want to go shoot a mountain
lion and you're like walked out your

1062
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:46,660
backyard. He's writing, he's
just right down the road.
Yeah. In, in La. So anyways,

1063
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:48,490
but I should say before we go,
sorry.

1064
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:52,540
I also have two podcast shows that are
going to be on this, on the new website.

1065
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:56,470
Oh cool. Uh, one of them's a storytelling
show. Beautiful. Remember DC?

1066
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:59,920
Benny and I used to do that
show. Urban myth. Yeah. Wait,
what, what, what venue did,

1067
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,730
did that,
was that,

1068
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:03,460
I just almost got to this earlier
when we're talking about zinc bar,

1069
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,760
cause that was the original onc bar was
on Houseton Street do urban myth every

1070
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,630
Tuesday. The new podcast I have is called
tall, but true. It's a storytelling show.

1071
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:17,900
It's been, it's pretty much urban myth.
Oh, cool. As a podcast. So it's like the,

1072
00:59:17,901 --> 00:59:20,200
the two of us tell a story and
then a guest tells a story.

1073
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,260
So I'd love to have you do that call into
that if you want. And then another one,

1074
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,920
and that'll all be on the
real Ben bailey.com. Yeah.

1075
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,840
And then one where my girl and I,
it's called speaking of movies,

1076
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,630
we watch a movie and then we just
talk about the movie afterwards.

1077
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,770
It goes around, which we love, which we
did anyway. And then one day we're like,

1078
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,230
we always have these great
conversations after we watch a movie.

1079
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:40,220
Let's just start recording them.

1080
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:44,990
So can you recommend a movie you've seen
lately that you like? Dude, I watched, uh,

1081
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,940
you've probably seen it I'm way behind,

1082
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:51,830
but I just watched Batman versus
superman. I liked it. I've loved it, man.

1083
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:54,170
You've already seen it all. Yeah,
I think it was great. I liked it.

1084
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,560
I said that yesterday
at, uh, Benson's podcast.

1085
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,860
Doug loves movies and everybody's
like, what? They were like,

1086
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,670
they thought it was taking, what I
liked about is awesome. I liked the, uh,

1087
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:10,810
sorry. I like the, uh, how
the, the way they had like the,

1088
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,260
the government getting involved on,

1089
01:00:12,261 --> 01:00:15,920
we can't just have this
guy acting unilaterally and
whatever the fuck that means,

1090
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:16,301
you know,
just,

1091
01:00:16,301 --> 01:00:19,730
just basically helping out who the fuck
he wants and people claiming him and all

1092
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:21,560
that.
I was just going to hold accountable.

1093
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:26,240
That actually seemed like some shit that
they would do and then demonize them

1094
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:28,280
and all that. Like I always forget
movies the second I saw him,

1095
01:00:28,281 --> 01:00:30,770
but that thing stuck out with
me. I, I really liked that.

1096
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,590
I thought it was great man.
And it's, it's uh, you know,

1097
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:38,450
if you've ever seen a watchman, remember
that one? That's the same director, uh,

1098
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,400
Zack Snyder, I think his name
is, he made the watchman,

1099
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,760
which is like super dark,

1100
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,410
super hero movie based on this
graphic novel, which is awesome.

1101
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,800
You should check it out. You'd
love it. Here's the only,

1102
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:53,330
the only thing called the comedian Oh,
cool. Superhero called the comedian.

1103
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:54,350
He's like super dark.

1104
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,440
The only thing I don't like about superman
movies is it always comes down to the

1105
01:00:57,441 --> 01:01:01,430
Kryptonite. It's always, it's never,
uh, he never bangs the wrong girl. It's,

1106
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,020
you just know. Okay, where's the,

1107
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:05,750
when's the green chain getting
wrapped around his neck? Yeah.

1108
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:08,330
When's it gonna Happen?
That's the only thing that can do it.

1109
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,850
The only thing that he's, he's
too powerful. That's the thing.

1110
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:13,130
It almost gets a little
boring wealth. Well, Ben,

Can you start moving the shit
around a track or we're all losers.

1124
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,010
A Newsweek reports.
The average American wastes five minutes a

Share a story of when you've
lost something, you need it. Oh,

1129
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:35,970
I remember one time I was
taking a dump when I was like,

1130
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:37,500
where's the toilet paper?

1131
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:42,090
So I'm walking around with my
fucking belt around my legs.

1132
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:46,920
Tracker makes losing things a thing of

Press a button on tracker and your phone

1149
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,580
You know about Lyft,
right?

1150
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:56,880
It's the APP that gets you
rides in minutes on demand 24,

1151
01:03:56,881 --> 01:04:01,710
seven for less than the cost of a cab. Uh,
if you tried Lyft, you know what I mean?

1152
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:04,140
With Lyft, you just download
the APP, request a driver,

1153
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:08,100
and they show up in three and a half
minutes on average. That's really fast.

1154
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:09,360
In case you didn't know there,

1155
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,520
every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through their 10 point safety standard.

1156
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,200
Have you ever killed anyone?

1157
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:20,400
Two idiot jerk off when
you're driving three, right?

1158
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:22,050
They go through the whole thing.
She'd be safe,

1159
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:25,470
including criminal and
DMV background checks. Uh,

1160
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:29,610
you'll know you'll get
around quickly and safely.

1161
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,630
Why can't I read tonight?

1162
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:35,400
Lyft drivers are rated after every
ride solely the best. Stick around.

1163
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,120
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy card with some creepy dude.

1164
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,021
Uh,

1165
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:45,021
with Lyft you can tip in the APP would
obviously leads to happier drivers.

1166
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:45,601
I mean,

1167
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:49,470
nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect
five star rating from the passengers.

1168
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:53,220
It's just better all around experience.
Well, what happens on that 10th one?

1169
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:57,540
We'll leave that up. Bigger
isn't always better. Um,

1170
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:01,440
you fucking size queen lift isn't
the biggest ride sharing app,

1171
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:03,960
but it's the fastest growing
in the highest rated one.

1172
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,950
I'm talking quality over quantity. You
know where they're taking a shot at here.

1173
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,520
It rhymes with scoober.
Um, thanks to lift,

1174

avoid drunk driving.

1175
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:17,530
You never have to bum a ride and you
never have to worry about parking.

1176
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,570
A lot of people are
actually getting right,

1177
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,890
getting rid of their cars and relying on
Lyft to get around. And you know what?

1178
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,850
I don't blame them. What if I did
say that you wrote that? Well,

01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:22,400
Ever find yourself almost
all the way to work.

1229
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,240
Or maybe you're out with your family
and friends and you get that nagging

1230
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:31,190
feeling, why did I marry this woman?
No, not that negative feeling.

1231
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,760
You start thinking, did I close
that window? Did I lock the door?

1232
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:37,780
You just don't know. It
could drive you nuts. Well,

1233
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,580
you don't have to worry about that
anymore when you got simply safe home

1234
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:43,910
security. Also, if you don't
buy any nice shit in your house,

1235
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,830
you wouldn't care either.
But that's a different story.

1236
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,640
It's a nice extra layer of protection
to know. Simply safe is there.

hidden fees. They won't gouge you.

1241
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,610
It's 1499 a month.

1242
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:09,260
That's three times less than what other
companies judge and has some big news.

1243
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,520

new high definition security camera.

1253
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,250
I got to hit the home button.
I got to do the whole password.

1254
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,590
Good thing and that,

1255
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:07,860
hey,
what's going on?

1256
01:10:07,861 --> 01:10:12,861
And still birth is the Monday
morning podcast and uh,

1257
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:13,490
it's

1258
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,323
late in the day.

1259
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,100
And then I finally got to it and this
is my fourth attempt at trying to do a

1260
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:23,060
good one. Get a good
one. How about that line?

1261
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:27,500
What movie set from that times
at Ridgemont high? Mr Hand,

1262
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,590
you remember him? Do you know the
guy who played that? He was in, uh,

1263
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,440
my favorite Martian and he took
that gig back in the early sixties.

1264
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:41,420
And so, so like 30 fucking
years, every time somebody
ran up to him they said, hey,

1265
01:10:41,421 --> 01:10:42,980
it's that fucking marsh and guy.

1266
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,800
And he hated life and he
hated that fucking show.

1267
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:48,740
And then he did that show movie
fast times at Ridgemont high.

1268
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:53,200
And one day the clouds parted and some
young kid came walking up to him, said,

1269
01:10:53,201 --> 01:10:56,720
hey, mister hand. And evidently
he was really excited.

1270
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,240
Isn't that a nice show?
Business Story?

1271
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:03,970
I don't know what the fuck that has to
do with my podcast or this fucking bus

1272
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:08,780
that is in front of me that is not
moving. Go, you're boss. There you go.

1273
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,980
Merge, give con. Um, anyways, uh,

1274
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,150
if you're new to my page or my website,

1275
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,330
I do one of these every single week and
people send me questions and I tried to

1276
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:19,980
answer them to the best of my ability.

1277
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,620
I try not to say concert
during the podcast,

1278
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:26,640
but occasionally it's flips out when
there's a broad us driving two miles an

1279
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:30,000
hour. What the fuck is wrong
with me? I can't say words.

1280
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:35,001
Lately I was working at xannies and
Nashville and I kept stumbling over words

1281
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:37,590
and then I started thinking why I
keep stumbling over these words.

1282
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:41,860
And then I almost started
stuttering on stage. And uh,

1283
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:45,720
speaking of which, if you came up to
see me at Zinis in Nashville, Tennessee,

1284
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:49,010
I just want to say thank you very much.
And I'm,

1285
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,580
even though I just said
thank you very much,

1286
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:53,850
you might have sensed a little bit of
anger underneath that and it has nothing

1287
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:54,684
to do with you guys.

1288
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,130
And it has to do with the fact that there
aren't enough hours in the day today

1289
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,350
and I'm fucking frustrated.

1290
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:06,510
And I basically only have about
10 15 minutes to do this podcast.

1291
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:11,280
And you know, usually, usually
I go on for about 45 minutes,

1292
01:12:11,281 --> 01:12:13,290
but today or whatever,
half hour,

1293
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,460
this is going to be like an EDP kind of
like guns and roses, that live album,

1294
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,550
except I'm not going to drop the n word,
you know?

1295
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,620
So slash if you're listening to this,

1296
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:25,170
if you're one of the 14 people
who listens to my podcast,

1297
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,840
you're not going to
feel awkward or have to

1298
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,970
have to fucking explain yourself.
Um,

1299
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,020
I don't fucking know people. You know
what? You know what? I got nothing.

1300
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,430
I got nothing this week. I got nothing.
Funny to say. I am fucking burnt out.

1301
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:45,000
I just did back to back weeks
on the road plus a college.

1302
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,330
Do you want to hear them? You want
to hear my, uh, my week I was in a,

1303
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:52,110
I always in Washington DC,

1304
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,090
then I was in la and
then I went to Colorado,

1305
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:00,870
then I flew to a Indianapolis,

1306
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:06,060
did the Bob and Tom show and I
had a night off the night before.

1307
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:09,330
And because my brain never
shuts off. I'm like, well,

1308
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:13,830
why the fuck would I just chill out in
Indianapolis when I can drive for fucking

1309
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:17,460
hours up to Detroit and go to a red
wings game? And that's what I did,

1310
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,450
except I thought it was only a two hour
drive and it turned out it was a fucking

1311
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:24,660
four hour drive, four and a half
actually. And I went up there,

1312
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:27,510
it was Redwings penguins, which turned
out to be one of the games of the year,

1313
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,270
but I had to leave before
the third period and did,

1314
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,400
and I missed the penguins come
back and win and overtime.

1315
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:37,680
But I still got to go to that arena and
I couldn't believe how small it was.

1316
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:42,600
You know, there was no upper deck. It
just kind of went straight up. You know,

1317
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:47,160
it was kind of an, I dunno, an old school
building and like a 1975 kind of way.

1318
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:52,530
But, uh, it was really cool and
the fans were awesome. And uh,

1319
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,393
you know,

1320
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,600
I don't like going in that expansion
shit and I don't like fairweather fans.

1321
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,960
And that's choice. Got Good
fans. And there were a lot
of Pittsburgh penguin fans.

1322
01:14:00,961 --> 01:14:02,610
They're talking a lot of shit.

1323
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,550
Even when they were down
for two after two periods.

1324
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,030
And I missed them all talking shit
when they came back and won seven,

1325
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:10,350
six and fucking over time.

1326
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:15,150
And where was I driving by fucking corn
field in the middle of Indiana. Bobby.

1327
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:15,993
And

1328
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:21,640
so my brain right now is fragile and um,

1329
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:27,610
you know, you might wonder, uh, what the
fuck is wrong with bill and uh, you know,

1330
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,440
I don't have any answers.
I'm driving a hybrid.

1331
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:34,630
I just drank three quarters of a Sam
Adams Beer, one of their seasonal Bruce.

1332
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:39,430
And I'm on my way to a writers meeting
because I have to go write some sketches

1333
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:43,480
for something that I'm shooting and uh,
I'm exhausted.

1334
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,450
This is one of these times when I
just want to sweep for fucking nine,

1335
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:51,940
10 hours and wake up the next day
and just stare at the fucking wall.

1336
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,030
But I can't because I have to do this.

1337
01:14:56,020 --> 01:15:00,190
I have to somehow put my voice into a
sketch, which is not an easy thing to do.

1338
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:05,560
I find this very hard for me to write
sketches because I write very set up,

1339
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:06,850
punch, set up, punch.

1340
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:11,290
There's not a lot of layers that's
not a left model left turns, you know,

1341
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:14,380
it's just like my act as a lot
of screaming and uh, the f word.

1342
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:17,920
So you have to figure out how to do that.
And we're at a red light,

1343
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:20,350
so I think it's time for a
podcast question. Look at this.

1344
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:24,220
This is just like the cash cap. Uh,
okay. If don't question when. Number one,

1345
01:15:24,221 --> 01:15:28,120
have you ever been asked to write
material for another comedian?

1346
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,140
First of all, look at this fucking guy
riding down the street with a bicycle.

1347
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,550
I hate when got people do that.

1348
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,640
They put a reflector on their back
and then all of a sudden they just,

1349
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,370
they feel like they're like,
uh, this sort of like a,

1350
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:44,371
a motorcycle on some level and they
start riding with traffic like the Kevin

1351
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,900
Bacon and quick silver,
you know,

1352
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:50,350
nothing makes me want to lean
over and open my passenger door

1353
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:56,320
and commit vehicular manslaughter
like some fucking turn your life.

1354
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:03,100
Somebody didn't have their lights
off. Um, like that. Do you know what?

1355
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,250
I don't know what the fuck was I taught?
What was the question?

1356
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:11,110
Have I ever been asked to write
material for another comedian? Uh, yes,

1357
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:16,060
yes. I have. I have, uh, written for a,

1358
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:20,710
I wrote for one roast is Shaquille
O'Neal roast. And I got to admit,

1359
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:23,620
you know, at first I started
writing the jokes and I was like,

1360
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:25,150
I don't want to write jokes
from another comedian.

1361
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:29,350
I want to write them for me and I want to
be able to say, um, so I get the laugh.

1362
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:33,550
But then I realized what's cool about a
roast is you're not at like writing for

1363
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:38,260
Comedians to act whether then gonna go
on Hbo and kill with some joke and get

1364
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:43,000
credit for it. Um, it's,
it's a very specific thing.

1365
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:45,970
It's not like I have a chunk of
material about Shaquille O'Neal,

1366
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:51,610
so what do I care? And I wrote it and
um, evidently it went really well.

1367
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:55,300
People in the writer's room, I guess
liked it and I got a real kick out of it.

1368
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:57,730
And, uh, I got one joke on the air.

1369
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,380
I believe that joke was,
uh,

1370
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:08,410
something about watching Shaquille O'Neal
play basketball was like watching a

1371
01:17:08,411 --> 01:17:11,120
retard fuck.
Something along those lines.

1372
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:15,470
Something along of that. He
was just such a big dude. Yeah.

1373
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,380
He's such a big fucking dude that
even when he's dunks the ball,

1374
01:17:18,381 --> 01:17:19,214
it doesn't look good.

1375
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:22,700
He looks like a fat kid dunking
a ball on like a nerf hoop set.

1376
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:25,760
And that was basically,
that was basically it.

1377
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:29,690
I went the cheap route I use retard is a
reference stand out so I'm not proud of

1378
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:32,120
it, but it got on the air.
All right, here's another one.

1379
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:35,330
Do you agree that the reason many
TV shows or abruptly canceled,

1380
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:41,000
the reason many TV shows or abruptly
canceled is due to the media is attempt to

1381
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:45,920
control what we watch such as reality TV.
Okay.

1382
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,780
Um, the media, his attempt is it,

1383
01:17:48,781 --> 01:17:52,190
the entire media is working together.
Um,

1384
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,810
if you're in the conspiracy theory,

1385
01:17:53,811 --> 01:17:58,811
I would work a little higher up the ladder
and try to see who owns media in this

1386
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:03,680
country. And you'd be surprised.
It's not that many people. So,

1387
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:05,810
uh,
I dunno,

1388
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:09,620
I don't think reality TV is an attempt to
Pete for them to control what we watch.

1389
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:13,400
I just think it's really cheap and it's a,

1390
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:17,900
there's something mesmerizing about
watching 10 losers in a house.

1391
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,040
Talk Shit about each other
as much as I make fun of it.

1392
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:25,990
Did that guy just fucking bump into me?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1393
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:29,960
You fucking idiot.
But like just fucking rear ended me.

1394
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:31,003
Hmm.

1395
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,503
Hang on a second.

1396
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:35,600
Okay.

1397
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,640
Fucking do this. I'll fuck
away. He just did that

1398
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,550
quite a gut. I think some guy
just literally tapped my bumper.

1399
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,460
Hang on a sec.
You know what?

1400
01:18:51,461 --> 01:18:53,960
This would be great if we get to a fucking
red light cause I know we didn't hit

1401
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:57,080
it hard enough. Hold on, hold on a second.

1402
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,010
Bump into me.
Hang on a sec.

1403
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,620
Did you just bumped into
me? You didn't? Okay.

1404
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,360
I don't know if was my car or not.

1405
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:17,420
I was wonder why he has such a nonchalant
look on your face. I'm like, all right,

1406
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:21,570
I'm just making sure. All
right. Sorry about that.

1407
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:27,960
Okay. Hi. Hi Ma. Okay.

1408
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,500
So anyways,
me even didn't into me.

1409
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:33,720
I think my car just had like a hiccup,

1410
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,450
but it literally felt like
somebody just tapped my buck

1411
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,010
and I looked in the rear view mirror.
This guy was right on my fucking ass.

1412
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,560
You guys almost started in La moment.

1413
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:45,590
Okay,

1414
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,080
what is, I fought him.
I want to fuck. Fuck.

1415
01:19:47,081 --> 01:19:49,820
And if the I have enough
speaker phone do it,

1416
01:19:49,821 --> 01:19:53,270
then they could have
used my podcast in court.

1417
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:57,740
Then I finally would have got like
50 fucking listeners. God dammit.

1418
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,240
That was, that was a moment right there.
That was a moment that almost happened.

1419
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:08,370
What a stupid question. Oh, did you just
go up into me? Ah, no I didn't. Oh, okay.

1420
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,800
Jesus. Can you believe I'm not a
private investigator with that?

1421
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,760
That's sort of fucking police
work. All right. So anyways,

1422
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,200
anyway, Shit. I gotta wrap this podcast
up cause I'm at where the fuck I'm at.

1423
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,400
So this guy being writer's thing that
I'm doing, but you gotta admit, you know,

1424
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:31,080
that was pretty exciting that for
a second. Um, all right, let's,

1425
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:33,690
let's start a bloke who, some of these
more, some more of these questions,

1426
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:34,710
but before I get the phone,

1427
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:38,600
thanks to everybody who came up to see
me at saint e's in Nashville, Tennessee,

1428
01:20:38,601 --> 01:20:43,601
I had an awesome time and literally tons
more people showed up since the last

1429
01:20:43,891 --> 01:20:47,160
time. It's really made me feel good that,
you know, people actually saw my special,

1430
01:20:47,161 --> 01:20:50,260
they liked it and it made
him want to come out. And uh,

1431
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,080
I'm really psyched about that.

1432
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:55,440
And I know I've been telling you guys
I'm putting the dates up for 2009.

1433
01:20:55,441 --> 01:20:58,920
They're definitely getting up this
week. I talked to my booker and, uh,

1434
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,750
there's supposed to be
emailing me something.

1435
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:03,870
So I'll get the dates up up on my website,
up on my myspace page.

1436
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:08,280
Please come out to see me and you'll
watch me put together my next special that

1437
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:12,480
hopefully I will take this
summer coming summer. So anyways,

1438
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:15,960
here's a long question about
corporate America. Hey Bill,

1439
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:20,370
let me tell you why I effing hate
corporate America, especially Verizon.

1440
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,540
Exclamation point.

1441
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,050
They sold me a blackberry that recently
for the fifth time to keyboard,

1442
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:29,010
wouldn't work, couldn't make or
answer calls and couldn't do anything.

1443
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,580
Each time it would happen, I'd go to
Verizon, they would fix it for me,

1444
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:34,050
but the last time,
a few weeks ago,

1445
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:38,100
a buddy of mine in the army was cost the
day before he shipped off to Iraq and I

1446
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:42,210
was unable to answer the call. Jesus,
that sounds like a lifetime movie,

1447
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,590
like phone,
I need to say goodbye.

1448
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:52,100
So I went to Verizon furiously as you
should have demanding an explanation on

1449
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:54,750
why they sold so me such a shitty phone.

1450
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:58,650
They told me that they could do was
replace it with the same model phone in

1451
01:21:58,651 --> 01:22:03,360
which my response was all you'd be doing
is giving me a shiny or piece of shit.

1452
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:07,650
Ah, God bless you. God bless you.

1453
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:11,160
That's exactly what you should've said
and then shouldn't taken the phone and

1454
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:15,210
buries inside of his head and blamed
him for that design is if he designed it

1455
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:16,560
all right.
Leading me.

1456
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:21,210
And this basically led him to sign up
with a t and t and now Verizon wants to

1457
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:25,110
charge me with $125 early termination fee.

1458
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,430
I've been arguing my case with them on
the phone trying to explain to them that

1459
01:22:29,431 --> 01:22:32,880
if I still had Verizon I wouldn't
be able to make this phone call.

1460
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:37,650
They kept telling me that they understand
why I'm except upset and which my

1461
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:38,670
response was great.

1462
01:22:38,671 --> 01:22:43,260
So if you understand why you still ask
for my money and basically there is no

1463
01:22:43,261 --> 01:22:46,800
way that I'm going to buckle and give
it into them. Good, good for you.

1464
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,600
I keep calling them disputing them.

1465
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,410
I'll keep calling them to spooling
up for two years if I have to.

1466
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:56,010
To me it's a matter of principle
because what pisses me off is how these

1467
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:59,010
corporations are allowed to
conduct business. You know,

1468
01:22:59,011 --> 01:23:03,360
I don't even need the rest of the three.
The rest is exactly exactly that.

1469
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:07,150
They're bigger than you and they have
more money than you and they can wait you

1470
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:10,120
out and then they can send you shift
to a collection agency cause you're the

1471
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:13,720
little guy. And they know that
you're not going to do that.

1472
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:17,860
This is what you want to do. You want to,
you've got to do that old school thing.

1473
01:23:17,861 --> 01:23:18,180
Just go,

1474
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:23,180
I want it to speak to a manager and you
keep going up the ladder asking to speak

1475
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:26,530
to somebody, bumped them,
get everybody's name,

1476
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:31,090
keep using words like
ridiculous and outrageous.

1477
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:33,850
Like this is ridiculous.
This is outrageous.

1478
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:38,080
And a just do it the way like
an old lady would and just,

1479
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:42,010
just don't get off the phone. Don't
ever curse. If you never curse,

1480
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,670
then they can't.
Uh,

1481
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:49,990
they can't hang up on you. I'm full
of Shit. I don't know what to do.

1482
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:53,230
You know what? Go burn down their
fucking building or something.

1483
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:57,280
But I'm sorry man, I really didn't
answer that question well, but uh,

1484
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:01,570
I got to go in and do this meeting,
so whatever.

1485
01:24:01,571 --> 01:24:06,100
Thanks for listening to the Monday morning
podcast. I know this was real short,

1486
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:06,431
but hey,

1487
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:11,431
we had a nice yelling match with potential
yelling match with another person in

1488
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:14,920
the car,
which turned out to be friendly.

1489
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:17,890
How bad did you guys want that to
escalate into violence? You know, you did.

1490
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,080
Then you could have heard
me get my ass kicked.

1491
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,650
I that guy just rolled down the window
like I've ever taken a karate class.

1492
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,520
It was fucking ridiculous. But
fortunately, shit didn't go down that way.

1493
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:31,480
So anyways, it was very short,
very exciting. Tj Hooker,

1494
01:24:31,481 --> 01:24:34,540
episode of a,
the Monday morning podcast.

1495
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:38,970
Keep listening and please keep
sending the questions and, uh,

1496
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,420
that is that God bless all of you.

1497
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:43,600
Please come and see me at Carolines in
New York City the first week in December.

1498
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:47,950
And, uh, that is it. And I apologize
to the guy who I thought hit my car,

1499
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:52,870
but really didn't, if he's a
podcast listener. All right,
dude. That's it. All right,

1500
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:57,320
good. I take it easy. Bye to take it
easy. I take it easy. Bye. Alright.

1501
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:58,200
Take it easy.
Bye.
