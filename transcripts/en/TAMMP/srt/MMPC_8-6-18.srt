Hey, what's going on as bill burn his
time for the Monday morning podcast from

August 6th,
2018 what's going on?

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,080
How are you doing?
I am back.

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,990
I am back in Los Honga. Oles you
don't look at my last hanger lays now.

5
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:28,100
Everywhere else I go is just as
hot as here, but it's not as nice.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,840
Oh everybody walking around
sweating their balls off. You know,

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,710
you might as well be out here in
Hollywood with all the real people.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,450
The forward thinking, progressive
people. How we, we pushed the needle,

9
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:44,720
we changed the needle, we drive
the sled, whatever the fuck,

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,750
whatever the fuck we're, we're
always saying about ourselves. Um,

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,420
and you won't, you won't find anybody
out here more phony than me. Okay?

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,020
I'm telling you that right now. You're
going to meet me and you can take, wow,

13
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:01,340
that guy is so down to earth and I
want you to know it is all an act.

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,463
Okay?

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,010
You're not at my level. Sorry. Um,

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,430
anyways, I just got back from,
uh, I did Rochester, New York,

17
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:17,670
I believe that's the first time I did a
gig out there. Did it with Dean del Rey,

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,290
Dean del Rey, murdering, stealing the
spotlight. Everybody fucking, you know,

19
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,420
flipping out about him.
You know,

20
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:28,770
we so interesting with his glasses and
his tattoos and I just come out right.

21
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:33,330
Fucking old milk toast Freddy.
Right? Nobody cares. No,

22
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:37,320
I had a great time. Um, I had
a great time with that crowd.

23
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,080
And what a beautiful fucking
God damn town. Put a coach.

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,190
Why can't it just say it was a beautiful
town? What a beautiful f and g d town.

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,660
I have got to stop cursing around my kid.
I have to,

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,390
I have to do that. I'm starting to do it
with adults where I just say like, uh,

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,540
yeah, and the f the F and guys in a hall
and then I just go, sorry, I got a kid.

28
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,410
I need the practice.

29
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,500
But is that any better cause that my kid's
going to be walking around like, yeah,

30
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,940
he fine. He's an FNA hole, right? It's
people that are still going to be like,

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,220
I don't,
I don't know.

32
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,800
It probably would still be
adorable cause I have to tell you,

33
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:18,800
I just came home and uh, it
was her nap time, but she saw,

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,230
I was expecting her to be asleep but
it was five minutes into her nap time.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,800
But we have her on a schedule and so I
figured for sure she'd be taking a nap

36
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,160
and I came home and she wasn't,

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,030
I was like tip toeing in the house and
he's heard these little feet come running

38
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:37,920
out. Dat, Dat, Dat, dat, Dat, dat. It
is the best. It's the best thing ever.

39
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,870
One of the few things in life that is not
overhyped having a kid is the greatest

40
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,010
thing ever. So anyways, um,

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,400
Rochester, New York, gorgeous, right?

42
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:54,990
So I get there and a first thing
I see is a giant brick factory,

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,540
giant factory, smoke
stacks, the whole thing.

44
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,380
There's a little bit of steam coming
out of one of them, but you know,

45
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,000
flying in and I'm looking down and
I, I, you know, I'm doing all this.

46
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,030
I have a private pilot's license,
so I'm looking at the clouds,

47
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:10,640
trying to guess what's going on here.
There's a bunch of like, you know,

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,430
patches of clouds, a little
poofy, a little puff,

49
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:16,910
they're little ports or what does that
tell me? That tells me that there's,

50
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,360
there's,

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,630
there's a lot of uneven air there that
we're going to have a little turbulence.

52
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,860
Okay. Cause there's, there's the, the
air is being pushed up in certain areas.

53
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,430
It's not just straight across,
straight across. And it was even,

54
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,620
and they weren't like all big
and Puffy, you think, okay,

55
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:34,130
that's kind of some smooth fucking air
there. Right. I don't know if I'm right.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,750
Ground school was a long time ago and I
fly out here in La and there's really no

57
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,650
way that should go along the
coast every once in a while.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,520
So I looked down and I see this factory
and like I said,

59
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,900
it's, it looks like an old school thing or
they, they, they, they Brewen some beer.

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,050
Are they making some steel? What
are they doing there? And uh,

61
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,370
and I looked down and it was this giant
empty parking lot, couldn't see any cars.

62
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,180
And uh, so I was like, ah, you know,
they'll just turn that into lofts.

63
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:08,570
Everything just gets turned
into a place to live. You know,

64
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:11,300
a place where we made something
or was a place to go do something,

65
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,940
they'll just take it and it'll
turn into lofts and was just like,

66
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,120
we kept a lot of the character of this
place where we used to make things.

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,600
So would you like to move into this
luxury apartment with your Gucci bags even

68
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:29,760
though you're only making 50
grand a fucking year or whatever,

69
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:30,980
the whatever the fuck it is.
People,

70
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:35,640
please don't be that person everybody
because a old freckles head.

71
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,830
I got a bear. I got, I
got a bad feeling man.

72
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,850
It's like things are
not adding up out there.

73
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,130
Okay.

74
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,090
Everybody is walking around with
these car Dashi and level outfits are,

75
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,680
a lot of people are
and uh,

76
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,300
the amount of fucking 20 somethings I
see driving around in BMWs. It's like,

77
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,580
does everybody have a
fucking rich dad out there?

78
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,130
You driving around in a BMW okay with
your fucking Gucci glasses and all of this

79
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:05,760
shit. And then this is the
thing, nobody's at work.

80
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,840
This traffic 24 fucking seven.
I looked at a census.

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,640
The population really isn't,

82
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:15,580
at least the legal population isn't
really growing in this country.

83
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,590
I don't think if you are an illegal,

84
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,430
I don't think you're driving around in
a fucking BMW attracting all kinds of

85
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,510
attention to yourself. So unless
everybody's a fucking Uber driver,

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,490
but then where are they driving?
All those people during the day,

87
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,220
they're all late for work.
I Dunno.

88
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,210
I Dunno what's going on it
this, this, this, this happens.

89
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:44,190
This happens like every fucking
once every 10 years. You know,

90
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,620
first time I saw it was in the 80s,

91
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,040
everybody was doing blow all the yuppies.

92
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:54,090
Everybody was fucking walking around with
a Rolex and all of this fucking shit.

93
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,060
And then right there,
Fred over

94
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,990
all of a sudden you fucking, yeah,
I had nothing left in your nose.

95
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:06,590
Like he'd been boxing for 20
years. Right? Skinny ties are out,

96
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,430
z caviar, Ricci genes are in,
you're a fucking coke head.

97
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,880
You're fucked up your whole life. And, uh,

98
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,110
they repossessed you BMW then in the
90s. Right? It was a little rough time.

99
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:21,460
They're a little rough time
there. And then, uh, you know,

100
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,290
Bill Clinton came in according to the
Democrats, he turns it all around.

101
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:30,730
He saved it. There was a zero
fucking, you know, we had no debt.

102
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,670
He got us out of debt, you
know, of course, you know,

103
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,180
he used a couple of vaginas as a humidor,
but you know,

104
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:39,100
everybody's gonna have their faults.

105
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,820
What was he supposed to do?
Balance the budget,

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,560
play the saxophone and not fuck
around on his wife. I mean,

107
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,090
something's got to give.

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
And I'm telling you that right now is
a sober fucking person who is not drank

109
00:06:55,731 --> 00:07:00,230
since June. Something has
got to give, you know,

110
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,880
maybe you go out, you know, maybe
you don't give into the boot, okay?

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,600
Maybe you don't bang an intern,
all right?

112
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:12,770
But if he had made you lay off the ice
cream and you don't watch Internet porn

113
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,070
and you're basically, you're going
to paint yourself into a corner.

114
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,770
And next thing you know,
you're driving down the street,

115
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,560
talking to yourself going, am I
really going to go out here? And, and,

116
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,980
and I guess do a thrill
kill. Is that what I'm doing?

117
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,510
Am I going to kill a hitchhiker right
now to just somehow inject some sort of a

118
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,970
rush into my life, right.

119
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,560
Sorry. Um, anyways, I'm coming
off the wagon tomorrow for
one day. For one day only,

120
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,290
uh,
me and Joe Derosa Hall.

121
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,920
Ah, I'll tell you right now, if I live
as could talk, they would say, let me up,

122
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,600
throw in the towel, get off of me. Um,

123
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,290
I dunno what they would say, but it would
be, they would give us a fucking, uh,

124
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,440
a thrashing, um, if they
could speak anyways.

125
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,360
That sounds like a fucking book.

126
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,710
If you're Oregon's could speak right
and you just stretch it out over like,

127
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:21,300
you know, I'm, I'm the organs. Do you have
like 10, you know, one days your liver.

128
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,280
Next Day's your kidneys.

129
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,760
Okay.

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,820
Okay.

135
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,480

136
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,530
Um,

137
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,683
Okay.

140
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,550
booth workers just sitting there with
a cigarette dangling out of his fucking

141
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:05,660
mouth doesn't give a shit. Right.
It's getting close to retirement.

142
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,590
I think the, your kidneys would be
the most progressive and annoying.

143
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,260
He could just drink some more
water. Sorry. Um, anyways,

144
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,600
so then after,
what is it after a,

145
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,140
okay,

146
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,260
Rochester.
I then drove down beautiful,

147
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:31,261
beautiful drive from Rochester all the
way down into a western Pennsylvania and

148
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,450
then down into Youngstown,
which I'd never gone to.

149
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:37,180
And I was say Youngstown was
like three hours away from Ohio.

150
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,630
It's like an hour and a half.
I thought Akron was way down there too.

151
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:44,070
I thought they were way down the
fucking east side down there. Uh,

152
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,980
Pittsburgh and shit, but they're
not, they're right there. So I went,

153
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:52,420
got to go to famous Youngstown a, it
didn't get to see shit. I came in,

154
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,290
I saw that there was some sort of Italian
feast festival going on in the streets,

155
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,160
which I would have loved to partake in.
But I'm on my diet.

156
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay. I'm getting my revenge
body. Everybody, uh, no,

157
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm sticking to my diet here.
I'm actually doing really well with it.

158
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,870
Until this morning I couldn't
find a place in the, in the,

159
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,770
in the airport that had oatmeal.
So I just,

160
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,250
I got some bacon and eggs with Hash
browns, toast. But every other,

161
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,390
every other meal I ate, I ate the way I
was supposed to be eating. So whatever.

162
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:26,320
That was my one fuck up. And you don't
have a cheat day, you have a cheat meal.

163
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:29,940
So that was a cheap fucking meal.
I got on the plane and the, and,

164
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:33,730
and the fucking stewardess was like, uh,
you know, I always have my headphones on.

165
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:37,990
Right? And so she's got a wave in front
of me and I go, yes. And she goes,

166
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,950
what would you like to drink? I said,
water with ice. I got, that's all I want.

167
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,290
That's all I want. I'm good. All right.

168
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,970
In five seconds later she's waving at
me again. Would you like to breakfast?

169
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:50,110
I was getting mad at her like, how the
fuck did she know that that's what I meant

170
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,550
for the whole flight. So it was
like, no, Nah, I'm good, I'm good.

171
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,110
I'll just have the fucking water.
You don't want anything.

172
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,100
Did I say?
I didn't say that,

173
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,600
but I thought it and she,

174
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,870
I could tell she was good at reading
people and she sensed it and she's like,

175
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,010
this guy's a Douche.

176
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,730
And you know what's funny was I was
still wearing my suit and tie that I had

177
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:17,900
worn at the rough and rowdy taping the
night before cause I just didn't feel

178
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:18,890
like packing the suit.

179
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:23,390
And every once in a while if you have a
backpack and a little wheelie, carry on.

180
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,280
If you also have the garment bag, they'll
be somebody like the Dudley do. Right.

181
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,850
You don't like the cop in the middle
of nowhere. That has no excitement.

182
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,290
So they got to like fucking,
you know,

183
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,710
see how far away from the curb you
parked so they can give you a ticket.

184
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,780
Someone will say, ah, I'm sorry
sir, you have three items,

185
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:43,991
you know?

186
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:48,991
And then she puts me okay
in the position to say,

187
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,140
oh, excuse me ma'am,
I'm flying first class.

188
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,990
I'm allowed to break the rules.

189
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,200
Okay, I have, I have, I
go to your Sky Lounge.

190
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,840
Do you understand? Do you have any
idea what the fuck my dad does?

191
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,850
She puts me in that position or he,
but I never say that,

192
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,900
but I definitely think it,

193
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,300
and that's what makes me down to earth
is I don't say the things that I think.

194
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,880
So then the world has no idea
how fucking arrogant I see that.

195
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,080
That's how that works.
Um,

196
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,300
which you got to have a little bit
of arrogance in life. If you don't,

197
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:37,890
then no one's ever going to make a
statue of you. That's how it works. Um,

198
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,040
so anyways, so we're all waiting in a
line up and they're doing the usual thing.

199
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,700
Anybody active military duty,
anybody with kids?

200
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:47,400
Anybody with less than four limbs,
ghee,

201
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:51,240
you can board the plane now and all this
shit. Nobody budges I'm like, oh great.

202
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:55,560
It comes group one and all of a
sudden this fucking dude, right bald.

203
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:57,600
He's got the horseshoe,
you know, buzz down.

204
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:02,460
But he didn't shave the rest of it
walks by perfectly fine. No camouflage,

205
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,520
no fucking limbs missing,
no kids,

206
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,270
you know, can see he's not deaf. He
just walks by all of us. He goes,

207
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:13,830
hey, how you doing? The
guy go there, what's up?

208
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:17,510
And he just fucking beeps his thing and
it gets on the fucking place. It's like,

209
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:18,344
go on.

210
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,560
Do you going to put on his little
fucking outfit once he gets down the, uh,

211
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,460
the jetway there?

212
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,603
Yeah,

213
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,100
I dunno. Anyways, you would
know I had a great weekend. Uh,

214
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,680
so I get on the God damn
plane and I'm like, you know,

215
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,570
I didn't get a lot of sleep
because the rough and rowdy,

216
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:46,300
Yvette was fucking unbelievable.
I am going to talk to you
about that. All right.

217
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,990
But it's gonna be a great story here.
So I'm sort of teasing that.

218
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:54,300
So he continued. I'll wait. You could fast
forward through all of this. Well, um,

219
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,480
I, I'm really into me TV
and old movies right now.

220
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:01,420
I just go through these phases
and I was watching this. Uh,

221
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,190
the postman always rings twice,
which I remember from the 80s,

222
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,820
and I thought it was an original
Brian Depalma film film.

223
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:14,230
I didn't know he remade it,
but it kind of seems like he took

224
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,480
the name of the movie and then he like
switched it up. He did the Jimmy Page,

225
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,210
you know what I mean? Like if Robert
Plant just switched the lyrics,

226
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,320
they wouldn't had a fucking problem.

227
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,470
Cause for a lot of those songs that Jimmy
get in trouble for, he, you know, he,

228
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,510
he changed the arrangement enough that
of Robert just switched up the lyrics a

229
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,630
little bit here.
I believe it when he says that he,

230
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:38,860
that he wouldn't have gotten in trouble,
um, or sued that many fucking times.

231
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:39,610
So anyways,

232
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,610
plowing ahead and watching this thick and
just some of the shit that they say to

233
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:45,970
women in these things.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,980
This guy was in love with this woman
and they were trying to plot killing her

235
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,700
and at some point they, I dunno, they,

236
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,670
they came up with the idea and they
thought it was a good idea and they could

237
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:01,480
get away with it and they were excited
and he just grabs both their arms and he

238
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:04,410
goes, now kiss me before I sock. Yah.

239
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,130
And that was considered a music back
then because guys didn't know how to

240
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:16,360
express love, but there were guys beating
women where the guy's beating women.

241
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:20,110
But when did beating women become a fad?

242
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,110
Like when did that first happen?
I know grunge was in the early nineties.

243
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:27,760
I'll have to look that up. Um, and I'm
going to leave that open. Ended to,

244
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,160
cause somebody is going to post that
and then somebody is going to be like,

245
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:34,570
you know, is bill per really dense. Um,

246
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,500
anyways,
and then I was watching 77 sunset strip,

247
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:43,450
my favorite fucking show on TV and I'm
into the first season where they have

248
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:46,870
like the, uh, the matinee idol look
at and Efram Zimbalist juniors is,

249
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:49,690
he's like not even an in episodes.

250
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,550
And what somebody was saying was he was
basically the Steve Urkel of 77 sunset

251
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,384
strip.

252
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,450
They got him in there and then he just
kept getting more and more and more lines

253
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:02,470
that he just fucking took over and
then they phased everybody else out.

254
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,730
So anyways, the, uh, the Dream Boat
Guy, they're the lead of the show.

255
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,460
He's a, he meets this woman.
She goes, I'm convinced my,

256
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,810
my husband's trying to kill me. He's
having an affair with his secretary. Uh,

257
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:19,200
you know, I, the brake
lines were cut on my car.

258
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:23,760
He almost accidentally hit
me with his boat. And, uh,

259
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:26,040
I think he tried to poison
me when he made me a drink.

260
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,310
And what's funny is this woman
is gorgeous and this, this guy,

261
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:32,780
he's gotta be 40 years
older than her and a,

262
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,280
which amaze me that this guy was
already going to trade her in. You know,

263
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:39,000
cause that's what those guys do. They
just sort of collect them like a cars.

264
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,040
So I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with that. You know,

265
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,390
there's nothing wrong with the
objectifying a woman if it's that obvious.

266
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,780
You know what I mean?
Cause she's uh, what's,

267
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:56,380
what's the material I guess
gold dig in you yet? Oh,

268
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,960
it's like I know you're here
for this stuff and you know,

269
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm here so you look good on
my arm and I can, uh, you know,

270
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,840
fuck something that doesn't even
remotely look the way I do naked.

271
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,020
It's an arrangement.

272
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,990
But what happens because
there's no love there.

273
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,790
Somebody always ends up pulling the plug
first and then it gets fucking ugly.

274
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,570
So anyway, she goes, this guy's
trying to kill me. She goes,

275
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,780
I'm convinced these haven't, uh, you know,

276
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,930
he's having an affair with his secretary.

277
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,500
So he goes down over to the
office to investigate, right?

278
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,750
And he comes walking in and you know,

279
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:40,690
he's about ready to meet a woman
cause the saxophone starts playing,

280
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,930
which was what they always did back
there, right? They just play the song.

281
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:46,540
There's this beautiful Asian woman
comes walking out and they just,

282
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,210
it's his secretary.
She comes out and the Sax

283
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,820
[inaudible]

284
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,160
right. He's always hitting
on him and shit. And this,

285
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,900
this is his opening line
under it goes. Yes. He goes,

286
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:05,010
they told me you're Boston ported
oriental art. I have to agree.

287
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,280
This is what he said.
The sad thing is,

288
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:11,550
is that same shit is still set
in a Hooters every fucking night.

289
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,950
Bio by a man of a certain age. And
then he grabbed her and said, no,

290
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,240
kiss me before he saw you.

291
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,533
MMM.

292
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,711
You know,
it's funny.

293
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:23,930
That's one of the first things I
said to Nina when I first came home.

294
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,653
Yeah.

295
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,520
It's just something, some
lines of too good. You just,

296
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:30,900
you just have to repeat them.
Sweeney it was,

297
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:35,901
let's get into rough n rowdy
number four from Youngstown.

298
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,420
Um,
unbelievable night.

299
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,840
I don't think I'm telling you why I
can't even believe I get paid to do that

300
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:47,370
shit. It's just like, it's
so much fucking fun. And uh,

301
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,600
I dunno.
It's usually just hanging out,

302
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:54,660
watching people beat the shit out of each
other. What, what, what's not to like,

303
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,650
like I, I've just, I dunno,

304
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,650
do you just sit there watching the
fights and even the ones that are bad,

305
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,980
they're hilarious. First of all,
the, the, the fight card started off,

306
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,210
it had two brothers like blood brothers
fighting each other and in their promo

307
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:16,050
videos, one was saying that
my mother never loved me,

308
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,250
you know, and I'm like, oh, Jesus is
this guy's the victim of the family.

309
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:24,150
And then his brother gets on and confirms
it goes, yeah, she fucking hates him,

310
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,060
you know, always hated him. Right?

311
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,840
All he does is sit around and play video
games and I'm in the National Guard and

312
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:35,700
I'm out here crushing it. So the brother,
when is it is, you know, a little,

313
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:40,680
uh, what do you call it, ric
flair, sort of a promo video.

314
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,270
He said that the military is overrated.
They're a bunch of this soft

315
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,830
fucking hilarious trashing his brother.

316
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,520
And then they went out there and they
beat the shit out of each other now.

317
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:57,480
And I had to root for the
older brother because I,

318
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:58,980
there's this unwritten rule.

319
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,950
I don't know if it's something
somebody told me or I just, I just,

320
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,510
just how I felt. You can never let
your younger brother beat you up.

321
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,630
You just cannot,
you cannot ever let that happen.

322
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:11,790
You have to be in the mindset of,
you know,

323
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,700
you're going to have to murder me and
I know you don't want to go to jail.

324
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,440
That's where you have to be mentally. You
just can't have it. CanNot fucking head.

325
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,274
Let that happen.

326
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,350
And I sat there and I watched it happen
on pay per view and I got to tell you as

327
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:29,670
an older brother, it made me
sick. Great fight though. Um,

328
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,730
couple of Youngstown firemen,
Jesus Christ,

329
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,100
one went in there and just fucking
knocked this guy out to the,

330
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,400
it was the first time I saw a guy really
get knocked out where he went to get

331
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:42,050
back up again and went back down
again. First of all, he, he,

332
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,580
when he first went down, he was doing
that thing. Do you know Bill Gates to do,

333
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,670
what's that thing that the guy from
the Carolina Panthers would do after a

334
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:53,610
touchdown?
It was a really easy sort of move,

335
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,220
which is why white people
are ruined it so quickly.

336
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,650
You sort of bring your
arms out to the side.

337
00:20:59,490 --> 00:20:59,980
Yeah.

338
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,210
[inaudible] is that what they call it?
Yeah,

339
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:04,550
he looked like he was doing
that the way Bill Gates did,

340
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:07,190
where he didn't have his elbow bent.
He just draped it across his eyes.

341
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:10,210
Like the sun was beaming down there.
He was laying there like that.

342
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,350
And uh, and then he rolled over
and he went to get up and uh,

343
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,210
he went fucking back down
again and, and it was a, yeah,

344
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,630
that happened. And then, uh,
what else, what were some
of the other highlights? Oh,

345
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,010
pig versus punk.
The cop fight in the skateboarder,

346
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,290
skateboarder proved he was a punk.
He didn't show up.

347
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,450
So at the last second they got a bouncer.

348
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,170
Yeah.

349
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,900
So you got a cop and you got a bouncer.
Who's kidding?

350
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:43,590
Who a bouncer is just a cop
that never went pro. Right.

351
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,310
So it's a lot of overlap.

352
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,450
So they fucking get it in the ring and
all my, that's the cop, first of all,

353
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:56,400
I didn't realize he had lost
his job because he did a
drive along or ride along,

354
00:21:56,401 --> 00:22:00,120
whatever the fuck you call it. And
uh, somehow the mayor got wind of it.

355
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:03,480
And you didn't fucking like it. So they
fired the guy and I got to tell you,

356
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:08,310
a bar stool sports, uh, paid
two years of the guy's salary.

357
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,290
Um, and anyways, he went
in there and Jesus Christ,

358
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,030
and this was a,
he fought a bounce and a,

359
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:19,620
granted the guy didn't fucking
have any time to prepare and uh,

360
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,480
and it looked like it. Holy
Shit. This guy was fast,

361
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,610
strong, knew what the fuck he was doing,
had decent footwork. I mean, you figure,

362
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:30,600
you know,
the cops,

363
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,380
they teach him some of that MMA shed
will stand up a little how to choke a guy

364
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:37,440
out or whatever. And uh, he just,

365
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:40,680
he beat the shit out of this fucking guy,
but I got to tell you,

366
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:42,870
the bouncer could take a punch man.
He fucking,

367
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,970
he ate all of them until the last one.
And then that was kind of it.

368
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,160
And um,
then the cop,

369
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,860
the cop got ops of out of the ring and
everyone's going like really huge date,

370
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,200
three inch day.
Like give him his fucking job back.

371
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,860
And then he proceeded
in the post interview,

372
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:04,580
I think to ruin any chance of ever
getting a job as a cop anywhere.

373
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,710
They said to him, they go, hey, so are
you upset? You know, did you do that?

374
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:16,910
The mayor, you know,
uh, stepped in and said,

375
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:19,910
your police chief, either it's you
or him, are you upset with him?

376
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:22,250
Now what he should have said was like,
listen to,

377
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:25,160
there's a lot of variables involved.
Um,

378
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,850
I have respect for the office of the
mayor and the mayor himself. He was,

379
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,480
Dee did what he felt was best and a,
I'm not gonna argue with that.

380
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,230
I'm just happy to have the opportunity
to come down here and get the people in

381
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,600
Youngstown some entertainment. That's
what he should have said. But he did like,

382
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,710
are you upset with the Mary's just
like, I don't give a shit. Yeah,

383
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:44,240
I was fucking mad and I fucking,

384
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:49,020
I brought that fucking anger in there
and he said, it's just like, all right,

385
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,580
that's a wrap on the criminal
justice. Well, who knows?

386
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,950
I will just say the tape is out there.
So if anybody ever like

387
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,990
where to do some sort of, I
dunno, Internet search on them,

388
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,330
but I think they kind of
just check to see, you know,

389
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,910
if you were watching any porn, you
know, isn't that kind of where they go?

390
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,380
I have no idea. And then the end,
the uh, the highlight, the a,

391
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,390
the headlining match gay pat versus
the two time convicted felon homophobe.

392
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,830
Okay.

393
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,640
Oh, and I almost forgot to
mention, uh, Pat McAfee,

394
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,340
former puncture of the country,

395
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,700
any Indianapolis Colts to that guy.

396
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,890
Absolutely crushed it as he would,
he was the MC for all the, uh,

397
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:37,911
the major.

398
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:41,810
They'd like four or five major fights
and he would go into the ring and do the

399
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:45,710
announcements and he
was fucking hilarious.

400
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,380
Hilarious. This one guy
went in his name, just,

401
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,650
we'll just say his name was
Edward Robinson the second,

402
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,120
and he was like standing
in the red corner,

403
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,330
hidden the sloppy gray shorts and
you'd go, this is this whole fucking,

404
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,280
they would like make fun of you. And
then he says the guy's name, he says,

405
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:08,420
like he says,
Edward Robinson does second.

406
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,990
The second day was more than one.

407
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,020
I'm butchering his delivery,

408
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,380
but he did just the way
he fucking ripped apart.

409
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,280
The fact that this guy went by the second,

410
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,680
the fact that he repeated the second
again and then tagged it with there was

411
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:34,040
more than one just so intelligently.

412
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,810
It's so succinctly fucking

413
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,570
basically says what everybody thinks
when they hear the second. It's like,

414
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,100
I don't who gives a fuck why you acting
like you're Henry the eighth. You know,

415
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:49,040
like you use some fucking king,
you just some fucking jackass.

416
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,850
Nobody gives a fuck.
And they did that too with the felon.

417
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,440
He is a two time,
two time convicted.

418
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,120
He was fucking unbelievable.
Unfucking believable. Um,

419
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,600
so anyways, gay pat goes in there
and I'm not gonna lie to you.

420
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,630
Everybody was nervous cause it was, you
know, it was a, it was this guy, you know,

421
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:14,990
he said all his fucking homophobic shit.
I ain't know he was also playing a role.

422
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,540
He was also helping a, you know,
sell the fight and everything,

423
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,440
but like nobody wanted to see
that, you know, and I, and I was

424
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,030
okay,

425
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,390
really happy that the whole
crowd was on pat side.

426
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,370
They were chanting his name,
Gay Pat Gay Pat, right. And, uh,

427
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,040
oh my God, I almost forgot fucking
raccoon boy. This guy went by raccoon boy.

428
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,340
He would wear a fucking raccoon
hat like Davey fucking crocket.

429
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:43,920
And for whatever reason,
he came down the aisle in a Trashcan,

430
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,260
one of those recycle fucking trash cans.

431
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:50,520
He was in there peeking out like a
fucking raccoon and they wheel them down

432
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,230
while they did his intro.

433
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:55,950
And then he tried to get his big body
out of there with boxing gloves on.

434
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,100
And it was some of the best
comedy I've seen in a while.

435
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,990
He was very upset that they didn't let
him wear his, uh, his leather vest,

436
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,490
which I thought in a very subtle way
was him giving support to gate pat.

437
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,630
Cause it was very al Pachino cruising.
It didn't look like a biker vest,

438
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,010
I guess when you're shirtless, you know,
he looked like a fat Freddie Mercury,

439
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,600
you know, if like if Freddie lived and
continue to eat steak Bob's or started,

440
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:24,850
I should say, he was always in good
shape, right. So anyways, and uh,

441
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,390
he went in there and he got,
uh, he got exterminated.

442
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,430
Okay.

443
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,360
It was another one there.

444
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:37,730
These two fat guys fight and one of
the fat guys was beaten. The share,

445
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,520
the other guy who went by the Dale
show and his name was not Dale,

446
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,360
and he was getting the shit kicked,
shit checked out of them.

447
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,460
And then the other dude had
to stop because he was so
fat that the head gear was

448
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,430
choking up.
And what killed me was,

449
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:57,330
it was like sort of looked like it
was underneath the bottom of his job.

450
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,980
But who am I to say that it wasn't,

451
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:02,310
it was probably the combination of the
strap under the jaw and the eight pounds

452
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,300
of blubber around the guy's neck.
Um,

453
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,790
and there was a lot of fucking wild
eyed people getting pumped up and then

454
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:13,200
wasting their energy,
trying to turn fear into courage.

455
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,000
You know,
like there was one guy,

456
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,450
he came out and he's just swinging wildly
and he got a couple of punches in and

457
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:21,310
then like his headgear got messed up,
messed up. So they had to, you know,

458
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,050
have a quick stoppage. And as they
were fixing it, he was going like,

459
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,460
like flipping out. And we're like, well
this guy's fucking crazy. And then he,

460
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:32,220
I don't think it landed another punch
for the, for the rest of the fight.

461
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,970
I think he let out all of that fucking
energy and that was over. So anyways,

462
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,290
this is all coming from a guy who would
get the shit kicked out of them by any

463
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,830
of these people. Okay. Um, so anyways,

464
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,870
gay pat comes in and he was
just totally fucking comp.

465
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,010
Went in there and then I saw the convict
going. I'm like, he's not that big.

466
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,520
He's only five, eight, one 80. So he's
a little stocky, but he's not that tall.

467
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,740
Gay Pat is six for a buck 80.
So they weighed the same.

468
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,850
So everybody knew that the convict was
going to bull rush him and everything.

469
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,360
And uh, I got to tell you, I'm gay.

470
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:12,360
Pat fought a filthy fight.

471
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,930
Mayweather would have been
envious with the amount of elbows.

472
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:21,610
This guy through forearms to the face, he
was leaning on him. He used his height.

473
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:25,900
He had a tremendous fucking strategy.
His corner was great.

474
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,810
They trained him and uh,

475
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,560
he came out with the victory and he
got some good shots in there too.

476
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:34,780
It was a, it was great.
It was one of the, uh,

477
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,810
then it was such a fucking relief
that he wanted, because yeah,

478
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,170
I was getting nervous that if he just
came in and took an right and was knocked

479
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:44,720
out really bad and the crowd
was actually against him,

480
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:47,060
like that could've gotten
really ugly. So, uh,

481
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,280
kind of dancing between
the raindrops on that one.

482
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:52,760
But I want to thank everybody at
Barstool sports for letting me do that.

483
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:55,760
I literally, when I saw the arena and
just, I just started smiling like,

484
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:59,690
I can't believe, you know, I go
to a zillion sporting events.

485
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:02,340
I've always wanted to be in the broadcast
booth. I know this is, you know,

486
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,450
not at the professional level,
but neither am I.

487
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,750
So the next one is going to be
in Kentucky outside this one,

488
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,750
like the Thrilla in Manila.
It's going to be outside.

489
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,790
This is going to be at a baseball stadium.

490
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,500
I believe it's October 5th in
Kentucky. Unfortunately. Uh,

491
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:24,470
I don't think I'll be able to make
that one cause I believe I have gigs.

492
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:28,160
I think I'm in Connecticut and
Boston that weekend, but uh,

493
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:33,260
I'm definitely going to rent it. Okay.
You get it for 15 bucks a few days,

494
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,930
but right up until the day
of the fight day, the fight,

495
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,780
it's fucking 1995 I'm telling you.

496
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,620
Tremendous night of entertainment.
Uh, anyways. All right,

497
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:43,580
so now that I've done that,

498
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,130
I'm going to read a little
bit of advertising here and
then we're going to talk

499
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:50,870
red sox, Yankees at New York.
Thanks. Hang in there. Okay.

500
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:54,290
Don't think this is, don't think I'm
going to talk about this the way ESPN did.

501
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,010
All right. I am not in that business.
All right. Frame. Bridge everybody

502
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,630

529
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:43,050
what was the upside for him?

530
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,693

stacks of resumes, a

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,310
I just imagined during that whole read
everybody's girlfriend or wife going.

584
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:33,470
This isn't funny.
I don't understand beyond these.

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,350
I'll take out my deck.

589
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,010
It piss on your Ted and put on
some fucking soft on Delaware.

590
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,590
That rubs my balls better than
you since we've been married.

591
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,940
How about a blow job
every once in a while.

592
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,220
All right, you've heard me
obsessed over me, over me undies.

593
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,590
You've heard me talk about how they are
three times softer than cotton and come

594
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:13,050
with fun new prints each month.

595
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,550
But I've got a big scoop that I'm so
excited to share with you all be on these.

596
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:21,780
Just gave their membership a massive
upgrade. All those dirty, old,

597
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,140
whole written fucking disgusting
underwear you've hung onto.

598
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,470
It's time to throw them all
out and give you a top drawer.

599
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:31,560
The refresher it deserves
each month. Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,300
If you keep your underwear for a long
time and you're a single guy like you've,

601
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,310
you've worn those through relationships,
you've worn those,

602
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,040
probably that same pair of
underwear when you picked her up.

603
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:46,200
I broke up with her and then met the
next fucking check each month me undies,

604
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:49,470
we'll release a new executive
print that only members can get.

605
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:50,970
Well I gotta be equal opportunity women,

606
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:54,620
you've probably wore those panties since
you went down to the Virgin Islands.

607
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,050
Get your fucking hair braided and bang
some guy in the island but didn't count

608
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,280
it cause it was in a different country.

609
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,100
These could be
collaborations with artists,

610
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,400
brands or other unique designs.
You're going to definitely want to have.

611
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,900
Members will also pay less for everything
on the [inaudible] website with

612
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:16,440
special member pricing. That means
if you want a second pair of undies,

613
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,630
a bracelet or a law or lounge pants,
you'll play less than anyone else.

614
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,070
The membership comes with no strings
attached unless she wants some kinky pair.

615
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:29,160
You know when we get like the laces
up the cracker, their ass. Nah,

616
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,240
I don't think they make those over here.
You could switch style. I say kinky.

617
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:36,200
How old am I skip the
month or cancel at anytime.

618
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,470
I love these undies
according to this copy.

619
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,430
They are the softest underwear I've ever
put on according to them and they come

620
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:47,840
with fun prints that I can
match with socks or a bralette.

621
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,500
They come with a hundred
percent satisfaction guarantee.
If you don't love him,

622
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,390
then fuck you man.
Just send them back for a full refund.

623
00:38:56,391 --> 00:39:00,320

653
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,510
Let's talk some baseball

654
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,850
bump, bump, bump, bump,
bought up a pop up.

655
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,460
Wow.

656
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,280
The red sox sweep the Yankees.

657
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:58,520
How about that for game fucking sweet.

658
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,420
We didn't have Chris sale
data and Aaron judge,

659
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,860
but the fucking luck was on our side.
I thought,

660
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,850
I thought if we were lucky we were
going to split with them, you know,

661
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,030
and it was going to be, you
know, I don't know what happened.

662
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:17,080
It was just one of those things.
We were hot, they were not. And uh,

663
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:20,770
they should have one. Certainly
the last game, the last two games,

664
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,320
they should have won.
They blew leads in.

665
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,430
They fucking had a
meltdown in the last one.

666
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:28,300
So the red sox are now
nine and a half games up.

667
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:29,620
So what does that mean

668
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,850
to people in sports radio
on ESPN and all that shit?

669
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:37,940
You know what it means to them?
The race is over.

670
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,680
You know why it's over?
Cause we're up nine and a half games.

671
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,870
There's 48 fucking days,

672
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,350
probably even more. I just, I just counted
the games in August and in September.

673
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,910
What in the fuck I'm sitting there.
What are these people talking about?

674
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,390
Then it's like, oh yeah, that's right
there in the job of overhyping shit.

675
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,610
Hype it up to the fucking God damn moon.
And if it comes in,

676
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:08,600
you look like a genius and if it
doesn't come in then you gotta be like,

677
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:12,080
what happened to the Red Sox? What
happened to this guy? What happened?

678
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:16,460
What the fuck happened? They
started asking why? Acting like,

679
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,260
like the teams that they hype said they
were going to do what the fuck they said.

680
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,500
And I understand it now because
they are 24 hour sports network.

681
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,990
So what the fuck are you gonna do during
these 16 hours a day when there's no

682
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:34,640
fucking games going on? What
are you going to do? Yeah,

683
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,900
you just gotta. You gotta go
big. You got to say crazy shit.

684
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:39,940
So guys like me lose their fucking mind.

685
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:44,260
Do the fucking red sox were up
by like 16 or 18 games in August.

686
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:49,150
In 1978 the Yankees came to town.
That was the Boston massacre.

687
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:51,610
We had the one game playoff
and then it was over

688
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,580
the fucking,
the mets were like 9 million games out.

689
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,040
They came back in 1969 I don't have time
to look all this. This fucking happens.

690
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,110
Almost like dude,

691
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,540
the red sox wrap by like 1213
games like four or five years ago.

692
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,480
2012 and we shit,
the bed

693
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,730
didn't even make the fucking playoffs

694
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,790
did we had Valentine as a manager. Then
the next year we won the world series.

695
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,070
So I, I don't even know what they're
talking about here. This is far from over.

696
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:29,190
We have six games left
alone with the Yankees.

697
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,800
We got two series,
I believe with the Cleveland Indians.

698
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:34,590
Everybody's sleeping on Terry
Francona and the Cleveland Indians.

699
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,660
I still think Terry is the best manager
of baseball. Uh, he, he, you know. Um,

700
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,850
and what about the Houston Astros?

701
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,010
Okay.

702
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,150
They're no slouches either.

703
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,680
And how about the fact that despite the
fact the Yankees a nine and a half games

704
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:50,930
out, there's still six
games up in the wild card.

705
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,300
Okay.

706
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,830
So according to what I was watching,

707
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,240
that dude Mike box seat Mike
from the old Mike and Mike Show,

708
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:01,660
now he's on a different show.
He was saying the tea according to him,

709
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:07,300
it's essentially fucking over despite
the fact that the red sox have blown

710
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,370
leads. Historically 1812 gay, we
fought, we fought, we fucked this.

711
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,730
This franchise alone is fucked it
up twice in my life that I remember.

712
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,510
Okay.

713
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,810
I don't have time to look up the
other ones. Okay. And then, okay,

714
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:22,060
so now using that logic,

715
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,330
I don't mean to just put it on him
because everybody was saying it all right.

716
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,580
Using just that fucking logic.

717
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,530
The Yankees being up
six games in the card,

718
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,710
they only need to be up six games for
another two weeks and then the wildcard is

719
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:41,250
over. Is that how the math
works? That's another thing too.

720
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,220
All the Yankees got to do is just keep
playing the way they've been playing all

721
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,960
year and they're going to
win the wildcard. Okay.

722
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,490
Which means then we all go to the
playoffs were all zero and zero.

723
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,470
Yeah.

724
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,960
So you know what happened this weekend?
A whole bunch of nothing

725
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,840
because the greedy MLB once or wildcard,

726
00:45:03,841 --> 00:45:06,690
they want more people in the playoffs
so they make more fucking money.

727
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:11,691
Cause you know you can't make enough
fucking money in defense of Major League

728
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:13,410
baseball,

729
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,730
the Federal Reserve is a private
corporation that prints the money for this

730
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,830
country.
So they keep us all running on the wheel.

731
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,980
Even those guys was their mistresses
in their yachts and their masquerade

732
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,940
parties and all that. To the point they
have to keep adding rounds of baseball.

733
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:31,440
See like right now as a red sox fan,

734
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:36,000
I would be excited that we swept the
Yankees if there wasn't a fucking wildcard

735
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,300
that just negates the whole thing.
So

736
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,550
what is all that that meant was maybe
if we meet the, uh, the Yankees,

737
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,690
maybe 50, 50. If we meet
the Yankees in the playoffs,

738
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,730
if we continue to win the way we do,

739
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:57,050
the first two games of the
series will be played at Fenway.

740
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,920
That's all that meant.
Okay.

741
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:06,170
Everybody just stand down and
fucking relax. Dude. I got,

742
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,660
I got a bet with my agent and Paul Versey.

743
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:13,430
I bet him 50 bucks each and been
doing it the last two seasons.

744
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,140
We bet the, uh, the red sox Yankees
series, you know, whoever wins, you know,

745
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,550
the regular season series, right?
And then if we go to the playoffs,

746
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:26,990
I think it will bump up to 100 bucks
a game each. Right. Keeps it fun.

747
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,040
It got me back into baseball and I am
fucking loving baseball now. Right?

748
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,180
Um, those two guys, they had
their fucking head in the oven.

749
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,100
It was hilarious. Fucking
hilarious. It's just like

750
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,140
you guys a Yankee. We'd been up 18
games and you guys and you came back.

751
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:48,110
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Jesus Christ,

752
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,330
just packing it in.

753
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,760
And maybe we maybe actually questioned
both of them as human beings.

754
00:46:55,850 --> 00:47:00,410
I really hope to hear this,
you know, fuzzy right now.

755
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,220
You can't rob a bank with that guy.
The second anybody goes,

756
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,860
like if ric flair walked by
and went, whew, you know,

757
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:09,710
he would think the cops were coming and
he would just pack it and you would that

758
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:12,830
you think we would think it was over.
Now I've got to be thinking my agent,

759
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:16,520
you know, when a a a, a promoted
pushes back a little bit,

760
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:20,200
he's not getting me the
best deal. Um, anyways,

761
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:24,180
so there's plenty of time left. I
am really looking forward to, uh,

762
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,740
when the red sox have a, uh, the Indians.

763
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:33,960
And then we also play the Astros are the
two that I'm paying attention to. Oh,

764
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,240
pay the Astros and September 7th,
eighth and ninth.

765
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:40,750
And I'm hoping Justin Verlander is
pitching because I want to see how we do

766
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:41,800
against that best.

767
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,430
MMM.

768
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,770
And then we get some, you know, yeah, we
got to, we've got one series in August.

769
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,500
I don't have Internet access
here for some fucking reason,

770
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:57,070
but in September we got the Indians on
the 21st 22nd and 23rd and then I believe

771
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,090
we closed up September. I always think
that not they play for the first three,

772
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:03,520
four games in October.
But we have a,

773
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:08,570
the Yankees 28 29 30 if not October
1st maybe my cell phone will work here.

774
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,973
MMM.

775
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,720
Like how funny is that with
you have 48 games left Europe,

776
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,050
nine and a half games on
this one team that you're,

777
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,320
you're still going to play six more times
in everybody's gone. Yeah. Yeah man,

778
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,350
it's fucking over.
I'll tell you right now.

779
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:30,740
That's why most people's dreams don't come
true. You know, not because of the, the,

780
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,570
the patriotical fucking
structure. Whatever the fuck
people are saying nowadays.

781
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,770
It's cause you quit.

782
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,250
Yeah.

783
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:41,810
All right. And I'm not saying that things
are, are, are, are unfair out there,

784
00:48:41,811 --> 00:48:45,770
but like nobody gives a fuck.
Nobody cares.

785
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,020
Everybody's too busy trying
to keep this shit afloat.

786
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,000
To have time to give a shit about you
and your fucking drink. All right.

787
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,350
So why don't you grow the fuck up?
I don't know.

788
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,010
I'm just trying to fill time right here,
people.

789
00:48:58,011 --> 00:49:02,720
I don't mean to fucking come down on
you, man. What's the next October?

790
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:04,840
Okay,

791
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,770
no game scheduled. Wow. Look
at that. No Games in October.

792
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,920
I can't remember the last time they
finished the regular season is September.

793
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:14,830
That's kind of cool. They're playing
the world series in like November now.

794
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,790
I guess they got to get
ready for all the playoffs.

795
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,760
All the rounds of the playoffs. Playoffs.
Um, anyways. All right, let's read some.

796
00:49:21,761 --> 00:49:25,870
Uh, so anyways, it was great to see
them when all those fucking games.

797
00:49:25,871 --> 00:49:27,730
It's nice to have that kind of a lead,

798
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,660
but I am by no means thinking that this,

799
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,120
this is over by any stretch of the means.

800
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,960
I will think that it's over when,
uh,

801
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:44,070
we're up nine and a half games with eight
games left and the Yankees are out of

802
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:49,540
the wildcard to,
that's when it's over.

803
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,630
Other than that, it's, it's
gets game on there. All right.

804
00:49:55,631 --> 00:50:00,010
Frame Bridge. Everybody. Uh, if
you've been listening to this show,

805
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,180
oh wait, what the fuck am I
doing? I'm reading the Goddamn
advertising. All right,

806
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,800
podcast comment. Hey Bill, on your
latest episode on Jesus Christ,

807
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,290
I really feel like I'm going
to get shit here. You're,

808
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,940
you said you don't appeal to women,

809
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:16,070
but just wanted to let
you know you have a des.

810
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,950
Okay.
That creeped me out.

811
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,830
Um,
all right.

812
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,830
Just for the record,
I'm 50 years old.

813
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,380
That was from a 23 year old son.
God,

814
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,850
if I fucking sat across the table from
a 23 year old, I give her a rattle. Um,

815
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,480
who's your will? Will
get bulky. Why we hated,

816
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,670
why we hate other redheads.
Jesus Christ. Hey, what's up?

817
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:49,930
Okay,

818
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,100
Billy,
no glutes.

819
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,560
I was listening to an old podcast when
you were talking about the paper planes,

820
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,030
music video, and that a group of
redheads made you feel weird. Yeah.

821
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:06,130
It was weird to see because you never,
you never see us.

822
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,830
You never see just a giant
group of redheads. You know,

823
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,100
we're like the spice in the stew.
You know what I mean? We're not,

824
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,580
we're not the beef in
the stove. Right. Uh,

825
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:20,250
I can say that I totally
agree with you on that part,

826
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:22,350
but I would actually go a
little bit further with that.

827
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:27,000
Of course you would say and say that
I hate or despise other redheads.

828
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,400
Oh, this is a self hating reddit. I
didn't say I was a self hating redhead.

829
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,830
Uh Oh Jesus. Here's my reason though.
They make me look bad. Simple.

830
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,240
I'm a normal guy, kind of tall.
Try to hit the gym often enough.

831
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:46,241
So I have what you once
called a standing six pack.

832
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,840
But most of the fucking red
heads are a fucking disgrace.

833
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,850
Just started shaped Dorky on athletic
unfunny losers with no charm.

834
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,960
Don't get me wrong. There are
exceptions, but not many. Anyway,

835
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:04,460
go fuck yourself and bring your balding
red headed ass to Iceland. You can't.

836
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,680
Um, I think with any
group that gets picked on,

837
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:14,210
you're hypersensitive in a negative way
to the way that people around you are

838
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:15,480
behaving.
Cause I know what it's,

839
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:20,510
I've seen the big pasty freckled shapeless
arms that for some reason they're

840
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:26,060
wearing like a, a a tank top.
I, I definitely agree with you.

841
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:30,440
I do feel that that necessarily women I
do feel with guys is a redheaded mail.

842
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,140
There's a certain level of
shape you have to stay in.

843
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,853
MMM.

844
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:40,630
Cause you're already going
to get picked on. So, um,

845
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,850
I and I do understand some
of that, but I am not a, uh,

846
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,300
I'm not self hating.
I don't hate the way I look.

847
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:52,300
I actually think I'm a good looking
guy. I do make fun of myself, but like,

848
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:53,963
mmm.

849
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,450
I Dunno. I don't get like, I
had never been anything else,

850
00:52:57,451 --> 00:53:02,160
so I don't know what the fuck, you
know, that would be like, but uh,

851
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,970
I do feel bad for redheaded
kids now because of

852
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,053
mmm.

853
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:13,210
You know, that South Park episode, like
the level of shit that, that like, that,

854
00:53:13,211 --> 00:53:16,210
that probably started, you
know, I can't, I can't,

855
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,420
can I play and I can't play them up.
Too Big of a fan.

856
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:22,840
I would say maybe whenever that
kick of Ginger Day came around,

857
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,730
like I'm so glad

858
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,820
I can't tell if I'm glad that that wasn't
around when I was a kid or I'm kind of

859
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:34,260
jealous because at least you knew
what date of fake sick on, you know,

860
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:38,210
as a redhead.
Like whereas when I was coming up there,

861
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,240
got to see like that was more
of a week rather than a day,

862
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,960
but a whatever it or what doesn't kill
you makes me, makes you stronger. Uh,

863
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:52,450
all right, Tom Cruise, helicopter. Um,

864
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:58,300
okay. Hey there. Billy Bald. The wise, uh,

865
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,510
Billy bald.
The wise,

866
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:05,300
I always feel like I should be figuring
out what the fuck that means. Bald,

867
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,210
the wise, the wise is, that's another
English word, kind of Billy Ball.

868
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:13,950
The wise, is that like a
character? I don't know. Anyways,

869
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,040
just wanted to hear your thoughts
on the new mission impossible film.

870
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:19,980
I have to see it. I haven't seen her
yet. I'm seeing three movies this week.

871
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,780
I'm seeing the Mr. Rogers movie.

872
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:27,170
I'm seeing eighth grade and
I'm seeing a mission possible.

873
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:28,471
All right.

874
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:32,190
So I'm seeing something from my childhood
and seeing how millennials deal with

875
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,640
being in the eighth grade and then I'm
just watching a big summer blockbuster.

876
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,100
So I feel like I'm, I'm, I
got a nice fucking, you know,

877
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:41,670
smorgasborg what the fuck's
going on out there? All right.

878
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:43,140
Just want to hear your
thoughts on a new mission.

879
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:46,590
Impossible and how Tom Cruise is
notorious for doing his own stunts.

880
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,010
Do people understand what the word
notorious means? That that's like a,

881
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,610
that's basically known
usually for a bad thing.

882
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:59,010
Um, I'd say he's famous
for doing his own stunts.

883
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,330
I feel like a lot of people don't know
what infamous in notorious meets. Uh,

884
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,260
anyways,
I read,

885
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:08,610
he learned how to fly a helicopter in
about three months for the film as a pilot

886
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:09,211
yourself,

887
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:13,560
that seems like a short amount of time
for someone to do the action sequence and

888
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:17,640
start work that was displayed.
Check out the link below. Thanks.

889
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:22,350
And Go fuck yourself. Well, I
think there's a, there, there,

890
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,470
there is a lot of this,
they're trying to sell a movie,

891
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:30,900
so whatever he did, they're going to,
they're going to shrink it down. Um,

892
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,990
but I don't care how long or how short

893
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,070
the amount of time he did what he did,

894
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:42,870
took an unbelievable amount
of fucking balls. And, uh,

895
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,730
I was talking to some director,
he goes,

896
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:48,870
I can tell you without a doubt bay
definitely shut that shit on the last day.

897
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,490
Meaning if he killed himself to think
that they could easily put a stunt man in

898
00:55:53,491 --> 00:55:57,780
there and they would still
have a movie, I don't know. Um,

899
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,040
I, I've just only seen the movie clip, Eh,

900
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:07,130
but there is no fucking way ever in my
pilot and career would I ever do anything

901
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:10,110
like that ever.

902
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:16,680
That's how I can fucking
tell you no fucking way. Uh,

903
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,030
I like to live, you know,
that's my shit. Ed. Uh,

904
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,630
I don't have problem with
stuntman. I really, you know,

905
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:28,110
I don't want to see them act and they
don't want to see me jumping in front of a

906
00:56:28,111 --> 00:56:30,720
fucking moving car and I
stay out of their laid.

907
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,270
I look how I'm acting like
I'm at Tom Cruise's level.

908
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:37,800
I just like that shit where you jumped
from one building to another and they

909
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:42,450
kept it in the film and he like broke
his foot or something like that. Uh,

910
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,330
yeah, that's like, like Jackie
Chan does shit like that. And then,

911
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:50,280
then Tom takes it to the next level
where he's, he's like, well, is he,

912
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,820
as far as I can tell you essentially just
knows the helicopter over and just was

913
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:58,620
flying straight down at the earth while
spinning. I believe, added that to it.

914
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,370
Uh, which I really believe is hard
enough to do on a fucking airplane.

915
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:06,630
Forget about an a helicopter,
like I don't understand. Um,

916
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:08,640
okay.

917
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,530
I don't know how that works, but
uh, you know, hats off to that guy.

918
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:18,480
That guy is, and he can also fly like
a, like a fucking jet, like a g five,

919
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,640
like just get in the
thing and fly to England.

920
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:24,700
Like I believe he's that level of a pilot.
Uh,

921
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,070
I would tell you though,

922
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,980
I would definitely rather fly with John
Travolta cause it seems like, you know,

923
00:57:28,981 --> 00:57:32,640
he dresses up like the captain and he
just, you know, straight and level.

924
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,500
It just sort of flies

925
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,600
where I feel like Tom Cruise big oh shit.
Look at that.

926
00:57:39,601 --> 00:57:43,800
And it would just do a fucking barrel
roll just to scare you so you can laugh at

927
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:44,250
you.

928
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,160
I remember having a long time ago telling
his story on fucking Letterman where

929
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:47,994
they,
they,

930
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,620
yeah,

931
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,530
they were up front and they thought it
was funny and they deep pressurize the

932
00:57:52,531 --> 00:57:54,540
cabin and they made the
guy in the back pass out.

933
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:57,660
They didn't like 100% but
they somehow made the,

934
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,300
the oxygen, I dunno, the mixture of it. I
don't know if there's too much to oxygen.

935
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:08,040
So he fucking overloaded on it and
got lightheaded and passed out. Uh,

936
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:09,810
I dunno,

937
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:13,860
but all I remember he was crying laughing
when he said it and I was like, yeah,

938
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:17,000
that guy's fucking guy's nuts.
But I,

939
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:20,530
I'm definitely going to see the movie
and I am a huge Tom Cruise fan. I had a,

940
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,840
I didn't, you know,
he's one of those guys.

941
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:25,020
I didn't realize how big a fan I was
until one day they listed all these movies

942
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:26,970
and I realized I saw like 80% of them.

943
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,673
MMM.

944
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,070
Yeah. Kind of like when you go to,
somebody dragged you to a concert.

945
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:35,870
Like I don't want to, I mean,
I know they are. I mean,

946
00:58:35,871 --> 00:58:38,980
I'm a radio fan of them and then you
get there and you're like, oh fuck.

947
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:43,600
They sing this song to, Oh my God, dude,
he's fucking awesome. Next thing you know,

948
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:46,990
you come home, you're downloading all that
music. That's what Tom Cruise is like.

949
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:50,950
Well, I can't wait to see the movie.
Uh, it's perfect. Scott. Tom Cruise,

950
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:55,300
he's got helicopters and they shot a lot
of it in Paris. I mean, I'm in, it's over.

951
00:58:55,870 --> 00:59:00,040
Um, anyways, lady asking for advice.

952
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,560
Hey Billy, no buns. I'm
loving this. You motivate me.

953
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:09,310
I'm going to the gym right after
this and I'm doing some squats. A,

954
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,880
I'm a 23 year old woman. Oh
by the way, I, I cannot, I,

955
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,730
I got one of those little fucking,
you know, you know, this little, uh,

956
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,550
foam rollers already had one of those,

957
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:22,620
but I've been using that religiously and
then I got one those little balls that

958
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:27,600
you could just roll out your fucking
legs, your glutes, your back,

959
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:31,500
the whole fucking thing when you're on
the road. If you're an old person like me,

960
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,420
it is a game changer. Game Changer. Uh,

961
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,620
anyways, I'm a 23 year old woman from
London and I love your podcast. Oh,

962
00:59:40,621 --> 00:59:44,190
thank you. I'm crushing it with a
23 year old ladies this week. Uh,

963
00:59:44,191 --> 00:59:46,170
you always say you want to
hear from more of US ladies.

964
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:49,680
I do cause it gets to one,
one side. So here I am.

965
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,140
I would love your advice
on my current situation.

966
00:59:52,141 --> 00:59:56,160
My parents were quite strict when
I was growing up, so I never,

967
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,350
I have never been on a date before.

968
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:04,230
Yeah I would say that goes a
little beyond. Quite strict.
I would say suffocating.

969
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,400
I still live at home.
I'm studying for my masters.

970
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:13,020
They are less strict now as my brother
is now married and they are now more

971
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:16,920
comfortable with me dating.
Well what the fuck is their problem?

972
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:22,490
I do that. That's like
sad. You should, you know,

973
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,920
lets say go out and fucking you know,
get gangbanged here but I you know,

974
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:28,850
go out and you know,

975
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:33,470
go on a date experience finding love,

976
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:34,800
losing it and fucking

977
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,560
yeah

978
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,320
that weird thing when you finally
erased their number on their phone.

979
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:42,410
I mean I can't, I know your phone. I can't
believe you missed all that. Anyways,

980
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:45,500
I'm studying part time and I am
working for the rest of the time.

981
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,780
How do I go about meeting New People?

982
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,910
The people I work with are all in their
mid forties and don't really socialize

983
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:56,510
outside of work. Any advice would be
appreciated. All right. Number one,

984
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:00,080
don't fuck any of those 40 year olds.
Okay.

985
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:06,330
Your work with them and they're
rolled. Don't do it. Okay.

986
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:11,220
God knows where the fuck those old dicks
of Ben stay away from him. All right.

987
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,440
You like a fucking one of those, you
know those, those nerds by the uh,

988
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,040
Star Wars action figures and it's a big
thing of the box has never been opened.

989
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,510
Your box has never been opened. All
right. It's worth a lot of money there.

990
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,993
Um,

991
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:27,600
yeah,

992
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,720
and also you're asking me how to meet
people when I've been out of the dating

993
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,460
scene for like 15 years.

994
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:38,400
I'm 50 years old and at no point in
my life was I still living at home,

995
01:01:38,401 --> 01:01:40,830
studying for my master's
while having a job.

996
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:45,630
I love that you felt enough about me that
you thought at some point in my life I

997
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:50,370
attained that level of success.
It was that pressed for time. Um,

998
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,680
how do I go about meeting New People?

999
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:55,650
Don't you guys just like
go on apps dating apps?

1000
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,880
You know what? I'm actually gonna I'm
going to phone a friend on this one.

1001
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,690
The rest of the podcast listeners guys,
how do you do it ladies?

1002
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:08,250
I should ask the ladies how
in this day and age, good,

1003
01:02:08,251 --> 01:02:12,510
someone with a vagina, 23 year old vagina
that has not had the seal broken yet,

1004
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,020
how can they go out into the dating world,

1005
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:21,350
avoid the dirty dicks and have a
nice entry into the dating world,

1006
01:02:23,901 --> 01:02:28,730
a positive experience that's going to
make her not be jaded and think that maybe

1007
01:02:28,731 --> 01:02:30,920
her parents were right for fucking,
you know,

1008
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:35,090
keeping her chained to a radiator for the
first quarter of a century of her life.

1009
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,730
Uh,
how should she go about doing it?

1010
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:42,780
I feel like dating apps is a lot of
guys on there just trying to fuck,

1011
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:47,750
you know, and then they, there's
these, no, no, that's that APP.

1012
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:52,160
That's that app where people just trying
to hook up this app is the more serious

1013
01:02:52,161 --> 01:02:55,370
app or what's to prevent someone to
go on there and just act like they're

1014
01:02:55,430 --> 01:03:00,260
looking for a relationship or they
just want to bang you. So, um,

1015
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:07,100
the first thing I would say, if you have
the time is it you need some sort of,

1016
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,023
uh,

1017
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:15,430
activity that you're involved
in that involves you, uh,

1018
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,710
socializing with

1019
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,230
the,
you know,

1020
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,230
men and women basically. I don't know
what it is. You know, going to bars,

1021
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:26,970
getting hammered and shit.
That's usually not gonna.

1022
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:30,840
You're not gonna meet a nice guy there
for the most part. Uh, I would say,

1023
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:34,000
I don't know.
Join a softball league.

1024
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:39,960
You meet a lot of women there. Uh,
volleyball. What it was, I mean,

1025
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:43,620
I'm old fucking start riding a dirt bike.

1026
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,270
Maybe you'll meet some guys out there and
the trail. Uh, they're dusty. Dick's. I,

1027
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:51,630
I mean, I don't, I don't know
how to, I don't know how to
help you here. I'm sorry.

1028
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:55,860
Uh, I, I, yeah, I got a, I
got a phone. A friend. Yeah.

1029
01:03:55,861 --> 01:04:00,590
You guys gotta help me out here.
Help this lady. Okay. Put on, on in,

1030
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:03,410
in the subject.
Put A,

1031
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:05,530
okay.

1032
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,480
Uh, what do, what do you,

1033
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,040
okay.

1034
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:12,840
23 fresh box.
All right.

1035
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,440
Fresh box 23, let's call it
that. All right. And you send it,

1036
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,030
email me your advice. Okay. And
then we can fucking figure it out.

1037
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,610
We can help this lady up
because, uh, you know,

1038
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,500
I have empathy for you that
you're late to the game.

1039
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,120
I showed up late to the game.

1040
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,880
I showed up at above fucking halftime
down 40 points. Alright. Dilemma.

1041
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,810
Would you rather get punched in the
head by Mike Tyson in his prime or get

1042
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,150
kicked squared and the nuts by Bruce
Lee. Oh, easy. Bruce Lee. Dot. A. Dot.

1043
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:49,190
L. Dot. A. Dot. I would
go to a sperm bank app,

1044
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:51,390
my sperm frozen before I had yeah,

1045
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:56,410
that happened. And, uh, you know,

1046
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:03,410
then I would still have my brain intact
to intelligently be able to tell the

1047
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:08,100
woman that I ended up falling
in love with why I allowed

1048
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,730
the greatest Asian of all time
to kick me square in the nuts.

1049
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,860
MMM. I mean, Mike Tyson,
I'd still have my balls,

1050
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:25,060
but I might be drooling on them
afterwards as I sit down de de Lou. Uh,

1051
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,090
that was a disgusting image. I didn't
mean to say that. All right. For the,

1052
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,710
for the Tyson choice. Oh, I'm sorry. Your
hands are tied behind your back. Okay.

1053
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:36,430
Now I know I have details.
Your hands are tied behind your back.

1054
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:41,460
Tyson can wind up and is told to cause
maximum damage to your head with one

1055
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:45,250
punch. It's going to be
his famous overhand, right?

1056
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:51,020
Yeah, no, fuck that. Fuck that.
You know there's another thing too,

1057
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:55,790
is this way better footage on Mike
Tyson than there is on Bruce Lee for the

1058
01:05:55,791 --> 01:06:00,080
Bruce Lee choice. You are spread
eagle and cannot defend yourself.

1059
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:05,110
I assumed you can only wear a European
man Thong to give you a semblance of

1060
01:06:06,411 --> 01:06:06,891
dignity.

1061
01:06:06,891 --> 01:06:11,891
I appreciate that Bruce Lee is
told to cause Max maximum damage.

1062
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:16,190
Jia manhood with one kick.
He will get a running start.

1063
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:21,020
Do you choose Mike Tyson or Bruce Lee?
I still got to go with Bruce Lee.

1064
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,423
You know what I mean?

1065
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:29,490
What is my quality of life going to be
if Mike Tyson gives me permanent fucking

1066
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:33,420
brain damage, but my junk
is still intact. All right.

1067
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,680
If Bruce Lee obliterates
my dick and balls,

1068
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:44,010
but I've already frozen my fucking sperm,
I could still have kids.

1069
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,370
Um, I don't know. I let my wife fuck
other guys, I guess. I don't know.

1070
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:52,220
I don't know what to do at that point.
Uh,

1071
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,180
but you know, I, I could
still have my brain,

1072
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,720
but then my brain would be all day long
in a loop going, you don't have any junk.

1073
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:08,850
You don't have any junk. You
know what I mean? Junk. Yeah.

1074
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:10,410
But you know what?
If I was still at my brain,

1075
01:07:10,411 --> 01:07:14,480
I could be smart enough to figure out how
to kill myself. All right? So I would,

1076
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:15,510
I would go with the Bruce Lee.

1077
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,493
Okay.

1078
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,610
You know, it'd be funnier than
watching me get kicked in the balls.

1079
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:29,380
Spread Eagle wearing a European man song
is,

1080
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,030
you know,

1081
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,900
the only thing is funnier than that
would be the yell that I let out as Bruce

1082
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,460
Lee was running at me.
I think it would sound a little like this.

1083
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:41,990
It would just be like,

1084
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,010
and then watching my
inner thighs flexing is,

1085
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:50,710
I tried hopelessly to
try to close my legs.

1086
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:53,943
Um,

1087
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,160
oh, that would be the worst too. If
your legs were tied, Spread Eagle,

1088
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:00,890
I mean immediately get kicked in the
balls, you go into the fetal position.

1089
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:04,050
I would not be able to do that,
you know,

1090
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,340
which I would think it would make it your,

1091
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:10,270
your body stay and even more of panic
mode because then you go into fetal

1092
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:11,770
position,
you know,

1093
01:08:11,771 --> 01:08:14,900
it kind of covers up your junk unless
you have old man balls and they score it

1094
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:15,810
out back.
Right.

1095
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:17,973
MMM.

1096
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,380
At which point somebody walks by and
accidentally kicked some, you know,

1097
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:24,140
like when you fucking think you clear the
door and you actually stubbed your toe.

1098
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:25,810
MMM.

1099
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:30,440
All right. That was disgusting.
Okay. That's the podcast man. Um,

1100
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:34,820
I hope you guys enjoyed it. Thank you to
everybody that came out in Rochester. Uh,

1101
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,840
thank you to all the guys at, at, at,
uh, um, I want said rough and rowdy.

1102
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,150
Everybody at Barstool sports,
rough and rowdy.

1103
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:45,260
I had such a great time and thank you to
all the competitors that showed up and

1104
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,170
entertained everybody. I
had such a great time. Uh,

1105
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,380
if there's a way for me to get to the
one in Kentucky, I'm going to be there.

1106
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:52,640
If I can't,
I'm going to be,

1107
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:57,650
I'm going to be watching it
either in Connecticut or an,
uh, Boston, Massachusetts,

1108
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,120
uh,
with a bunch of my friends.

1109
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:00,723
MMM.

1110
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,870
That's it. Oh, freckles

I have is in Las Vegas on,

1112
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,030
uh, August 18th. I believe. That's it.

1113
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,700
Uh,

1114
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,480
go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on, yeah, on Thursday.
