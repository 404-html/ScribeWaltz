1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,690
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr
and it's the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,570
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,063
Yay.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,120
Sorry man.
I'm running out of ways to say it.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,810
I try to do it differently every week
cause I know people are starting to do

6
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:22,560
mashups up and so I
tried to give you some,

7
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm trying to give you something to work
with. Um, I'm doing this on a Friday.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,530
Why you ask?
It's like what the fuck bill?

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,350
The Monday morning podcast is always late.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,630
Did you come up with
the Thursday afternoon,

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,190
Monday morning podcast just before Friday?
Just just to,

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,510
just to disappoint us twice in one week.
Huh?

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,820
Like the podcasting version
of a dead beat. Father

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,120
dead be dead. Why is it a dead
beat father? I'll tell you why.

15
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,960
Because there's no alliteration and on
the news you can't keep people sitting

16
00:00:56,961 --> 00:01:01,130
there listening with their mouths, hanging
out her up next dead beat fathers. Nah,

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,690
that doesn't work up.

18
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:07,691
Next dead beat dads wanted a doing
d dead beat dads dead beat dads at

19
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:15,081
[inaudible] up next on Ktl a Sarah,

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,120
can you tell us your story about
being married to a deadbeat dad?

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,400
Well,
you know,

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,780
I probably shouldn't have stuck his dick
on the first date and he said I'm going

23
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,710
to come. And for some reason I
don't know what I was thinking,

24
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,930
but I just crammed it into my clam
hole and that. So we had our first kid.

25
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,760
Well, I mean, nine
months later, I'm sorry,

26
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:41,761
I'm nervous because I'm on TV and right
off the bat it's like he take us to

27
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,530
Denny's and the check would come
and he would be like, excuse me,

28
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,720
I have to go to the bathroom.
And I never saw him again.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,460
We tracked him down.
Dead beat dad.

30
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:58,461
Danny come out of this dilapidated fucking
something that begins with the day.

31
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,680
Um, we just want to give you your
chance to tell your side of the story.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,790
I love those fucking things.
Those,

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,070
those new stories where they expose
bad people, like they give a fuck.

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,950
You know what I mean?
They don't give a fuck.

35
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,980
They just know that we like sitting
back watching people get in trouble.

36
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,610
Is there anything better than that than
watching somebody getting yelled at?

37
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,600
It's fucking phenomenal.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,750
It's like you can see last week when
I went off on the Burger King Guy,

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,800
I didn't even know his name.

40
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,690
I didn't even know how many
fucking rounds there were.

41
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,500
And I clearly stated that I was making
fun of someone that could beat the shit

42
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:34,770
out of me. Right. So what do
you constitute? You chop it up.

43
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,210
You leave out this where the part where
I say I'm just some more on in a fucking

44
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,460
in my office. It shopped the whole fucking
thing up and then you start put, oh,

45
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,750
a fucking comedian goes on rent.
What are you doing nia?

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,410
I'm giving these guys shit for,
they fucked me over last week.

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,180
I you're talking about a
safe corner [inaudible] hour.

48
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,950
Yeah. Neil loves him. A great guy.

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,730
But I did tweet that.
I was giving that, uh,

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,710
that when a little bit of the side,
I know he'd be,

51
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,720
they stopped it because obviously that
guy was gassed or something would've got

52
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:15,640
hurt. Think so. Like it's just, I feel
like he was this, can't do this again.

53
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,570
We can't do this again. Not to
down, but not out obviously.

54
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,190
I don't know all the rules,

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,150
but he knocked him down shore
and then he covered his head.

56
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,670
We don't protect this head.
One of the thoughts

57
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,020
or anything. We were just excited
for the underdog. We were showing,

58
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:36,280
I met grant and we were like, how bad
ass is? That guy's chest tattoo though.

59
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,200
You got to being about his bad ass.

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,400
You've got to be in the sickest shape
ever to pull off the fucking that guy.

61
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:47,050
He's basically signed himself up to
fucking pull up like pushups and spin

62
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,050
classes for the rest of his fucking
life. Spin classes now. But you know,

63
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:52,300
some of it because he's been
on TV kicking people's asses.

64
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:56,740
Then he can just be like, well I did that
and that's why I had so much shit. Like,

65
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,310
that's the thing that's so hilarious
about him and the shaver gets him in

66
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,690
trouble. Do me a favor, tell me,

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,140
tell them the tea story and then I got
to blow through the rest of this and then

68
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,740
I got a, I got to drop my
truck off to get the story.

69
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,823
So I'll,

70
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,230
I'll say Aka bills add or
just not paying attention.

71
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,110
Maybe. No, that's not true. Knees
laying in bed. She's like, oh,

72
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,700
can you go get me some tea?

73
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,090
Cause when you get married you're also
like a waiter and bill's like, Ooh, Ooh,

74
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,070
Ooh.
Do you want,

75
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,030
I say I like I a cup of
green tea would be lovely.

76
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,680
Just not the caffeinated coffee. He
said, not the caffeinated, caffeinated,

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,340
regular, you know, what did
I say? And you went, Oh hey,

78
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,160
I knocked the cafeteria and then you
walked out the door and I just sat there

79
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:49,730
thinking he's not going to get this right.
He's not.

80
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,820
And sure enough, he came downstairs with
your big sweet smile. Hey goes sweetie.

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,760
And sure enough,
it's the decaffeinated.

82
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,740
See when I told you we cannot,
not the cafe.

83
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,440
I thought there was the
caffeinated and not to caffeinated.

84
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,930
So when you said not the captain and
I was like, Oh, good to caffeinated.

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,090
I thought it was like fiction and
nonfiction. I don't drink tea or coffee.

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,990
So I was like, all right, that's
not to caffeinated, caffeinated.

87
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,780
What you should have
said. Oh No, I should,

88
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,930
I wasn't thinking you should have
said no, I was not, not the captain.

89
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:32,690
And we have to use a double negative to
get your brain to work correctly. Well,

90
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:37,390
you'd say, well I want a book, not
nonfiction. No, you wouldn't say that.

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,250
You would say I want a fiction book. I
just, but yeah, but you can also say,

92
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:45,760
I want a book, not nonfiction also.
That means fiction new for you.

93
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:50,110
If I just said green tea,
you would just listen.

94
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,500
You would have screwed it up regardless.
It's like get any points for trying.

95
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,740
I you do. And you were very sweet
to even gave me a cup of tea. Oh,

96
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,290
don't talk to me like I'm fucking

97
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,580
neck against some mental issue. Well,
you were very sweet. Is that what I am?

98
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:03,330
I'm that person.

99
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,030
The person who is never going to get laid
and just stays in his hometown for the

100
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,470
rest of his life.
He's sweet.

101
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,690
Can you help me carry this
thing that's really heavy?

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,400
I don't think that's what's happened,
but you are me. You are pretty, uh,

103
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,070
I'm pretty, what's the word?
Slow on the uptake. Alright,

104
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,440
listen, I gotta knock this out cause I
gotta drop my truck off today. All right,

105
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,420
you've got to follow me. Okay.
All right. That's it for me.
Well, I gotta I gotta go.

106
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,920
Yeah,

107
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,720
I got to trash them. I was pretty good.
I got to trash him for, uh, you know,

108
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:37,060
I was making fun of the guy there
and the tidy whities that's what I,

109
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:40,200
one thing I did like about Conor McGregor
is that when he was going on that Greg

110
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:40,540
our,

111
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,540
when he came out and the tighty whities
what saying what I did like about that

112
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:49,920
is you got an idea of what it would be
like if you broke into his home in the

113
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:50,754
middle of the night.

114
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,370
He come out with that crazy luck that
he did between round one and two, like,

115
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,460
hey,
you want to

116
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,390
come out in his bare feet
a fucking put his heel, he,

117
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,190
you'd sit, he do this spinning
thing. The best sound,

118
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,870
even though you're
getting your ass kicked,

119
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:13,680
would be him running across the
hardwood floor, the slap of his feet.

120
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,480
And then he do this spinning thing.
Just like,

121
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,790
then he started with a spinning kick
or was that somebody, I think he did.

122
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,960
And that would be right at him or
was that the, it all ran together.

123
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,930
I forgot to say the fight
before the fight of the night.

124
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,430
Bloody like nightmare over there.
Yeah,

125
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,400
that was a two were the sickest warriors.
I've deaf guy.

126
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:36,310
Finally his fucking nose just exploded.
It was unreal. She near wanted all race.

127
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:38,310
I was like, no, I have to,
what? I've got to Wa I live,

128
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm such a fucking tub of shit that I
have to watch guys fighting at that level

129
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,880
just to get myself to
take my dog on a hike.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,340
And you know what,
we fast forwarded through it but I uh,

131
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,050
I think I read that Sinead O'connor like
came out and sang with Conor McGregor.

132
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,090
I'm only going to say it
like that from now on,

133
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,540
so I have to go back and
watch that. I mean I don't, I,

134
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,710
I think I read that on the Internet
but I may be wrong. I have to go back

135
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,330
and chill.

136
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,200
It's funny you brought her up and I know
she doesn't think this thing sing this

137
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:03,441
song,

138
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,920
but I thought it was that the who married
the old creepy guy that's saying on

139
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:07,754
the boat,

140
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,500
let's say, let's say another episode
of what is bill talking about?

141
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,903
Woo.

142
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,910
Whitney Whitney Houston. Oh sorry.
First done by Dolly Parton. All wait,

143
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,740
can you tell,
can you tell everybody

144
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,360
when you were just trying
to describe a gone girl,

145
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,090
what did you call where the [inaudible]

146
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,630
but the thing is,
I know I'm wrong,

147
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,750
but I do it like I do it
like the $10,000 pyramid.

148
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:42,580
I just start throwing clues
where the bitch really though,

149
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:43,990
that's a really brilliant,

150
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,980
because Hollywood keeps
remaking movies now.

151
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:50,380
Cause everybody stole
the movies so they can't,

152
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,540
they can't do anything originally.
Marcus, what's the point?

153
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,890
They just got to keep
doing shit that works.

154
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:57,490
So they'll do the black version of it
will, which will be where the bitch go.

155
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,420
And then Paul, Paul, Paul C we'll
do, we'll do the all female one.

156
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:08,400
An alternative to a fucking 10 zillion
dollar a comedy. Where'd the dude bro Go?

157
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,460
I don't know where it would be. I don't
know what it'd be. All right, let me,

158
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,820
let me finish this so I can get
outta here. So as I mentioned today,

159
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,840
very exciting day for me is uh,
my,

160
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,850
the power steering in the
air conditioning units.

161
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,360
Would it be him motors came
in from my truck. So a,

162
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:27,430
for those of you is not
mechanically inclined as myself.

163
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,760
I've since learned the amount,
those on the front of the engine,

164
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,470
you know that belt that goes all around,

165
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,920
it's just using the front end of the
crank shaft and that's what turns the

166
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,040
fucking motor. Then that's what
gets it going. I don't fucking know.

167
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,540
That's how it works. Um, at least
that's how it gets the motor going.

168
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,420
That's a very simplistic version of it.
So now my truck will have power steering,

169
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,600
which, you know, I was one of those
guys, I'm going to keep it all original.

170
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,610
I'm going to keep it all
original, but like, you know,

171
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,820
it had drum brakes and just
driving out here, drum brakes,

172
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,890
no power steering original suspension.

173
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
It's every time I went over a bump I
had to hold onto the seat so my head

174
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,230
wouldn't hit the fucking ceiling.
Um,

175
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,340
the roof of the cab there if it
was a significant one. And um,

176
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,571
you know,

177
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,510
if there's somebody behind me and I'm
trying to parallel park and I'm holding

178
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,460
them up, you know, that panic,
I got to get in the spot,

179
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:16,020
I would literally be out of
breath. And, um, so anyways,

180
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:19,170
so I'm, I'm just updating it, keeping,
I still kept it three on the tree.

181
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,740
I got the whole engine redone,
it's running, it's running so well.

182
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm not scared about saying how
fucking great it's running. Um,

183
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,800
so today I'm getting the, uh, the power
steering in the air conditioning done.

184
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,790
And then also I went on Ebay and,
uh,

185
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,510
I have an aftermarket horn on my
truck and it's just the high note.

186
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,780
So it's like, hey, it's
such a bad ass truck.

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,780
And an I beeped the horn and it just
sounds like the worst fucking thing ever.

188
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:50,380
So I found somebody, uh, I don't
know how the fuck they got it,

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,010
took it off a truck. I had it in
a junk yard, but they had the low,

190
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,900
the low whatever, the low note
and the high note. And, um, uh,

191
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,590
they're going to slap that
on. So it actually sounds
like a fucking man's truck.

192
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:04,130
And then I think at that point I'm done.
Oh,

193
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,780
I still need the directionals
and the reverse lights to work.

194
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,930
And that's the reason why my wife put
the Kibosh on me getting a 65 galaxy.

195
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,060
So I gotta I gotta hold off on that. She
actually made a great argument. She goes,

196
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:19,530
we already have one old car that
constantly needs work. And I'm like, no,

197
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,750
I'm getting to this to the point
where it's going to be totally fixed.

198
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,800
And she just like, you know, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. So whatever,

199
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,480
I haven't given up on the fight,

200
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:30,870
but sometimes you just got to realize when
it'd be like, you know what, you know,

201
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:33,480
stick and move. I kind of put
it out there, I'll wear it down.

202
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,220
I wear it down the same way she does
when she wants a pair of fucking shoes or

203
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:42,510
something. But I really like, um,

204
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,100
so anyways, the continuing story, uh,

205
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,680
of me not booze and trying to lose fucking
weight, I weighed myself this morning.

206
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,450
Um, and I'll tell you I had
a rough week, you know, um,

207
00:11:56,451 --> 00:12:00,600
I did not Boosie and this
week started off, uh,

208
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,760
started off a little, hit her
reform. Um, I was, I started, I quit.

209
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,650
And on July 5th going on
a 72 day liver cleanse,

210
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,340
which by the way, I don't even know that
that's how many days you need, you know.

211
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,100
Um, I basically talked
to Dr. Paul [inaudible].

212
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,650
Paul [inaudible] was the one that says,
you know, dude, I argue, you know,

213
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:23,030
I heard you needed like fucking 72 days.
So I just took that as law. I was like,

214
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:26,750
well, that's my buddy Paul Versey. He
never went to medical school. I'm sure he,

215
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,760
he overheard it. And a bar
from a us, somebody with a
doctorate and something. Um,

216
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,580
so I am going to go the 72
days considering I fucking
booze like a maniac from

217
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:41,560
that southern tour, the end of April,
right on through, right on through to a,

218
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,620
the July 5th.
So to get everybody caught up.

219
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:48,560
So I'm trying to lose three pounds a week.
When I started this,

220
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,430
I was one 86.68 and belly fat face.

221
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,630
Did I know the news, fat
freckles exposed. Um,

222
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,810
so last week I weighed myself.

223
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:06,590
I was one 83.2 and I'm halfway
through this week. Now.

224
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:11,210
This week started off rough. Who?
Boy? Or of one? Um, on Monday night,

225
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,630
Monday night, I, uh,

226
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,260
I took my lovely wife to go see steely
Dan with Elvis Costello opening up and I

227
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,130
got to tell you,
that was easily,

228
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,730
that might've been the best
concert I ever saw. I mean,

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,630
Elvis Costello comes out and just fucking,

230
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,750
just destroy, like he had such
it, like I'm sitting there,

231
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,750
I'm sitting in the crowd
when Elvis Costello is going
to fucking open this thing.

232
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,300
This is ridiculous. Um, you know,

233
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,860
sky's been headline and for
40 fucking years. And, uh,

234
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,580
he came out and he had such a sense
of humor about it. He played all the,

235
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,300
some weird Illuminati song that
they were like the chosen ones.

236
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,530
So immediately I'm like, this is going to
be a, this is going to be fucking great.

237
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,970
And he came out,
played some newer shit,

238
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:05,600
played a bunch of classic hits
and he just kept going and going.

239
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,800
And what's funny about the Hollywood
bowl is down low, you know,

240
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:13,730
I got great fucking seats right
in, down low. They have, um,

241
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,990
they have like these like picnic tables
kind of things. You can get this.

242
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,700
And what was funny is I'm watching Elvis
Costello and he went on early first.

243
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,140
I mean,
and uh,

244
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:28,400
it's still light out and there was so
many people eating where like it was like

245
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,450
a groups of four.

246
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,320
So two people who are in the front seats
closer to the stage would be turning

247
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,570
around facing the people
they were talking to, eating.

248
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,280
There was so many people turned around
while Elvis was initially on stage that I

249
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:43,280
was looking at so many faces.
I almost felt like I was on stage.

250
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,300
It was fucking hilarious.
But then he just went into the hits.

251
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:50,650
And when he played that, uh,
I don't know his shit that

252
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,780
dayday around. Damn. Damn. Damn.
Damn. Everybody fucking went nuts.

253
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,950
And the sun had gone down.
Oh well darn has set some fucking asshole.

254
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:05,750
Flew right over the Hollywood
bowl at about four or 500 feet.

255
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,490
Now I am a novice. I just got my
license. But as far as I know,

256
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:15,470
you can't fucking do that. You can do that
when it's empty. But as far as I know,

257
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,440
and outdoor arena with the
significant gathering of human beings,

258
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,120
one hour before the event to one hour
after is a temporary no fly zone.

259
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,460
But this fucker flew over at twice.

260
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,170
And that was being that
fucking guy with a hobby.

261
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,930
My wife's trying to enjoy the
show and I'm like, he can't,

262
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,250
she's like shut up.
So by the way,

263
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,030
I'm embarrassed to say that
I wasn't aware that um,

264
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,550
Elvis Costello has had basically the
same drummer for 40 years because I was

265
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:48,380
watching the guy going
after once. I was like, wow,

266
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:52,160
that guy's really good at two songs
I was saying near as any better than

267
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:55,130
watching a professional drummer.
They've got fucking fluid and just smooth.

268
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:57,170
That guy is,
and then I ended up looking him up,

269
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:59,870
guys name is Pete Thomas
does not get enough credit,

270
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:03,650
but every drummer out there knows who
the fuck he is and was blown away by him.

271
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,980
All right. And then his, his night ended.

272
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:10,970
I would've been fine with Elvis Costello
band. I would have been fine with that.

273
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,720
And then,
um,

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,960
stealy dad came out and did the greatest
live band I've ever fucking seen.

275
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,880
How intricate and how like amazing
their albums are. They came out,

276
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:24,881
they sounded exactly like the albums
and they got Keith Carlock on drums who

277
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:30,041
played drums so fucking well
that it transcended like music.

278
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,650
He was playing drums so well I was
thinking about how can I get better as a

279
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:36,530
comedian.
Like I want to do standup as well,

280
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,890
if I can do it half as well
as this guy's playing drums.

281
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,500
And my wife took this amazing clip.
Um,

282
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,580
I'd even think I was so fucking
blown away by his, his playing.

283
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't take any video. I just sat
there with my fucking John the ground.

284
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,490
And um, this is what a bad ass
he is. Two songs into the set.

285
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:59,540
They played Asia and he fucking
destroyed it. Absolutely destroyed it.

286
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,050
Effortless was amazing.
Just fucking amazing.

287
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:07,520
How fluid isn't it fucking that Mola
movement thing that he does where it looks

288
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:12,170
like both of his fucking arms are doing
the worm just flying down the toms.

289
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,040
But it wasn't overplaying. It was
all tasteful. The dynamics. He just,

290
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,050
he's a fucking beast.
If you ever get a chance,

291
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:19,370
cause I remember when I lived in New York,

292
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,310
that guy would do a lot of stuff
down in the village, just sit in.

293
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,530
I would just follow him on Twitter.
Uh,

294
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,490
I'm sure he announces the live
gigs and all that when he's around.

295
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:31,010
If you ever just want to fucking sit like,
you know,

296
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,520
20 feet away from arguably the greatest
drummer of his fucking generation,

297
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,550
I would say check that guy out.
Um,

298
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,330
and right now obviously he's on
tour and um, it's a long story,

299
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,240
but I got to know him a
little bit through, uh,

300
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,620
the guy who sets up all my radio tours.

301
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:49,050
So he hooked us up with the tickets and
then afterwards I got to fucking talk to

302
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:52,590
him for two seconds. I swear to God,
just like a total fucking drummy groupie.

303
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,930
And you know, I avoided asking him all
the drum questions I wanted to ask like,

304
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,330
can you teach me some
of the fills in Asia?

305
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,050
Can you just hammer them
out here on this trashcan?

306
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,720
I just wasn't going to do
that because you know why?

307
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,710
Because I was sober is old
Billy drunk tank didn't,

308
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:14,160
wasn't drinking and I,
and I was aware enough not to do that.

309
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,800
And all I needed was a couple of
Mila highlights and I would've been,

310
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,550
I would've asked him all
kinds of questions and he
would have been crawling up

311
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:25,080
the walls trying to get away from me. So
there's another reason not to drink. Um,

312
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:28,630
so anyways, please go see them
if you get a fucking chance. Um,

313
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,200
I know they just played New Mexico,
whatever, but they were fucking amazing.

314
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,590
So anyways,
um,

315
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,130
what else did I want to talk
about? So, Oh, speaking of flying,

316
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,950
I'm all over the map here today.
People,

317
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:45,951
I'm actually leaving tomorrow to fly up
to Ottawa to play some Blues Festival

318
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:50,940
where I'm doing standup
outside in between two bands,

319
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,970
which usually is a hell gig.

320
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:56,190
But they're telling me that all these
awesome comics have done it and it's,

321
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,880
and it's a great gig. So I'm hoping
it's going to be that. If it isn't,

322
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,230
it's just going to be 45 awful
minutes in my life. That's it.

323
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,360
That's how I always look at him. Like,
all right, this is going to suck,

324
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,590
but in 45 minutes,

325
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,800
it's going to be over and I'm going
to be in the car and I'm going to,

326
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,390
it's not going to matter. And I'm going
to go back to my room and I'm going to,

327
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,630
uh, put a pillow over my face and
I'm going to cry myself to sleep.

328
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,030
I picked this job. Um, and then I do
the Montreal comedy festival. And as,

329
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:31,600
as mentioned, I'm playing three
nights on the comedy jam. Oh,

330
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:35,130
Billy woodshed there, uh,
three different songs and um,

331
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,540
and then I'm doing three
shows a at a theater up there.

332
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,410
I forget what the fuck it is, but uh,
I'm really looking forward to it. And um,

333
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,950
you know, not gonna Boosie
that's going to be difficult.

334
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,720
That was really difficult during,
uh,

335
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,020
going to a concert to not
drink or anything or get
any sort of a buzz. But, uh,

336
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,820
I stuck with the waters for a minute and
then I finally got like a Turkey wrap

337
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,880
or whatever.
So long story fucking short.

338
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,940
I weighed myself today and I am the
fuck was it one 81.41 81.6 I basically

339
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:10,080
dropped five pounds.
That's how much I boost.

340
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,810
Just stopping boozing.
I dropped five.

341
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,700
How hard is it to the
lose five fucking pounds?

342
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:18,610
It's really fucking hard for me anyways.
And I dropped five pounds, so I'm,

343
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,260
so I'm on the, I'm on the
fucking road here. All right.

344
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,910
I gotta I gotta buy next Monday.

345
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:27,540
I gotta be one 80 and then I'm
keeping it going three pounds a week.

346
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,110
Everybody three pounds a week for
two months. Do it with me. All right.

347
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,890
Have you fucking oatmeal every morning
with a banana and then have an apple or

348
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,520
an orange is a snack.
Somebody told me,

349
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:41,940
maybe you have a couple of scrambled
a couple of eggs, you know,

350
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,320
but don't even start the
egg debate with people. Uh,

351
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,950
too much cholesterol than other
people. Well, if you scramble it,

352
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:50,000
you get rid of all the fuck nutrients
would you want to do is soft cook it?

353
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:53,170
I like good egg over easy, whatever.
I have a couple of fucking eggs.

354
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,270
Just don't have any toast,
bacon and potatoes.

355
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,730
Just throw those on the side of a gently.
That's a good fucking thing.

356
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:01,300
I don't know.
And then a lunch,

357
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,140
I just been doing the fucking Turkey
slices, little bit of Avocado.

358
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,850
I'll actually have a sandwich.
I don't give a fuck.

359
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,280
I'll have a couple of slices of bread
even though people say don't do that.

360
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,080
And then I after that,
it's just fucking a giant salad,

361
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,570
some sort of fucking
vegetarian thing for dinner.

362
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,830
And then all I got to do is take my dog
on a hike, do couple of pushups and uh,

363
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,940
not fucking booze and it's been going good
for me. So that's been working for me.

364
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:28,300
I hope it works for you. So anyways, um,

365
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,150
continuing on. So I've been,
uh, I've been flying here,

366
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,340
I'm trying to get my hours up.

367
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,240
My school recommended that I fly with an
instructor for different times just to

368
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:43,300
get radio calls down and I've done,
um,

369
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,250
I've done three flights
and this last flight I did,

370
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,100
I flew out to Catalina island,

371
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,760
which a lot of people don't know about
unless you live out here in La and you

372
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:53,810
probably know about it.
You never went to it. Um,

373
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,630
I didn't have the time to land cause I
had to go do some F is for family shit by

374
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:01,210
the way,
which is looking really funny by the way.

375
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,880
We got the first episode almost totally
edited and I was beyond excited,

376
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,660
um, up until that point I
was like, I don't know man.

377
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,790
I don't know how funny this is
going to be. You get all nervous.

378
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,620
And yesterday we just fucking
worked on the thing. Um,

379
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,990
I don't know from like two o'clock
to about nine o'clock at night,

380
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:22,420
just tightening it up and tighten it up,
tighten it up,

381
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,780
editing it and all that type of shit.
And uh,

382
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:28,240
I was able to keep my add under control.

383
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,610
I really do hit the wall at some
point where I'm like, I just,

384
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:32,440
I gotta get the fuck out of here.
But um,

385
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,620
they're really good about just
ignoring me when I say that.

386
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,720
It's like he became the running joke
cause I kept going. I have a hard out,

387
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,900
I have a hard out at seven,
I have to be Outta here by seven.

388
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,740
And then it was like seven 30 and
then it just became the running joke.

389
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,800
I just kept saying, I have a hard off
guys like guys, I'm not kidding around.

390
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,960
And they, and they would just be like,
oh yeah, but oh yeah, you're right here.

391
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You're going to get you out of
here by seven. Um, so anyways, uh,

392
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,470
yesterday before he went over there,

393
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,190
I did a flight with one of my instructors
out to Catalina island. Like I said,

394
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:07,990
we didn't have time to land. It's a
just off the coast, about 23 miles,

395
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:12,430
24 of 25 miles off of, uh Oh
wait, is that how far it is?

396
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,840
No, I think they aren't back was
like 25 miles. I think that, yeah,

397
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,750
I think that's what it was.
Anyway.

398
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,790
So right off the coast of
Vile Long Beach and uh,

399
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:26,290
we flew out there and I saw my
first whale, if you can believe it,

400
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,420
we're flying out there.
We got the doors off,

401
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,440
which is actually great because if
he had to do an emergency landing,

402
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,960
that's kind of a bitch to have to fucking,
you know,

403
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,360
tried to open the Goddamn doors and
shit. I just like immediately, uh,

404
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,060
hitting the water and get the fuck out,
you know?

405
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,740
Um, so what, what is that
fucking procedure? I should
know that, right? Yeah.

406
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,610
I know what it is,
right?

407
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,700
You go into your flare and then when
you pull your power, but he's a skids.

408
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:56,690
Hit the water. You fucking
go. You go left cyclic, right.

409
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,930
You rolled down to the tent too, right?
You go left cyclic in the fucking blade.

410
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,670
Stop hopefully.

411
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,540
And then you just sit there
and hope somebody picks you
up before the sharks get

412
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,390
you. And that's what I was thinking when
I was flying over it going like, Bill,

413
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,210
you are fucking terrified
over the ocean right now.

414
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,470
And that was that halfway point that we
got to with the altitude that we were at

415
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,500
where it wasn't even that
we fly it like 2000 feet.

416
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:21,170
So basically once we got to a
certain point off the coast,

417
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,050
if we had a fucking problem, we'd
have to ditch it in the fucking ocean.

418
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,880
So you just hold onto a,
that's not going to happen to me.

419
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,940
So anyways,
we flew out there,

420
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:37,240
saw up two pods of dolphins and
at the altitude that we're at,

421
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,580
they like glow and they're
jumping out of the water.

422
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,460
It looked like look like a well
those little fireflies man,

423
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:47,350
it was fucking amazing. And then
um, the guy was a flying with,

424
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,930
you know, he was looking for whales cause
he knew I never saw him when he goes,

425
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:52,450
they haven't won it. There was one
that has one and know and he's like,

426
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,900
I have controls, you have
controls. I have control.

427
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:56,650
So he now he's flying and I was
looking and I got to watch the thing.

428
00:24:56,651 --> 00:25:01,180
Come right up, take a breath, you know,
blow the fucking water out. Right.

429
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,950
Take a breath and then dive down again
man. It was fucking amazing. So, uh,

430
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,040
I'll actually, you know what, I'll, I'll
give you guys some pictures of that.

431
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,910
We had the um, you know,
life vests on and shit,

432
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,220
I'm not going to send you the
picture of me cause I'm slouched.

433
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:19,570
I look like a Douche in the, the,
the life jackets around your waist,

434
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:21,820
like a fucking fanny pack.
So I'm not going to show you that.

435
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:26,070
I'll just show you the view of,
uh, when we came in to Catalina,

436
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:27,700
it was fucking amazing. And then, uh,

437
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,080
went around the island
and flew back and uh,

438
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,070
just an incredible God damn flight.
So I'm really enjoying that.

439
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,500
But I'm getting to the point where all
freckles is going to be up there by

440
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:42,640
himself and I'm feeling pretty
confident about it. And, uh, who knows?

441
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,880
I might put a Gopro on one of these days
and I'll show you some of the shit when

442
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:50,560
I fly over dodger stadium when there's
no game and like that jerk off when we

443
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,410
were in the fucking, uh,
Hollywood bowl. All right,

444
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:57,700
let me get to the advertising
here for the week. Um, all right,

445
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:00,310
I got to do this right. Oh,
video, doorbell everybody.

446
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,760
I think it's only fair at
this point that uh, you know,

447
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,450
I did the music I gotta have, I gotta
have the fucking sad music underneath it,

448
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:10,030
right? Isn't that right? Here we go.

449
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,520

450
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,090
I looked up sad music on youtube and
this is 90 minutes of sad emotional music

451
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:21,040

not least, zip recruiter.

547
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,670
Are you hiring? But not sure
where to find the best candidates?

548
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,500
Are you sitting on a couch? But not sure
it's there. Are you on drugs right now?

549
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,750
Uh,
as a business owner,

550
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,790
I can tell you that your company is only
as good as the people you hire. Well,

00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:40,130
you don't need to tell us that that's ob
really is the team only as good as the

quality candidates,

556
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,150

what's reading it. Uh, but when
you, when you're short staffed,

I want to Jim Mercy uses that, Huh?

572
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,690
Uh, no, he just tanks and
entire fucking season out bill.

573
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,830
When you trim your counties. All right,
Uber, everyone. This is the last one.

574
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:08,150
Mercifully intro. Hey, you like
making great money, right? Sure.

575
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:08,960
We all do.

576
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,800
Here's a really cool opportunity that
I just had to share with you evidently

577
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,100
driving with Uber.

578
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,880
Uber is that popular smartphone APP
that connects riders with drivers.

579
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,950
I take Uber a bunch. No I
don't. I take taxis. Okay.

580
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,050
I'd take taxis cause
they don't know who I am.

581
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,000
And I'm not trying to be an arrogant ass.

582
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,450
I just appealed to people who drive Uber.
You know what I mean?

583
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:35,430
If I take a bus that he doesn't know
who the fuck I am, I take the subway,

584
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:38,510
Hey I know what the fuck I am. I go and
play and they don't know the fuck I am.

585
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,940
Something about Uber, something about
singing, no more sweaty, clammy.

586
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:47,550
We really meet that just connects with
these cons but you know, whatever. Um,

587
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,670
everyday I love them by the way. And
in chatting with the different drivers,

588
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,330
some of them have really interesting
stories as to why they drive with Uber.

589
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,010
They love being their own boss. They
earn great money. It's easy to start.

590
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,570
You just need a car and a license.

591
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:05,900
Driving with Uber is great for anyone
who needs flexibility. Parents,

592
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:08,990
this is really easy way to work
under your family's schedule.

593
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,910
They were like 20 of
these points. Stone, it's,

594
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:14,440
you can make extra money between classes.
No more stripping layer.

595
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,490
I just go topless. I feel it's
more like an artistic thing. Um,

596
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,930
now that now's the prime
time to cash in with Uber.

597
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,560
You'll thank me for telling
you how to get paid every week.

598
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,520
I could be getting into your car
when you drive over a call to action,

599
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,580
you got a car and a driver's license,
right? We'll put 'em together.

600
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:39,040
Stupid to work for you and start
serious life changing money today.

601
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:42,670
Sign up to drive with Uber.
Visit drive with uber.com.

602
00:35:42,671 --> 00:35:47,670
That's drive with e u B e r.com.
That's drive with uber.com. Uh,

603
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,850
you should definitely do this,
man.

604
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:51,640
This is a great way to supplement
your fucking income. But what it is,

605
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:55,010
when you have that extra
income, don't fucking drink
it away. Put it up, you know,

606
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:58,900
is a buy some shoes. Pay Down your
fucking dead and become a free man.

607
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,920
Pay Down your credit cards. Pay Down your
student loans. Get out of fucking debt.

608
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,440
Don't owe anybody any money. All
right? You don't owe anybody anything.

609
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:14,820
They owe you. You want to stand it.
That's still what you want to stand it.

610
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,860
You want to stand that. That's the
way to go. I'd love to keep talking,

611
00:36:17,861 --> 00:36:20,320
but my internet sucks here and that's
going to take forever for me to fucking

612
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,910
upload this thing. Um, anyways, that
was me just checking in on you. Hey,

613
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:29,560
it's Friday everybody fucking Friday.
It's the fucking east coast at this point.

614
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:33,400
What is it? 11 a two
o'clock. You're almost there.

615
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,420
You're almost there.
Whatever. Um, anyways, uh,

616
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,720
thanks to everybody who's been listening.
Uh,

617
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,550
yeah.

618
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,230
Why don't I feel like I've got
to thank everybody this week.

619
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:47,830
I just had a fucking awesome week.
I did. I had a fucking great week.

620
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,140
I'm just psyched. I'm losing weight.
I'm turning this ship around.

621
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,030
You know what's funny too is fucking
how much your skin clears up. You know,

622
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:57,940
and I don't need you guys
with your fucking horse shit
when you're just going to

623
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:01,900
go look up stuff about your Liverpool's
because of the toxins your liver is able

624
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:05,650
to get rid of. I understand that. I
can also Google what the fuck happens,

625
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,620
although nobody will
give me an actual number.

626
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,030
Why can it get an extra we'll number?
Does anybody know? What is the,

627
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,150
I mean it obviously depends
on how much you boost.

628
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,490
And I booze pretty hard, but when an
ice stopped boozing, I just miss boots.

629
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,180
Like I didn't fucking get the sweats,
you know what I mean?

630
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,690
I didn't fucking get the shakes,
you know,

631
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:31,600
they didn't have to lock me in a room
with fucking chicken broth or any of that

632
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:35,410
type of shit. I just miss it. You
know what I mean? There I said it,

633
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:39,790
I miss it like a friend. Um, all
right. That's it. I'm going to send,

634
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:44,770
I'm going to upload some
pictures of a flying around
Catalina and I'll, oh, so, uh,

635
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,190
I'll,

636
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,400
I'll upload that thing of Keith Carlock
killing it a while he's playing Asian.

637
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:51,580
I'm telling you guys, even if you're
not, even if you don't play drums,

638
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,130
you just gotta see, you gotta see
this fucking band, their horn section,

639
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:58,860
that bass player, fucking everybody
destroyed it. And um, you got to go see.

640
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,080
All right. That's it. That's
the, that's the podcast.

641
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,520
And I'm going to get a
little throwback here.

642
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,170
Half hour above podcast
from days gone past.

643
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,380
And it's only a month out from fucking
football season, right? There'll be,

644
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,170
they'll be playing three seasons.
Think about that.

645
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,360
All right or don't think about it.

646
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,313
Oh,

647
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,480
let's go get something to
eat. I said, all right,

648
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,290
here's a fucking Mcdonald's
right there and she's like,

649
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,330
do you want to eat there? And started
was looking down at the ground, all sad,

650
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,133
you know,

651
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,860
just doing that classic
female manipulation thing.

652
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,750
She knew I wanted to eat there.

653
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,770
I just said there's a Mcdonald's
there and then why would she say,

654
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,010
do you want to eat there
and look down at the ground?

655
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,630
This question is for all the young male
listeners, if my whispering podcast,

656
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,510
why would a female do
that? Do, do, do, do,

657
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:53,890
do. I'll tell you why.
Because she doesn't want,

658
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,000
if not only does she not
want to fucking eat there,

659
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,730
she already has a place where
she wants to eat. She's our,

660
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,280
she's already had this
place that she's wanting,

661
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,230
wanting to eat at for probably a
month before you ever went to Vegas.

662
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:11,120
But she's not going to tell you about it
because if she tells you about it that

663
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:15,200
give you time to do research on it and
find out how fucking expensive it was.

664
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,610
Yeah.

665
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,760
So should I take you out to eat and she
looks down at the ground. So immediately,

666
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,860
despite the fact that I know all this
about females, I take the bait. Why?

667
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,940
Where do you want to eat sweetheart?
Um,

668
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,050
there's this burger place at Mandalay bay.
I heard it was really nice.

669
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,870
Do you ever watch top chef? Uh, only
when you're watching it sweetheart.

670
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,760
I don't like that show.
Fucking show is annoying.

671
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,790
I hate when the shift starts screaming
at those people. Fucking foreign accent.

672
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,340
He called that a fucking grilled cheese
sandwich. Get the fucker in my kitchen.

673
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,510
Hey. Hey, you think I'm fucking
afraid of you? You fucking dope.

674
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,470
You got a fucking problem with
my grilled cheese sandwich.

675
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,920
You come up like a fucking
gentleman and you take me aside.

676
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,640
Don't fucking be screaming at me. Well,
I got these fucking knives in my hand.

677
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,660
Stick it right to your God damn
trachea. What you think about that? Huh?

678
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,300
I'll give you a fucking blow holes right
out the front of your fucking neck.

679
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:24,040
Get out of my goddamn face before I take
your value fucking hair and wash your

680
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,730
face into this pile of shrimp.
Huh?

681
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,190
That I haven't taken the shells off so
I'll give you a bunch of little razor

682
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:34,890
cuts. Sorry. That's a good
shit. At Mandalay Bay.

683
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:36,930
The bad shit is we go to
this fucking burger place.

684
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:40,070
I can't remember the name of it.
We go in there and I,

685
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:45,120
I order a $16 and 50 cent fucking Coby
beef burger and they're talking about how

686
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:48,420
it's the greatest God
Damn Burger. I'll, I'll,

687
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:52,850
you know the highest quality
fucking meat, Yadda, fucking Yada.

688
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,660
My girl orders one to 1615
1650 what is that kid?

689
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:02,160
That's 33 bucks plus fries plus drinks,

690
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,910
all that bullshit. You know the
mob doesn't run Vegas anymore.

691
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:08,220
You can't go out and
get yourself a $2 stake.

692
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,420
The whole fucking place out there
now is a god damn. It's a fuck over.

693
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:18,330
So whatever cost me like 40 something
bucks, 50 bucks with the goddamn tip,

694
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,300
I eat it. A aunt wasn't even that
good. My girls like, how's your burger?

695
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:27,290
You know what I said? I said,
it's good just keeping the peace,

696
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:32,330
keeping the water nice and smooth.
Nice and fucking still on the horizon.

697
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,690
Okay.
So anyways,

698
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,450
I get back to my hotel.

699
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:43,230
My girl already tells me she doesn't feel
too good at that burger sitting in or

700
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:46,350
like a God damn boot. And I'm
like, you know what? I feel fine.

701
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,420
I get ready to do my show.
I end my button down shirt,

702
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,530
put a little conditioner in my hair,
what's left of it,

703
00:42:55,531 --> 00:43:00,531
shape it up a little and I head
downstairs to go work the Orleans casino.

704
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,600
The last place Carlin ever worked, the
place where the smothers brothers retired,

705
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,300
you know,
smothers brothers who was so fucking edgy.

706
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,530
They actually lost their sketch show
during the Vietnam War. They did.

707
00:43:16,531 --> 00:43:17,820
So I forget what the sketch was,

708
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:21,780
but they had the balls to
say no to the network and do

709
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,560
a sketch that was actually criticizing
what the fuck we were doing over there

710
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:33,150
and they lost it. God Damn Show, you
know, I don't know about you guys,

711
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:37,290
but for me, that's lifetime
for respect. So anyways,

712
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:41,670
I walked down there and I'm going through
the Orleans casino and then all of a

713
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:46,410
sudden it just fucking hits me. Boom.
Right. My stomach, like some capsule,

714
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,570
some time release.
CIA,

715
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,900
you're going to shit your
pants fucking capsule goes off.

716
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,260
And I know there is no question that
whatever I just ate was not good for my

717
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:57,960
body.

718
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,960
And it was about to reject it one way or
the other without getting crude people,

719
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,900
when something goes into your stomach,
if it's coming out,

720
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,720
it only has two options.
All right.

721
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,570
Anyways,
I just thought of a really,

722
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,020
really bad joke for the fucking third
one and I'm not going to say it,

723
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,790
but it involved stabbing yourself in the
stomach and you can fill in the blanks

724
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:31,150
on that one. All right. So anyways, um,

725
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,450
tell him he gotta be fucking, do you
gotta be shitting me? No Pun intended.

726
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:39,300
So I go in the back way,

727
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,730
the same way that Carlin used to go in,

728
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,390
cause I've already asked everybody every
fucking question. Literally so much.

729
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,130
I'm into Carlin. How did he
leave? Did he hang out now?

730
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:52,020
He'd say good night and he would go
right out the door and he'd be in the car

731
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,420
and he wasn't difficult to work with.

732
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:56,850
I guess he had arthritis at
the end of his life. And uh,

733
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,720
the sound guy was saying one show you
forgot to take the bottle caps off the

734
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:05,721
water bottles and he saw the car loan
was struggling with them and when he got

735
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:10,860
off because George, I'm so sorry. I'm so
sorry. And George just like whack al come.

736
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:13,140
I'd come out and I don't give a
shit. Don't worry. Just walked out.

737
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:15,330
I guess he was a really great guy.
So anyways,

738
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,790
I'm walking through this legendary door
and uh,

739
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,820
you know, and what's worse is like,
I know what's going to happen,

740
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,990
but I know it's not going to
happen for like another 15 minutes.

741
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,440
And coincidentally the fucking show starts
in 15 minutes and I'm going on first.

742
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,010
All right? And this guy,
when you're backstage,

743
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,840
literally says 20 minutes till showtime,
20 minutes till showtime,

744
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,500
he liked counts it down.
I ain't never get nervous before shows,

745
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,230
but this guy counting down
the show is making me nervous.

746
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,960
15 minutes till showtime, okay. And
it's starting to get worse and fuck it.

747
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:59,400
Get literally gets down to two minutes
before showtime. And I'm questioning,

748
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,990
can I make it through a half hour
set? And I was like, you know what?

749
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,010
Fuck this.
The show can't start without me.

750
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,690
My opening music is Elvis Presley.
Anyways, the fuck do I care?

751
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,220
They can listen to that song.

752
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,170
Oh, going robe of illegals.
Lose your long block her,

753
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,910
Slam your fork and fully solve
the fucking sink. A Ho, Ho,

754
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,170
I don't give a shit. And I said, fuck it.

755
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,770
And I fucking ran into the bathroom.

756
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:33,400
And I will spare you the details.
But you know,

757
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:37,990
when something either amazing
or,

758
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,470
uh, something amazing
happens, they make a statue.

759
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,940
If something horrific happens, a lot
of times they will preserve the area.

760
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,850
You know, like Dealey Plaza. Fuck a
president gets his brains blown out.

761
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:55,120
All of a sudden we can't change one blade,
a fucking grass.

762
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:00,220
The horror that happened in that
fucking bathroom, ladies and gentlemen,

763
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:04,270
I never do shit jokes. They should
have retired that fucking bathroom.

764
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,840
That's it. They should
have just fucking, uh,

765
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,950
air sealed it and just
put a glass fucking door.

766
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:17,740
Two people could look in and realize why
they closed that fucking burger joint

767
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:22,870
at the Mandalay Bay and a, I got
to met, dude. I have, I haven't,

768
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,650
this is Monday.
I'm finally back to normal.

769
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,300
So there you go.
There's my big shit story.

770
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,480
I had a burger over at the
fucking Mandalay bay and
it almost ruined my fucking

771
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:42,700
show over at the Orleans. So if you guys
saw me, anybody saw me Saturday night.

772
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:43,871
All right,

773
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,350
you want to talk about a professional
because I extra fucking killed on that

774
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:51,550
show.
If you knew what the fuck happened,

775
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,551
just know that the next time you go to
Vegas and you go to see Barry Manilow and

776
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:01,030
he's singing that song,
Mandy,

777
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,950
you something and you saw
amped and then you stomped and,

778
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,410
but I still want to fuck
you. Oh, Mandy. Right.

779
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,960
Just know that he could have just been
shit in his fucking brains out two

780
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:18,961
minutes before he put on his ray on
fucking slacks with his horrific plastic

781
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:22,870
surgery is yank back face.
I bet you know.

782
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,550
I was going to say he did another
facelift if he fucking shit the way I did

783
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:30,640
before my show. But that's actually
not true. There's no strain.

784
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,530
There was no straining. Um, anyways.
All right bill. Jesus Christ.

785
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:36,364
Enough already.

786
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,640
All right, here we go. Here's a
question for a week. Uh, Bill,

787
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,110
let me start by saying this.

788
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,580
This question stems from events
spanning over the last six years or so.

789
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,130
About six years ago,
at the age of 20,

790
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,220
I was about a year and a half into what
at the time seemed to be a really great

791
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:14,990
relationship.
Coincidentally,

792
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,050
my job and money situation
was also doing really well.

793
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,030
Um,

794
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:25,100
so I decided instead of throwing my
money away on rent, I'd buy a house.

795
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,630
There you go. This guy's making the moves.
He's doing well in life, buying a house.

796
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,740
Everything's good.
So far being that I always plan ahead.

797
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:36,890
I purchased a rather nice
house for a first home,

798
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:42,230
even though I thought, uh, he said,

799
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:46,050
even thought I knew it, even though I
knew it was a little too much money. Um,

800
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,850
now I didn't decide I didn't buy
this to start a family or for her.

801
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:53,090
I just wanted a fucking house,
uh,

802
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,140
in the year or so after the
relationship really went downhill,

803
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,170
mainly because I was working more in
spending less time and money on her.

804
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,340
Um, okay. Uh, long story short,

805
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,990
we split about two years later. Since
then, I've had many encounters with girls.

806
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,220
Okay. So let me, let me fix this
with my awful reading. All right.

807
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,180
Basically, this guy's dating a
girl. He's making good money,

808
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,950
doesn't want to throw his money
down the toilet, paying rent.

809
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:20,510
So he goes and he buys in house.

810
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,680
And then now he's got a nut to fucking
crack every month he works a little bit

811
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:28,640
more. He's not spending time with his
woman and it downhill plus these younger.

812
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,400
That's pretty normal except
the fact that he owns a house.

813
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,410
So now he's in this situation,
he's single,

814
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:36,860
he has this really nice house and this is
what's been happening since. All right.

815
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:40,160
Since then,
I've had many encounters with girls.

816
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,490
The one thing they have all had in common
is their hatred and animosity towards

817
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:47,990
my ex girlfriend and my house.

818
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,570
I've even heard them say things about
sleeping in a bed I bought with her or how

819
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:57,170
they don't like it that I did all
this with, uh, with the other girl.

820
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:02,240
I've been dating a girl for about two
years now and she's the same way. Uh,

821
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:07,040
she even has problems with my dogs
because she says they were her dogs,

822
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:11,990
meaning the ex. My question is this,
why is it never good enough? Well,

823
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:14,630
if you're a fan of this podcast,
you've already asked that question,

824
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:18,170
but I think it's timeless. So I'm going
to go, that's why I'm reading this again.

825
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,490
Am I suppose to start my life over every
time I want to begin a new relationship

826
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,970
or is it that girls really always
want to have what they can.

827
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:31,030
They cannot have half the country nowadays
are just waiting for some guy to put

828
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:33,320
them up in a house and
take care of everything.

829
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,760
But when you give them the chance,

830
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,470
they bitch because they didn't
get to pick the fucking drapes.

831
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,490
Yeah.

832
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:46,530
Oh, this guy is making some good points
near, I'm going to need your help. Paris.

833
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,770
Uh, I don't, uh, I don't get it.

834
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,010
I've done really well for myself
and I've done it on my own.

835
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,250
None of that had anything to do
with who I was dating at the time.

836
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:57,770
And I hate feeling bad
because I'm trying to make,

837
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,660
because I'm trying to better myself.
What should take all right.

838
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:06,590
Nia, what did you say on this? She summed
it up really well here. What do you,

839
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,290
what do you think about this guy? Just
to, just to reiterate, you know, the deal.

840
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:12,170
What, what, what is,
uh, what is his problem?

841
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,710
I think the problem is the
kind of people that he dates,

842
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,400
cause I don't think that
they're mature enough.

843
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,430
So like let go of the past, you
know what I mean? It's like,

844
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,310
of course he stayed at other women, of
course. You know what I mean? It's not,

845
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,870
yeah, but let me ask you this. If, if
when I met you already had a house, right.

846
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,300
And uh, it was, you know, it had a
little bit of the female touch to it.

847
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:37,400
You know what I mean?
Yeah. You know what I mean?

848
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:40,250
It's not like you walked in and there was
just a coffee table and like fucking a

849
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,940
play station, you know, popcorn in
the cushions or whatever. Right.

850
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:46,490
I'm not saying this house looks like
that, but you know. Right. Yeah. No, they,

851
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,930
it looked like, and I still had the bed
that I used to bang the other one me.

852
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,020
Then I'll say, at least she can do,
dude, you can leave, switch out the bed.

853
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:54,750
You know what I mean?

854
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,290
Led though I thought. I think that's a
little, I think that's a little much,

855
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,910
honestly. What did the little much to
still have it? Yeah. He's going to buy it.

856
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,750
Do you have much better because you
don't have him buy a whole new bed just

857
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,670
cause he's slept with somebody else on it.
Ladies,

858
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:12,720
can you see why this is my
girl? You're the shit. Yeah,

859
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:14,160
because I mean how many,

860
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,700
when you're dating somebody and you
have sex with them in their house,

861
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:21,450
chances are they've had sex with somebody
else in their bed before you anyway.

862
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:25,310
So now all of a sudden it's
like a big deal because no, he,

863
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,070
he needs to date some more mature girls,

864
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:31,550
but he's been dating someone
for two years. Uh, I don't
know what he's been doing.

865
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:35,210
I thought you said he, I just
focused on saying the words, right?

866
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,240
Yeah. He says, you know
what? You know what this,

867
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,170
this house could be like
the lock to the lock,

868
00:53:42,171 --> 00:53:46,250
the door tests in them in a Bronx
tale. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah.

869
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:48,530
Like if if they can't deal with
and they start giving me shit,

870
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,240
you give them the heave Ho.
Exactly.

871
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,330
I think they should get the
heave Ho this is my house.

872
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,490
This is where I fuck you want in.

873
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,860
Well not quite so asshole,
but if anything he could,

874
00:54:00,861 --> 00:54:05,060
you know, get some new
sheets or something. You
know what? I know obviously.

875
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,490
Oh yeah. Bed, bath and beyond. I'm
thinking about some new sheets.

876
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:12,140
You want to help me pick out some
girl would love that. Love it. Yeah.

877
00:54:12,141 --> 00:54:13,910
There you go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

878
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,700
At what point in the relationship
should he do that? You know,

879
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:19,850
cause we don't like being tied down.
I want to send the wrong message.

880
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,370
I don't want to say that I love you,
but I want you to still bang me.

881
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,200
Like at what point?
I think when it's like official date,

882
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,190
like a monogamous type thing is when
you can say, hey, lets you know.

883
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,110
Okay. All right. That's really, you
answered the question, don't oversell it.

884
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:40,310
You answered it. I think it's really
annoying that these girls would be like,

885
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,210
oh my God, I can't believe that, you know,

886
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:48,470
this is already decorated and these
are her dogs and as her house,

887
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,080
and I can tell that she's
saying that's stupid.

888
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:55,360
That's how I say how la girls
say favorite. That's my favorite.

889
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,470
All right.

890
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,110
All right. I think that's going
to be the podcast for this week.

891
00:55:03,111 --> 00:55:05,090
So I guess so that's your answer
right there. And you know,

892
00:55:05,091 --> 00:55:09,380
I'm not going to always defer those, uh,
to Nia, but I just think sometimes you're,

893
00:55:09,381 --> 00:55:12,410
you're really asking me what women are
thinking and I think I've done enough

894
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:15,800
trashing of women and, uh, shut up.

895
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,483
MMM.

896
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,100
I'm done enough trashing of them.
And you know,

897
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,760
that's actually a serious question
here because still, you know,

898
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:27,240
you don't want to get that in a situation
where, I mean, you have to, I mean,

899
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,470
literally sell the house. What if it's a
bad fucking market just to appease her?

900
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:32,310
That's ridiculous.
