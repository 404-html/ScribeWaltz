1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,880
Okay. Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:07,080
It's bill burr and it is time
for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:10,060
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,013
Yeah.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,550
Um, oh. Why did I start doing
that? What did I start doing?

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,150
I got to do it every time now. Right.
You got to give the crowd what they want.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,900
You know what I love too is I love that
people listen to this and I know that

8
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,900
they have roommates, they have boyfriends,
girlfriends at fucking hate this.

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,930
And then every fucking Thursday,
you know,

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,860
they got to listen to be obnoxiously yell
like that. And I know right now, Ooh,

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,370
folk off.

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,960
I asked Warren take time right now to
say I'm sorry to those of you in the

13
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:50,860
background. I know it must be difficult.
And also, you know what? Fuck Que,

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't need you. Yeah. Walk
away. I don't give a fuck.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,210
Um, anyway. Oh,

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,470
oh fucking Billy red velvet
pancakes is in a great fucking mood.

17
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,740
That's how I've been eating lately. I'm
still working out, but I'm gradually,

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,210
the pooches come and the pooch, the
pooch, the pooch is coming back.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,200
Hang in over a man under fucking whiz.
Um,

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,620
I'm going to do something about say
pushups and then I'm going to skip rope.

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,150
So anyways,
I'm going on.

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm going on the road tomorrow for two
weeks getting ready for the Madison

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,770
Square Garden show. And uh,
for the first leg of it,

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,810
it's going to be the four horsemen here.
It's going to be me, Bart, Nick Verdesian,

25
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:35,940
La hit. And uh, we're all
going to the Notre Dame.

26
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:40,380
I'm a USC game this weekend
is as far as I know.

27
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:44,860
I think USC, USC got rid
of their, uh, their coach.

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,010
Is that what happened? Why do
I, you know, so you know why?

29
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:51,130
Cause this is all fucking just, I didn't
know I was going to talk about this.

30
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:55,570
I'm like, why didn't I look it up?
Why didn't I read about it? You know,

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,960
why do you run your fucking mouth
without looking up some shit?

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,040
USC coach,
let's see what comes up.

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,610
Clay Helton USC did a horrible thing
to Steve Sarkisyan because it had no

34
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:16,590
choice. Oh, this guy was,
was this guy boozing it up?

35
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,560
Maybe I should call them up.
See what he's doing now.

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,100
Probably got time to do the tour right.
See if we can hang with them. You'll see.

37
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:28,240
Did a horrible thing to Steve
Sarkisyan because it had no choice.

38
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:33,241
The Trojans put their football future
over the health of a person they

39
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:38,120
supposedly cared about.
This was probably the best case scenario.

40
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,670
Oh, they put their football future
over the sky. Ra receiving it, Dan.

41
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:46,650
It was not what? You're good at
editing until this gets done. Uh,

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,140
God just say what he did.
He entered treatment,

43
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,160
showed up drunk a couple of
times and that's fucking great.

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,870
I mean it's sucks cause
he lost a good job.

45
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:58,590
But when she love to see taper or that,
I mean body,

46
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:02,260
take a ne gather out.
Where's my whistle?

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,400
Oh it is right there.
Sorry.

48
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,710
At first after his fucking bullshit,
you know,

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,780
I know there was [inaudible] problems.
Three

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,730
me and a quarter. I can't do
this. This is bad. This port best.

51
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,370
So you know what?
He's going to fucking,

52
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,800
you know what do you got
to tell you something for a
fucking drunk. Look at him.

53
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,690
He looks great.
You know,

54
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,360
it must be all that screaming and yelling
and running up and down the sidelines.

55
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:35,710
I like that he wears the old school,
uh, you know, football coach,

56
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:40,410
black cleats. Right? But the
white stripe, that's unfortunate.

57
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:44,530
Oh that's never fun. Right? To make
fun of a drunk that just lost his job.

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,160
So he's a drunk and they'd do a face
plant at work, but he still has his job.

59
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,430
Then it's hilarious. Right? What
happened? Why am I bringing this up?

60
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,450
I'm in a great mood.

61
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,980
I didn't get fired for drinking and
this one is scary things and all my,

62
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,020
you know, my job, I can
not get fired for drinking.

63
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,960
I can not get fired
because I'm self employed.

64
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,680
I can be asked to leave wherever I'm at,

65
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:10,000
but I'm still a comedian at the end of
the day. Right. So I know it works. Why?

66
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:14,110
Don't know bill, why don't you keep
drinking and figure it out? Um, anyways,

67
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:18,250
so I'm in a great mood cause I got out
of the tour starts tomorrow, you know,

68
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,970
we're all going to be a, it's weird.
We're starting with the dessert first.

69
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,070
Usually we do the whole tour
and then we do go to the game.

70
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,430
But how it worked out is the
game comes first. So, uh,

71
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,140
we're all gonna show up, you
know, meet at the hotel bar.

72
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,590
Whoever gets there first will
probably already be there.

73
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,390
I think Versie gets their last,

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,870
which means he's going to
become wheeling in his bag.

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,620
Probably we'll get one in him
before he even gets to the room.

76
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,120
Come on Paul to a shot, do a shot. Um,
you know, this is going to be awesome.

77
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,210
And then a couple of my buddies
fly in the following day.

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,080
We pick them up the airport. We go
straight to the game to the legendary,

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,360
uh, confines of whatever the fuck. And
the name was a touchdown Jesus stadium.

80
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,350
I have no idea.
Uh,

81
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,520
but I've wanted to go there for a long
time and I have a weird thing with Notre

82
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,960
Dame where I always wanted
to go there when I was a kid.

83
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,160
Um, it was impossible not to
be a fan, you know what I mean?

84
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,090
They were on TV all the time.
It was the fighting Irish.

85
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,760
I got some Irish blood in me,
although I'm mostly German,

86
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,780
but it was fighting Irish, you know, I
looked like the mascot minus the beard.

87
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,850
Right. So it's just like, you
know, I got into it. So I,

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,120
for some reason I wanted to be a lawyer.
Right.

89
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,080
It's probably cause I wanted to be
in front of a crowd. I have no idea.

90
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:40,150
So when I was in junior high,
I was like,

91
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,390
I wanted to go to Notre Dame and go
to law school and become a lawyer.

92
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,710
That's what I was going to do.

93
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,250
And by the Diet had that dream right up
until the first day of freshman year in

94
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:53,710
high school.
And by the end of my freshman year,

95
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:58,480
I was considering going to Wentworth
Institute Boston and getting into

96
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:01,420
construction.
Um,

97
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,850
I'm not going to get into the details
of it, but let's just say it a,

98
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,050
it went off the rails, went
off the rails quick. You know,

99
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,270
I basically,
if you could somehow Ryan leafs,

100
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,070
NFL football career, if you could
just slide that over to academia.

101
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,900
Is that a word to academics? That's
what happened, you know, and in the end,

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,730
you know, halfway through my freshman
year, rather than screaming at a reporter,

103
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,290
you know, I was probably
yelling at my mom, I don't know.

104
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,250
Yeah,
well you have to,

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,760
you're not going to go to college.

106
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,340
I love that. And get your grades
up so you can go to college.

107
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,620
It's like go to college.
I can't even handle high school.

108
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,280
Fuck are you talking about, it's like
sucking at the college level. Hey,

109
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:55,300
try a little harder so you can get
to the NFL doesn't work that way.

110
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:59,650
It does with academics, right. You
can get way in over your fucking head.

111
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,850
Next thing you know,
you're in a major,

112
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,680
you don't even want to be
in and all of that shit.

113
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:06,940
You gotta get the fuck out of it.
Right. So anyways, I absolutely,

114
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:11,830
whose kid knew I had completely just,
I fucking tanked.

115
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,241
I tanked.
You know,

116
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:17,320
like when they say like the coach lost
the locker room and he can tell the

117
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:21,520
team's just not out there
trying, you know, that was me.

118
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,380
I lost my whole drive somewhere
during my junior year.

119
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:30,910
I was just like, you know, what am I
going to summer school again this year?

120
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:32,260
I might as well just have a good time.

121
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,570
I remember in math class I used to get
like my test back and I get like a seven.

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,930
It was always a funny number B. What'd
you get? I guess 75 I got on that bill.

123
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,010
What'd you get? I'd be like, I've
got a nine. I remember getting a 17.

124
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,460
I got an 11.
Like everything I got on the test,

125
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:54,420
like we're like quarterback
numbered jerseys.

126
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,280
I got a Burt Jones,
I got a Troy Aikman.

127
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,320
I got to Steve Grogan and uh,

128
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,470
who's 17 dandy don Meredith
was the 1717 is a tough one.

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,690
Um, I got a Roflik Burger,
uh, which is also Burt Jones.

130
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:21,100
That's number seven Raymond bore right
back then my freshman year of high school,

131
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,580
that was still a Raymond Bork until
my sophomore year, somewhere around.

132
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:29,570
Then he changed to number 77 and speaking
of the Bruins, hey, we go, bro Ain't,

133
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,670
here we go. Um, I fucking love this tape.

134
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,250
All right. It sucks that because his
salary cap and whatever other reasons,

135
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,830
they had to get rid of Hamilton,
Lou Cheech and all these guys.

136
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:45,910
Tyler's saying all of these
fucking guys over the years. Um,

137
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,300
I'm literally watching my own team and I
have like the Bruins Nhl site opened up

138
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,810
onto the raw stuff so I
can figure out who's who,

139
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,350
and I'm not going to lie to you, you know.
Oh, we had some rough ones, you know, um,

140
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,160
Winnipeg,
we got pounded.

141
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,030
MMM.

142
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,010
I should, we did okay
for the first, you know,

143
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,530
half of the game and then
it just went off the rails.

144
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,630
Same thing happened with the Canadians.

145
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,930
And then we jumped out to a two to
nothing lead against Tampa Bay and,

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,360
uh,
and ran at the end of the period,

147
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,540
we let up two quick ones and um,

148
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,910
you know, and then the rest of the
shit happened. And then, I dunno what,

149
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:34,090
so anyways, last night we finally,
we played the fucking, uh,

150
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,510
the avalanche and we fucking
jumped on them early.

151
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,520
We stayed on him and we got
to, that 10 minute period
is, uh, in the second period.

152
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:46,000
That was just like, no, all right, all
right, please don't fucking implode.

153
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
And we got all the way right to the end
and then we took it fucking double mine

154
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,970
and a, the score to fucking goal.
I think at that point it was like,

155
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,530
it's either three to nothing of four
to nothing. Then it became four to one,

156
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,220
then it was five, nothing, some five
to two. And I thought, you know,

157
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,230
in the third period I thought we
were gonna fuck it up, but we didn't,

158
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:09,460
we hung in there. We got our first, uh,
we got our first victory and your illness,

159
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,780
Gustafson Gustafson was in net and a,
I just want to say to Provence, France,

160
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,230
don't jump all over. Tuka I know
he led in a ton of fucking goals,

161
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:22,060
but also we had a bunch of
new guys and um, you know,

162
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,310
don't do that Boston thing,
that New York thing,

163
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,150
that east coast fucking thing where
you're only as good as your last fucking

164
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:30,390
game where you know,
you know,

165
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,570
forget the fact of all the
successes that these guys had.

166
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:37,370
Same thing with the head
coach and everything. So, um,

167
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,670
because there's so many new players,

168
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,260
what they did before the Bruins game is
what I wish they would do before every

169
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:48,520
hockey game. If anybody connected,
working with the NHL is listening.

170
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,820
If you want to get people
a little more on board,

171
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,050
every other fucking sport does this
before the fucking game starts.

172
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,820
Like if you're watching a baseball
game, they'll just be showing the, the,

173
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,600
the whole baseball fields and then they'll
just put the names of all the players

174
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,360
of where they're at and they'll do it.
Football teams.

175
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:11,710
And then they showed the lineups.
You know, they give you a chance,

176
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,280
they do it in football or fences on,

177
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,590
they show the offense and they
show the other team's defense.

178
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:21,640
And then the other people get the ball
the same fucking thing for some reason in

179
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,474
hockey

180
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,810
where it's going 90 fucking zillion
miles an hour and you have substitutions

181
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,570
happening while the puck is still in play.

182
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,790
For some reason they never fucking do it.
So before the Bruins game,

183
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,120
they did it and this was what
our lines look like. They had,

184
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,890
our first line was Ericson,
Bert Bergeron,

185
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,160
Ron and Conley than we had.

186
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,640
I didn't even know how to say
Boleski crazy pasta knock.

187
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,450
And then Kelly Hayes,
ah,

188
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,880
you had fucking four points last night.

189
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:59,620
Then it was Rinaldo Kim pining and
Talbot was our fourth line. So then,

190
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,250
you know, I started looking up the
numbers and I'm able to get on. I'm, I'm,

191
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,310
I'm all caught up.
I still haven't watched the Winnipeg game.

192
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,070
I'm watching that today, so
I'll be all caught up and, uh,

193
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,760
hopefully heard Brad Marshawn and starting
to skate with the team again. So I'm,

194
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:15,490
I'm fucking site. And I think
that play playing well, you know,

195
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:18,910
we just had to learn to kind of a,
I dunno,

196
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,500
we weren't getting physical with anybody.

197
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,370
We're just sort of skating
the fuck around and, uh,

198
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,890
we'd let up a couple of goals and then we,
I don't know,

199
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,140
it took a bunch of penalties. I got
to tell you though, our power play,

200
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,630
it looks like shit though. Our
power play looks like shit, but uh,

201
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,980
we're great at killing penalties. God
knows, you know, if you take 90 a game,

202
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,050
you get pretty good at it.
You get a lot of practice.

203
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,490
I think we took like seven or eight
when we played the Canadians, but, um,

204
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,990
but anyways, I'm, I'm,
I'm on board, you know,

205
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,730
I thought this was going
to be a brutal year.

206
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,310
Like is it for the last few games
is as bad as they're going to play.

207
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm watching every fucking game.

208
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:57,100
I can totally handle it and it's going to
be interesting to see what they can do.

209
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:01,480
A, if we can maybe add,
we don't really have,

210
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,680
we don't have a guide who's going to
score like 40 goals. I don't feel, I mean,

211
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,090
maybe we could if they start to gel,

212
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:14,410
but we just don't have anything
like that on our team. And, uh,

213
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,970
but I was like, and we would take in
a little bit more less shit. You know,

214
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,000
our defensemen McQuaids always good
to fucking clear somebody else.

215
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,350
So it's Chara obviously, but uh, we'll see
how the rest of this goes down. But uh,

216
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:30,190
I'm fucking psyched. I'm psyched. But I'm
going on the Rodeo for like two weeks,

217
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,830
so I got to figure out how to use that.
Um,

218
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,500
that shit where you can
watch the game. Oh, you know,

219
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,510
I'm going with Bochnik barnacles.
Show me how to do it.

220
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,080
You don't have to feel like right now
I'm not even doing a podcast anymore.

221
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm just sort of talking to
myself as unpacking. I apologize.

222
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:47,620
Let's get back to the podcast here.
So whatever we got our first two points,

223
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,960
we're not in the cellar anymore and
I'm actually debating getting the NBA

224
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:57,730
package this year to step might
start watching the Celtics to, um,

225
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,630
you know,
my marriage will suffer if I get both.

226
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,330
If I get both of those going and
the NFL, you know, fucking happy,

227
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:08,770
I'm going to be upset. My wife's
going to be, this is how cool Nina is.

228
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,060
You know what?
She got me the other day,

229
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,090
she got me this thing that
makes round ice cubes,

230
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,650
these giant round ice cubes that you
stick in your drink for when you're having

231
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,484
a little lick.

232
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,290
And she only got me one because she
wasn't sure if it was going to fucking uh,

233
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,040
if it was going to, if I was going
to like it. And I absolutely love it.

234
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:31,030
So I've been making them all day.
You know what the fucking movie was?

235
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,280
It was it good fellas when they
will make them like the eight balls,

236
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:34,900
that's what I'm doing
except with ice cubes.

237
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,170
And my goal is to have it all filled
up these round ice cubes, you know?

238
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh Shit.
I just came up with a brutal idea.

239
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,000
What you could do with
those kids do not do this.

240
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,170
I figure everybody listens to this is
too old for a snowball fight member.

241
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:53,300
Back in the day when you fucking hated
somebody who made the old ice ball,

242
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,810
everybody's throwing snow and then you'd
fucking put some ice in the middle of

243
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:00,320
it. You always took that one either
to the fucking side of the head,

244
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:03,950
took it right to the temple or you took
it in the knee cap one or the other.

245
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,130
I always caught you right on a fucking
phone. It was never, you know what I mean?

246
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,650
You've got this giant
fucking winter coat on.

247
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,890
You're wearing basically a flak jacket.
It would never hit that.

248
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,150
Come sail and right in and he
got you stupid knitted cap. What?

249
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:21,590
The palm palm on it. By the way, could the
NFL make those hats any fucking bigger?

250
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,540
How dumbed did Tom Brady and uh,

251
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,500
what's is there Cameron Crowe there
that plays for the fucking, uh,

252
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,350
the fucking panthers look dead.

253
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:34,370
Giant stupid hat on both of them.
Tom,

254
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,250
Tom Brady and uh, Nate Newton.
What the fuck is his name? Walk.

255
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,460
God dammit. What's the fuck's the name
of the guy he played from off for Auburn?

256
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,510
He won the Heisman trophy.
They said he was cheating.

257
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,050
Is it Cameron? I fucking
don't know. Anyways,

258
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,450
both Tim and Tom Brady,

259
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,840
they have like movie
star good looks right.

260
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:04,030
The two of them be put those fucking ads
on him and I kick [inaudible] wearing

261
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,270
like they're adults. Oh,
hang on a sec. Hello.

262
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,450
Hey, um, I'm doing the podcast. They
got you on speaker. Say what's up. Oh,

263
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,400
hi. Hi. I'll see you in a minute.

264
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,840
But um,
anyways,

265
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,710
why don't we make the hats so
fucking big is my big question.

266
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,840
I want to speak in the NFL football.

267
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,930
If I could just dance all over the fucking
place here because I'm so excited to

268
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,800
go on the road. My add is just flying
off the fucking rails here. Um,

269
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,260
to the point,
just cause I said that,

270
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,720
I just forgot what the fuck I was
going to talk about. Nfl Football,

271
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,980
the Patriots are playing the crying cults,
the Indianapolis Crying Colts.

272
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,130
They're playing him this weekend.
Andrew luck chart though. So we'll see.

273
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,010
We'll see. What the fuck happens. I will,
you know, if we beat them or whatever,

274
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:00,840
I don't want, I'm not gonna
fucking talk any shit because a,

275
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm not going to be like,
um,

276
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,410
because I know luck isn't 100%. So
that's the thing too about the patriots.

277
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,860
It's like we got this gaudy record, but
I don't feel like we've played anybody.

278
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,440
You know, the Steelers weren't the
Steelers, right? We played Jacksonville,

279
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,900
they stank, we played the bills. You know,

280
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,500
they're still trying to find their way.

281
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,960
And then we played the
cowboys without Tony Romo.

282
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:31,910
So here we are sitting on four now, you
know, I don't know. I'd like to see, uh,

283
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,750
how we do against the packers is something
that giants are starting to come on.

284
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,870
SLAAC and Eli Manic. Ah, my God,

285
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:43,610
if we never see Eli manning
again in the playoffs, you know,

286
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,950
happy. I will be. I totally,

287
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,350
I'm telling you the
football gods love that man.

288
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,010
I got this big debate with Paul
and I was going through it.

289
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:56,670
He's basically drew breeze with the
defense. He's not as good as Brady.

290
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,290
He's not as good as Peyton
manning. He's, he's got dude,

291
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,990
he's fucking gangster and all this shit.

292
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,700
And what it really was is I know the
guys, the shit, what it was was when,

293
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,530
the way that the giants beat
the 40 niners was it last week?

294
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,730
I've been running around so much.

295
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,660
The way that they beat them made me
have a flashback to when they beat us.

296
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,810
When we were undefeated,
it was the same fucking thing.

297
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,610
I watched Eli throw a pic to
lose the game and I watch it.

298
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,240
I watched it get dropped.

299
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,080
And you do not want to
give that second chance.

300
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,070
Who's getting hope you like?
It's a lot of the fucking credit,

301
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:35,250
but it was their front format and then
front for stray in and all those guys

302
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,990
kicked the shit out of
our old line briefly.

303
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,630
The game fucking running for his life.
I mean that was,

304
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,550
that had a lot to do with it.
But uh,

305
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,970
Eli also made this fucking huge place
that I don't want to see that guy again.

306
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,860
I just, you know, it's funny as far as
he's going like, dude, he, you know,

307
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,740
even the New York media, they keep jumping
on the guy that always jumping on him,

308
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,150
you know,
he's like,

309
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:57,330
look at Brett Farve Brett or five
two with a bunch of interceptions.

310
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,050
You'd help blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, all this
shit, you know? And he goes,

311
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:03,240
they just liked him because he
was a hick and I was like, dude,

312
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,680
Eli and Brett Farve of, I'm not mistaken.
And from the same state, aren't they?

313
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,710
Both from Louisiana.
This is the deal.

314
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,110
The problem Eli has is mechanically,

315
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,680
he's not as good as his brother, even
though I would take him in the playoffs,

316
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,480
um, over his brother, I think
for whatever fucking reason.

317
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:25,920
And he's just had more success.

318
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,270
And that the reason why I
think people jump on Eli,

319
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,960
the man just does not look
good in a football uniform.

320
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,350
He doesn't look good. When he
puts his, puts the helmet on,

321
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,660
he just doesn't look good,
you know?

322
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:42,040
And then when he's ease out
in his street clothes, yeah,

323
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,830
he's walking around wearing like action
slacks and a fucking sweater, you know,

324
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:49,530
partners here on the side.
Like he's still in the third grade.

325
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,710
It's like he's asking for it.
I don't want to blame the victim,

326
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,000
but the man is fucking asking for it.
However,

327
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,630
I do think he's the shit and if somehow
it works out that the giants get

328
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:08,460
healthy, you know, Jpp you know,
comes back, right. And they somehow,

329
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,110
you know,

330
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,740
have a better record or they go in and
they'd beat Green Bay in Green Bay and we

331
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:18,480
faced them in the Superbowl. I'm telling
you right now, I am not watching it.

332
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,320
I'm not sitting through that again. And I
know what you're thinking. Jesus Christ.

333
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,860
Bill, I think you're a fan and your
team. I am. I am a fan of my team.

334
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,420
But how many times can you get fucking
slap to the face before you don't start

335
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,970
Winston first? You know, um,

336
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,650
although it would be great to come
back and try to avenge those to God we

337
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:41,310
fucking gave it. Didn't give it to
them. We gave them two up to something.

338
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:45,810
Samuel dropped that pick Brady
to Welker three yard pass.

339
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,790
Those fuckups allowed
Eli to become a legend.

340
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,490
All right. Now I'm not
taking it away from me. Like,

341
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:57,190
cause he'd had the fucking
deliver any did. Um,

342
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:58,891
oh my God,

343
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,650
it makes me sick to my stomach thinking
we're going to play the fucking giants

344
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:05,850
again. Jesus Christ. You
think winning four of them,

345
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:07,920
you could just fucking
walk it off and be happy.

346
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:12,000
But now I'm actually gonna try to do a
podcast with Rappaport right after. Uh,

347
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,720
we play each other and nobody
talks shit like that guy.

348
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:18,780
If you guys listened to him on stern
when he does the fantasy football thing,

349
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,800
Rapaport is out of his fucking mind.
Um,

350
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,520
so giant fence.
If you guys win,

351
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,990
you're going to want to tune in to his
podcast. If I'm on their Patriot fans,

352
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:34,680
you get a maybe want to take
up a cyclic or something.

353
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:38,750
You might want to skip that
one. Um, anyway, so let me
do some, uh, let me do laugh.

354
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,970
Fuck, I forgot to bring this shit up.
I forgot to bring it. You know what?

355
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,860
I forgot to bring it down.
I bring up the draft kings thing.

356
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,690
I love talking about
these guys cause I love,

357
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,960
I love that people thought that
they were going to fucking somehow,

358
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,451
you know what I had real,

359
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:56,451
do you realize that sports stadiums
have like draft king little fucking like

360
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:02,690
booths there
or thinks they are at least three?

361
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,680
Is it just they're advertised. There's no
way they have the boots at the stadium.

362
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,100
I have to look that up because if they do,
they're literally the sports book.

363
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,130
Let me look this up. Draft
King. Needless to say,

364
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:15,640
they're never going to fucking advertise
on this thing anyways and I can't help

365
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:20,290
it. I can't not talk about this.
This is fucking fascinating. Alright.

366
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,350
Draft kings booths at stadiums
probably boost isn't the right thing.

367
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,860
VIP experience. She lets stay
premium seating. Nah that's not it.

368
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,580
Maybe they just say I I saw somebody
showed where they had like one of those,

369
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:38,890
what do you call it?
An awning and it said draft kings on.

370
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,660
It's like there's no way you can walk up.

371
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,590
That'll probably be be like the next
thing. But whatever that I told you.

372
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:47,060
I think I told the story
the last time about the, uh,

373
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,550
that thing on fan duel where the guy
worked on Wall Street and said, you know,

374
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:56,050
I'm quitting my Wall Street job to
try to win $1 million on fan duel.

375
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,810
And then of course he does. Of course he
does, right? Because that's all you do.

376
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:03,100
Just, you know, pick your players and the
pickup your cash. Simple as that. Right?

377
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,770
So the guy wins and fucking
Billy does and then quit.

378
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,090
I'm to believe that this man walks
away from a six figure job to take his

379
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:13,860
million dollar earnings that are now
about four and 80 grand after taxes,

380
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,140
and he's now going to take that in,

381
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:19,720
invested as new business of gambling on
football and that he's not going to end

382
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:23,380
up being homeless. Um, anyways,

383
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,370
I feel at this point I'm just fucking
beaten a dead, a beating a dead horse.

384
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,420
I always hated that fucking scene.
Beating a dead horse. It's like, oh,

385
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:35,740
it was okay to beat it when
it's alive. You can't, you know

386
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,820
it back in the day when I,
when me and uh,

387
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,900
first you were talking about
what you would do if you, uh,

388
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,970
had like a time machine. I think I just
figured out what the fuck I would do.

389
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,420
I would go back in time and I would
fucking abuse people. Abusing animals.

390
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,070
Okay.

391
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,900
Well then again, if I was
going to do that, then what
about human being expelled?

392
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,860
You're gonna go in there and
try and stop slavery. Yeah.

393
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,710
Go back and try to give the fucking
native Americans a little heads up.

394
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,390
What the fuck am I read for this week?
Youtube video.

395
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:12,780
What happened to Canada?
Hollywood improv.

396
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,790
You dispute has been escalated to a claim.
What the fuck is that?

397
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,400
Yeah.

398
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,880
Disconnect. Where the fuck is
the fucking Jesus Christ? Oh,

399
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:24,820
I'm in the wrong one here.
I'm in the wrong account.

400
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,600
Okay.

401
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,170
Why do I have so many accounts? All right.
Here we go. Sorry. Jesus. Chris, you guys,

402
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:32,420
just walk it off. Go make yourself
a sandwich and a couple of seconds.

403
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:36,500
I'll get back to the podcast here.
Come on, come on. Come on. Ah,

404
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:40,300
there's the re there's
the reeds. All right. Uh,

405
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,250
club w club, Debbie. Um,

406
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,330
don't you hate when wine looks like a 10,

407
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:52,130
but it winds up tasting like a six or
even worse when you walk into the store to

408
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:56,750
pick out your wine. You could easily be
fooled into a situation just like this.

409
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,100
Well now I'll just like this meeting,

410
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:03,220
the thing before I thought
you were set me up for yeah,

411
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:08,140
I'd like judge wine by the label
and I refuse to buy any wine that's,

412
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,840
that has the name of somebody. I'm
not buying Paul Newman's fucking, uh,

413
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:17,000
Sierra mist, whatever the fuck you
call a wine. You know his Barolo.

414
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,990
I'm not doing that. It's like, dude,
I'll buy your fucking dressing.

415
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,350
I'll buy your popcorn. I know
it goes to a good cause. Okay.

416
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,350
I'm trying to get fucked up here.
All right.

417
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,880
It has to be somebody famous that's
like notoriously a fucking drunk.

418
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,510
Like if the guy from USC, if the
coach, if he put out a wine right now,

419
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,700
although wine I was, man, they'll
drink fucking $2 bottles. So fuck that.

420
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:44,670
That's a bad thing. I Dunno.
Anyways. Well now here.

421
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,910
Well now there's this new wine club
club Debbie Club dubby for we watch.

422
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,650
Shame on you fool me. Get, you're
not gonna fool me again. This.

423
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,160
They've changed everything.

424
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,430
No more being fooled by wines that
pretend to be harder or tastier than they

425
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,960
actually are. It's
easy. Just go to club w.

426
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:06,750
Dot com and answer six simple questions.

427
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:09,330
Their algorithm creates a
power profile just for you.

428
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:10,950
I don't feel like they're
explaining this right.

429
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,260
There's like a zillion
different kinds of wines.

430
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,100
How the hell do you know
what's good? What's bad? Yeah.
I basically, I personally,

431
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:20,520
I judge it on how much it costs
or how cool the label looks.

432
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,820
You know what I mean? That's no
way to do it. These guys will say,

433
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:28,200
what do you like in your wine?
They come up with a formula, right?

434
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,130
Just take out your cash and
they'll pick out the wine.

435
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,190
This is the draft kings of fucking,
I'll fucking wine.

436
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,580
Oh, okay. So they come up
with the algorithm and a
Palette profile, just view.

437
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,590
Then they dig.
Just send why directly to your door?

438
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,690
Perfectly customized to match your tastes.

439
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:51,691
Club w tear is the leading is leading
the grape to glass wine revolution.

440
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,720
They worked directly with the
vignettes to cut out the middle man,

441
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:58,450
which saves you a lot of Moolah.
So with club Debbie,

442
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,990
you get freemium wine,

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,900
customize to your tastes at a third
of what you'd pay at the store.

444
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,230
Forget about all the bottles you
buy that you actually think stink.

445
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,010
They even have a no risk hundred percent
guarantee that you'll love what they

446
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:15,790
send you.
And Right now club Debbie Club Darby.

447
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm a war president.

448
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,610

00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,440
okay.

456
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,310
That's just as hard.
You know,

457
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:48,160
I wanted to try a different beer and
there's like a zillion of them. I just,

458
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:51,580
I can't get into these things
like, you know, ugly dog.

459
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,340
Go Fuck yourself all.

460
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,260
Always have these cool names and
then you drink them and they stink.

461
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,150
You know what I mean? All of that fucking,
you know, angry vineyard, you know,

462
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:05,500
fuck you orchard, all of
that stuff. Crazy mix,

463
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,150
donkey punch, you know, ball
bag, brew, all of that stuff.

464
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,380
The hoppy, you know, Honduras,
whatever the fuck it is.

465
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,120
None of it's, you know, you know what
I bought that absolutely fucking sucks.

466
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,580
I bought Guinness Blonde Ale.
I'm telling you right now,

467
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,530
if you ever just wanted to buy a six pack,

468
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,130
have a sip and then dump the rest in
a sewer. That is the beer for you.

469
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,310
I Love Guinness,
but Jesus Christ.

470
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,860
Okay,

471
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,670
that's a classic. Stick to what you
know they have Freddie. All right.

472
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:41,870
Identify the pain of
hiring. Oh, zip recruiter.

473
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,570
All right.
As a business owner,

474
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:48,710
your company is only as good as the people
you hire. Posting jobs at one place.

475
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:52,080
It's not enough to find quality
candidates. Short staff,

476
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,390
short staffing leaves little time to post
to dozens of job sites. Jesus Christ.

477
00:28:56,391 --> 00:29:00,710
What do you do while you can position
zip recruiter is the solution or am I

478
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:01,670
supposed to do that?

479
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,040
Okay,

480
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,300
I don't understand this copy.

481
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:06,500
Just send me the copy and
stop telling me what to do.

482
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:09,820
But to position Ziprecruiter is a
solution. Don't know what to do.

483
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,230
Go to Ziprecruiter,
everybody.

484
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,410

487
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,130

488
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,730
Ziprecruiter has been used
by over 400,000 businesses.

489
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,910
Insert approve user testimonial.

490
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,300
I think this is more like a professional
chef. All right, I'll do one. I had a job,

491
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,920
oh, selling low. I had to take a,

492
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,810
and then nobody was selling lemonade
and this guy came up and afford ranch.

493
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,140
He slowed down and he kept
going and I was thinking, shoot,

494
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,590
that could've got me 35 cents.
I need someone else to help me.

495
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:56,110
So then I went to zip recruiter
and I said, hey, you watch
work, a lemonade stand.

496
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,990
Next thing you know,

497
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,190
over 40 are the most authentic
individuals I've ever seen in my life.

498
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,030
Who actually thought that over
the age of 35 working at 11 age,

499
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:07,630
Dan was a good deal.
They got to me.

500
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,460
Can I was able to hire nine of
them and that never happened again.

501
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,390
I piss and shit whenever I want.

I'm so fucking excited to go to that
Notre Dame game. Oh, the drinking.

We're gone and drank a bunch of

I'm going to root for the Irish.

511
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,050
You know I'm going to root for the Irish
over fucking USC. I never liked USC.

512
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,070
You know, if they just had one more
fucking song that the band could play,

513
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,190
I literally think I could make
the USC band playing trumpet.

514
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,900
If it can be fucking six weeks,
I could learn how to golf

515
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,140
58 fucking times a quarter.

516
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,030
I'm not the most creative people. They're
down at USC. You know what I mean?

517
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,790
I don't get it. They got the
money, you know. Um, all right.

518
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,000
Uh, okay. We got to wrap this

bunch of shit I got to do,

519
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,920

and uh, um, when I'm done doing this shit,

520
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,100
did I mention I'm going to be on the road?
Uh,

521
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm actually running down to the grocery
store and I'm gonna make some pumpkin

522
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:35,850
bread cause every year I make it

00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:44,400
So I'll miss um,
Miss Halloween.

525
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:46,560
So I'm going to knock out
a couple of loaves here.

526

Make like four or five tonight with my
round ice cube. Fucking whiskey going out.

527
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:53,730
It's going to be the shit.
It's going to be the shit I might,

528
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,800
I haven't smoked a cigar. Well over
two weeks. I am so ready to fucking go.

529
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,640
Um, I swear to God. I'm ready.

530
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:04,560
I'm ready to run to the fucking airport.

531
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,280
I'd ladies do you get this
fucking exciting? What, what
gets you going like this?

532
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,090
There's gotta be something.
I know it is.

533
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,100
There's no way you go to life
not getting this excited.

534
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:18,360
I'm meeting five of my favorite
guy friends in the fucking,

535
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,640
like I have women friends.
I don't have any women friends.

536
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,320
Five of my favorite friends
in the fucking world to booze,

537
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,680
smoked cigars and go to
the Notre Dame USC game.

538
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,770
I like one of my buddies is
going to be on my fucking flight.

539
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,600
It is going to be a
wire to wire shit y'all.

540
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,820
I can't wait. Oh, we're going to be bleary
by the time we get to Fort Wayne. Um,

541
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:44,310
I'm really looking forward
to Fort Wayne to, and um,

542
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,460
I understand some of you guys,

543
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:50,610
if you can't fucking make it cause the
patriots are playing the cults, um,

544
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,700
at that time I get it. What are you
going to do? That totally makes sense.

545
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:57,230
So anybody who's shown up to that,
thank God, bless you. God bless you.

546
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,133
You know what I mean?

547
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,230
I might even go out and take some
fucking pictures with the afterwards.

548
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,200
I should fucking do that. You know,
I should do that in Fort Wayne.

549
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,910
You know what I mean? Go out there
amongst all your drunk, you know,

550
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,090
she'd come up to me, hammered,
spitting in my face, not meaning to,

551
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:15,530
and then I got to wipe it off. I'll
don't, I'm sorry. Did I get ya? You know,

552
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,420
um, I might even go out there.
I might even go out there.

553
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:23,570
Usually what I do is I go
right back to the fuck.

554
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:26,520
And the same thing you would do.
You're done with your job.

555
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,030
Are you going to go hang around for more
job or are you going to go out to your

556
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:34,410
car and start drinking?
That's what the fuck I would do.

557
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,990
It's a no brainer. Um, all right.
I'm sorry. I'm being a criteria.

558
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,390
They'll bill you really going to grace
us with your big fucking head. You can't.

559
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,520
What makes you think we're not
going to drive away? You're
arrogant. Fuck, I dunno.

560
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,950
Um, anyways, let's, let's wrap
this up here. Uh, before I go.

561
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,040
Uh, Lamar Odom, everybody, man,

562
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:56,940
I hope this for some reason
he pulls through and uh,

563
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,380
thank God he's actually at this point
surrounded by Kardashians in that film

564
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:03,000
crew to uh,

565
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,830
let him know that they really care so
they can get all the crying on camera so

566
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:10,970
they can fucking get some ratings.
Jesus Christ. That bet I heard that day.

567
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,600
That's what they're doing.
That better not be true.

568
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,530
That poor guy seems like the
nicest fucking guy ever. Um,

569
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,180
because I'm sitting in glorifying, going
out boozing and shit. Jesus Christ.

570
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,190
I hope the guy pulls through
obviously. Um, so that is it.

571
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,260
The, how can I end on that note
then? I guess it was a negative,

572
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:34,390
but it's sad. I'll tell you what one. Um,

573
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,000
okay.

574
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,370
All right. That's how happy story.
This morning I had flown, you know,

575
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,290
doesn't the helicopter
thing and well over a month.

576
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:44,870
So I had to get down there just because
I knew I was going to be gone for

577
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:48,200
another two weeks. I didn't
want to get too rusty. Um,

578
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:52,850
so I did a flight this morning and
it was just like no one was up there.

579
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,860
It was so fucking clear. It was one of
the sickest flights I've ever done. I,

580
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:02,180
um, transition, uh,

581
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,190
through lax is airspace
like 150 feet off the water,

582
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,650
flew right over these guys
sitting on surfboards.

583
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,050
I was so low I could actually look.

584
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:16,790
And I saw a father telling his son to
look up at the helicopters, were going by,

585
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,550
made a right turn at Santa Monica.

586
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:24,551
Piers flew right over a write up Santa
Monica right by the use you as a UCLA

587
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:32,060
campus. And then I went over to the Fox
slot where I just had some acting work,

588
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:35,510
flew right over where we
were shooting. And then, um,

589
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,490
I flew back over to where my houses
did a lap around the top of my house.

590
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,480
And then went over to the rose bowl,
did a lap around that,

591
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,910
um, data, low approach
at El Monte airport,

592
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,950
straight out departure and then landed
back at fucking long beach was it was the

593
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:56,784
shit.

594
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,730
I'm so happy I did that because it was
getting to the point is that thing where

595
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:02,100
you don't do it for a while and you
stay stuck getting nervous again. Like,

596
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:06,660
Oh fuck Darren, remember how to
do this shit? So I'm one of the,

597
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,620
I dunno, maybe this is only
appealing to people that uh,

598
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,590
that have a pilot's license,
but I got to tell you like the,

599
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:17,850
the fucking privilege to be able to do
that and the feeling you get when you're

600
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:21,810
up there is really a indescribable,
um,

601
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,270
such a cool thing.
But I'm still,

602
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:27,600
I get nervous like about making the
call when you got to go through Bravo

603
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:31,530
airspace because you got
to have total fucking 100%.

604
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:34,050
They got to read you a whole tail number
is one of these things where they can

605
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:38,040
say you have clearance but they don't
read your hotel number and you got to say

606
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:41,070
back to them your whole fucking tail
number or else your in trouble even though

607
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:44,280
they fucked up. You know what I
mean? I don't want to get in trouble.

608
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,160
That's like the, that's what I
had the biggest nightmare of.

609
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,520
I don't even have anything about the
engine cutting out anymore. You know,

610
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:53,010
I've done enough of those auto rotations.
We did a few more today.

611
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,610
We only did one, but I, you know, I did
a great job, you know, stimulating, um,

612
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,320
engine failure. Granted, you
know, if I got a nice long
fucking runway to pick out,

613
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,810
you know, it was funny when we were
flying today, they were doing the uh,

614
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:05,660
the earthquake,
um,

615
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,180
drill at all of the schools.

616
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,480
So every school I f I flew over or flu
near had a bunch of kids standing out in

617
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:19,560
the field, which was unsettling because
those are the places I, you know,

618
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:22,350
you look and like if I have a problem,
that's where the fuck I'm landing.

619
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,840
And you look down, there's a bunch of
kids there and you're like, all right,

620
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,570
now I've got to try to put it
down on the street. You know,

621
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:32,550
there's all these wires and the fucking
traffic lights and all that shit. But, um,

622
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:37,360
it was an unbelievably clear day.
Um,

623
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,760
and it was also cool out. It
wasn't hot fluid, the doors off.

624
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,440
It was the fucking shit. Um, it
was awesome. So anyways, I didn't,

625
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,360
what the fuck I'm babbling about here?
Uh,

626
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,110
and I'm sure I was all over the map and
I was probably talking too fast here,

627
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:55,470
but I'm excited to do this tour and
to do the run through the Midwest.

628
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:59,340
Once again. We're going to be doing Fort
Wayne. We do in Cincinnati, Columbus,

629
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:04,200
Cleveland, Pittsburgh,
Milwaukee, Chicago, Minneapolis.

630
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,950
I might've forgot one in there, but
uh, with Taryn all the way through the,

631
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,170
the Midwest and um,

632
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,460
we got law ahead with us right through
Columbus. He's not doing Pittsburgh,

633
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:19,410
but he's doing, um, he is
going to do Cleveland and uh,

634
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:22,350
the after party, by the way,
the afterparty and Cleveland,

635
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:26,340
if you guys want to hang out with us is
going to be at hilarity. His comedy club.

636
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,770
Um, they got the Martini bar. We're
going to be going there after the show.

637
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,590
Uh, nick cost is one of my
favorite people in this business,

638
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,060
the owner of hilarity.

639
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,330
And he used to headline me there when
I would draw like 30 or 40 people.

640
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:44,110
So whenever I come to town
I always make sure that, um,

641
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,700
I always make sure that I, I stopped
by say hello and thank you to him.

642
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,340
Whenever I go to Pittsburgh,
I always make sure I say,

643
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,320
what's up and thank you to Randy Bauman,

644
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:58,540
a Wd v e uh,
built me up in that market,

645
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,040
you know, big time hockey fan
and all that type of shit.

646
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:04,030
He always breaks my balls
about the fucking Patriot
being cheaters and all that

647
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:08,080
shit. So a lot of good stuff to be looking
forward to coming up. And once again,

648
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,410
thanks to everybody who's bought
tickets and that's it for the Thursday

649
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,390
afternoon, Monday morning
podcast just before Thursday.

650
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,490
Throwback Shit for you.
I'll see out there on the road.

651
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,833
Yeah.

652
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,260
Nervous Scott.

653
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,973
Um,

654
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,080
uh,
my college,

655
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,740
uh,
has been dating his fiance for two years.

656
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,210
He's a really nice guy so he tends
to get walked all over Jesus Christ.

657
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,560
I have to read that again because there's
so much that right there is something

658
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:13,790
that every guy needs to hear.

659
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,660
He's a really nice guy so he
tends to get walked all over.

660
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,840
I'm not saying you have to be a dick.
All right.

661
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,880
But you got to stick up for
yourself. Okay, here we go.

662
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,410
Even before they got engaged,

663
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,560
I had heard rumors about his girlfriend
being a bit of a hole where as his

664
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,094
friend.

665
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,910
Okay.

666
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,100
As his friend and her pretend friend,

667
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,990
I attempt to give her the benefit of
the doubt and ignore the accusations,

668
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:45,170
as did my roommate who had also heard
the rumors unless she was drunk and got

669
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:49,650
out of control and belittling him.
We didn't mind.

670
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,060
We didn't mind her too much aside for her.
Trying too hard to be one of the guys.

671
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,570
Okay. Recently. Okay,

672
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:02,100
now this one I'm fucking up reading
because he's naming all names. Recently,

673
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,270
uh,
Ebenezer called to me and said that uh,

674
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:10,080
Tabitha had kissed a guy at a bar.

675
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,790
Okay.

676
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,540
And that the,
okay.

677
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,430
Recently the fucking potential groom
called up to say that the fucking his

678
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,830
fiance who were,

679
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,800
had kissed a guy at a bar and that
they were postponing their wedding and

680
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:24,060
starting fresh.

681
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,090
I was just surprised to hear
that he wasn't dumping this
bitch. Uh, but whatever.

682
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:33,120
Not My choice. At least he knew
about it. So after starting fresh,

683
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,860
what seemed to be the fifth time it
appeared that they were working it out.

684
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,030
Of course, this is when
things go completely off the
rails with one phone call,

685
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,013
a friend,

686
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,250
another friend who knew nothing about
the cheating kiss that happened a few

687
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,200
weeks ago tells me that a friend of
his from college was told by his whore

688
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:56,201
fiance that she would break off the
engagement if he gave her a chance.

689
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,340
Just fucking yesterday.
What?

690
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,090
Well, why can't she just open up
her mouth and break it off anyways?

691
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:08,000
The source seems reliable,
but it's still just hearsay.

692
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,980
All of his friends now know,
but somehow the potential groom doesn't.

693
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,530
There is no easy way to
bring this up to him. So, um,

694
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,220
up to here, any advice? Thanks
for the podcast and the podcast.

695
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:23,740
Select hope to see you
perform against soon. Oh fuck.

696
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:26,520
Okay.

697
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,010
All right. You got to make
a call here. You got a,

698
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,040
you got to decide whether or not you're
prepared to put your friendship on the

699
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:39,050
table because a,

700
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,880
why don't you want to tell him this shit
basically because you're worried that

701
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:45,990
he's not going to believe you.

702
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,580
He's gonna flip the fuck out and then
he's going to go ahead and marry this

703
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:54,150
whore anyways, and the two of
you aren't going to be friends.

704
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,790
Okay?

705
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,900
I gotta tell you this dude,

706
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,550
it's gonna make you sick to your fucking
stomach to watch this guy go through

707
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:05,060
this shit. Let's say you keep your
mouth shut. You stay friends with them.

708
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:09,120
Then you kind of sit there and you're
going to watch this girl fuck around on

709
00:43:09,121 --> 00:43:10,340
him.
You know,

710
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,940
I don't know why guys choose to do this.
Women don't.

711
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,740
If women see a dude fucking around, they
go right to that girlfriend. Oh my God,

712
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,700
am I God? He fucking, I thought
blah blah blah, blah, blah.

713
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,380
And they hug and they say, I'm sorry.
I'll be there for you. You can do better.

714
00:43:28,381 --> 00:43:30,930
And they try and fucking for some
reason guys, we can't do that.

715
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,540
I don't know what it is.
I don't know if because it's an ego thing.

716
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:36,780
He can't handle it. You girls
been fucking around, but a dude,

717
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:41,350
you got to tell this guy, you got
to tell this guy, fuck this girl.

718
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,620
Don't let another fucking whore go out
there and take some guy for all he's

719
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:47,380
worth because this bitch is going to get
knocked up and this guy's going to be

720
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:50,650
into her for 18 fucking years financially.
Okay.

721
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,670
And just like that other guy said, where
is the God damn justice? All right,

722
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,630
what you need sir, is a clear
conscience. You have to say something,

723
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,950
all right. And just tell him,
just tell them. Say, look,

724
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,530
you're going to hate me for
telling you this, but as a friend,

725
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,540
I have to tell you this.
I can't sit back

726
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,720
and hold onto this information.

727
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,410
I got to tell you and I support
whatever decision you want to make.

728
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,790
And all you gotta do is just tell him
the facts without calling his fiance a

729
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:23,230
whore. Don't say that. Just say
what you know and then that's it.

730
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,400
And tell him, dude, I really
think you need to dump this girl.

731
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,100
You can do way better and that's
it. And he gets fucking mad at

732
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,360
Ya. He gets mad at you and if he cuts
you out, he cuts you out. But this,

733
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:40,440
but you will not have,
you won't have a guilty conscious.

734
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:44,310
It won't be weighing on you. I'm
telling you, and I don't know,

735
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:45,600
some other people say,
you know,

736
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:49,080
mind your own fucking business when
it comes to this stuff. I don't,

737
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,580
you get in there and tell them shifts.

738
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,970
If one of your buddies is going to
marry a whore, you got to tell him.

739
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,493
You got to tell him.

740
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,860
I saw that happen to a guy. I know.
I saw it, saw it fucking happened.

741
00:45:00,861 --> 00:45:04,250
It was fucking disco. It was
horrible. It was horrible.

742
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:06,560
And I was younger and I
didn't fucking say anything.

743
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:09,560
And then the whole fucking thing
unraveled. About 15 years later,

744
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:13,760
it was just awful. Fucking wasted. A
decade to half of his goddamn life.

745
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,310
Um, looking back should have said
something but did not, did not.

746
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:22,610
So I'm telling you to do what I didn't do.

747
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,980
I can't judge it because I didn't do it.

748
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,700
[inaudible]

749
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,480
I brought a video camera with me this
weekend. I forgot my little tripod stand.

750
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,580
Um, oh, I forgot to tell you. So
this, this fucking audience member,

751
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,080
it's audience man. You know what,
you know, you don't want to know why,

752
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,700
how I just remembered the audience member.

753
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:15,590
If you want to get an idea
of how my brain works,

754
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:20,570
I just realized that I forgot when
I said tripod. I was, you know,

755
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,070
those little mini tripod things.

756
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:26,630
I was picturing setting up my video
camera and then I immediately imagined

757
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,300
fucking somebody in my room.

758
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,360
And then I thought about this
girl this weekend who came by,

759
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:36,230
who had the most phenomenal titties
I've seen on the road and a long time.

760
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,230
Yup.

761
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:43,220
And then that took me to being in the
bar and this what this Douche said.

762
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,930
All right,
so I'm hanging at the Bar,

763
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,580
right? I'm drinking a a what
the fuck was I drinking?

764
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:55,940
I was drinking cranberry and soda.
All right.

765
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:00,290
The girl with the phenomenal tits is
showing how she can do that fucking Hulk

766
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:05,240
Hogan thing. So everybody's watching.
It's phenomenal. And then this guy goes,

767
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:09,950
hey bill, they'll come. I,
well I deep rich second cause
I'm like, all right. Yeah.

768
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:13,280
Why don't I talk to you instead of
watching this girl fucking Mover d cup

769
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:16,430
titties as I drink cranberry juice.
Do you understand sir?

770
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:19,760
I'm not drinking anymore. You
know, I don't fuck around.

771
00:47:19,761 --> 00:47:24,050
So this is my own little innocent
thing that I can do to make it somewhat

772
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:26,450
exciting to be here in
Columbus at the mall

773
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,033
anyways.

774
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,290
Some fucking, so I walk over
to this guy. You know what?

775
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:37,870
Because I'm a nice guy
because I'm generous. No,

776
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:42,530
because I have a need to be liked.
So I walk over and I'd say,

777
00:47:42,531 --> 00:47:46,540
I started talking to this guy and he
starts asking me 9 million fucking

778
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,270
questions.
Okay

779
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:52,340
about doing stand up. Like come
on. I even said at one point like,

780
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:55,510
do what does this inside the
actor's studio? And he goes, no,

781
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,440
I just want to do some good.
And I finally just said, dude,

782
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:00,560
are you thinking about doing
stand up? And he said, yes.

783
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,620
He's sitting there with his
wife. So I say to the guy, I go,

784
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:05,630
just write five minutes of
Shit you think is funny.

785
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,430
Go on stage when they call your name. All
right, you'll figure it out from there.

786
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,120
There's no way.
There's nothing more I can do.

787
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,120
It's not like,
I dunno,

788
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,050
teaching somebody how to change the oil.

789
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,840
It's like just something you have to just
jump in the deep end and just hope you

790
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:30,860
don't drown.
It's just this,

791
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:33,030
it's the most fucked.

792
00:48:33,031 --> 00:48:36,570
It's the most fucked up thing
ever to try and learn how to do.

793
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,160
Like if you learn how to play guitar,

794
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:43,161
you can take guitar lessons and you can
get to a certain level of skill before

795
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:46,770
you actually try to take it out at a
party and play in front of other people.

796
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:49,980
But stand up you, you have
to, the first time you do it,

797
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,780
you have to do it on a stage while people
watch you. It's fucking, it's unreal.

798
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,840
So that's what I'm trying
to explain to this guy.

799
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,310
He's sitting there with his wife,

800
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:03,390
he's telling me that he's a banker and
he actually said that a lot of shit that

801
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:06,630
I say is right on is hitting
the nail right on the head.

802
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,260
So I'm sitting there talking to this
guy and all of a sudden these two other

803
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:13,800
ladies come over,
all right.

804
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,540
That was part of that
other crew of people.

805
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:18,150
The girl with the fucking Teddy's that
she was making moves. She goes, hey,

806
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:21,600
we'll leave at bill. Thanks for the
show. I said, hey, thanks for coming out.

807
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:25,230
See you next time we come here.
And then he says, hey bill,

808
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:29,910
how long you've been with your girlfriend?
Just out of the blue. I just went,

809
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:34,550
I don't know, five, six
years. And then they just,

810
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:38,010
it got all uncomfortable and
then they left and I'm thinking,

811
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:42,840
why the fuck did he asked me that,
right. And then then he says to me,

812
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,450
he goes, oh sorry about
bringing up your girlfriend.

813
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:48,840
I just wanted those girls to leave
cause I wanted to keep talking to you.

814
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,480
And his wife just looks down
at the table like Jesus Christ.

815
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:57,760
And for some reason in my head I was like,
I was like,

816
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,100
did he think I was fucking
hitting on those girls? Why?

817
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:01,270
Why the fuck would he do that?

818
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:05,080
And then I just realized it wasn't until
later I just realized what a fucking

819
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,970
manipulative dirt bag fucking
move that that guy was doing.

820
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:12,661
And then I was thinking,

821
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:17,210
thank God he's thinking about doing
stand up because the fact that he's the

822
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,590
banker and he's going to
handle other people's money.

823
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,380
I don't know if he's an investment guy.
I don't know what,

824
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,820
but that's like the kind of guy that will
make old people lead alto and not even

825
00:50:26,821 --> 00:50:29,120
give shit. You know, watch,

826
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:33,770
he'll become a comedian will probably
end up stealing jokes. Uh, God damn it.

827
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:36,920
I wish I could just teleport myself back
to that moment in time and just tell

828
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:40,160
him what an absolute fucking
piece of shit move that was.

829
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:41,980
Okay.

830
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,900
You know, barest them in
front of his fucking wife and
then left. Just a fucking,

831
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,920
oh,
it was so fucking slimy.

832
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,810
Yeah. Effective. It didn't fucking work.

833
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,080
Second Child.

834
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,240
All right, dear bill. I
am from Kansas City to,

835
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,270
and there's currently radio commercials
and which a law officer, a law,

836
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,940
a law office offers their services
exclusively for women going through a

837
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:42,900
divorce. Of course they do. There's
a ton of money involved there. Uh,

838
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:47,710
they talk about how they were view all
of the husband's finances and ensure the

839
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:51,910
woman will receive the maximum
amount the law will allow.

840
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,520
And then he writes in capital letters.

841
00:51:54,521 --> 00:51:59,521
What the fuck are there any law offices
that offer services exclusively for men?

842
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,640
I doubted if there were,

843
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:08,641
I would imagine there would be a huge
protest from feminists all across the U S

844
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,310
I know you've addressed
this hundreds of times over,

845
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,520
but why is it okay Kay to completely fuck
a man over this commercial insinuates

846
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:24,550
the man is already in the wrong.
This is absolute bullshit, dude.

847
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:28,480
You preach on skies is speaking
the Gospel here. Anyways,

848
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,640
wanted to share this with you as,

849
00:52:30,641 --> 00:52:34,810
this is just another example of man
bashing commercials that just piss me off.

850
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,270
Um, all right, let's, let's,
let's review this. Ah, yeah. Okay.

851
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,900
First of all,
he can't get mad at the lawyers because a,

852
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:48,790
they're just going with
the is and, um, and as you,

853
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,440
as you, as you say that, if,

854
00:52:50,441 --> 00:52:55,441
if it was the opposite way that there
would be feminist groups protesting.

855
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,073
All right.

856
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,520
That there in lies the fucking problem
until men actually get together and start

857
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:06,550
protesting that type of shit,

858
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:10,930
which I would absolutely love to
be a part of on any fucking level.

859
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,040
I would love to see that happen.
But what guys?

860
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:19,300
We don't do that shit once we get you
get punched in the face. Yeah. Fuck you.

861
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:22,540
You get up and you walk away. Like
you can't do that. Like, yeah,

862
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:27,620
this should be guys protesting it. I
think that would be fucking hilarious. Um,

863
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,410
that's absolutely terrifying.

864
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,600
That's one of 9 million reasons
why I never got fucking married.

865
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,940
That is just unfucking believable.
You know,

866
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,800
I'll tell you what kills me is,
uh, most women who would watch it,

867
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,670
they always say the same thing where
you liked, you'll say to them like,

868
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,280
can you believe that shit when they
always say that saint? Yeah, that's right.

869
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,710
That's right. Yeah. That's what
you get. That's what you get. Ah,

870
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,480
big stupid face. What the fuck? Have
you ever done that? That's my whole,

871
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:06,110
my whole thing with dad.
It's just a, I dunno,

872
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:09,170
you get married, you just bet a
pray to God. It fucking works out.

873
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:13,580
There's a guy that's all you have
and the amount of power, it's not,

874
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:17,720
it's not a balanced relationship because
of the way that the divorce laws are.

875
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,860
It's the second, you know,
it's like when you're single,

876
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:24,710
you have an unbelievable
amount of power as a guy,

877
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,650
even if you're in a relationship,
because

878
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,020
that she can't get to you legally.
That's it. It's fucking over.

879
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,550
You have your shit and that's it,

880
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:39,290
and you're a guy and you can earn
a fucking living and that's it.

881
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,260
You don't have to worry about shit.
And then the second you get married,

882
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,790
you lose all power because at any point
should she can just divorce you and

883
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:50,320
fucking take you for everything. You're
worth, everything you work for. It's,

884
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,400
it's just, it's fucking
over. Look at tiger woods.

885
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,710
Tiger Woods gave his wife a
quarter of a billion dollars.

886
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:02,790
She was a nanny. Fucking
nanny worth what? Nine figures

887
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:09,580
for what she, he had a prenup where
she was only going to get $5 million,

888
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,530
only $5 million.

889
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,100
Who here wouldn't kill for $5 million?

890
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,420
I quit my podcast for a fucking 200 grant.

891
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,920
You know,
you find out your husband,

892
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:31,270
some dog going around
cheating or whatever. That's,

893
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,980
that happens to women.

894
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:37,700
And the guy's a broke ass son of a
bitch and they're left with nothing.

895
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:39,530
So it's not like women always make out,

896
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,560
but here's a situation where you
find out you have husbands a dog.

897
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,110
The marriage is over. Oh, but
I get $5 million. But that's
not enough for the cont.

898
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,980
Cause she knows he has a billion and
she wants to get as much as that is.

899
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,650
She can't,
I swear to fucking God,

900
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,790
I can't do these topics because it
makes you see red because they're not

901
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:02,720
entitled to it. It's bullshit. All right?

902
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:07,721
If you marry the greatest golfer of a
fucking generation who's won 14 titles,

903
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:13,610
okay? And you haven't even won a game,
a tiddly winks on a professional level,

904
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,810
you're not entitled to that money. You're
not. You are legally, but you're not.

905
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,410
You didn't fucking earn it. You
can't. Ah, right. There you go. Bill,

906
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,730
get to the core of the hatred.

907
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,700
[inaudible].
