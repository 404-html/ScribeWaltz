1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,390
Hey, what's going on is bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:08,540
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcasting.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,540
Just checking it all you what's going on?

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,650
It's just fucking global
warming. Awesome. Or what?

5
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:23,430
Jesus Christ is summer just keeps going.
It's incredible.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,280
Um,
the Golden Age,

7
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:31,281
the golden age of global warming and
joy it before the sea levels rise up.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,583
MMM.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,140
By your waterfront property
in West Virginia. Soon.

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,640
Sorry, I don't want to go with all
gloom and doom here. Um, it is, uh,

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,700
12:46 AM Thursday.
Uh,

12
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:50,360
so I have gone 56 days.
All right.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,400
56 days. Two months. Sorry,
two months. No fucking booze.

14
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:57,410
And 56.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,000
Now what does the number of 56 mean to
you all you baseball fans out there.

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,940
October playoff baseball,
56.

17
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,040
Jolton Joe Dimaggio's
unbeatable hit record,

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,470
hit for 56 games in a row.
And it's true.

19
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:17,471
I think it's very poignant that I bring
up a great Yaggie when those fucking

20
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:21,740
cons just came back against
the, uh, Cleveland Indians.

21
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,370
And, uh, I have to tell
you, it was a red sox fan.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,080
The Yankees are common and they're
going to be good for a while.

23
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:32,150
They've got a bunch of,
you know what I love about the Yankees?

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,360
Is there a fucking team?
You know what I mean?

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,410
I fucking hate that they're going to
be good, but I got to acknowledge it.

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,770
They're fucking good. Um,
poor fucking Cleveland.

27
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,090
Jesus fucking Christ.

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,150
Jesus Christ g oh Jesus.

29
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,880
That's an oh Jesus. Right
there. Up Two games to none.

30
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:56,850
Or You just had to win one more.
You know, fucking do it. Oh,

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,530
fucking comedy of errors.
I didn't see the game four.

32
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:03,650
I guess they fucked up a bunch of
average and then they just, you know,

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,510
the fucking guy in left field,
that's the single turn into a double.

34
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:11,270
Then they overtake fucking alligator arm.

35
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:15,350
A fucking cutoff and the guy scratch
this was a fucking shit show. However,

36
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,480
the only thing I don't like
about the fucking, by the way,

37
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:21,410
Brett gardeners at bat legendary a bed,

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,800
their shortstop, dare, I don't know if I'm
going to say his name right. He's a DD.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,780
Great. Glorious. I have no
idea. Two huge fucking home run.

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,680
Smiley. My only question mark, if
I can go sports radio right now.

41
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,780
Are you buying or are you selling?
I don't know about Chapman is the closer,

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,830
you know, I know he closed the
fucking game. That was great for him.

43
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:45,830
I know he wanted for the cubs last year,
but I don't know.

44
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,470
I don't think you got a fucking strong
closer when he walks the first guy and

45
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,900
you already have somebody
else up in the bullpen.

46
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,950
Maybe I'm spoiled after all those
years when I watched Marianna Rivera,

47
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,090
nobody fucking got

48
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,010
okay.

49
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,660
It's fucking Marianna were very, that
gave it, the game's tied. The game's over.

50
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,920
Except in 2004 of clothes. Of
course I'll bill. You can't,

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,160
that was impressive. So now they're
going to play the Houston Astros.

52
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,670
A franchise without an identity.

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,370
I Dunno what it is about them.
I was just talking to a j law head,

54
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,780
you know, giving them my condolences. I
congratulated Versie my teams out of it.

55
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,650
I'm not a cunt. Right? Well I
am, but not that big of a cut.

56
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,570
Um,
I was just at what the fuck?

57
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,180
Why are the Astros' so not exciting?

58
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,280
Okay.

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,540
Is it the uniforms?

60
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:43,990
Okay.

61
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,160
Maybe I'm just an old guy.

62
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,680
When they were in the fucking
national league and they had,

63
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,960
I don't know what you would
call those fucking uniforms,

64
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:54,210
those things with his shit.
They sorta had the, uh,

65
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,640
the gay bar flag,
you know,

66
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,190
gay friendly fucking flag.

67
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:04,000
They were flying those
colors really progressive way
back in the late seventies.

68
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,060
They played on the National League.
So it was all hitting run.

69
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:12,040
They had the astro turf day,
a Jr Richards.

70
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,940
They had hope say cruise Enos Cabell
you remember that fucking team way back

71
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,000
when? I don't think that they've
been fucking exciting ever since.

72
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:27,001
At some point they decided to
have those fucking bland uniforms.

73
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,740
It's like dark color.

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,640
You don't what it looks
like they did uniform.

75
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,900
It's a uniform or equivalent
to when you go on a diet,

76
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,890
you know, you have your first
little fucking chest pains and they,

77
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,840
the doctor goes, look, I'm
gonna tell you right now,

78
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,520
he needed to take off 30 pounds.

79
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,120
You need to cut all this salt and sugar
out of your diet, right? And you're like,

80
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,960
yeah, fuck it. You just sitting there
eating lettuce, staring across somebody.

81
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,710
If somebody went to dinner with the
reading the chicken palm dare order and

82
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:01,310
bread and you're just sitting there with
your fucking salad and the protein no

83
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,010
bigger than the size of
the palm of your hand.

84
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,290
They have the uniform version
of that low level of excitement.

85
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,490
Okay.

86
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,860
Um, I have no, I don't know shit
about the Astros' other than that,

87
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:17,730
they had an unbelievable year. So,
uh, I fucking love October baseball.

88
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,590
Um, my fucking Red Sox
Los, we deserve to lose.

89
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,770
What are you going to do? A, we'll
see what we do in the off season.

90
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,480
Congratulations to the Astros.
Definitely were the better team and a,

91
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:34,230
I missed all the Dodgers series and
I saw the highlights tonight of, uh,

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,940
of the cubs and nationals. Jesus Christ.
That fucking grand slam is brutal.

93
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,010
You know what's weird is the cubs lost
for so long. I still felt bad for him.

94
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,760
I forgot that they won the world
series last year, but I was just,

95
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm so used to feeling bad for cubs fans.

96
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:54,360
I actually felt bad when that guy
hit the home run. And by the way,

97
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:57,290
can anybody explain?
And uh,

98
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,340
this it's always bugged me about Wrigley
field is that fucking fence that just

99
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,960
juts out that little basket,
you know,

100
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,470
that gives the warning track
power guy a fucking home run.

101
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,860
What are they going to take that thing
down? I don't understand that thing.

102
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,480
It hangs out into the field of play.
It's not a fucking hall.

103
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,440
It is a home run.
The little fence there.

104
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,180
What are we playing? Fucking tee
ball, take the God damn basket.

105
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,210
Whatever the fuck that is.
Um,

106
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,100
reminds me of way back in the day when
against the Yankees first the Orioles,

107
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:41,360
when that kid reached over and grabbed
the home run instantly became a fucking

108
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,440
hero with all Yankee fans who then I'll
then turn around and fucking call the

109
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:48,830
fucking red sox. I mean, the
Patriots cheaters, it's Hilarious,

110
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,400
but everybody does it. You
know what I mean? I mean,

111
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,470
look at this big story
out here in Hollywood.

112
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:58,850
The big scandal ha ve Weinstein,
right?

113
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,740
First of all, dude, I mean,

114
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:05,741
what a display of power to finish in a
potted plant and then have the nerve to

115
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,610
call the person the next day saying, hey,
you know, I had a great time. I mean,

116
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:14,720
that's out of your fucking mind and
I don't get these fucking people, uh,

117
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,060
where everything,
but I'm going to go to rehab.

118
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,400
How do you go to Rehab to stop you
for preventing a woman leaving a room,

119
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:28,230
taking your dick out and comment
on a firm? Do they have rehab?

120
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,610
I didn't know that. What are you
in there for? Oh, you know, I uh,

121
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,510
I fucking blocked an
exit and just on a plant.

122
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,060
Oh yeah, yeah, me too. Me Too. Well, I
guess we're going to be buddies here, Huh?

123
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,040
You know, and they just in this wing of
the rehab with this no potted plants,

124
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,380
they got buddies outside
the fucking window.

125
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:56,250
Tried to sneak fucking plants in forum.
That is the most bizarre fucking story.

126
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,960
But, um, that's not what I want to
talk about here. You know what I mean?

127
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:05,640
Where they fucking sitting there going
all I love when they send all all of men

128
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,230
in Hollywood kept silent.

129
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:12,150
It's like everybody did and they weren't
acting like Harvey Weinstein couldn't

130
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,040
ruin the career of a guy.

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,350
That guy up until four days ago could
take your career wadded up right in front

132
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:23,340
of you and throw it in the gutter and
you were done. You were fucking done.

133
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,980
You're talking about a guy,

134
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,920
whoever allegedly could block
a woman from leaving a room

135
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,410
and then coming on a planet and then
fucking does the follow up call.

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,280
Like they went to dinner and a
movie and they had a lovely time.

137
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,320
That's the level of power this guy had.

138
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,420
Human beings should not have
that level of power by the way.

139
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:50,890
Cause man or a woman, they, they, they
do not handle it well. Um, but anyways,

140
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:55,030
let's get back too far. It's like, you
know, being able to see both sides,

141
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,500
the fence house sports fans that just
like, you know, that's obviously holding.

142
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:00,960
And then if the holding called doesn't
it go against you? It's like, oh no,

143
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,610
no fucking great call,

144
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,080
great non call Fox News Day.

145
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,660
We're going off on fucking
Harvey Weinstein and all
Hollywood now underhanded

146
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,150
and Blahblahblahblahblah.
But when Trump was grabbing the pussies,

147
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,190
they got nothing, right?
And then fucking CNN,

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
it's the same fucking way Trump
grabs the fucking pussies.

149
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,380
They're all fucking over.
Harvey Weinstein does what he does.

150
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,930
This isn't a time to
fucking politicizes thing.

151
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,500
They're both so fucking full of shit.

152
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:35,040
And they're going to judge all
Hollywood on Harvey Weinstein. Right?

153
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,880
The same way the Liberals Judge
all Republicans on Donald Trump.

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,980
I don't know anybody. Uh, watch is
either one of those channels. However,

155
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:47,340
I will say this cause I don't
watch Fox News that often.

156
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,850
I don't really watch CNN, but I
will say at least CNN, it looks,

157
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,600
it looks professional. I'm not saying it
is all it is, but I'm not saying it's,

158
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,880
it's obviously not ridiculously
biased that they both are. But for,

159
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,890
what is Fox News looks like?

160
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,570
It looks like fucking Wsp k TV 38 back
in the day when they go in between

161
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:12,420
periods and their little bullshit sent.
I don't know. What about Fox News?

162
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:16,110
It's like they, they got to put more
money into it. Everybody looks sweaty,

163
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,180
you know, I don't understand
it. Um, but anyways,

164
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:24,150
Jesus fucking Christ.
Uh,

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,420
so now they're going back
into everybody's life.

166
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,080
They go back into somebody's eye. He
did this back in 2000. Here's my thing.

167
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,990
All these guys and now going to have
to apologize for all the shit they did

168
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:38,490
evidently back into the fucking 90.
So whatever my question is, is, uh,

169
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:41,630
when is the,
when is it going to even out a,

170
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,260
I would love to see some gold digging
whores come on and apologize and be like,

171
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,160
yeah, hey, sorry,

172
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:52,050
I took your house and add a couple of
kids with the Ed said that I loved you

173
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,810
when I really didn't. Uh,
I shouldn't have done that.

174
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:57,600
And then prevented you from seeing
those kids that you had with me.

175
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:02,440
That half looked like me and you now know
that I never really loved you. And uh,

176
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:07,441
I'm sorry for that and banging the
new guy in this house that you bought.

177
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,310
And now I'm also not
going to, uh, you know,

178
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,450
have my new boyfriend ever move in or
married me because then my payments from

179
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:18,300
you and the alimony will stop.
I want to apologize for that.

180
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,910
My behavior was completely unacceptable

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,890
just to balance it out. Listen,
if you knew that this podcast,

182
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,390
um, one of the mainstays of this
podcast is, and I'm a, I'm a,

183
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,090
I'm a contrarion cunt.
All right?

184
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,050
So if you're, if you're new
to it, you know, I don't know.

185
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,690
This first 11 minutes is what you
can expect for the rest of this. Um,

186
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,390
anyways, I am in Atlanta,
Georgia right now. Uh,

187
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,350
I got a, I got a small part
in a big movie. I mean,
that's my career. That's my,

188
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,770
that's my fucking wheelhouse.
I love it. You know,

189
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,660
all I want to do is paratroop in for a
couple of fucking days, have a good time,

190
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,520
you know, get to watch the real
fucking actors. Do the Goddamn thing.

191
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,780
I always feel like I won a contest when
I do a movie. You know what I mean? Like,

192
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:18,310
Hey, you want to be in a
movie? Oh boy. Oh boy do I. Um,

193
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,690
so I'm gonna be here for the next, uh,
the next couple of weeks, you know,

194
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,110
miss and my family like fucking
crazy. Uh, I'm hoping, uh,

195
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,980
trying to work something out where I
can bring them in so I don't lose my

196
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:33,130
fucking mind out here.
I'm not going to lie to you.

197
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:37,030
I was actually so fucking
lonely and depressed last night.

198
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,610
Um,
I mean,

199
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:43,240
obviously it's exciting to do a movie
just missing my family that I walked by a

200
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:47,440
liquor store and I saw this bottle of
booze in there in the window and I was

201
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:51,130
like, uh, am I going to buy
that and finish all of it?

202
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,650
And fortunately I walked past it and I
went down to the laughing skull comedy

203
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,760
club, uh, went up on stage, thank
you to them for putting me on stage.

204
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,070
And I went up there and I want to say
I kind hate my boss. It was a very,

205
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:10,270
a give and take, a lot
more. Whatever's worse,

206
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,200
but a lot more worse. A lot more give or
a lot more to, I don't know what it was,

207
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:18,640
but it, it was a rough one. Okay. Um,

208
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,240
but anyway,
so now I'm Outta here.

209
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:22,620
I gotta figure out what
the Fuck I'm going to do.

210
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,850
I went to trader Joe's about some
healthy fucking food. You know,

211
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,460
all this shit's healthy,
but they still have a frozen food aisles,

212
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:33,030
so I don't get that. You know what I
mean? They still have fucking cereal,

213
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,870
you know what I mean? That's that part
of a balanced breakfast. Is it cereal?

214
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,540
Can you even what, what the fuck is
cereal? I just thought about that.

215
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,010
Like what is in a cheerio
about these brand fucking things?

216
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:51,430
I don't know what they are
like,

217
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,590
can you make cereal? I bet
to some. Somebody on Youtube,

218
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,820
homemade cereal. I'm gonna look
that up. I, I've been, it'd be,

219
00:13:58,821 --> 00:13:59,720
I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

220
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:02,030
I'm the first person we ever
fucking Google this home.

221
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,260
Fucking feds are going to knock on the
God damn door right now. Homemade cereal.

222
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,080
Does anybody likes cereal
enough to fucking do directions?

223
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,640
Okay. Preheat your oven to 275
degrees. I don't know about you,

224
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:20,750
but I'm already out. I get either
open a box and pour it and it's done.

225
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:25,640
Or I can go preheat my oven until 275
degrees from my friends around the world.

226
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:29,330
That's 135 degrees Celsius.
Um,

227
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,030
in a large bowl mix. Oats,
wheat germ, wheat germ.

228
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,600
What I'll is that in and we brand,
oh my God.

229
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,950
If you can actually take
the time to make cereal,

230
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,070
this is what you're going in a
medium bowl blend. Brown sugar,

231
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,420
vegetable oil,
honey and water mix and vanilla extract.

232
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:53,270
Is he making here? Cinnamon. Nutmeg.

233
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,790
It sounds like you're
making a pie and salt.

234
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,330
Beg for 45 minutes in a preheated oven
stirring every 15 minutes until lightly

235
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:07,460
brown. Hey Eddie, you're 20 minutes
fucking later than you usually.

236
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:11,030
Are you usually only an hour late for
work? Where the fuck you been? Oh,

237
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,310
you know what I'm saying?
All about with making breakfast.

238
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:17,510
What the fuck did you make?
Homemade cereal. Hey, Yeti.

239
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,380
Do me a favor. Why don't you fucking go
punch out and get the fuck out of here?

240
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,520
You're fired. How do you make corn
flakes flakes? Saudi make cocoa puffs.

241
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,680
They actually had this shit.

242
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:32,681
How to make cinnamon toast crunch caught
a couple whole wheat pastry flour.

243
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,550
Who has the fucking time to do this?

244
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,970
Quarter Cup of all purpose flour.
Baking Soda, cinnamon. All right.

245
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:46,380
Wait a fucking minute.
We're going to go this far right.

246
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,680
How do you spell Fritos?
Homemade fritos.

247
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,850
All right.
Hey De oven to 375 degrees.

248
00:15:56,851 --> 00:16:01,851
Cut to pieces of parchment one the same
size is a beacon baking sheet and set

249
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,810
aside in a small bowl.

250
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,900
Whisk together the corn meal and the
salt place one sheet of parchment.

251
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,010
Am I going to do this?

252
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:14,320
Can you imagine if you fucking made
a homemade fritos and people like,

253
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:17,740
what the fuck? Where the fuck did you get
these freedom? I made it myself though.

254
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:22,090
Homemade.
Are you on house arrest?

255
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:26,180
Who the fuck has time to do
this shit fucking asshole.

256
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,730
You make it homemade, you know, how
did you make your own trans fat?

257
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:35,410
She a fucking psycho. Um, quarter thought.

258
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,870
Who the fuck would have thought that
you could do something like this?

259
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,720
It says a fucking great country.
Um, I've heard people make it.

260
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,060
Do you hear that fucking growl side?
What is that?

261
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,940
I shut off the fucking air con.
I fucking hate air conditioning.

262
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,460
It's so overused.

263
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,750
Air conditioning is like that person at
a party who just won't shut the fuck up,

264
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,453
you know?

265
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,790
Oh, you know what they said
that about, I was watching,

266
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:07,320
you know the B e t a wrap awards there,
hip hop awards

267
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,990
and um,

268
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,670
I'm watching all this shit.
And they had the guy from two live crew,

269
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:16,490
they were giving him like a lifetime
achievement award and it was fucking

270
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:20,750
hilarious. He was up there dressed
like he just got a doctorate

271
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,520
and then afterwards he does all his
music and it's all over me. So horny,

272
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:31,430
all that shit. I'm not saying I don't
like that fucking music, but I mean,

273
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:36,200
Jesus Christ, he had like a bow tie
on and his whole suit and everything,

274
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,310
it looked like a s a
fucking elder statesman. Um,

275
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,880
but anyways, uh, I dunno, I was

276
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,540
okay

277
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,570
talking to my wife about it.
I don't know shit about hip hop,

278
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:53,460
but this fucking thing where everybody
is drinking that shit, that lean,

279
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:56,040
whatever the hell it is,
and everybody sounds,

280
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,760
even if they're not fucking wasted,
they sound like they're waste

281
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,720
drives me up the wall. I just
listened to it. It's like, you know,

282
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:06,690
when you go to a party and there's
somebody way more fucked up than you were

283
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,640
just like, dude, I can't talk to you. I
got, how did I got to get out of this? Um,

284
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,530
that's what it sounded like. That one
dude lost all that fucking wait man. Okay.

285
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,990
I usually takes the shirt off when
he was fat, he took his shirt off.

286
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,850
Now he's skinny or,
and he has his clothes on,

287
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,660
which probably means he's still getting
the skin removed or whatever. You know,

288
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:30,980
it's funny. All the weight that he lost.
He still weighs more than all of them.

289
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:35,760
Migos
put together even with their jewelry on,

290
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,190
I'm sorry. I've just been, I, I'm I
my first day on the movies tomorrow,

291
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:45,870
so I've just been sitting here and
fucking watching TV and a waiting to work.

292
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,920
So I've just been watching

293
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,623
MMM.

294
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,220
Just been watching all
of this shit and uh,

295
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,770
listening to music and stuff.
Dude, I know, I'm like fucking, uh,

296
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,850
over 10 years late on this thing,
but I am an old guy is,

297
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:07,530
um, I've just been listening to the
first to Mars Volta albums and a,

298
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:11,220
I got to tell you, John Theodore is a
fucking genius drummer. That, what is it?

299
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,730
How do you say the Sarah Eyes? I don't
want to say any anything. V I s c.

300
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:16,380
E r a any drummers out there,

301
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,350
you gotta listen to that fucking song
and you've got to learn how to play it.

302
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,090
He can't be a drummer.

303
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,180
It listen to that and not want to
at least that open and drum groove.

304
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,580
I don't know what the fuck he's
doing on the breakdown in the end,

305
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:31,581
but it's one of the sickest fucking
drum grooves I've ever heard in my life.

306
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,980
And you listen to what the guitar is,
is doing.

307
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:39,981
Most people would have just played with
the guitar and the way he fucking plays

308
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:43,344
around it.

309
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,680
And one of my favorite things is does
not have the snare on two and four. It's,

310
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,340
and it's still just fucking
not only fucking rocks,

311
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:55,560
it propels this fucking song.

312
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,890
I think I've listened
to the song 200 times.

313
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,660
Okay.

314
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,440
And the last fucking week and it's still
giving me chills. It's fucking unreal.

315
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,910
And uh, my drum teacher a long time ago
told me to get into this band, Michigan.

316
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,320
And I listened to it and I, I just,
it was too advanced. I couldn't,

317
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,140
I couldn't hear what was, it was
just too much shit to be listened to.

318
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:20,010
But because I've been listening to
Mars Volta and they're crazy shit.

319
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,090
I actually went back cause I was scrolling
through looking for Mars Volta and I

320
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:27,930
and I had this much sugar album for
the longest time and I went back and

321
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:30,930
listened to it and I,
I think I'm finally starting to like,

322
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,710
I always knew it was amazing, but now
I actually am like fucking into it. Um,

323
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,870
I just keep listening to that first song.
I'm baby step in my way into it.

324
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:44,340
This music is way advanced for my fucking
limited fucking musical abilities.

325
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,060
But that first song
Stanger, s, e, n, g, h,

326
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:53,710
just the drumming on that, the whole
fucking thing is unbelievable. So, uh,

327
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,040
I've just been, that's what I've
been doing. I haven't been boozing.

328
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,120
I've been watching old twilight zones.
I've been listening to,

329
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,110
there's all this fucking music and uh,
I dunno,

330
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:08,470
I went out tonight till was cigar bar.
That's my one vice that I have left.

331
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,290
That's all I got left.
Um,

332
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,600
and it went out and ordered my fucking
club soda and a lime. I got to tell you,

333
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:20,950
the minute I actually felt, you know,
walk out, I'm not shit faced. It's Nice,

334
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,430
you know? Yeah. Bill, that'd
be boozed every fucking day.

335
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:27,770
People find that nice after a while.
I will. All right then. All right.

336
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,580
I haven't been able to watch
any of the hawk. He fucking,

337
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,370
I know the Bruins are one and two.
We got crushed by the avs tonight.

338
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,204
Six to three.

339
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,660
And I'm actually debating on Saturday
because I'm going out of my mind,

340
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,130
uh,
miss and my family,

341
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:45,580
I'm actually debating the Tennessee
volunteers have a home game.

342
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm actually debating, it's a three hour
drive. I know they're not good this year,

343
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,890
but that's such a legendary stadium.
They are home.

344
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,710
I live on the other side of the country.
It's three hours.

345
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,410
I can drive up their scalp,
a fucking ticket,

346
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,120
watch him play the South Carolina
Gamecocks Nice sec matchup.

347
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,780
I get to fucking go to that state.
I think I'm going to do it.

348
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,340
What else am I gonna do?
Sit here alone in this fucking hotel room,

349
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,890
missing my Kiddo, you know? Um,
anyways, so let's get into the, uh,

350
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,830
I think I'm going to do it.
Fuck it. That'll be my 20th,

351
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,320
my 20th college football
team that I've seen.

352
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,580
I've seen some big ones though.

353
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,320
That'll be Mike by Fifth or sixth
SEC team that I've seen a home game.

354
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,070
I've seen Texas a and M, Lsu,
Alabama, Georgia, Florida,

355
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,270
and then Tennessee. I mean, as far as the,

356
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,100
the big ones I'd have left, I'd have
Auburn, Ole Miss, Mississippi state,

357
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,880
and fucking Arkansas,
you know,

358
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,060
no disrespect to, uh, uh,

359
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,990
Vanderbilt was who's left? Vanderbilt,
Kentucky and Missouri, Missouri. Like,

360
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,670
you know, I feel like the SCC is like,
they're rebound conference, you know,

361
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,800
they still want to be in the big 12,

362
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,160
but the fucking university of Texas came
up with their own, I dunno, their own.

363
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,030
Yes. Network their own and
whatever the fuck they did.

364
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:16,810
I don't understand why everybody else
just didn't do the same thing. Um,

365
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,410
but anyways, I think I'm going
to do it anyway. It's enough.

366
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,350
Enough with the fucking pablet here.
Oh, a little bit of advertising here.

367
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
All right. Uh, but don't do it

crabs down in your fucking under and you

374
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,260

382
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:19,040
That Yankee Fan at the end of
the fucking Cleveland series,

383
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,990
when they cut to those two Yankee fans,
the guy on the left, when he was clapping,

384
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:27,930
somebody's going to turn that
into something. I mean, dude,

that you can't even clap

chimp on a clap of fucking chimpanzee,

387
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,290
clap better than this guy in
the fucking look on his face.

388
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,440
I don't know what was going on with
that guy. I hope he doesn't help.

389
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,800
He's not touched on some level then. I
feel bad. He did have front row seats.

throwing over at fucking Uber during

424
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:59,421
this lift begin believes that being a
ride sharing drivers should be fun if

425
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,140
you're having a good time.
So are the passengers well
don't have to good at time.

426
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:07,620
You fucking up my life in your
hands there. If it choosing raw,

427
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,970
I ride sharing company to drive for go
with a company that treats you better.

428
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,790
Lift lift was the first
offer in APP tipping.

429
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,960
When you drive for Lyft you keep 100% of
the tips are my stomach's growling here

430
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,150
being an actor can't eat late at night.

431
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,800
A 100% of the tips drivers will
be paid over 200 million in tips.

432
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:29,130
Since drivers have been paid over 200
million in tips since the feature was

433
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:29,970
first introduced,

434
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,620
express pay lets drivers get paid almost
instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

435
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:37,050
Lyft has taken the
guesswork out of pickups.

436
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,030
The new amp device uses color coding
to help passengers find the drivers.

437
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:46,210
You can earn hundreds of dollars
a week plus tips. What are it?

438
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:49,830
Won't dry boards? Never been easier
to give yourself a raise. Sorry,

439
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,910
I'm doing this one 13 in the morning here.
Now it's a simple formula.

440
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,980
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

441
00:27:55,981 --> 00:28:00,060
Maybe that's why nine out of every 10 Lyft
riders get a perfect five star rating.

442
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:04,290
So join the ride sharing company that
believes in treating its people better.

443
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,650
Go to lift.com/bird today and you
can get a $500 new driving bonus.

444
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:14,760
That's lyft.com/burr lyft.com/
[inaudible] spelled l,

445
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,230
y. F. T. It's a limited
time only terms do apply.

446
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,890
All right. What am I up
to here? 28 and change.

447
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:26,190
I got to kill another minute and a half.
Um,

448
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,190
actually if I do the drive
up to Knoxville,

449
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:34,830
Tennessee,
um,

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,210
I will pass through one of my favorite
and most one of the most underrated

451
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:42,660
cities in the United States,
Chattanooga, Tennessee.

452
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,280
I've only been there one time and I had
such a fucking great time. Great Food,

453
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,550
great bars,
just great people.

454
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:54,480
Just a great fucking great city.
Love that place.

455
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,650
And um, and Knoxville's another
place that had a great fucking time.

456
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:01,350
Everybody goes to Tennessee,
they all go to Nashville.

457
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,210
They want to go to the grand old
fucking Opry. They want to fucking,

458
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,540
I don't know what the fuck you'll go
see some live music and all that shit.

459
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,050
I'm telling you right now,
sorry.

460
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:18,240
Do not sleep on Chattanooga,
Tennessee. Do not avoid Knoxville diff.

461
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:21,720
Fucking great. I swear to God, if
I wasn't in this God damn business,

462
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:24,750
I could live in either one of those towns.
Um,

463
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,170
I'm a big fan of that state.
Um,

464
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,670
not that I'm shitting on fucking Georgia
here cause it's another good time. Uh,

465
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,940
speaking in which I guess
the College Hall of fame,

466
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,670
some sort of hall of fames out here.
I might go check that out down the street.

467
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,460
Um, but that is it, that that is a
podcast here. Oh Billy freckles here is,

468
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:48,300
I got to get my hate. I was asleep.
Um, and go do my fucking little

469
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,050
what I like to call acting
tomorrow. Uh, that is it. It,

470
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,210
was there anything else I wanted to talk
about my promoting anything coming up.

471
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,073
Oh yeah.

472
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,080
We added a third show and I'm in Austin
and Austin city limits now is all

473
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:08,850
excited that this is the same place
where I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan play.

474
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:10,860
But evidently that's a new one.
However,

475
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,390
it is the same place where I saw Iggy
pop with queen of the Queens of the stone

476
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:16,680
age performed.

477
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:21,450
So it is legendary and we'd be down
there with Dean del Rey and I'm trying to

478
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:23,670
find out if I can record.
Um,

479
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,260
cause my Madison Square Garden
recording did not work. Um,

480
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,190
I fucked up.

481
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,990
They just gave me the recording from the
board so I am loud as shit and you can

482
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:37,830
barely hear the crowd.
So oops.

483
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,830
I don't know if I'll ever get to do
Madison Square Garden against, so,

484
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,470
oh well I guess it's just a memory.
Um,

485
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,150
but I'm starting to think when I played
like these really cool venues like this,

486
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:51,310
that I'm just going to record audio.
I don't know what I'm going to do with it.

487
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,330
I might just start, you
know, putting out a random,

488
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,090
like fucking just on vinyl Assam Shit.

489
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,840
MMM.

490
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,223
You know,

491
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,430
I got to know the guys over there at third
man records that's also in Nashville.

492
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,070
Uh, Jack White's company. Those
guys treated me great. I did my, uh,

493
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,020
Carnegie Hall one with those guys,
so maybe who knows,

494
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,970
maybe I could do something with them.

495
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,633
MMM.

496
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,400
I Dunno.

497
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,970
I kinda like the idea that cause my act
changed so much and I have like a lot of

498
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:25,210
like topical shit. And I was
thinking like, what if I just,

499
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,380
yeah,

500
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:26,650
I don't know.

501
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,490
Just start recording all these sets and
then maybe I splice it together a bunch

502
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,770
of different ones. I Dunno,
we'll see what happens. But, uh,

503
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:34,600
it's never bad to have a good recording.
Right.

504
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,830
Am I just spit balling out loud you guys
as if this is fucking entertainment.

505
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,280
I have no idea. Um, all
right, that's it. Uh,

506
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,990
congratulations to Jaromir Jaeger.

507
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:48,991
You've got fucking signed with the Calgary
flames demands career continues and

508
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:53,580

them out there and shit.

509
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,500
I know I made all you guys yawn.
I apologize,

510
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:59,890
but I don't have time to do
this tomorrow. Uh, that's it.

511
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:03,490
You guys have a great day,
a wonderful weekend. And um,

512
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,460
I will talk to you on a Monday and a,
those of you new to this podcast,

513
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,250

from a Thursday gone by. Uh,

514
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,070

you have any questions about who did the

515
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:18,551
music,

516
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:23,551
just a tweet at the mm podcast

517
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,350
Andrew is really good about,

who it is cause he plays all the cool

519
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:35,320
music. Uh, you know, um, but um, I'm
way behind as you can tell. All right,

520
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm just starting to get into Mars Volta.
Okay.

521
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,270
I'm getting into a band that people
are hoping is going to have a reunion.

522
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,140
I'm just getting it to them. Okay. All
right. Okay. That is it. Uh, all right.

523
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,320
Have a great weekend.
I'll talk to you later,

524
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,303
citizen.

525
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,243
So,

526
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,250
all right. Hair loss or sex loss bill,
I'm sure you've heard of Propecia.

527
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,870
Heard of it.
I used it.

528
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,010
I used it and when I ran out of it,

529
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,180
I just had that honest moment
with myself and I was just like,

530
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,990
there's no way. There's not going to be
a side effect. Okay. There's always just,

531
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,660
there's no way. There's just no way.
There's no way this thing, okay,

532
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:03,260
I'll save my hair but damage my liver.
You know,

533
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,790
what do I need more? You know, a full head
of hair or a functioning fucking liver.

534
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:12,860
You just, you know, you just got to bite
the bullet and turn it. Just turn old.

535
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,490
Just age gracefully. You know,
I try to keep my hair short.

536
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,390
I tried to offend as little people as
I go through the slow process of seeing

537
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:25,050
what my skull actually looks like.
He goes,

538
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:28,560
I have a lot of friends on it
that say it's sort of works.

539
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,460
Definitely slows down hair loss
by doing something. However,

540
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:37,200
apparently the drawbacks is no boner.
Oh,

541
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:40,290
is that? I don't know. I don't know
either way on that one. That's a,

542
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:45,060
that's some bar stuff. I think that that
can, that can happen to some people.

543
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,510
I have no fucking idea.
He said,

544
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:52,080
so do you choose hair to
get sex or choose no hair,

545
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,120
which might mean no sex.

546
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:59,350
Is this some sort of sick joke by the
pharmaceutical companies know you're,

547
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,970
you're fighting nature. Listen
Dude, I'll tell you right now.

548
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,760
All right, there's women out there
that think a shaved head is sexy.

549
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,270
Not all of them, but
there's enough. All right,

550
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,530
there's enough out there that you can
keep going out. Bang. And women, you know,

551
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,360
some women find a shaved head fucking
they lay like it turns him on.

552
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,100
So listen,

553
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,460
this is the great thing about women is
they could see beyond what you look like.

554
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:35,590
Okay? If you come in there and you got a
little swagger and you're funny and you

555
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:40,050
fucking, you know, shaved shows
confidence, dude, you're like, fuck it,

556
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,460
preemptive strike. You guys are
walking out on me. Well you know what,

557
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:47,790
I'm kicking you out the door
and you take out your clippers.

558
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,520
You know, I bust my head down a
few years ago. I fucking loved it.

559
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,280
And I took all the jokes.
When your kid's a patient,

560
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:58,610
if fucking make a wish but bubba button
to Peters out after a couple of weeks,

561
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,923
you know?

562
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,800
Yeah,

563
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,500
I dunno. I go back and forth.
I go back and forth. I mean,

564
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,960
I go literally from doing,

565
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,650
maybe I'll do the fucking hair transplant
to all the way back to all fucking

566
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:14,710
shape my head again. I have no idea, but
I gotta be honest with you, dude. It it,

567
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,710
it doesn't, the vibe you're bringing
is going to be way more. Listen,

568
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,740
do you really want to get with some
girl who's with you because you have a

569
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:26,580
fucking, a nice big cow lick
on top of your fucking head.

570
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,640
And if you didn't have it then she
wouldn't be with you. You know,

571
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,630
going bald is like driving
a piece of shit car.

572
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,210
It really keeps the horse away from you.

573
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,130
All these fucking idiots with full heads
of hair driving around flashy cars.

574
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:47,460
You see what happens to them?
What happened to Mel Gibson?

575
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,800
He should have just gone bald,
but he didn't.

576
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:53,130
He kept fighting it through and shit
up there. Drove around in a flashy car.

577
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,540
I had to give up my fucking leg or
tickets, you know, flipping out,

578
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,040
flipping up. You know what dude?
Yeah. Don't take those fucking drugs.

579
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:06,270
Those drugs are brand new and the side
effects that they're talking about,

580
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:10,110
I'm telling you is just to shit that
they're letting on to cover their ass is

581
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,720
that they said that there
was some side effects. Okay.

582
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,670
From what I've overheard bars,
the people on the FDA,

583
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,680
half of them used to work for these
pharmaceutical fucking company,

584
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:23,400
so they got the nuts running
the fucking nuthouse. All right,

585
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,170
and you're just going to be a good,

586
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,410
you're going to be a little lab rat if
you start taking that shit. All right?

587
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,030
So I would suggest not doing it.

588
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,360
Let nature take its fucking
course and do what I'm doing.

589
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,380
Wait for the cure and our
guarantee it at ain't gonna come.

590
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,090
So just fucking man up and go bald.
You fucking pussy gate door.

591
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:44,460
What I'm doing just slowly let it happen.

592
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,300
A year from now,

593
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,940
I'm going to have fucking hair plugs
and I'm going to be performing for

594
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:53,580
dictators for New Year's Eve.
Give niggers

595
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,490
be best friends with Beyonce.
I didn't see my itinerary either.

596
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:00,780
I didn't know who it was.

597
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,600
I literally use the same excuse
for performing for oil men.

598
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,313
Stop

599
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,770
sweating.

600
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:07,590
Uh, the past couple of weeks I've been
talking about the food down here in New

601
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,230
Orleans, saint help, delicious
slash unhealthy it is.

602
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:14,430
And how you can't find fucking
Kale. Excuse me. As a drink.

603
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:16,740
More cold water for my fucking scalded.
Tunc

604
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,263
mmm.

605
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,900
I actually bought a juicer this week to
somehow combat all the fried food that

606
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,750
I've been eating. And a, I started
drinking that shit that, that guy and uh,

607
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,600
uh, fat dead and kind of sick,
whatever the fuck is called.

608
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:34,860
Fat Sick and nearly dead.

609
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,090
Yeah.

610
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:41,840
Just sick, fatty with dead
fucking something, whatever. Um,

611
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,460
I've been drinking that
Shit, man. I got taste.

612
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,290
Something that's delicious
that only is delicious.

613
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,000
You crave it after awhile and uh,
yeah,

614
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,380
I think I dropped like four or
five pounds. Good pounds too.

615
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,890
You know the flabby once I was joking
on Twitter saying how I was in,

616
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,610
I wasn't buttoned down shirt shape
and I actually want to get into like,

617
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,060
I want to be in shitting down,
no shirt on shape.

618
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,540
I don't know what, I don't, Bill
Cosby did a bit on this, but he's,

619
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,230
so what the fuck happens
when you sit down?

620
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,730
You stand up and look sideways in the Mary
Lake Guy. You know what? That is a bad,

621
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,090
dare I say, it's kind of cue shows
that I like the occasional snack.

622
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,410
Right? And you sit there pitching it
yourself like you're in an old school,

623
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:38,250
special k commercial going on. Right?
That's not that bad. It's not that bad.

624
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:43,430
Then you just sit down and like three
handfuls of Shit just lands on your

625
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:44,424
thighs.

626
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,493
You know,

627
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,940
for the life of me, I can't.
What is, what happens?

628
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:55,710
The hip bones move up to your fucking
man tits and everything just gets blown

629
00:40:55,711 --> 00:41:00,330
out. I have no idea. But sitting down
without a shirt on, you know, that's,

630
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:03,840
that's the truth moment of your fucking
physique that you're going to see all

631
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:04,674
day.

632
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,570
Okay?

633
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:09,710
Stop standing up. Suck in any
gut. All right? You want to see,

634
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,740
you want to see the damage you've done.
Maybe not ready for it.

635
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,553
All right?

636
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,180
This is like the ring. When you
looked at that fucking chick's face,

637
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:22,710
you judges opens up and you land
in a fucking walk in closet.

638
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,860
Oh my God. I don't know what happened
to me. I'm not even that bad of shape.

639
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,100
So I said, fuck this.
I got a juicer. And um,

640
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,500
I just did a quick gig up in Chicago,
came right back, this private thing. Um,

641
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,040
so I don't know. I ate halfway decent
up there. I did find a Vegan restaurant,

642
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,360
but then of course they had
had some Chicago Pizza. Um,

643
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,540
so now I came back and I had my little
fucking grilled cheese sandwich and

644
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:52,374
tomato soup.

645
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,340
So now my body is starting
to pull me back to the,

646
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,160
the bay,
the dark side.

647
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,990
And that's what I've really learned
about trying to stay in shape.

648
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,580
It's all about keeping your
brain out in front of your body,

649
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,840
keeping you fucking wits about you.
Like this shit.

650
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:17,510
It's like food, you know,
when they say food is a drug,
I didn't believe him, but I,

651
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:20,440
I'm totally convinced of it now.
It's like when you're eating bad,

652
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,850
when you just go on like a three month
bender have just eaten bad in your head.

653
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:27,970
Like, Oh God, I got to stop
on a fucking cheeseburger.

654
00:42:27,971 --> 00:42:31,030
And you just keep going and then that
makes you want cookies and all that type

655
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:31,780
of shit.

656
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,780
It's the food equivalent to like locking
yourself in a Roman just freebasing for

657
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:42,850
three months. That's what you
doing. So when I try to do,

658
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,410
when I'm eating,
eating bad like this,

659
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:48,310
I just talked to a buddy of mine outside
of the business who's trying to lose

660
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,240
some fucking wait.

661
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,500
I was trying to tell him that like you
gotta keep your head out in front of it

662
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:57,190
and just go like, I want that,
but I'm going to eat this.

663
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,110
Even in,
in,

664
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,370
in that moment when you're looking at
that apple as opposed to that fucking

665
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,540
glorious, whatever
you're looking at, right?

666
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:12,340
Toasted roast beef and cheese with the
fucking pickles and the chips and all

667
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:16,590
that. The last thing your
body's like, that's fine.

668
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,480
Just what the fuck I want.
And you got to reach for that apple.

669
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:25,290
You got to fucking hit that,
that crack pipe instead.

670
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,580
And I'm telling you, the second you
get to three bites in, you're like,

671
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:34,530
oh thank God, thank God I did that. And
you find, cause the, from what I've,

672
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,430
what I've read,

673
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,420
the braid little I've read use your
body is it's actually craving nutrition.

674
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,800
You know?
That's why we eat Chinese food.

675
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,690
Like fucking 35 minutes later,

676
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:48,000
you're hungry again because your
body's still craving nutrition.

677
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,980
There wasn't like a fucking
ounce of it in that shit.

678
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,090
At the risk of getting sued by that
entire fucking continent of China.

679
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,090
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

680
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:01,510
okay.

681
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:05,500
So that's what I would say
if you could try to do,

682
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:08,640
that's what I'm trying to do as I'm
trying to keep my head out in front of us.

683
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:12,340
So I got that grilled cheese sandwich
and I got to tomato soup and I said,

684
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:14,710
all right, I gotta get back on
the fucking Green Gumbo here is,

685
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:18,400
I'm calling it because I'm in
New Orleans and uh, that's it.

686
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,660
I'm back on that shit for the last two
tomorrow morning and wake up and make

687
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:26,110
another one. Bingo. Bango
I'm trying to do two a day.

688
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:30,070
Jewson and then one day having
the fuck in, uh, you know,

689
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:31,150
a healthy dinner.

690
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:32,030
Yeah.

691
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,400
And then I go on the treadmill for
a half hour. There's no fucking way.

692
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:38,390
You're not going to drop weight.
All right, so there you go.

693
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,620
So stop doing those stupid ass fad diets.
EA.

694
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:45,590
It's the fucking cornflakes died.
All I do is he could lay eggs.

695
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:49,400
I can eat as much as I wanted.
That bullshit veggie eventually.

696
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,080
Okay.

697
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,410
You don't really, I think the really,
it really is, is not even like,

698
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,150
it's not even the fucking diet. It's
the, once you get to your weight,

699
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,870
what do you do then? You know,
once you get down to your weight,

700
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,640
if some point you're going
to be looking around,

701
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:08,540
it's like you got out of jail and
there's some ice cream right over there.

702
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:13,970
You were an adult. You don't have to
go, mom, can I have some ice cream?

703
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,540
Right? That's how you become
a fat fuck as an adult.

704
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,060
There's no one to say you
had enough cookies, so on,

705
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:24,100
you got enough boobs put on a condom.

706
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,263
It's all on you.

707
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,620
You gotta be your own fucking parent
until you get a lady and your life.

708
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,150
Then she starts fucking nagging at you.
Take your shoes are on there.

709
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:36,550
I get off the rug up.
Fuck you lady.

710
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,740
Where did you become so angry?
Um,

711
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,743
okay,

712
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,130
so that would be my advice when
you're just on, if right now,

713
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:53,780
if you'll listen to this shit
and you're on a bad fucking road,

714
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:58,600
I'm telling you one of these days in
the future, you're going to wake up,

715
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,700
you're going to be sitting
down on the side of your bed,

716
00:46:00,701 --> 00:46:03,970
you're going to glance it to a mirror and
you're going to be like, what the fuck?

717
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,450
What have I done to myself?
You just stand up real quick.

718
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,110
You can try to suck it in and try
to deny the truth that you just saw.

719
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:15,211
Hear that?

720
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:19,920
That's the steam engine coming back
on the fucking racist genocide.

721
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:20,754
One Oh one.

722
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,603
MMM.

723
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:24,761
The fuck am I to,
yeah.

724
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:27,790
Just make yourself eat an apple
or just eat a fucking salad.

725
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,660
You gotta you gotta turn that
you've got to turn the boat around.

726
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,540
Yeah,

727
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,510
that's what I'm trying to do.

728
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,110
Okay.

729
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:39,100
I got to do what I fucking went back up
to like almost a buck 90 and now back

730
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:42,970
down to like the mid one seventies I got,
it's the fucking worst.

731
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,640
Just trying to lose like 15
pounds is the fucking worst.

732
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:50,080
I can't imagine people who got a, I
got to lose more than that. So, uh,

733
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,950
you know,
I don't know.

734
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,300
I don't know how this became more
of a weight loss podcast. Um,

735
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,990
but I think it's working though. This guy
actually sent me a letter. He said, uh,

736
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,080
podcast success story,
Dear Wilbur,

737
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,880
you sir are a god amongst men.
Ah, Jesus. I wish that was true.

738
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,590
He goes, I used to be a depressed
piece of shit. You're a,

739
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:15,400
your typical, the world is
against me. Nobody likes me.

740
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:18,070
Nobody wants me fucking moron.
That's who I was.

741
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,340
But your advice on stepping back and make
it fun of every negative annotation I

742
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:26,050
have. Is that a word? Did he write that?

743
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,500
Okay.

744
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,860
D type that correctly or
am I am boy annotation?

745
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,540
I Dunno not to make you depressed
again. I don't know how to spell. Um,

746
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,500
he goes, I have fucking change
my life. I'm 80 pounds lighter.

747
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,460
I got a great girl and I've gotten
two count them two promotions.

748
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,750
You're a comedian.
You're not obligated to be Oprah Maury,

749
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,710
but you still make a
difference. Thank you, sir,

750
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:52,210
for knocking me back into cohesion. Uh,
you probably make 20 times more than me.

751
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:56,590
I doubt that sir, with the
two big promotions there. Um,

752
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,620
but I know,
but I owe you a drink next time I see you.

753
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,640
If you're in Canada or being tamps you
stay classy, sir. Thou that's great.

754
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,120
Good for you sir. We'll get
ahead. He turned it around

755
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,480
somehow. My negative, whatever
the fuck my shaming, my fat shame,

756
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:18,610
my fear shame has been working.
Um,

757
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,360
all right, enough about that
shit. So that's what I'm
doing. I'm drinking the, I'm,

758
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:27,970
I'm doing that fat,
sick and nearly dead juicing thing and uh,

759
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,030
it's like all green
stuff. It's Kale, celery,

760
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,200
a couple of handfuls of
parsley, cucumber, Zucchini,

761
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:39,040
and then alignment to take
the bitterness out. And uh,

762
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,010
I get tell you it's fucking delicious.
I love it.

763
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,420
And um,
I dunno,

764
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:48,640
I think I'm going to incorporate
this in every couple of months.

765
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:49,630
Just go back to that.

766
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:53,380
Well just juice for like four or five
days just so I stay out in front of it

767
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,790
just so I don't have to have sit down
one day and have that fucking beach ball.

768
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:02,110
I've got a thing on my button down shirts.
It's the one, two third button down.

769
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,460
When that button starts to look like
it's doing the iron cross between both

770
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:10,810
sides of my, of my shirt. That's an,
I'm like guy, he fucking jerk off.

771
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,340
All right.

772
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,280
And then what happens is they lay off
the beer and then I just start slamming

773
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:18,160
whiskey.
Like that's my initial when I've,

774
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,480
we've begun our initial
defendant until our dieting is,

775
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:25,570
I go from drinking Pale Ales to whiskey.

776
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,480
I really am a freckled mess.

777
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,640
[inaudible]

778
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,590
Hey,
what's going on?

779
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:36,880
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

780
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,140
October 12th,
2009 and uh,

781
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,060
I am in a fantastic fucking mood.
Isn't that nice? Isn't that nice?

782
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:50,260
When you run into somebody on a Monday
and they're in a great mood rather than

783
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,670
the usual country run into it
work. Hey Jerry, how you doing?

784
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,790
Oh,
you know the fucking week.

785
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,920
No girlfriend would be a bitch yo weekend.

786
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:05,720
Can't believe Patriots lose due
to food for tube. Rudy. Rudy,

787
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,210
most who's worried open.
Yeah.

788
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,570
Shut up. You think I give a fuck
about you? I was just saying hello.

789
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,200
I was being friendly because we
were walking in opposite directions.

790
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:19,670
Pass each other and our eyes happened
to meet. That's all I was saying.

791
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:21,710
No one gives a fuck about
your host stupid day.

792
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:26,711
So I'm in an awesome mood and I'm going
to tell you why because I've been on the

793
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:31,880
road for six of the last seven weeks
tightening up my act the way Bill Bella

794
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:34,910
checks going to tighten up that
patriots' defense over the year and we'll

795
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:39,080
challenge for a fucking title
sometime next year,

796
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,690
but it's still a good thing. I haven't
packed it in yet with the Patriots. No,

797
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:45,560
I've been on the road and I was on the
road for the last 10 straight days.

798
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,500
Everybody, do you have any
fucking idea what that's like?

799
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,650
Has any of you ever gone out there?
You've ever gone out to Disney world?

800
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,360
What a fuck do people go for it?

801
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,320
10 days. Oh my God. It went to Ahca Poco.
It was awesome. We sat on the beach,

802
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,860
we were tanning. We didn't do
anything. We dress like who was,

803
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:06,420
who was we? Just like
absolutely. Absolutely, totally.

804
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:10,080
100% who is,
we didn't pay for a drink.

805
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,920
I had no pubic hair.
I barely had a bikini bottom on.

806
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:19,130
I had this island guy put corn in my
hair and I did fucking things that would

807
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:22,020
explain the cows is on my knees,

808
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:25,710
but I'm not going to because it was
in a different country and it doesn't

809
00:52:25,711 --> 00:52:26,550
fucking count.

810
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,470
Well, what I did was look at me with
all of fucking energy. You know what?

811
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:34,270
I thought I had a meeting this
morning at 10 in the morning.

812
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:37,900
It turns out it was fucking yesterday.
So I'm clean shaven and I am dressed,

813
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:43,180
dressed to impress for this
fucking podcast. And uh, anyways,

814
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:45,610
I've been on the road for the
last 10 fucking days. And, uh,

815
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,920
I finally got to sleep in my own bed,
saw my girl, I saw my dog, you know,

816
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,950
I came home.
I watch some sports yesterday,

817
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:57,220
even though fucking Red
Sox and the Patriots lost,

818
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,990
you know, good for the angels, by the way.
All the people out here in California,

819
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:03,370
man, good for you guys. You know,

820
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,610
I know what it's like when you
can never beat a team. Granted,

821
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,210
I wish you still couldn't beat us,
but I know what the fucking deal is.

822
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:15,130
I watched to pay a fucking red sox loose
to the Yankees for the first 80% of my

823
00:53:15,131 --> 00:53:19,750
life. Well, first 36 years of my life
could not beat the sons of bitches.

824
00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:24,550
So, uh, congratulations to you. I
hope you beat the Yankees and uh,

825
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:28,140
you know, I really hope you do. But the
fucking Yankees look really good too.

826
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,340
They really do.

827
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,720
Their $200 million team has just plugging
away against that $60 million fucking

828
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,530
Minnesota twins. That's right. Your can't.
Some bringing it up. But you know why?

829
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:42,300
Because none of the announcers due
to share as having a hell of a bat.

830
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:46,350
Juniors aren't Firstar Jesus Christ
has taken a lead off the third base.

831
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,360
He better watch out.
He's still got that robot.

832
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,260
It's not even fucking competition anymore.
You know,

833
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,220
and I know the red sox are part of
the fucking problem, but Jesus Christ,

834
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:01,590
Jesus Christ, rarely, um, anyways,

835
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,210
let's plow ahead. Good luck. Minnesota.

836
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:06,960
You really should be up two games to one
if you didn't fucking blow it, you know,

837
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:08,820
but what do you guys care?
How, what do you guys care?

838
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,800
You've got the mall of America.

839
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,680
You can go down there and ride the
Ferris wheel right across from the stride

840
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:16,470
rite outlet. Um, so anyways, yeah,

841
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:19,720
I've been on the fucking row for the
last 10 days and I swear to God, um,

842
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:24,750
I figured it out in the last three weeks.
I have done 22 sets of an hour or more,

843
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,360
and I was, my final night was Saturday
night at the Improv in Pittsburgh,

844
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,830
which, um, is really becoming one
of my favorite cities out there.

845
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,040
Uh, it's just, uh, it's
just a great sports city.

846
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,920
It's one of the greatest views when
he calls it the Fort Pitt tunnel.

847
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:45,280
I don't know where it is. A,
you always come through the
tunnel, right? You know, he,

848
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,440
after you drive down the
fucking roadway there, whatever,

849
00:54:48,441 --> 00:54:51,000
when a comment come onto the airport
and get on the highway, there we go.

850
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,170
You know,

851
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,290
the only thing that sucks about
Pittsburgh is they're really big on having

852
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,250
whatever the numbers of lanes are.
When you get on the bridge,

853
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:03,990
there's one less lane. They're really into
that bottleneck thing. Um, three lanes,

854
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:06,780
it goes down to two, four goes down to
three. That type of ship when anyways,

855
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:09,480
when he go through the tunnel,
when you come out,

856
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,440
you think you're just going to be
coming, you know, up underground.

857
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,370
Like you don't like the Holland
tunnel on the Lincoln tunnel.

858
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,190
When you come into New York City,
feel like a fucking rat.

859
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,390
You just come up and you're
right at street level. But in,

860
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:22,760
in Pittsburgh you come through like this,
uh,

861
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,640
I don't know if it's big enough to say
it's a mountain to fucking hill and they

862
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,010
dug a tunnel right through it.
And as you come out,

863
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,580
right as you get to the other side, the
whole city is right out in front of you.

864
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:36,640
This panoramic view of
the whole city and look,

865
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,160
you look to the left is Heinz field
where the Steelers play and next to it is

866
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:41,611
that a,

867
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:46,611
the ballpark where the AAA pirates play
where the Yankees and red sox actually

868
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:52,500
have trained vultures circling the
stadium. And when anybody hits a triple,

869
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,790
we both dive bomb in to see
who can snatch the way first.

870
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,840
It's a tragedy man. Major League
baseball is a fucking tragedy.

871
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,430
You know. What do you think the red
sox are going to do this off season?

872
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,310
$120 million. All we
spent last year, one 25.

873
00:56:11,311 --> 00:56:13,230
You think we're not going
to get back up to a buck 80?

874
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:16,230
Like we usually do better watch out.

875
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,040
Oh you little fucking teams around the
league were common. We got our checkbook.

876
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,760
Um, it's horrible. Anyways,
plowing ahead. Um, yeah,

877
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:26,680
the whole in that they have
like all these bridges,

878
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:28,250
all this great steelwork that,
you know,

879
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,000
people actually live in the town if they
didn't die when they were building them

880
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:33,640
falling off the bridge cause they had to
smoke weed because they were afraid of

881
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,610
heights but couldn't admit
it because they're a man. Um,

882
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:41,020
all those bridges are there. And uh, this
is nothing about Pittsburgh. Very, very,

883
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:45,310
very underrated delis. Whenever
you hear about great like Pastrami,

884
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,130
corned beef or whatever, you always hear,
you know, go to a New York, you know,

885
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:51,340
New York Deli,
oh I'll make you a fucking hero.

886
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,350
But Pittsburgh,

887
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,120
I don't know what's going on out there
but for some reason they have kept it a,

888
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:00,190
why doesn't that guy fee
air? He go there, you know,

889
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:04,750
and take a big fucking bite out of that
shit cause I'm telling you incredible,

890
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:08,410
incredible. A Deli meat. I
went to a, came in a day early.

891
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:12,240
I went to the Pittsburgh penguins verse,
the Phoenix Coyotes,

892
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,110
one of the worst hockey
games I've ever been to.

893
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,640
They didn't fucking show up cause they
were resting cause they had the flyers

894
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:21,790
the next night, let's just
go easy. They're bankrupt,

895
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,030
we'll just let them win tonight.
That's basically the game I went to.

896
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:28,750
But it was fun to go to the old
thing. So, uh, I'm just babbling.

897
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,650
I'm babbling like a fucking fat chick who
just got an engagement rank, you know,

898
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,950
that's what's going on here.
That was really mean and uncalled for.

899
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,970
Um,
so anyways,

900
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,330
this is what I have to talk,
you know what I want to do this week.

901
00:57:43,331 --> 00:57:47,260
I want to take some time out to talk
to you guys about what it's like to fly

902
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,100
from fucking Pittsburgh to Los Angeles.
Basically,

903
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,490
there's one show in town and
the show's name is us air.

904
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,440
And um,

905
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,330
okay.

906
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,570
I went in, I mean you were Sarah's,
it's a fucking rinky dink. Caroline,

907
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:06,010
who's kidding, who, you know
what I mean? Like if they,

908
00:58:06,011 --> 00:58:10,000
if they were in baseball, they would
be like the pod race, you know,

909
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,420
no offense to, you know what I
mean? That in an offensive way.

910
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:17,650
There's no comedy clubs in San Diego.
What am I really heartening, you know?

911
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:22,910
Um, this is what I did. I show
up and I go to check in, um,

912
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,640
and I'm bringing my bag along and
uh, I'm checking a bag. Basically.

913
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,150
You know how much they want for first
checked bag. Go ahead. I'll wait.

914
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:36,340
Take a guess. What'd you
say? 15 ah, higher. 2020.

915
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:39,430
You say their a guy in the back even more.

916
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:43,960
25 bucks for the first bag checked.

917
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,060
Now do they bring that up?

918
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,100
Is that anywhere on the Internet as
you're going to make you fucking die?

919
00:58:49,101 --> 00:58:52,840
I didn't. I don't know who do I know
I fucking, I call my travel agent.

920
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:56,350
All I know is they don't fucking bring
it up until you get to the airport and

921
00:58:56,351 --> 00:59:00,310
then you go to give it to bag and then
they go. That'll be $25. And they got you.

922
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,340
They got ya.
It's a total fucking shakedown.

923
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,850
And that's the exact song that went
through my head cause I was thinking,

924
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:10,150
why don't you just make this
part of the ticket? You know,

925
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:13,390
it's kind of like 1995
plus shipping and handling.

926
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:17,860
So you don't see that it really costs
like 27 bucks, then you'd be 27 bucks.

927
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:23,120
That's not worth that onion chopper thing.
If there's a one in the beginning,

928
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:24,710
I'll definitely fucking buy it.
Right?

929
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:26,840
That's what they're doing
to me and I'm tired of it.

930
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,400
Total fucking shake down those
fucking cops and I say to lay, I go,

931
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:35,480
you gotta be kidding me. It's 25 bucks for
the first thing. She goes, yeah, I know,

932
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:38,570
I know. She goes, well, it's only 20 if,

933
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,640
if you go on the Internet and it's like,
yeah, and then you don't have a job.

934
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,320
And she goes, I know I go, so why
would you tell me that? She goes,

935
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:52,460
to be honest with you, the people above
us say, we have to tell people that.

936
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,650
All right. And we also have to suggest
that they use the automated machines.

937
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,470
And I go, that's unbelievable.
She goes, yeah, and you know what?

938
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:05,040
The people above us get a commission
for the amount of people who use the

939
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:07,260
automated machines and
we don't get anything.

940
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,210
Do you realize how fucked up that is?

941
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,480
All you fucking people who argue with
me about those automated machines.

942
01:00:12,481 --> 01:00:15,180
Do you see what they're doing?
They're pitting us against each other.

943
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,170
People's bad financial positions.
That lady behind the counter,

944
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:20,340
she wants to keep her job,

945
01:00:20,341 --> 01:00:24,360
so she literally has to teach people
how to phase her out of a fucking job,

946
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,473
you know?

947
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,520
I Dunno. The whole time
I was in, now all I hear,

948
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,100
I kept hearing unilad ACDC song shakedown.

949
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:37,230
Nervous shake down off of a flick
of the switch. You know how it goes.

950
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,930
You don't. You don't know how.
You don't know how it goes.

951
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:43,840
You guys weren't fans of that shit.
Here it is. Here it is right here.

952
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,310
Yeah, it's $25 for the first bag. Yeah.

953
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,940
He didn't tell you because we knew you
wouldn't pick this fucking airline.

954
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,780
That's all I heard in my head.

955
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:04,440
Then I'm on the fucking flight and this
old lady goes, oh, I'm a little chilly.

956
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:08,740
Sweet Little Old Lady. All right,
could I have a blanket in the lit?

957
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,830
The stewardess said,
that'll be $7

958
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:16,811
that's what they should have.

959
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:19,550
That's the song that they should
have had this second phase,

960
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,940
close the cabin door.
It's fucking brutal.

961
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,690
$7 $7 for a blanket.
Everybody on us there.

962
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:31,220
But then somebody told me that's actually
because of the swine flu because of

963
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,140
the swine flu. And I was
like, wait a minute now,

964
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,770
didn't we put smallpox in blankets
and give them to the Indians?

965
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,513
You know?

966
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,270
So maybe there is something, I don't
know. I vaguely remember reading that,

967
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:48,410
that you can wipe out a whole group
of people if they're, if they're cold,

968
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,750
it's very easy to do.
You just put,

969
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:55,610
you just sneeze on some blankets and
you hand it to them and then they start

970
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,780
dropping like flies.

971
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:01,810
And the ones that survive run a casino
ronic casino when they cry about litter.

972
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,160
So see, there you go, people. Okay, now it
gets worse. So I'm on this fucking plane,

973
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:08,480
right?
It's 25 bucks.

974
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,693
MMM.

975
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,760
25 bucks for the first bag.
$7 for a blanket.

976
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:16,250
The people in my row was saying that
there's a rumor that are actually going to

977
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:19,770
start charging for the bathroom, which I
think is bullshit. There's fucking way.

978
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:25,560
We're not to that point are we?
Um, and then when we go to land,

979
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:28,410
this is the greatest fucking thing
ever. I go to land, I'm like, thank God,

980
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,920
thank God I have made it.
I am back here in La.

981
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:34,980
I'm going to sleep my own bed and
we see my baby and we see my dog.

982
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:36,000
Everything's going to be great.

983
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,430
I fucking standard down there waiting
for the bag that I paid $25 for.

984
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,090
That should come out of the fucking
thing on its own little pillow for that

985
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:49,620
amount of money. Right? I had
to wait half hour for my bag.

986
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,860
Still nothing, no announcement
from anybody, nothing.

987
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,980
So I finally walk into the
thing and I'm like, excuse me,

988
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,870
do you know what's going
on here? She goes, yeah,

989
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:01,860
we kind of Sunday we kind of have like
a skeleton crew. So I make a joke.

990
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,100
What do you got? Like one guy on
loading the plane. She goes, yeah,

991
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:06,780
one guy for 200 bags.
You know,

992
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:10,200
I don't flip out at those people behind
the counter because I know that their

993
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:14,040
job is to basically sit there and get
yelled at by people who don't understand

994
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:17,730
that they don't make the fucking
policy. Right. So I leave, alright,

995
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,640
half hour in,
another 20 minutes goes by,

996
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,670
I'm standing there for almost
a fucking hour, no bag,

997
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,740
and everybody's standing
around like zombies.

998
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:29,800
Occasionally somebody would be
fucking walking in there and uh,

999
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,450
I finally walked in there and
I was just like, alright, um,

1000
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,400
I know you don't have anything
to do with this policy,

1001
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:40,401
but do you have a form that I can fill
out so I can ask for my $25 back please?

1002
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:46,020
And lays like, um, no, there's no
form for that. I have a number here.

1003
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:49,800
And I go, how many people do you
have working right now on a Sunday?

1004
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,780
And she's like, I don't know. I don't
have access to that information.

1005
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,750
Um,
do you do this every Sunday?

1006
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,890
Just so I know in the future when I go
to travel that I won't fly us Aaron on a

1007
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:06,420
Sunday. Do you know? Do you do this
every Sunday? Yeah. I don't know.

1008
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:11,190
I don't usually work Sundays.
Do you know what's going on with the bag?

1009
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:16,170
Yeah. I don't know how to contact
the people. Every fucking thing.

1010
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:19,170
I asked her, she couldn't give me
a fucking answer and I was like,

1011
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:21,480
do you think this is a
smart way to run a business?

1012
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,200
I mean,
I don't have a problem.

1013
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:29,050
Where can you fucking morons?

1014
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,710
So I go just gimme gimme gimme
I'm becoming that person.

1015
01:04:32,711 --> 01:04:35,620
I fucking complain all the time.
Right. Um, I'm gonna, I got the thing,

1016
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,800
I'm going to get my $25 back.
I got to figure out how to do it.

1017
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,320
I don't think I'm going to
be able to do it via email.

1018
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:44,800
I think I need to get on the phone
and then I go, I want money back.

1019
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:48,430
I'm sorry sir. We don't have for
refunds. I'm sorry. I know you're sorry.

1020
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:51,650
You guys are always sorry, but none of
you guys can fucking help. All right.

1021
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:54,430
I can't curse. So I realized
you're sorry. I'm sorry to,

1022
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:56,320
is there someone above
you that I can speak to?

1023
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,860
Well I would like to speak to them and
just keep going up and up and up and

1024
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:01,180
become such a pain in the ass.

1025
01:05:01,181 --> 01:05:04,900
And the key is you don't curse cause if
you don't curse they can't hang up on

1026
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:09,710
you. Well my buddies had a great
fucking line the other day.

1027
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:12,620
He was on one of these
1-800-NUMBERS and he was,

1028
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:14,570
and he was having the same
problem. He goes, yeah, I want to,

1029
01:05:14,571 --> 01:05:18,190
I want a refund and I'm
sorry we don't refunds. Um,

1030
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:20,890
is there anything else I
can help you with? He goes,

1031
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,560
anything else you can help me with?
You haven't helped me with anything yet.

1032
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:24,640
You're fucking Twat.

1033
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:29,560
And of course she hangs up cause
he said the f and the t word. Um,

1034
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:33,550
so anyways, uh, I don't even know
what I'm talking about right now.

1035
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:36,460
I think the only fucking way to get back
at these corporations is you have to be

1036
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:38,800
like those little old ladies
who just won't go away.

1037
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,650
And you really just have to complain
and just say that is completely

1038
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:43,090
unacceptable. I mean, what the fuck?

1039
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:47,020
Kind of an airline doesn't have enough
guys to unload their fucking airplane.

1040
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,930
You know, I love too is such
a jam packed fucking airplane.

1041
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,470
And I know it's a tough time. I don't
know. They're probably even losing money,

1042
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:57,100
but those fucking assholes at the top
are still making it just as much money,

1043
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,610
just as much money as they were.
I guarantee it. Those fucking CEO,

1044
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,900
CEO douchebags never take any,
they never take a fucking pay cut.

1045
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:08,170
They got me standard down there
for an extra fucking hour.

1046
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:13,360
Did I say I was in a good mood this week?
I actually am in a good mood,

1047
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:14,194
but um,

1048
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,590
I'm more pissed off at the fucking people
who challenged me on those automated

1049
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:18,281
things and all that.

1050
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:22,390
You don't even realize you're leading
yourself and the rest of us down this

1051
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:24,550
fucking path and that's what
it's going to be in the future.

1052
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,820
There's going to be nobody there and
there's going to be one robo cop.

1053
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:29,470
And if the second you start complaining,

1054
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:33,130
they're going to somehow connect the
dots with you and the al Qaeda and you're

1055
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:36,070
going to get shot. All
right. Maybe that's,

1056
01:06:36,071 --> 01:06:38,470
maybe that's a little bit of an
exaggeration, but you know what I mean.

1057
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,390
Whatever happened to the customer is
always right. Fucking old lady next to me.

1058
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:45,820
She was,
she put newspaper on her legs.

1059
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,740
I don't fucking know. What are
you going to do? All right,

1060
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:54,690
let's move on with the podcast. And if
you liked that song, nervous shakedown,

1061
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,780
which I don't know why you wouldn't,
you know, why wouldn't you like that?

1062
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,950
Why does that sound good?

1063
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:03,450
Dat,

1064
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:08,320
Dat, Dat, Dat, Dat, Dat, dat
that Abu [inaudible]. Um,

1065
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,920
all right, let's get on with the
podcast. So if you knew my podcast, um,

1066
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:14,980
most times I'm in a country mood and
sometimes I say I'm in a good mood and I

1067
01:07:14,981 --> 01:07:19,810
still sound a little bit cunty. Um, last
week a lot of people really enjoyed, um,

1068
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:24,930
when Joe Derosa was a guest hosting
cohosting who's being Joe McMahon.

1069
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:26,771
And,
uh,

1070
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:31,270
we got a big debate over what was
less healthy doughnuts or pancakes.

1071
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,050
And a,

1072
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:37,050
I was on the pancake side and everybody
seemed to agree with me and one person

1073
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:42,070
actually sent me a little linked to show
how donuts are made after they make the

1074
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:42,910
dough and all that.

1075
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:46,990
Evidently they fucking deep fry them
for like seven days before they even add

1076
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,330
the jelly in the,
in the,

1077
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:52,720
in the goo and the coconut and
the crap that they put on them.

1078
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:58,080
And fucking Joe to Rosa is trying to
tell me that Bisquick some eggs and some

1079
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:00,740
butter and a little bit
of Syrup is, is, is,

1080
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:04,470
is worse than that and know
the Syrup Mai Tai. It's, it's,

1081
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,480
it's damn close in order to like this is
where it's like pancakes or the red sox

1082
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:13,360
and donuts to the Yankees,
you know,

1083
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,060
it's basically the difference probably
between 180 million and 200 million.

1084
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:22,460
Um, oh look at that. I got an
email from the ACDC official store.

1085
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,790
I'm 41 let's see what they have to say.

1086
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,880
Oh they have a limited
edition ACDC tee shirt

1087
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,920
that's actually fucking cool.

1088
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:36,921
They wrote ACDC on like a Marshall amp
preorder the ACDC backtracks two CD.

1089
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,150
Oh Wow.
They getting fucking old.

1090
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:46,530
My mother used to say that they never
fucking release shit. Rereleased material.

1091
01:08:46,531 --> 01:08:47,430
They don't like doing it.

1092
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:48,900
Okay.

1093
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,260
The ACDC backtracks amplifier tee shirt.

1094
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,491
What is going on?

1095
01:08:54,491 --> 01:08:57,190
Let me get back to the podcast and a
fucking look at this later. All right.

1096
01:08:57,191 --> 01:08:58,270
We've got a lot of shit to get to.

1097
01:08:58,271 --> 01:09:03,271
Cause last week I shot the shit with
Joe to Rosa and I didn't get a chance to

1098
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:06,040
answer a lot of questions or whatever.

1099
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,200
One of one of the people
actually had a great solution.

1100
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,670
Remember last member a couple of
weeks ago on a on, I read that, um,

1101
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:18,090
I read that story where that dead guy
was flicking the ear of the boyfriend of

1102
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:22,660
a, of his sister, you know,
and they were a little drunk.

1103
01:09:22,661 --> 01:09:26,440
They would come from the cubs game. I'll
do a little recap here. And the, the,

1104
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,180
the boyfriend was driving,

1105
01:09:28,181 --> 01:09:31,900
telling the dude to stop and he kept
fucking doing it in and then the kid just

1106
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:35,890
snapped and he turned around and punched
him in the face and knocked his teeth

1107
01:09:35,891 --> 01:09:40,470
out. So the brother of the sister, um,

1108
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,250
says, now I have to kick the shit
out of that kid and it has to happen.

1109
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:49,780
The kids been ducking me and I
know I'm going to do what? But, um,

1110
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:54,160
I just need you to help me explain
it to my sister. Wide has to happen.

1111
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,780
So I offered a, Oh yeah, that was
last week. That was last week. See,

1112
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,780
10 days on the road, you don't even know
when the fuck it was. It was last week.

1113
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,220
So me and Joe de Rosa tried to give
this guy some solutions and I hope he's

1114
01:10:06,221 --> 01:10:09,580
still listening this weekend. He
didn't get pissed off, but, uh,

1115
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:13,300
this guy has got a great ear flicked
solution. All right. He says, Bill,

1116
01:10:13,301 --> 01:10:16,840
I have a great way to resolve the fight
between the two friends and last week's

1117
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:21,610
podcast. Two words,
flare, chop. All right.

1118
01:10:21,611 --> 01:10:25,510
For all your raw, raw wrestling fans
out there originated by the nature boy,

1119
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:27,400
ric flair.
You simply,

1120
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:31,660
you simply wind up and backhand
the person in the chest.

1121
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:38,470
My cousin, brother and I use it to
resolve all arguments between us.

1122
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,710
The reason it's effective
is it hurts like a bitch,

1123
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:45,220
but only for a short period of time.
It's hilarious for all that.

1124
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:48,790
Watch it and leaves the raised
imprint on the person's chest.

1125
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,420
After you flare chop someone
all malcontent melts away.

1126
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:57,490
I think that's a fucking hilarious,
hilarious idea. So all you got to do,

1127
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:02,491
explain to your sister what
the flare chop is and uh,

1128
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,610
I think that's perfect because it's
not going to be anything permanent.

1129
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:11,320
I think it's going to get away. A lot
of anger is going to get out. You can,

1130
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:15,660
you guys can start over again and uh,
cause who's kidding? No. You know,

1131
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:18,000
I'd rather have my ear flicked
and get my tooth knocked out,

1132
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,830
but you were kind of being a cunt,

1133
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:23,160
so this is a great way to resolve
it and it's fucking hilarious.

1134
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:27,090
Maybe you can turn it into a funny youtube
video and I'll probably get a lot of

1135
01:11:27,091 --> 01:11:31,410
hits. So, uh, my hat is off to
that wonderful fucking solution.

1136
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,720
They should give you one
of those judge shows.

1137
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,520
I think you really got a really
got a knack for it. The flare chop,

1138
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:42,630
the nature boy ric flair. All
right, here's something else.

1139
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:46,280
Somebody sent me this week and um,
I dunno,

1140
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:49,200
I didn't really fit into the advice.
It didn't really fit the questions,

1141
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:53,640
but I thought it was a great point.
So this is kind of an op ed piece. Um,

1142
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,140
all right. It says, dear bill,

1143
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:59,010
this past week I attended game one of
the series between the Dodgers and the

1144
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:03,750
cardinals. Uh, before the game started
there was of course the national anthem.

1145
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:06,450
They gather, they gathered, uh,

1146
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,880
let me move this closer to my
eyeballs so I can read this.

1147
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,880
They gathered probably 50 to 75 or so
sailors from the u s navy locally based

1148
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:17,910
and they hurled out this huge flag.
Um,

1149
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:22,380
fast forward to about the fifth inning
when they are doing the cheesy jumbo tron

1150
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:27,000
spotlight. And they put the troops up
on the screen. Everyone in the stadium,

1151
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:28,260
cheers and applauds.

1152
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,400
That's when I noticed that they had
these navy guy where they had these navy

1153
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:36,840
guys seated. They were seated in the
very top section in the nosebleeds.

1154
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,640
This is just bullshit to me.

1155
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,250
We say we love our troops and
they have the greatest citizens,

1156
01:12:41,251 --> 01:12:45,360
yet we can't afford to upgrade them to
at least the outfield or even the second

1157
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:49,710
level fuck the MLB for using the
troops as a way to show their corporate

1158
01:12:49,711 --> 01:12:53,400
patriotism and then sticking them
at the very top of the stadium.

1159
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,320
Is it really that much to
ask for an organization such
as the MLB or the Dodgers?

1160
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,060
Who am I?

1161
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,360
Who am whomever the decision is up to
to lose just a little bit of money.

1162
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,890
Um, on some seats. The right field
bleachers were not even sold out.

1163
01:13:07,891 --> 01:13:12,210
Fucking ungrateful, Fake
Patriotic Cunts. Um,

1164
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,490
I don't know about you guys, but I
thought he made some great points there.

1165
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,540
I've seen that a lot of times they do.
Whenever there's a large group of people,

1166
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:22,920
be it the troops or some inner
city kids, they're the, you know,

1167
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:27,870
they always fucking stick them all the
way up at the top of the stadium. Uh,

1168
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:31,170
you know, that's, that's capitalism
for you. You would think though,

1169
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:35,340
you know what I mean? You would think
with the troops the least they could do.

1170
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,160
Yeah. I stick them on though. Yeah.
They'd stick them on the mezzanine level.

1171
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:39,740
Okay.

1172
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,770
You know what I mean? I mean, look a
team like the Yankees, I mean those,

1173
01:13:42,771 --> 01:13:46,220
those seats around Tuscon and know
those things are like 1500 a whack.

1174
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:50,300
There's no fucking way he
could do that. Um, so yeah,

1175
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,580
stick them on the middle level.
I think that's decent, right?

1176
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,690
A lot of the shit around
the, uh, around home plate,

1177
01:13:56,691 --> 01:14:00,600
those are season tickets.
Maybe they could do that.

1178
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:02,320
They could actually have
those corporate constant,

1179
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,400
some of those rich bastards who have
season tickets give away their tickets for

1180
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:07,740
one night.
Maybe they do a nice little switch.

1181
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:11,590
That'd be a great little thing as a
thank you. You know, they switched seats,

1182
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:14,530
they let him sit down there and then the
corporate guys could pat themselves on

1183
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:18,430
the back of what great people they are
as a fucking trudge their way up to the

1184
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:22,960
top and look down on all of us the way
they've always wanted to. All right.

1185
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:24,650
Okay.

1186
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:27,680
Now let's move on to the next section.
This is getting really choppy.

1187
01:14:27,681 --> 01:14:31,370
I'm trying to think of
anything interesting happen
and he, anything interesting.

1188
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,500
That's something me and my
girlfriend always talk about.

1189
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:36,290
You remember that bugs
bunny cartoon where a,

1190
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:39,290
you know the monster that actually
had arms but she couldn't see him.

1191
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,440
He wore the chuck Taylor high tops.
He was all brown and all the hair.

1192
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,680
And you remember that time when bugs
bunny just sat them down and started doing

1193
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:49,850
his nails and doing his hair.
Going mindset is such interesting people.

1194
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:54,560
It must be so interesting to be a monster.
You remember that? Um, do you now?

1195
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:58,610
I didn't think so. All right. What
happened? I just lost all momentum.

1196
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,950
I was doing so fucking well. I don't
give a shit. I'm psyched to be on.

1197
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:04,550
I'm really psyched to be home.
And if you have a pit bull,

1198
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:08,330
you really have to watch out for their
head because it's like a fucking bowling

1199
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:10,910
ball. And when they get excited,
they swing that thing around.

1200
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,020
It's going to catch in your chops,
it's going to hit you in the throat and a,

1201
01:15:15,021 --> 01:15:17,120
you're gonna have to lay on the ground
for a minute and then they're going to

1202
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:22,121
come up with that paintbrush sized fucking
tongue and practically drown you with

1203
01:15:22,611 --> 01:15:26,230
it. So, um, if you're
thinking about getting,

1204
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,270
getting a pit bull when you come
home after not seeing it for 10 days,

1205
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,160
you really,
you got to kind of,

1206
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:32,360
okay,

1207
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:32,570
I,

1208
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:37,570
I come from behind and what I do is I
make sure I have my head away from its

1209
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:41,840
head. Even if you get it to the
side, it's like a fucking alligator.

1210
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:42,890
Just swings it around.

1211
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:44,523
MMM.

1212
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:50,820
I Dunno. I think he's a maniac. All right,

1213
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:53,160
let's go. Okay. Interpreting dreams. Um,

1214
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,800
this is like a new segment that I thought
was going to be great and it never

1215
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:59,910
really took off. Uh, here's a dream
that somebody has. Okay, Bill,

1216
01:15:59,911 --> 01:16:03,980
last night I dreamt that there,
oh,

1217
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:07,190
last night I had a dream that was
so damn weird on so many levels.

1218
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,330
Basically I was back in the early
eighties. I was born in 1990.

1219
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,160
Okay, so he's born in 1990 for yet,
for some reason he's in the 1980s.

1220
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:19,370
I mean I might need some help
on this one. Um, and there were,

1221
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,630
they were gangs all around where
I used to live in Reno, Nevada.

1222
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:27,950
It was almost exactly like that movie,
the warriors. But I had never in my life

1223
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:31,980
till today seen that movie.

1224
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,450
I didn't really think much of it till I
watched a movie this morning and I swear

1225
01:16:36,451 --> 01:16:39,000
to fucking God that it was so
similar to the dream I had.

1226
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:43,560
It weirded me out to the point that I'm
pretty sure I just failed a biology test

1227
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:46,950
today at school because all I could
think about was the damn dream.

1228
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:51,420
Just the fact that I basically
dream something that had
already been created and

1229
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:55,350
then I had just heard they are making
a remake is pretty fucking strange.

1230
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,213
Any thoughts?

1231
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:57,990
Okay.

1232
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,010
Um,
yeah,

1233
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,990
I think you've been working out and you
really want to wear a vest with no shirt

1234
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:05,790
underneath it.
And a,

1235
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:10,580
you just grew up in a generation where
that's unacceptable on all fucking

1236
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:14,660
levels, even during Halloween. So, uh,

1237
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:19,400
in your dream, you were wishing that
you were born during a time when a,

1238
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:19,851
where you could,

1239
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:23,420
where you could wear a fucking leather
vest without a shirt underneath it.

1240
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,570
You know, maybe join a gang, maybe sing
some doo-wop around a burning trashcan.

1241
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,550
I think that's what your dream meant.

1242
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,970
It means that you don't want to
think it is. You were born in 1990.

1243
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,950
I bet in your past life you were
actually a member of a, of a, of a gang,

1244
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,383
you know,

1245
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,070
as opposed to some regular kid who just
goes to college out in fucking Reno and

1246
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:50,300
is bored shitless with his life. Right.
So he jerks off to porn on the Internet.

1247
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:52,660
Isn't anything, any of this, you know,

1248
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,070
I'm gonna do is I'm going to parachute
out of this fucking business.

1249
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,540
This is what I'm going to do right
now. Okay? I'm going to fuck him.

1250
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,480
I'm going to do one of those.
What is the, what are those,

1251
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:03,800
what are those fucking chicks who look
like men who tell you a future? You know,

1252
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:08,210
they get a little snow globe in front
of them where they take the dandruff out

1253
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:11,240
of it and all of a sudden they can
see your future. This is what they do.

1254
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:15,370
They get a little, they get a
little information about you and uh,

1255
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,650
next thing you know, they just start
piecing some shit together. There you go.

1256
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,520
I should put on some gypsy scarf right
now. That's right. In your past life,

1257
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:26,000
you were a member of a gang and uh,

1258
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:32,120
you know, you got, you got fucking
stabbed to death and uh, he had plans,

1259
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:33,920
he had plans to bring
all the gangs together.

1260
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,450
That's what the fuck you wanted to do.

1261
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,770
And you're the guy who gets shot by
fucking Cyrus. Was that his name?

1262
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,940
That's what it is.

1263
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,950
You wish you were born in a different
era as opposed to now where you live this

1264
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:49,190
very safe life. You want to be
a road warrior and you can't,

1265
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:51,701
what's the matter?

1266
01:18:51,701 --> 01:18:54,520
Was there some girl you wanted to talk
to but you didn't have the balls to?

1267
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:55,930
Okay.

1268
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:58,630
You know, so when your dreams, you're
trying to become like this hard ass,

1269
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,390
I guess you weren't in a drain,
you weren't in a gang and your dream,

1270
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:06,070
I don't fucking know. I Dunno if send
me more dreams, I'll get better at it.

1271
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:11,800
You know what? Maybe why. That's why
that segment didn't take off. All right,

1272
01:19:11,801 --> 01:19:13,600
let's get back to something
a little more proven.

1273
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:15,910
This is like doing standup right now.
That was like a new bit.

1274
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:20,170
It bombed and now I'm going to go to a
proven joke that I've told 600 times and

1275
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:24,880
make it sound brand new. All
right, here we go. Advice Bill.

1276
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:27,750
Uh, I recently got dumped
by my girlfriend, um,

1277
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,910
through behaving like an idiot
to be honest in her shoes.

1278
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:33,640
I would have done the same thing with
a different set I would have given.

1279
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,780
I would have given me a second chance for
the record. No, I didn't cheat on her.

1280
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:42,700
Instead, I found myself getting quite
broody. I think that means depressed,

1281
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,090
uh, with all the heaviness
that goes with that. Um,

1282
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,180
who knew that that can happen to men too?
I certainly didn't.

1283
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:56,330
What does broody mean? What does it
mean to be brooding? Isn't that what,

1284
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:59,650
what's his face did and rumble fish,
Matt Dillon.

1285
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,550
Isn't that how we got oh, you got
all his, his uh, his acting work,

1286
01:20:03,551 --> 01:20:07,950
they used to always say he does the
brooding good looks. So what happened you,

1287
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:11,250
you'd be in the apartment
with your girlfriend,

1288
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:15,150
she'd be trying to talk to you and you'd
be leaned up against one wall, you know,

1289
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:19,530
one foot on the floor, the other one
up against the wall. And she'd be like,

1290
01:20:19,531 --> 01:20:23,340
what do you want for breakfast? And
then you just sorta look, you know,

1291
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,380
you look to the side.
I Dunno.

1292
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,220
Okay.

1293
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,290
It's just doesn't feel right.

1294
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,030
Did you have a cigarette pack
rolled up and your t shirt?

1295
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:37,950
What the fuck is broody? I don't know
what that is. Anyway, see, she goes, um,

1296
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:42,480
he goes, I believe I'm
through that madness now.

1297
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:45,030
And yet while I was only with
her for about three months,

1298
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:49,530
I Mercer companionship terribly. I think
he means he was depressed. Anyways,

1299
01:20:49,531 --> 01:20:51,600
he goes, I sent her some
flowers to say I was sorry,

1300
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,970
but she says she doesn't
want to see or talk with me,

1301
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:58,530
although she says she will contact me in
the future when some of the other heavy

1302
01:20:58,531 --> 01:21:03,070
shit she's going through
right now is over. Um,

1303
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:06,560
I feel I owe the situation one last
roll of the dice at the very least.

1304
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:10,490
Do you have any suggestions? Yeah. You
guys need to not be near each other.

1305
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,600
All right. First of all, if you want
to call you back, don't call her.

1306
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,370
All right?

1307
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:19,970
Because you're going to sound even more
brooding is just standing there crying

1308
01:21:19,971 --> 01:21:22,760
with a bouquet of flowers or whatever.
Whatever the fuck you going through.

1309
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:24,080
And then this whole thing was,

1310
01:21:24,081 --> 01:21:28,490
she says she'll contact you in the
future when some heavy shit she's going

1311
01:21:28,491 --> 01:21:32,480
through right now is over with. You
know, I'm thinking of that movie.

1312
01:21:32,481 --> 01:21:37,160
Barfly you guys both like alcoholics.
What does the heavy shit,

1313
01:21:37,161 --> 01:21:40,700
she's got to get through the
fucking 12 pound meat hammer.

1314
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:44,570
She's going to be riding tonight.
I'm not trying to be a dick, but, um,

1315
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,530
look, well, you got to do right now, okay?

1316
01:21:48,531 --> 01:21:51,140
If you were out sit there Bruning
and you were all depressed,

1317
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:53,960
you're probably not coming across
as someone she wants to mate with.

1318
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:57,170
Who's going to bring her
some strong offspring? Okay?

1319
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,000
To get all discovery channel on you.

1320
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:01,550
So what you gotta do is you got
to show her that you're a man.

1321
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:04,520
So what you gotta do is just let her go.
All right?

1322
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:09,470
It start going to the fucking gym.
All right? Getting eight hours sleep.

1323
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:12,650
You start eating right? You start,
you can make yourself look good.

1324
01:22:12,651 --> 01:22:16,100
You make improvements in your own life.
So the next time she sees you,

1325
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:19,520
if you run into where you
look, great. All right?

1326
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:23,630
What was that fucking Rodney danger,
danger field thing.

1327
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,810
What was that movie without doing
the Cyrano de Bergerac Shit?

1328
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:31,640
Remember that Chico Telia
and the man remember that?

1329
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:33,830
That's what you gotta do next
time she sees you. You're the,

1330
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,900
you're fucking confident.
Nah, that's bad advice.

1331
01:22:37,901 --> 01:22:40,390
What are you gonna pretend to
be confident? I don't know.

1332
01:22:40,391 --> 01:22:43,600
I'm just saying you know what, to focus
on yourself. Get your own shit together.

1333
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:47,980
You know, and don't wait for her to
call you. You know? So working out,

1334
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,570
eating right,
getting some sleep.

1335
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:55,270
Go do some shit you always wanted to
fucking do, you know, and go out to the,

1336
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:56,350
you know,
go out to clubs,

1337
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:59,860
start talking to girls who are quote
unquote way out of your league.

1338
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:03,340
See what, see what the
fuck happens, you know?

1339
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,580
But the last thing you to do right now,
I swear to God,

1340
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:11,130
is to sit around thinking about that girl
or calling her or sending her flowers

1341
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:14,890
and a box of chocolates and
all that shit because you know,

1342
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,860
she needs a break from you, I
think. And granted, once again,

1343
01:23:17,861 --> 01:23:22,390
I give up this advice knowing that I,
I didn't really go to college. I did,

1344
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:23,530
but it doesn't really count.

1345
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,710
And I have no background
whatsoever and I know fucking read.

1346
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,600
So you're on your own.
If you take my advice,

1347
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:32,480
I take no responsibility for
this shit whatsoever. All right.

1348
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:35,440
And not to mention there's a
zillion fucking checks out there.

1349
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:37,300
Why don't you go join one
of those dating services?

1350
01:23:37,301 --> 01:23:40,240
That's a great fucking way to get laid.
You know,

1351
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:43,470
someone was talking to me
about that the other day.

1352
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,473
You know,

1353
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,610
there's like two of them.

1354
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:51,150
One of them's about really getting into
a relationship and the other one's just

1355
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:55,830
about fucking join the one that's
just about fucking and uh, go by.

1356
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,790
Go down a Bj's wholesale and
get some condoms and bang away.

1357
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:01,740
Alright.

1358
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:05,130
But the last thing you want to do is
to get all fucking depressed about this

1359
01:24:05,131 --> 01:24:09,360
shit and waste another couple months
of your life brooding. Alright.

1360
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:14,920
Dust yourself off. Get back
in the game. All right. All
right, next one. Hey Bill. Uh,

1361
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:17,340
I got an interesting,
uh, situation going on.

1362
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:21,840
I've been really good friends with
this guy friend. I'll do this is a,

1363
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:25,380
this is a fucking great question. I
don't even know if I can answer this one.

1364
01:24:25,381 --> 01:24:28,500
So I'm going to need some help.
All right. Uh, hey bill. I got a,

1365
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:31,740
an interesting situation going on. I had
been really good friends with this guy,

1366
01:24:31,741 --> 01:24:36,030
friend of mine full for like four years.
We're super tight.

1367
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:40,770
Talk all the time. Say I love you
regularly finish each other's sentences.

1368
01:24:40,771 --> 01:24:42,210
That sort of crap.
Well,

1369
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:47,211
one day I call him and found out that
he had stopped mid hookup with a girl to

1370
01:24:47,371 --> 01:24:50,010
answer my phone call.
When I asked why,

1371
01:24:50,011 --> 01:24:55,011
he said it was because I was the most
important girl in the world to him right

1372
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:58,470
in front of the girl he
was getting play from.

1373
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,190
My question to you is,

1374
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:06,191
does this do dig me or is he just
a great friend and if he does,

1375
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:10,680
why has any ever made a move?
Ah,

1376
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:11,820
wow.
Okay.

1377
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:18,920
Oh right.
There we go.

1378
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:24,680
It's not an original fucking question in
a way, but it is because this is what,

1379
01:25:24,681 --> 01:25:28,250
two dudes now? Yeah. Jesus Christ.

1380
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:32,140
How the fuck do I answer
this one? Uh, yeah, dude.

1381
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,400
There's something fucking going on there.
The way you write about it,

1382
01:25:34,401 --> 01:25:37,100
it sounds like you're in a relationship.
You guys are in a relationship.

1383
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:41,800
It sounds like a,
yeah.

1384
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:42,970
I don't know what his deal is.

1385
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:43,890
Yeah,

1386
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:46,890
he's definitely curious.
I can tell you that. Uh,

1387
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:52,410
I dunno, I, I've never tried to
figure out if a dude like me,

1388
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:57,840
but this is really
making me uncomfortable.

1389
01:25:57,841 --> 01:26:01,410
That's why I like this
fucking question. Um, yeah,

1390
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:06,200
I think you got to figure out
what's going on, you know? But I,

1391
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:08,050
I gotta be honest with you if this will,
yeah.

1392
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,580
I'll give you the same
advice that if you were,

1393
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:15,080
if this was like a woman and she
keeps acting like that around you,

1394
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:18,860
but she's hooking up with some other guy
than I'd be like, fuck her, walk away.

1395
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,820
So I'll give you the same advice. Fucked
his duty as an, you know, if he is gay,

1396
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:25,770
he's not ready to admit it yet.
And what are you going to do?

1397
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:30,170
Stand around like some fucking,
uh,

1398
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:36,040
some fucking guy who stands around
fuck dead. Go down to a fiddle,

1399
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:40,100
sticks, whatever, whatever the fuck
they was actually a gay bar called that.

1400
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:43,190
I remember there was a standup Gig in
Boston. Someone of my friends did it.

1401
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:48,560
It's called, it's called
fiddlesticks. Um, yeah. Fuck that.

1402
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:53,930
Yeah, go down to the bar. Do what you guys
do. Work out. Get the fucking abs going.

1403
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,520
Put on a tight shirt. Just don't
hook up with a creepy older guy.

1404
01:26:58,521 --> 01:27:01,070
That's something I noticed when
it living in New York and La,

1405
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:04,730
there's always like a creepy older
guy with the young, younger gay dude.

1406
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:08,510
Like he's teaching them how to be gay or
something and they're like gold, Drake,

1407
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:10,350
dig and gay guys out there.
Cause I,

1408
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:14,930
I really don't cause guys are visual
fucking people, you know what I mean?

1409
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,220
So I, I don't know how the fuck that
goes down and I'll tell you right now,

1410
01:27:19,221 --> 01:27:22,400
I don't want to, so whatever do,
I don't know what your deal is.

1411
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:26,720
Confront him or fucking
move on. Cause uh, you know,

1412
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:31,160
if he actually is gay and he's still out
there banging and women, uh, you know,

1413
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:35,300
when I'm telling you, you, you're only
on earth for a very short period of time.

1414
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,000
Your time is valuable.
You got to put a value on it.

1415
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:41,780
Just like that guy before you.
Okay. There chick fucking took off.

1416
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:45,910
Now we stand in there walking
around trying to hand her flowers.

1417
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,190
She's still giving him the Heisman and
then that's when you gotta be like,

1418
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:53,480
that's when you, you got to get some
fucking self esteem and be like, look,

1419
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:58,070
I'm better than this. I'm the shit.
I'm telling you the solutions,

1420
01:27:58,071 --> 01:28:00,980
you always go to the gym, you listen to
some fucking music. That's how I do it.

1421
01:28:00,981 --> 01:28:04,340
You know, if I can get some
sleep, you start looking good,

1422
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,790
you feel good about yourself and then
you go out and you talk to somebody who

1423
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,510
really,

1424
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:13,040
you have no business talking to and they
shoot you down and you have a couple

1425
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,590
more drinks and you start thinking about
the person that made you want to do

1426
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:17,780
that the first place and you
go back into the depression,

1427
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:22,280
but you wake up the next day and you do
it over again. It's six weeks people,

1428
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:22,941
six weeks.

1429
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:25,940
You've got to tough it up for six
fucking weeks and you'll get out of it.

1430
01:28:25,941 --> 01:28:29,030
So good luck to the both of you.
All right, next question. Hey Bill,

1431
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:30,950
this is a hockey question.
Um,

1432
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:34,580
it's another reason why I'm site to you
back on the road is now I can finally

1433
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:38,000
actually watch some hockey games
ordering the NHL package today,

1434
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:42,140
much to my girlfriend's Chagrin,
um, hockey question. Hey, bill,

1435
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:45,560
you seem to be a knowledgeable
person when it comes to hockey,

1436
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:49,670
so I figure, uh, it
would be best to ask you,

1437
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:51,343
um,

1438
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:56,960
being that I live in New Orleans where
there is no hint of an or of organized

1439
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:58,910
hockey and very few televised game,

1440
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:02,670
I am very limited on my knowledge of the
sport even though I love it. Basically,

1441
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:06,120
I basically cheer for Detroit, the
Kings, the avalanche, the devils,

1442
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:07,620
and the mighty ducks.
All right?

1443
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:09,960
You can tell you don't know a
lot about hockey if you chew,

1444
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:13,440
if you root for both the
red wings and the avalanche,

1445
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:17,250
that's like rooting for the
buckeyes and the Wolverines,

1446
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:22,560
the red sox and the Yankees, the
long horns and the sooners, you know,

1447
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:25,980
the troops and the al Qaeda,
the different sides. Dude,

1448
01:29:25,981 --> 01:29:29,130
you've got to pick a side on that one.
Anyways, let's get to his question. Now.

1449
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:32,580
My question is,
what is wrong with the mighty ducks?

1450
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:36,030
Why are they not considered
a respectable team?

1451
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:40,530
I went to a buddy's house to watch a
hockey game this weekend and was basically

1452
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:41,364
booed.

1453
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,780
That's funny to get booed in the living
room booed into oblivion because I was

1454
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:49,500
wearing a duck's jersey in parentheses
because it's the only one I own.

1455
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:53,670
I was told by him as well as the seven
other people president at the reason for

1456
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:56,610
hating the ducks was,
has nothing to do with the way they play,

1457
01:29:56,611 --> 01:29:59,370
but rather it's the fact that
the ducks are not a real team.

1458
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:03,930
Is this a general feeling
amongst real hockey fans? Uh,

1459
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,240
or am I just dealing with
some bonehead friends?

1460
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:10,680
Let me know and thanks in advance.
All right. This is the deal. Um,

1461
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,540
I don't know how old you are,

1462
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:17,430
but do you remember the mighty ducks
was a movie was a Disney movie starring

1463
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:22,050
Emilio Estefan says Estefan as
however the fuck you say his name.

1464
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:27,390
And it was a kid movie. It was
basically the bad news bears on ice,

1465
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:31,290
which is was bay. I mean the
worst fucking collection of kids.

1466
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:36,590
Emilio Estevez probably had relationship
problems and he learned a lot about

1467
01:30:37,201 --> 01:30:39,030
himself while working with the kids.

1468
01:30:39,031 --> 01:30:42,870
And then for some reason there's this
unbelievable hottie who's really into the

1469
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:47,430
fucking kids and see something in him
that he didn't know happened and then they

1470
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:51,090
hook up and then somewhere along the line
they have a big fight and then he has

1471
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:55,800
to get her back. And meanwhile
there's some big hockey game. And uh,

1472
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:57,570
I imagine the coach or the other team,

1473
01:30:57,571 --> 01:31:00,720
Emilio Estefan is already
fucking knows on some level.

1474
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:05,790
And that dude always wins in life.
And now this is his chance.

1475
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:10,320
You know what I bet to coach from the
other team is dating that hot girl and

1476
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:14,280
then they hook up. Is that how it
works? Is that how the movie was?

1477
01:31:14,281 --> 01:31:17,460
I could never watch it cause by the time
it came out I was like fucking 25 years

1478
01:31:17,461 --> 01:31:21,840
old. Yes, I'm that fucking old. So
anyways, yeah, the team. So the movie was,

1479
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:25,950
I evidently a big hit. They made like
two or three of them. And along the way,

1480
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:31,220
Disney bought a hockey team and
because of the corporate mentality,

1481
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:36,570
they named it the mighty ducks.
Okay.

1482
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:41,760
That's the, the history of
that team. Now, the NHL,

1483
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:46,470
the history of the NHL as it used to be,
six teams and six of the angriest,

1484
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:50,760
most psychotic fucking cities in
North America fighting was legal.

1485
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:53,820
You smashed, sticks over
people's heads. You know,

1486
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,900
Teddy Green had to get a plate in his
fucking head. It's a maniac fucking sport.

1487
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:01,590
And then they show up like, hi,
we're the, we're the mighty doc,

1488
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:04,090
lace them up.
Fuckers.

1489
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,660
It's already difficult when you have this
many teams because they really are out

1490
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:11,020
of ferocious animals to name teams after.

1491
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:16,770
So now they're kind of naming them
after different kinds of weather or

1492
01:32:17,021 --> 01:32:21,070
generalists, you know,
like, uh, the storm,

1493
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:25,570
the thunder, the
lightning, the cold front,

1494
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,950
they don't have a fucking,
you know what I mean?

1495
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:31,000
Or they categorize the predators.

1496
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:35,410
I still don't know what a thrasher is.
What does a thrasher,

1497
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,330
that's a kind of metal speed metal, right.
Anyways, so anyways, that's why people,

1498
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:43,720
they don't like to ducks because,
um,

1499
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:48,120
hockey is like a rogue sport and um,

1500
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:51,640
it's never been accepted, accepted
by the mainstream, nor will it ever.

1501
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:53,470
And uh,

1502
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,340
then all of a sudden they came
in with the mighty ducks and a,

1503
01:32:57,341 --> 01:32:59,050
they really left themselves wide open.

1504
01:32:59,051 --> 01:33:01,780
But the thing about they
got rid of the mighty,

1505
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:03,640
so now that just called the ducks and the,

1506
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:07,120
the funny thing about the ducks is
the kind of hockey that they play.

1507
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,600
They play like a really
physical in your face.

1508
01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:15,601
Like I love the style of hockey that they
play and I even know they just traded

1509
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:19,540
fucking Chris pronger. Um, you know,

1510
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:23,500
I gotta admit I'm starting to like the
Philadelphia flyers because there's

1511
01:33:23,501 --> 01:33:27,280
something about them that
I can relate to in my life.

1512
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,820
And that's the fact that
in the mid seventies,

1513
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:35,290
they won two Stanley cups by beating
the shit out of people. Okay.

1514
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:39,280
That's not what I'm relating to.
But they had an angle that was successful.

1515
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,010
And since then they have failed
miserably with the whole,

1516
01:33:45,011 --> 01:33:48,910
we're going to beat the shit out of you
to win a Stanley Cup. But God damn it,

1517
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:49,990
it doesn't stay,

1518
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:54,991
have not diverted from that game plan
one iota since 1974 75 they are still

1519
01:33:58,211 --> 01:34:01,240
trying to, even though the
league has changed completely,

1520
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:06,100
they are still trying to beat the
shit out of people. And you know,

1521
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:09,880
they added Chris pronger cause they think
this is why we're going to be able to

1522
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:14,230
compete against the fucking capitals
and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

1523
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:15,340
And what do they do? They, they,

1524
01:34:15,341 --> 01:34:18,760
they fucking lose six to five and
then they have a big fight at the end.

1525
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:24,240
And I relate to that because I have
certain things in my life that I've been

1526
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:29,380
trying to solve with the exact same
approach. And I fail every fucking time,

1527
01:34:29,381 --> 01:34:33,640
but I for some reason can't
get out of this Rut. So, um,

1528
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:36,190
I'm getting the NHL package
today and I'm telling you,

1529
01:34:36,191 --> 01:34:40,750
if you want to get into hockey, watch the
penguins, flyers, games all this year,

1530
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,990
they're there. There's not
going to be one boring one. Um,

1531
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,070
and a lot of people don't like when I talk
about sports, but I don't give a fuck.

1532
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:49,660
I gotta tell you I'm
concerned about my Bruins.

1533
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:53,380
I don't know why they trade Phil Kessel.
I don't get it.

1534
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:58,950
Why you would trade a young guy who's
your number one goal scorer and you trade

1535
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:04,190
him for draft picks. I could see if
he was 35 and he was past his prime,

1536
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:08,470
then you're like, hey, we gotta get young.
But so many draft picks, they don't,

1537
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,040
they turn out to be nothing.

1538
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,530
And you actually had a young guy who
was scored like 39 fucking goals and he

1539
01:35:15,531 --> 01:35:19,640
missed some games last year.
Man. Stupid fucking stupid.

1540
01:35:20,190 --> 01:35:23,370
And I like it. I don't like it.
All right, so they got to do,

1541
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,190
that's why they don't like the ducks.
So fuck them.

1542
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,260
Just learn a little bit more about hockey
then you won't say things like, I'm a,

1543
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:32,510
I like the red wings and the
avalanche. Uh, but good for you man.

1544
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:37,280
Good for you. Like in hockey down there
in New Orleans. All right, next question.

1545
01:35:37,281 --> 01:35:41,150
Hey Bill. Um, I'm in a
little bit of a dilemma.

1546
01:35:41,151 --> 01:35:44,300
I'm 35 years old and I have a
30 year old. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1547
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:47,780
I'm reading the one from last year. My,
all lot of that. I scrolled down too far.

1548
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:52,190
I thought I had some questions here.
Oh, there's the questions. All right,

1549
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:56,240
here's some questions and I'm
going to end the podcast here. Um,

1550
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:02,250
oh, wait a second. Yeah. Here we go.

1551
01:36:02,251 --> 01:36:04,940
Questions Bill. If your
family, siblings, parents,

1552
01:36:04,941 --> 01:36:09,770
and close friends are turning into
zombies, um, then you could kill them.

1553
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:13,100
I mean, like totally kill them because
if they are zombies, they would,

1554
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:17,060
they would technically be dead
also. In addition to that, uh,

1555
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:18,230
would you have to kill you?

1556
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:22,070
Would you have to kill them in a special
way because they are special to you?

1557
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:26,420
Like a quick death bullet to the head
or would you just take a baseball bat to

1558
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:29,130
them? Would you look forward to it? Um,

1559
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:32,990
I know I'd love it if someone I didn't
like became a Zombie so I could have a

1560
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:36,350
legitimate excuse for killing them
and getting away with it. Yes.

1561
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:40,940
Some people I'd love to take my time with.
Okay.

1562
01:36:40,941 --> 01:36:42,470
That's a fucked up question.
All right.

1563
01:36:42,471 --> 01:36:47,300
He's basically asking me if
my all my friends and loved
ones turned into zombies,

1564
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:52,790
could it, would I kill
them? Um, all right.

1565
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:56,600
In the old days when zombies could just
walk slowly, I would run away from them.

1566
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:00,440
And unless cornered, like in the
Michael Jackson Thriller Villi Video,

1567
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:04,220
obviously yes, I would kill them rather
than sitting there getting eaten alive.

1568
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:08,180
Now with today's Zombie 2.0 uh,

1569
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:11,330
where they can run and that type
of shit, uh, without a doubt, yes,

1570
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:14,660
I would kill them because it
isn't them anymore. And, uh,

1571
01:37:14,661 --> 01:37:18,740
I want to live and what I do at quickly,
I try to do it quickly,

1572
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:23,300
but if I didn't have anything, if I
only had something that would go slowly,

1573
01:37:23,301 --> 01:37:27,260
then I would use something
that would go slowly. You know,

1574
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:32,020
I don't know. You know what? I was
actually on the road and I saw that,

1575
01:37:32,021 --> 01:37:36,830
that Zombie movie, what does that one,
uh, Zombie land or something like that.

1576
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:39,740
And I don't know. It was cause I
wasn't in a crowded movie theater.

1577
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:44,480
I was a little, little, little
disappointed, but I heard
this something out there.

1578
01:37:44,481 --> 01:37:49,130
This, this new ghost movie called like
photosynthesis or something paranormal.

1579
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:54,320
Evidently it's supposed to be the scariest
movie of the last 10 years and I'm

1580
01:37:54,321 --> 01:37:58,590
going to go see it. Somebody fucking
ruins it for me. Um, so at that,

1581
01:37:58,591 --> 01:38:00,270
that is the podcast for this week.

1582
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,260
Please try to avoid us air if you can.

1583
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:09,440
American Airlines is also another
airline that that is also $25 a bag.

1584
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,110
And um,

1585
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:17,180
I'm going to complain and I would like
to encourage all of you because they

1586
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:20,640
really puts you in this position where
you feel like there's nothing you can do.

1587
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:25,470
I think that a regular customers
really need to get more vocal.

1588
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,380
This is just my opinion.
I'm not getting preachy here,

1589
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,510
but um,

1590
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:34,110
I really see no end to these greedy cons.

1591
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:38,160
Just taken another bite out of your
ass until we pushed back a little bit.

1592
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:43,170
So, um, next time we get fucked
over, asked for a website,

1593
01:38:43,171 --> 01:38:47,310
send some emails, do whatever
the fuck you can. Um,

1594
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:52,800
I dunno. I Dunno what the fuck to do. I'm
really, I'm really, I don't know what,

1595
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:53,910
so what,
you know what I'm doing right now,

1596
01:38:53,911 --> 01:38:57,690
I'm going to thank everyone who came out
to see me over the last six weeks. Okay.

1597
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:01,530
From,
from Stockholm to Boston to Philly,

1598
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:05,820
all the people in a Addison
who came out to see me, um,

1599
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:09,930
all the people at the stress factory in
New Jersey who've been coming out to see

1600
01:39:09,931 --> 01:39:13,440
me for years and in Pittsburgh,
which all of a sudden, man,

1601
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:17,720
I mean that's a really hard ticket
for Comedians to sell out there.

1602
01:39:17,721 --> 01:39:21,540
I sold out two shows and the other two
shows where all the way to like literally

1603
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:25,980
the last row and um,
you know,

1604
01:39:25,981 --> 01:39:29,730
it's seriously, man, no jokes here.
It's, it's, it's an unbelievable feeling.

1605
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:30,721
You know,

1606
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:34,350
I worked 17 years to get to this point
to actually have people like my comedy,

1607
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:37,740
the way you guys do and to come
out to my shows is fucking awesome.

1608
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,530
And I got to met.
There's always a little bit of panic.

1609
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:42,990
Every time I walk into a
showroom where I'm like, fuck,

1610
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,840
is this the week where
there everybody's over me?

1611
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:49,770
And it goes back to 25
fucking people, you know? So,

1612
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:55,020
uh, that's it. Thank you for keeping the
dream alive for another fucking week. And,

1613
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:59,240
um, and I think, I think
that's it. And, uh,

1614
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,810
I also want to thank,
uh,

1615
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:06,170
Jim and Randy at Wd v e n a Pittsburgh
for hooking me up with the unbelievable

1616
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:10,110
corned beef sandwiches. And let me
run my mouth on your great radio show,

1617
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,360
the opiate Anthony show.
Uh,

1618
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:16,350
who the fuck else I got to start thinking
those radio shows because those guys

1619
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:20,720
really fucking really
helped me out. And, uh, um,

1620
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:25,320
and also, um, I want to thank
everybody who came out for the,

1621
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:27,600
I got a buddy of mine who's, who's, um,

1622
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,000
he's really battling a
sickness right now. And, uh,

1623
01:40:32,001 --> 01:40:33,780
I went up and did a benefit of giggles,

1624
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:37,980
which is a great comedy club if
you live up in the Boston area. Um,

1625
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,310
my Clark Linny Clark's brother runs it
and we did this great benefit for this

1626
01:40:41,311 --> 01:40:45,900
comedian Kevin Knox,
just one of the great fucking comedians.

1627
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:47,100
I'll tell you a quick story.

1628
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:52,101
I started this business in 1992 and when
I did it was basically at the end of

1629
01:40:53,591 --> 01:40:56,120
the 1980s comedy boom.

1630
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:59,770
It was almost like the
housing market or the, uh,

1631
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:04,840
Internet bubble in that there was a bunch
of people making way more money than

1632
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:08,170
they should have been and there had
to be a correction in the market.

1633
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:13,171
So basically I started in 1992 and when
I was working during the first couple

1634
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:15,550
years of my career,

1635
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:20,580
I worked with a lot of guys who used to
be making way more money and used to be

1636
01:41:21,281 --> 01:41:22,950
headlining.
Um,

1637
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:27,310
sort of the guys like the
B and c level headliners.

1638
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,860
All right.
And I gotta tell you,

1639
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:34,890
there was a number of them who I will
say we're not so nice to work with.

1640
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:39,640
Basically, they tried to discourage
me from being a comedian. You know,

1641
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,040
I'm not talking about the big guns.

1642
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,950
The big guns who were in Boston still
were drawn and they were still doing well.

1643
01:41:44,951 --> 01:41:45,784
But there was like,

1644
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,510
there was some B and c level guys that I
ran into and they would say, shit like,

1645
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:49,990
you know,

1646
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:53,590
you'd be there on like a Thursday or a
Wednesday night gig and they'd be like,

1647
01:41:53,591 --> 01:41:57,110
fucking 30 people in the crowd. 40
people and they, they'd be the gold.

1648
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,710
Look at this shit man. You know, I'll
tell you men, two fucking years ago,

1649
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:04,090
three years ago, there would have been
a line around the block, you know,

1650
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:08,170
I'll tell you, man, if I was
your age, I wouldn't even
get into this shit. You know,

1651
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:10,090
I quit right now, man, if I was your age,

1652
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:13,100
if I could do this over again and never
would had done it yet, and I sorta guy,

1653
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:16,720
he's to leave there with like a
gun in my mouth, you know. But um,

1654
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:21,430
you know, there was this
one comic sky, Kevin Knox,

1655
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:25,930
I used to go down to his show and he was
just a fucking great guy and he would

1656
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:29,530
absolutely, you know, just, just a
fucking great guy. Totally encourage you.

1657
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:33,910
Positive guy. Not a, not a jealous
bone, not an envious phone.

1658
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:37,420
Competitive, none of that shit.
Just a fucking great dude.

1659
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:42,900
And me and all my buddies used to go
down and he put us up on his show and I'm

1660
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:44,290
not only was he a great guy,

1661
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:47,800
I really learned to how to follow somebody
or attempt to follow somebody because

1662
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:51,940
this guy was so fucking funny.
You know when he hosted a show,

1663
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:54,160
we used to joke that
he didn't host a show.

1664
01:42:54,161 --> 01:42:57,760
He used to take breaks from killing
cause that's what he would do.

1665
01:42:57,761 --> 01:43:00,670
He'd go up and he would just be
killing and they'd be like, all right,

1666
01:43:00,671 --> 01:43:02,650
I'm going to bring up your next act.
And then you know,

1667
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:07,660
he'd bring up a fucking 23 year old me
and I'd be happy to go up there and hang

1668
01:43:07,661 --> 01:43:08,560
on for dear life.

1669
01:43:08,561 --> 01:43:12,580
And it really helped me out when I went
down to New York and I had to go on

1670
01:43:12,581 --> 01:43:16,940
after like, you know, I go on after a
guy who had his own TV show and you know,

1671
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,830
the nervousness of that when you
first start out being a comedian.

1672
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,520
Um, and I was a much
