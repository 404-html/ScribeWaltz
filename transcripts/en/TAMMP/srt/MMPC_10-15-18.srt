1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,950
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:05,140
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, October 15,

3
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:08,730
2018 what's going on?
How I yeah,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,010
you hear the echo, echo, echo. I
am in New York City, everybody.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,950
I am, uh, here for the
next two, three days.

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:21,870
I'm doing a bunch of press to promote
my show at Madison Square Garden. No,

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,580
November 7th of this same year of
our Lord and the Chinese chicken,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,400
whatever, the fucking Chinese, whatever.
Is it, is it the year of the Monkey?

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,510
It was the year I was born. I was
born the year of the monkey. You know,

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,420
I find that very offensive. I am not a
monkey. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a dancing monkey.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,530
I was born in the Chinese New
Year of the dancing monkey,

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,103
uh,

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,570
Shanghai Shit joke. I'm trying to do a
little ration right there. I did my work.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,160
Um, anyways, what's, I've,

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,420
could I be having a better sports weekend?

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,990
Okay.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,530
I mean, I've got to tell you, if I'll feel
poor, I gotta be pretty fucking happy.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,410
We'll put [inaudible] on the
boob too. Um, you would think,

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,460
okay.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,750
You would think that I would be excited
last night that my new England patriots.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,130
Okay.

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,630
That I would be excited that they knocked
off the undefeated Kansas city chiefs.

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,580
Okay. Now obviously I am happy
that we won the fucking game,

24
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,790
but if somebody is going to sit there
and tell me that that's what a football

25
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,790
game is going to look like in the future.

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,530
I don't even know what that
was like watching two people
playing Madden football

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,810
in what?

28
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,900
It reminded me of the Superbowl last
year where there was just no defense

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,220
and you know who likes shit like that?

30
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,010
People who aren't fans
of the fucking game.

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:48,980
Okay.

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,410
I, I just, you know Tyree
kill everybody. How many,

33
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:57,880
how many fucking times cause he get to,
was he going to catch your fucking ball?

34
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:01,510
It was like that when Tom Brady goes down,

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,410
leads us down like he always
fucking does for the go ahead score.

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,543
All right.

37
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,010
Tyreek hill number 10 and you're
fucking playbook and your program

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,610
have a fucking accountant who doesn't
watch sports would be like, hey,

39
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:24,930
you know, I don't want to come off like a
know it all. I barely watched this game,

40
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:28,530
but I'm going to say you might
want to cover that number 10 guy.

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,293
Okay.

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,950
Oh,
it comes up to like

43
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,880
fucking the guy goes up untouched,

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,880
running across the middle of a fucking
NFL defense on fucking touched.

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,960
Tra La la catches the fucking ball.

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,910
Okay.

47
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,460
I Dunno, I was in a
sports bar. Was it 60, 70,

48
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:59,340
80 fucking yards untouched.

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,650
Who would've thought,

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,420
okay,

51
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,980
that Patrick show time,

52
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:10,090
my hope was going to go to fucking the
guy he'd been going to who had been

53
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,780
killing you the whole fucking Gig.
I understand that the guy beats you.

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,190
I understand that. I guess how
bad, see, I understand that,

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,820
but to basically not even cover the guy

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,920
devil.
I mean,

57
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:30,810
I would expect to see some play like that
and central park watching a couple of

58
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:35,811
Wall Street's psychopaths played fucking
touch football there was pathetic.

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,590
It was fucking pathetic. All right. Having
said that. Um, I love Patrick, my homes.

60
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm sold on the guy now.
All right.

61
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,040
I don't crown somebody king in September
of their first fucking year as a

62
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:51,600
starter, but yes. Yes. Fucking amazing.

63
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,250
Just an amazing beast of a fucking player.
Having said that,

64
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,920
I don't know what in the, I don't
know what the fuck is going on. Dude,

65
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,720
that fucking guy in the Kansas city chiefs
where they're trying to suggest that

66
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,320
he had Tom Brady for a and he's like,
Oh,

67
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,220
don't hurt the quarterback,
and then he fucking,

68
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,880
he runs in for a touchdown.
It's just like I,

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,830
you know, I understand. I
guess because of the, the, the,

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,450
the concussions in the longterm effects.

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,350
I guess I have to adjust how I watched
the game and when it comes to quarterback,

72
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:33,150
who's kitten heel? All right.
Those are the hot chicks. Okay.

73
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,350
They're not paying a cover. They're
not buying a drink. You know,

74
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,530
they're going to be sitting there looking
at their fucking Instagram bored out

75
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,450
of their fucking minds
because they get every day.

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,150
That's what a quarterback is going to be.
All right.

77
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,230
Depending on what they're doing for the
league because those are the ones that,

78
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,450
you know, bring in the
money. But that, you know,

79
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,643
I don't know.

80
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,940
It's fun to watch all of that offense.
But like watching that,

81
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,290
watching a guy,

82
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,710
okay.

83
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,550
Sack a quarterback and then unsat camp
because he doesn't want to get in trouble.

84
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,180
And then seeing that same
guy who runs worse than me,

85
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:12,780
score a touchdown I guess was
fun because I was a patriots fan.

86
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:15,930
But as a fan of football, I mean, I don't
know, I guess, oh no, I don't want them.

87
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,110
Okay.

88
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,820
I remember a long time ago I watched an
NFL films and this is before, you know.

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,040
Okay.

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,680
They started overly protecting
quarterbacks and you know,

91
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:30,040
leading with your shoulder, which I think
is a good, who's good? No. All right.

92
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,060
Not the project overly protecting the
quarterbacks. I don't like that at all.

93
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,763
MMM.

94
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,720
But I remember seeing this
old school football game,

95
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,140
he and he played in the 1950s or forties
and they asked him what you thought

96
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:45,360
about today's NFL.
And this was like in the 90s,

97
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,870
and he just was talking through his teeth.
He's like a wood look,

98
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:53,010
she'll football game the day you bugging
you gave you, they give him his fucking,

99
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,770
his head almost exploded steam coming out
of his ears. And I was just going like,

100
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,180
what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,170
And now that I am old enough
to seeing the game change

102
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,730
as much as it has, I feel like
I'm turning into that guy a pill.

103
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:14,320
What'd you think about your teen
beat? And the chief says nay. Good.

104
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,960
Are you going to come a Guy Rick Hale?
Like I'm fucking

105
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,343
okay

106
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,540
dude. I was in this sports bar and the
whole game it was just people screaming.

107
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,140
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

108
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,910
It was like they were watching an eight
year old tried to land a jumbo jet was

109
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:35,100
the energy in the fucking room. But
you know, which I guess is great. Oh,

110
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:39,320
by the way,
epic fucking sports bar guy.

111
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,950
Okay.

112
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,420
I really learned how much
people hate the fucking patriots

113
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,540
with, uh, the fucking

114
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,390
they hatred. This guy had to, he literally
got, he got thrown out of the bar,

115
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,150
like he was fucking Earl weaver.
It was like, I swear to God,

116
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:04,510
I was like watching a
baseball manager get objected.

117
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,120
He got thrown out of a sports bar,

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,400
not for fighting because how much
he was yelling at the fucking TV,

119
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,430
like completely lost.

120
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,760
Yeah,

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,690
his composure.

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,780
I saw so much of me in this guy,
but it's like I do it in private.

123
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,250
I do it when I'm driving a car or when
I'm at home with my wife, which is why,

124
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,440
you know, she fucking, you
know, it doesn't like me.

125
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,273
Mmm

126
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,791
No,
she likes me,

127
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:39,791
but I mean I'm tough to live with this
fucking guy was like when the Cino

128
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,470
patriots what went up big,
right, 24 to whatever,

129
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,480
you know, when the chief started
coming back, this guy, like,

130
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:50,800
he just fucking lost it.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,240
He like the whole night was fucking
hilarious cause I went in there with a

132
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:00,230
friend of mine and we were uh,
we will meet and another buddy of mine

133
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,720
and uh,

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
I was texting him going, hey man, we're
almost here. All right, well, you know,

135
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:12,860
we're pulling up. And he's
like, cool, cool. Right. So I
go in there, I don't see him.

136
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:15,920
So I'm like, Oh shit, that's
weird. I can't believe I
fucking beat this guy here.

137
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,010
So we grabbed a table when we yeah, but
you know, we got one other guide comments.

138
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:20,780
We grabbed the four top
and was sitting there

139
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,020
and uh,

140
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,400
the Patriots scored a touchdown and I
just hear this fucking guy just be like,

141
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,730
yeah, that's what I'm
talking about. America,

142
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,650
like just being an idiot. And I'm
like, who the fuck is that jackass?

143
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:39,190
I look down, it's my buddy that I'm
supposed to be fucking hanging out with.

144
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:42,620
So me and my friend, we laughed and
get a shit. We go over there certainly.

145
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,140
So we sit down. So that's the first clue
that there was going to be this lunacy.

146
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:50,650
So at that point we'd gone up like 24 to
like fucking three or six or something

147
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:53,530
like that. It was like, wow, man. Then
mopping the floor with these guys,

148
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:56,090
this is crazy. Right? And all of a sudden

149
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,540
the chief start coming back.
It's like 24, 13, 24 twenties.

150
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,110
And this fucking guy down the
end of the bar man. And uh,

151
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,130
he looked like he was older than me,
you know, but at this point, at my age,

152
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:11,780
I probably was fucking five to seven
years old in this guy. Right. But, um,

153
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,220
but I'm going to Hollywood, so I take
care of myself. I drink plenty of water.

154
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,360
I use lotions.

155
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,790
This fucking guy was agent like
that fucking quint in, uh, in jaws.

156
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,950
Right? So he's down, you know,

157
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,500
when the chief scored this the first time
she's called, he's like, yeah, all right.

158
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,340
You know,
and then when they scored the second time,

159
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,330
he just started yelling like, that's
right. That's right. It's 2018.

160
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,030
This is the new,
this is the new NFL.

161
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,780
It's fucking over for you
and it's over for you.

162
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:45,820
And he was yelling about the Patriots.
He was so sick of them winning

163
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,490
dude, I'm telling you. And then the
Patriots of course come back and match it.

164
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,241
And you know,

165
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:57,160
we've got a couple of paths in a Ferris
calls and this fucking guy who's losing

166
00:09:57,161 --> 00:10:00,510
his shit and just getting
madder and madder and it's,

167
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,180
it started off where he would yell about
the play and then yell about it for

168
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:04,870
three minutes.

169
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,950
And then hs was five minutes set myth
and then he was just yelling at the

170
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:13,300
fucking TV and he had just
completely lost all composure.

171
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,730
Um, and the Patriots went up by seven
again and they look like they were pulling

172
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:21,740
away. He missed the whole
end of the fucking game.

173
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,240
I just wish she was like it was getting,

174
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,183
yeah.

175
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,350
You know, the old me would have
engaged with this guy, you know,

176
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,500
cause I was having a couple of pops,
but I was kind of like a, you know,

177
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,940
older and wiser.
You know,

178
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:38,910
when the chiefs went up by three points
and he was learning, he was screaming,

179
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:43,230
this is a new rule, blah, blah, blah.
I did one point, one point yelled down,

180
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:47,700
I went regular season because
he was starting to annoy me.

181
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,410
And then he just completely,
like I said,

182
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:57,080
he was just yelling
like,

183
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,630
I mean they see the only thing
was missing was this guy.

184
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,550
Like just if they had a home plate on
the bar room floor and he could have just

185
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:06,340
pushed the dirt all over it.
I mean he,

186
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:10,670
he completely fucking lost it.

187
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,050
Okay.

188
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,810
And we just got back fucking rapper
reason that fucking Pittsburgh game.

189
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,600
I have some good mother fucker fucking
Porsche, but everybody in here knows it.

190
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:24,950
He said that everybody in here knows it
and I was just,

191
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,600
I was like,
yeah.

192
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:33,890
I was just like, is that what I
look like? I asked fucking this guy,

193
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,730
but he took it to a next and like
the next level, you know what I mean?

194
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,670
What you thought, like, you know,

195
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,020
it was like I was fucking
Michael Jordan of losing my shit.

196
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,180
Okay.

197
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,660
You know? And then along
comes Coby Brian like, oh wow.

198
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,910
I thought it was not a good
comparison cause he wasn't better.

199
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,180
Yeah.

200
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,060
I don't know. Dan Marino.
Right. And then everybody,

201
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,700
that's not a good comparison because
Dan Marino would've thrown for 6,000.

202
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,800
I didn't know what happened. Yo,
you're fucking hall of Famer.

203
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,370
You put up all these fucking number, like
no one's ever going to catch this guy.

204
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,120
And then all of a sudden you see yourself
get taught. You're like, wow, man,

205
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:17,620
records really are meant to be broken.
Even the ones no one wants to break.

206
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,820
So I guess they had been warning the guy.

207
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,570
Okay.

208
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,460
Because it got to the point
where it was kind of like, uh,

209
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,150
he basically turned everybody into the
bar into like his kid and he was the dad

210
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:37,281
driving the car and everybody was just
sort of be looking around like who dad's

211
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,420
really getting worked up today.
Huh.

212
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,000
And he was with this woman and she was
just smiling, looking at down at the bar.

213
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,520
I mean, she couldn't have been
with them. She would have,

214
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,670
she would have been mortified,

215
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,070
I dunno. Or She's just the biggest
st ever. And she just, what I like,

216
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,450
I like a passionate fellow. So
anyways, the bouncer comes in

217
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,680
and literally just have some on
the shoulders like you have to go.

218
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,060
And he put his jacket on.
He didn't resist on any level,

219
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:13,620
but he never stopped yelling.

220
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,380
Okay.

221
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,380
And screamed the whole way out of the bar.
It was like,

222
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,330
it was literally like performance art

223
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,153
and,

224
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,860
and everybody in the bar just had like
such, like a funny attitude towards it.

225
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:32,360
Like, um, there was no, uh,

226
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,310
none of that fucking shit that goes on
today where that triggered me and this is

227
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,710
a safe space. It was none of
that. People were just laughing.

228
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,430
Okay.

229
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,430
Just watching like one of the most epic
fucking frustrated sports fans I've ever

230
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,390
seen. I mean, I actually started, I did,

231
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,950
I just tried to start the slow clap
when he was being escorted out.

232
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,890
You know, I just felt like the guy, he
deserved a round of applause. I haven't,

233
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,670
I don't, I've never seen
anybody like, you know,

234
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,190
back in the day they came up
with something in the 70s.

235
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:10,970
Okay.

236
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,710
Because people were,
uh,

237
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,270
yeah,

238
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,570
we're,

239
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,730
we're throwing shit at their TVs and
they were breaking them while they were

240
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,750
watching television.

241
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,780
So somebody invented like this thing,
it looked like a brick,

242
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:26,320
but it was soft and you could throw it,
but you know,

243
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,380
eventually that went away because the
satisfaction is this sound of glass

244
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:33,904
shattering.

245
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,050
Okay.

246
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,883
You know,

247
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,330
of breaking the thing.

248
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,800
Okay.

249
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,140
That's making you up that either,
you know,

250
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,640
it's not working for you speaking
as a person with a temper. Right.

251
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,320
Okay.

252
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,010
You want to,
you

253
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,940
want, you want the inanimate
object to pay. MMM.

254
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,570
Which is why I remember a
long time ago when this actor,

255
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:03,550
I'm not going to say his fucking name,
whatever,

256
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,873
but

257
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,490
he was trying to call this quaff and
the fucking phone wasn't working and he

258
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:15,390
called down to the hotel,
the front desk and they couldn't help him.

259
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,753
Yeah.

260
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,630
Make it work.

261
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,650
So he ripped it out of the wall and
he went downstairs and he threw it.

262
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,430
He threw the phone at the fucking guy.
You know,

263
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,470
the guy got a little cut on his head and
shit. But I gotta be honest with you,

264
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,380
like as much as he
shouldn't have done that,

265
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,410
I can't imagine the release that that
must've been how satisfied he literally

266
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:43,811
took the thing that wasn't working any
through it at the person that couldn't

267
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:48,830
help him make it work. I mean
that is just like, you know,

268
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,280
two for two. Right. But that's like a,

269
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,540
that's like pitching a
perfect game in anger.

270
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,773
MMM.

271
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,530
So anyways, hats off to that fucking
guy. Hats off to Patrick, my homes,

272
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:06,180
he's a fucking amazing cheese. Have a
great fucking team. But like, you know,

273
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,483
mmm.

274
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,740
I don't know how anybody thinks either
one of those teams is going to win the

275
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,360
fucking super bowl.
You can't do,

276
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:19,650
they both lit up 40 invoice
it 40 and 43 points.

277
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,770
Okay.

278
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,380
And everybody's, I remember seeing
that back in the fucking day.

279
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,620
Like that was how the adult, the dolphins,
never one when they had Dan Marino,

280
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:32,240
cause they had no fucking defense. It
was just like, all right dad, you know,

281
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,680
we're going to give up 35 38 points.
Do you got 40 and yet again today,

282
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,380
he had to go out and score fucking 40
points so we can win by two or three. Um,

283
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,090
and those teams never won super bowls.
And to this fucking day

284
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,900
he gets shit for it. Like they blamed
the one guy who wasn't a problem.

285
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,020
Okay.

286
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,620
They blamed the fucking guy that
got him to as far as they can

287
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,370
fucking goal before they would
run into a fucking great defense,

288
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,780
which would,
you know,

289
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:09,020
knock down whatever Dan was going
to do by seven to 10 points.

290
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,310
But his shit defense would still give
up the fucking 35 38 points and then

291
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:17,020
they'd lose. And then in real Dan
Marino can win the big one. You know,

292
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,420
fucking Joe Montana couldn't win the
big one with those fucking differences.

293
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,313
MMM.

294
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,680
I mean, how many times you got to watch
sports defense wins championships. Okay.

295
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,680
I don't know what the fuck everybody's
so excited about last night's God damn

296
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,340
game.

297
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,340
Watching two teams giving up 40.0 I
can't wait to come play off toe player

298
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,790
player. Right. Um, anyways, so,

299
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,730
okay.

300
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,880
Meanwhile on a TV screen right next to it.

301
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,090
It was the red sox and the Astros.
Now I was out doing, so I missed like

302
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,390
the first half of the game I kicked by
the time I came in, it was five to four.

303
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,430
Um,
I don't know how price looked or whatever.

304
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:00,830
I got to go read some shit on it.
But um,

305
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,290
I think he left at five four.
So I believe if if,

306
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,124
uh,

307
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,570
Kimbro hadn't let that run
in to make it seven to five,

308
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,330
I used to know how this works.
I think he would have got the victory.

309
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,810
So if that is the case,
then he kinda got screwed out of a,

310
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:20,150
out of a win last night.
Um,

311
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,270
but I got to tell you the Astros
fucking lettuce up off the mat because

312
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:30,650
obviously going up to Oh is huge.
But the thing was they beat sale.

313
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,040
Yeah.

314
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,450
And that's what the Yankees had to do.

315
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:37,410
They had to beat sale because then you
get the price and price has not one in

316
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:41,160
October. So you basically get yourself
to fucking wins. And for the Yankees,

317
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,030
they got the first two, one a three that
they needed. And even with the Astros,

318
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,470
if he went in the first two fucking gags,
the other team has to win

319
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,360
for the next five and you
just have to go to a three c.

320
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,320
It's all about the mouth. So, um,

321
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,070
you know,

322
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,070
I did not have high hopes for how we were
going to look a against the Astros and

323
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,550
how game one went down was, well, how I
thought the series was going to go down.

324
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,120
But after watching last night
I was like, alright, you know,

325
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,910
this is the fucking Sylvester
Stallone. Yeah, it's so bad.

326
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,590
It's so bad.
Um,

327
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,920
but they are an incredible fucking team.
Um,

328
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,800
so we shall see,
hey,

329
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:30,300
who's that bearded guy with
the Bob Stanley body that
we have in a middle relief.

330
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,940
That guy's been doing all right.
When I saw him,

331
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:37,860
I had flashbacks to 1986 with Bob
Stanley running out of the bullpen.

332
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,050
I mean, that fucking guy, I swear
to God, like he had like a cop body.

333
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,940
Like it's a stereotypical like,
like bad cop.

334
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,270
I don't meet crooked cop.
I mean like, you know,

335
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,380
yeah.

336
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,370
Just, you know, you just keep, every year
you just order a bigger uniform, you know,

337
00:19:57,371 --> 00:20:01,240
one of those fucking guys and
then just coming, running out,

338
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,663
you know,

339
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,140
this skinny fucking legs and
his flabby fucking, I mean,

340
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,530
how are you like a professional athlete
and then you can't take your shirt off

341
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,930
at the pool. You know, it's
just fucking unbelievable to me.

342
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,710
That's basically the body that gay had.
So all muffin top Johnson,

343
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:24,240
whoever the fuck we have on coming
out in a middle relief, that guy is,

344
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:28,950
he's just been asis, these big fucking
asis and uh, Kimbrell just, you know,

345
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,250
you die a thousand fucking deaths
with that guy. He's just like,

346
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:36,090
he's going to let in at least one
run is what I've just come to expect.

347
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
And um,

348
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,060
okay.

349
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,990
The shit that I say when he out of
this mother Fucker, this fucking Cook,

350
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm son of a bar. You follow?
Yeah, of course. Of course.
You're walked up, right.

351
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,450
Um,

352
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,740
I have the second he gets in the game,
I stand up and I just start pacing.

353
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,383
Um,

354
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,460
yeah.

355
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,980
And I know that like I'm also

356
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:58,730
okay

357
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,190
a lunatic,
but I hats off.

358
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,640
Okay.

359
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,620
To that fucking guy.
Like that guy last night,

360
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:09,510
he's one of those grown men that when
his team finally wins it, like he's,

361
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,190
he's going to fucking cry.

362
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,180
Yeah.

363
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,841
Like he's like,

364
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:17,670
this is the new NFL did like how much
it meant to him for his team to win and

365
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:18,930
how sick he was.

366
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,480
Okay.

367
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,440
Of the Patriots just fucking getting all
the calls and all the shit that you say

368
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:27,170
about all the, all the fucking great
teams. I've fucking been there.

369
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:31,070
And it was just to watch it. It was,
I really learned a lot about myself.

370
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,143
MMM,

371
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,963
okay.

372
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,700
It's very rare that you see
two exciting games like that.

373
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,970
And then somebody's behavior
is at the same level. I mean,

374
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,990
all three of them were,
uh, were asis, but, uh,

375
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,740
okay.

376
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,650
Jesus Christ is Emma
homes kid. Good. My God.

377
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,940
Okay.

378
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,030
I wish that Monday night guy didn't
fucking hype them up so much and make me a

379
00:21:57,031 --> 00:22:00,030
fucking contrarion like tap
into that shit. He's like,

380
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:01,800
can you just let me watch and be great?

381
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:05,130
And then I can say he's great rather than
you spoon feeding what I'm supposed to

382
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:09,240
beat them.
I hope you realize what you just saw.

383
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,030
All right buddy.
Dial it down.

384
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,480
Okay.

385
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,000
It reminds me of like when
that woman with the Yankees.

386
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,170
Okay.

387
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,430
The Roger Clemens called Roger.
Roger Clemens.

388
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,140
Oh my goodness gracious.

389
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,523
What is,

390
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,470
um, both of them should be,
they'd be doing wrestling.

391
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,930
Um, by the way, um,

392
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,960
I want to thank everyone that came out
in Saginaw, Michigan. First of all,

393
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:43,370
I landed at the airport and I
swung by the old address, uh,

394
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:47,910
where my great grandparents lived. They
had a house in my great grandfather, uh,

395
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,700
evidently dug the basement by hand.

396
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,160
Okay.

397
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,220
Stubborn German guy. Right.
And I don't buy, by the way,

398
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,610
I don't know how the fuck do you do that
without your house falling down into

399
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,444
the hall.

400
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,623
Okay.

401
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,470
I would imagine you'd have to start in
the middle of the room, work your way out,

402
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:09,810
and then pick one side. You know,
and as you started to do it,

403
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:12,630
you have to put something
underneath the fucking foundation

404
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,920
because I wouldn't feel safe going within
two feet of whatever dirt the fucking

405
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,590
foundation was sitting on.
I don't know how the fuck he do that.

406
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:22,910
Okay.

407
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,060
But my buddy was laugh because we,
so we showed up to where the house

408
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,960
okay.

409
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,670
Was supposed to be the address and
there was no house there anymore.

410
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,540
That was in fact a lot of in that area,
you know, the houses, obviously my great,

411
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,670
great grandparents lived there a
hundred fucking years ago. So, um,

412
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:38,570
okay.

413
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,430
The house is no longer there.
It's now like it was knocked down.

414
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,640
They put up something new.
It was just like an empty lot.

415
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,180
And my buddy was joke
being like, well, you know,

416
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,360
your grandfather dug a basement here.

417
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,390
Maybe that's why the house
isn't here anymore. But, um,

418
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,280
I gotta tell you,
man,

419
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:59,080
that theater that I played in the
sound in that theater was incredible.

420
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,300
It's just, um, it was such a live

421
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,830
theater. It was, it was incredible.
I was like, well, how can you get,

422
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,200
this is another one.
He can take the fucking special in here.

423
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,820
And the crowd was
awesome. And um, you know,

424
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,620
I was teasing him about fucking,
you know,

425
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,910
being farmers and all of that
dumb shit that I do. And uh,

426
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,520
you know,
we were going to try it.

427
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:29,230
We would drive and right down to Ann
Arbor for the University of Michigan,

428
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,890
Wisconsin Badger game the next day and
we meet somebody in a bar and all of that

429
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:36,280
shit, by the way. Yes. Sober October
is just out the window for me.

430
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:40,630
It's not happening. All
right, I'm having a bad year.

431
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,120
Um, next year, next year I'll
win the title. So anyways, uh,

432
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,780
I was saying in my head, all right, I
usually do like upwards of 90 minutes.

433
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:55,780
I'll probably do like an hour and 15
jump in the car and we'll get the fuck

434
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:59,320
outta here. Blah, blah, blah, Blah and
all that shit. And I had such a good time.

435
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,940
I ended up doing like an
hour, 30 an hour, 35. Um,

436
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,130
ended up going out doing like the
meet and greet thing. And, uh,

437
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,950
but it's still all worked out because
we found this bar that was open till two

438
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:15,380
in the morning. And me and my
buddies, you know, for Z, Bart,

439
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:19,030
nick and our two other buddies,
uh,

440
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,340
that we go to the games with every year,

441
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,850
we would have in such a good fucking time.
Just laughing.

442
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,190
It's like the most laughs
I've had on a weekend.

443
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,130
Just laughing our fucking asses off,

444
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,810
just breaking each other's balls and we
were just having such a good time and we

445
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:37,630
were so excited about the game the
next day, you know, like all this,

446
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:41,560
like the people that work there,
they just start liking you. Um,

447
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,350
then they were coming over and you know,

448
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,230
next thing you know the bar
is closed and like, all right,

449
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:48,610
what does it just go downstairs?

450
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:50,860
Cause there was a downstairs
area so we don't get in trouble.

451
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,680
And then we stayed down there until
like fucking four in the morning.

452
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,410
So thank God it was a seven 30 game.

453
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,490
So the next day we fucking wake up and um,

454
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,930
we go out to go with some meat
before we head over to the tailgate.

455
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,970
When I mentioned meeting a bunch
of other friends, you know,

456
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:15,030
some of my relatives and all that shit
to tailgate before we go into the fucking

457
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:17,170
big house. Right. This is my weekend.

458
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,690
Ridiculous.
Right?

459
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,700
So we go out to this place
to get something to eat, man.

460
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,450
I'll tell you like, why did I
tell you everything was just okay.

461
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,780
It was all almost like
that almost tasted good.

462
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,040
You know how long it took
for the food to get out.

463
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,650
They didn't clear off any
of the fucking plates.

464
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,290
It was so fucking funny like this.

465
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,670
It was just one of the worst run
places I've been to in a long time.

466
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,590
And like I remember at one point
we, um, I just saw this random,

467
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,360
you know, personal work, then
go by and I just say, excuse me,

468
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,090
can we get our, uh, can we
get our check? She's like, ah,

469
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,240
you're going to have to ask your server.
And I don't know who that is.

470
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,120
Okay.

471
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,900
And I'm looking at it like,
well go fucking find out.

472
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,173
And then

473
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,740
do you know, of course she doesn't. They
finally see our server and to do that.

474
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:16,690
And then she said comes out and she goes,
excuse me,

475
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,500
the people over there trying to say
that you're somebody, are you somebody?

476
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:25,170
Are you,
are you bill Maher is what she said,

477
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,090
which was so fucking perfect cause the
food, all the food was almost good.

478
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,733
And then

479
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:37,190
she almost recognized me and almost got
my name right. So we were fucking crying,

480
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,024
laughing,

481
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,010
okay.

482
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,420
About how they just kept almost. And
then she goes, what is your name?

483
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,800
And I go,
Michael,

484
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,810
okay.

485
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,940
And she goes, Michael, who?
And it goes stray hand.

486
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,650
Okay.

487
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,390
And then afterwards I go, none.
And I am, I go, actually Bill Burr,

488
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,550
Bill Maher does. And she
goes, all right. She goes,

489
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,550
so who was the guy you said you were?
I said, Michael Strain. And he goes,

490
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:02,230
I used to play for the New York giants.

491
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,220
Now he does one of those morning
talk shows. And she goes, Oh, what?

492
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:08,320
So like you think that,
you know,

493
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:12,660
because I work in a sports bar that you
just got to say like a sports process

494
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,650
name that's kind of
stereotypical isn't it?

495
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,460
And I looked at her like Isaiah got
Mike getting like me to do right now.

496
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,320
Like what the fuck kind of energy is that?
You know,

497
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
that that part was like
fucking annoying to me.

498
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,923
Like,

499
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,090
like how fucking fully yourself are you,
you know?

500
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,970
Do you think that's all I am as a person?

501
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:34,210
It's like I don't even fucking know yet.

502
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,790
The only reason why he
said straight hands,

503
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,160
cause I didn't think there'd be
a follow up question to Michael.

504
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,300
And that was the first name I thought of.
Um,

505
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:46,551
anyway,

506
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:49,700
so I did stand up last night at Gotham
comedy club and I was having a great time

507
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:52,790
until I started making fun of women and
then everybody just fucking pulls back.

508
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:56,540
It's one of my issues with fucking
doing standup in New York City now is

509
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,120
everybody's so air quote woke.
It's like,

510
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,460
it's like doing stand up at
a fucking woman's college.

511
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,600
I feel like I'm performing in front of
old people on a cruise ship and you look

512
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:10,130
at them and they're like half my age and
they're borderline fanning themselves

513
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:13,370
and you're just looking at him like,
guys, I'm 50. You should be shocking me.

514
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,760
I'm telling you this fucking generation,
it's not millennials,

515
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:19,880
it's the generation. You
know, what does it see?

516
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:23,880
Whatever the fuck they call these fucking
people that like the level of midlife

517
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,030
crisis that these people are
going to have. It's just,

518
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,940
it's just going to be off the fucking,
it's going to be off the fucking rails.

519
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,310
So anyways,
um,

520
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,080
after crying laughing the night
before we were in this place,

521
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,960
the colon at the, almost
something, or rather crying,

522
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:45,380
laughing, it just how poorly run
the fucking thing was. Right.

523
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,560
Um, them, we're out in the parking
lot. We're trying to decide, all right,

524
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:53,550
are we going to Uber over there?
You know,

525
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,910
cause Uber is just taking
forever to call or whatever.

526
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,950
And so we finally decided
we're going to Uber.

527
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:58,760
Okay.

528
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,790
And we just started singing this
Bruce Bruce Springsteen song,

529
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,690
just trashing each other.

530
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,160
Okay.

531
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,130
Uh,
you know that it,

532
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,300
oh,
we just kept doing that.

533
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,020
It would make it fun of Barton it cause
he was driving, Joe can't see shit.

534
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,360
He's like farsighted so he could see
the fucking big house from Saginaw,

535
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:22,880
but he couldn't see the car
fucking two feet in front of them.

536
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,980
And we're driving in, it's raining out
and first he's in the back seat like

537
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:28,940
okay,

538
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,550
well a quiver in his voice
the entire fucking time.

539
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,880
And I've resigned myself to the
fact that we're going to die.

540
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,540
And Paul was mad at me that I didn't get
as upset as he was. It's just like, dude,

541
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:42,560
we're doing 80 miles an hour with the
guy who can't see in the rain. So,

542
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,500
okay,

543
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,440
what am I Jack Ryan? Am I going to
fucking reach over and grab the wheel?

544
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:49,050
It's like we're, we're, we're either
going to live or die, you know,

545
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,120
we're not walking away
with severe injuries.

546
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:53,520
This is going to be a fireball death.

547
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,793
Okay.

548
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,590
So we just was singing,

549
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,840
okay,

550
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,090
I can't move.
So those Joe bought nick,

551
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,980
he can't see shit changing
blades in the rain.

552
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,863
I can't even do it anymore.
Right.

553
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,020
Fucking shredded my voice doing it,
just trashing each other

554
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,520
and it just went all around pulverize
z and the whole fucking thing.

555
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:24,940
And then they say one about me and
we're just drinking in this parking lot

556
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:28,520
laughing
like the whole weekend was,

557
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,220
it just was one nonstop fucking laugh.

558
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Then we get to the tailgate and my
buddies are on this golf course and I have

559
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:40,640
the Uber dropped us off on the
other side of the golf course.

560
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:45,050
We had to walk like 10 fairways and you
know the ball breaking started by the

561
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:48,890
second hole. And I'm like, I think
it's over the next till. Yeah,

562
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:51,170
but all it's telling me the next
silly, where the fuck are we? You know,

563
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,520
I don't know. I believe it was a Magellan
reference. I can't even remember him.

564
00:31:55,521 --> 00:32:00,500
We just fucking laughing. Right.
And we finally ended up finding, um,

565
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,140
finding the tailgate with
throwing the football around,

566
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,510
but playing that bean bag toss game or
whatever, that one of the guys there,

567
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,580
he made his own, he built it from hand and
then he had in the hole, he had it lit.

568
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:19,070
He had like lights around
the hole on the inside.

569
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:23,810
It was just like to a whole other level
and it got really fucking competitive

570
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,650
and Farzeen this dude al that we go with,
they would like to, to best, I'm like,

571
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:30,170
you guys are the Dream Team.
You've got to take down the dentist.

572
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:32,480
Cause this kid who was a
dentist was the go fucking

573
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,720
built the thing himself. Um, corn hall I
believe is what the fucking games called.

574
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,830
And it got to the point, everyone
was just so fucking into it, right?

575
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,960
And uh, I sucked at it. Like I
just kept going for the whole,

576
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:49,580
I never got one to just,

577
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,910
I didn't that you gotta have like that
Robert Parish foul shot, rts shit.

578
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,010
So anyways,
um,

579
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,660
was standing there with plain and all
of a sudden this fucking guy, you know,

580
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:02,660
people kept walking between his throwing
and we know we will take an a time

581
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,110
letting people pass. And
one guy, I swear to God,

582
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:07,410
it looked like the dude
from fucking radio head,

583
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,790
he just comes walking up and he's
fucking hammered real slowly.

584
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:15,110
And then they tried to grab one of the
bags out of my buddies' hands and he,

585
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:17,630
you know, he's sort of a Midwest
guy. So the, the, you know this guys,

586
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:21,590
they got like a long fuse Midwest people,
but you know when they snap,

587
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:24,260
forget about it cause they're like had
to pick up tractors when they were kids

588
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:25,880
so they fucking squeeze you to death.

589
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,890
So he kind of chills out and they
got the east coast short fuse.

590
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,030
So I just didn't like it cause he wasn't
saying anything and he was just staring

591
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:38,540
that kid down. So I just looked at him
as a 50 year old man at a tailgate.

592
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,590
I looked at him and I said,
the fuck is your problem. Like,

593
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:45,200
like I'm going to roll around on the
grass with this guy with my fucked up

594
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,470
shoulder and my 50 year old Barney,
right? Not even, not even thinking, oh,

595
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,950
I've been PNID accident, have your
bill. You're half a century old.

596
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,660
Keep your fucking mouth shut and
drink your role in rock. But I didn't.

597
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,000
So what the fuck is your problem?

598
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,280
So he's walking away and he's staring
at me and I'm fucking staring at him and

599
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:09,020
I'm like going, ah, I'm about where
you get into a fight. Why? Uh,

600
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,630
I got a kid, like, what
am I doing? But like,

601
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:16,310
I'm not going to fucking look away from
this fucking guy because as much as some

602
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:20,870
thinking that I fucking hate this kid,
right?

603
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,510
So he's staring at me, staring at
me, and then all of a sudden you can,

604
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:30,080
he won't stop staring as he's kind
of walking away and he's just,

605
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,420
as he's getting into a distance of like,
all right,

606
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,490
I think he's just going to
bluff his way out of this.

607
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,670
He fucking walks into an empty
chair of somebody else's tailgate.

608
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,960
And when I tell you it took like
nine seconds for this guy to slowly,

609
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,820
it was like somebody
chopped down a redwood,

610
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,960
how long it took for him to fall and all
the tailgates cause they were kind of

611
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:55,540
watching it. The whole
thing transpire. Uh,

612
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,720
the like three tailgates as this
guy falls, everyone were like, oh,

613
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,900
hit the ground

614
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,410
and everybody's dying laughing.

615
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,460
And then he stands up and
he's still staring at me.

616
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,800
Like you ever see a drunk guy fall down,

617
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:15,650
but he doesn't spill any part of his
beverage. That's what he was doing.

618
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:16,730
But with like a stare down,

619
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:21,731
he had a cigarette is what he had and he
fucking hits the ground and he's still

620
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:26,810
staring him that Radiohead with one
fucking I more open than the other one.

621
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,260
And then he puts his cigarette in
his mouth and as he's getting up,

622
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:35,261
he's still staring at me and he grabs
the chair and for half a second I'm like,

623
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,740
this fucking Luna is going
to throw this chair at me.

624
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,490
And he just stood the fucking thing up
and then looked at everybody and did a

625
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,110
giant wave.
Like it was the end of the performance.

626
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,960
And I want to say he got an
applause break and he walked away.

627
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,760
So now we're all once again crying,
laughing.

628
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,650
Yeah.

629
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,320
Fucking crying, laughing. Just
having the best time ever.

630
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,600
Then we ended up,
we ended up going into the game.

631
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,490
Okay.

632
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,960
You know,
I'm a couple of heaters in here,

633
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:08,940
so this is when it becomes
like the slideshow, right?

634
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,820
We're at the tail gate shall change. Now
we're getting checked by security. Um,

635
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,180
so we're fucking going into the big house
and I'm telling my buddies, I'm like,

636
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:20,580
dude, it's not going to look like
anything. As you're walking up to it,

637
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,590
like two thirds of it,
they dug it into the ground.

638
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:25,670
It's when you go in there and you see
the fucking magnitude of this fucking

639
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:30,510
place, it's going to be unreal. So we
walked in there and one of my buddies,

640
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,040
I don't know how he did it, but you know,
you know, there's no booze in there.

641
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,570
He snuck in entire fifth of crown royal.

642
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,350
I mean like,

643
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,230
okay,

644
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,810
like the one Keith Richards
would take a swig out of,

645
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,420
um,
sit down and he just pulls it up

646
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,130
and the people behind us laughed.

647
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:02,680
It was so fucking ridiculous that
he got it in. They would just laugh.

648
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:03,514
They're like cheeses.

649
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,540
They started laughing and we just
shared it with everyone around us.

650
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,910
So then we were sort of like surround,

651
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:13,130
it was like when you play
chess and you build a castle.

652
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,180
We did that with drunk people around
us and it was fucking cold out. And um,

653
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,170
then we just kept everybody warm
and just proceed then and then,

654
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:29,090
oh, then then the fucking pregame things
started. I'm trying to find the video.

655
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,840
They have James Earl Jones
do it and they're like,

656
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:36,540
we all though Michigan moval reach,
we've won more games,

657
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,010
the college football team,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

658
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:45,110
And then at one point he goes, we bow to
no one. And we would just laugh and like,

659
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,590
I do it. I'm ready to run
through a fucking wall. Um,

660
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,740
and then the wolverines came running out.

661
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:54,590
We was sitting right on the 50 yard line,
like 12 rows up.

662
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:57,500
We weren't too low that, you know, you
lose like depth of perception. You know,

663
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:02,450
we would sit and perfectly and they all
just come fucking running out on one

664
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:07,451
whole side of 100,000 people's
is screaming God and on
the other side would go.

665
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,020
It was fucking just got chills and um,

666
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,100
and then the game started and fucking
Michigan had their way with them.

667
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,230
Thank God. Uh, cause I did not
want to see them loose, you know,

668
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,400
and would have ruined the experience.
I always root for the fucking whole team,

669
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,110
you know, unless Lsu is play.
Um, and then the game was great.

670
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,800
I mean it sucked if you were badger
fans cause it kind of just had their way

671
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:40,030
with them but it was such a fucking like

672
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:40,960
okay

673
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,050
an amazing experience and the
amount of laughs that we had,

674
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,750
I really think like we were
all sitting there talking go.

675
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,620
I think that was the best one. I,
I'm a, I'm calling it right now.

676
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:54,760
We're going to have a hangover one next
year where like last year where we went,

677
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,330
we went to Lsu, Florida
gators, and it was just so,

678
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:04,060
uh,
fucking hot out that it was,

679
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,710
it was almost impossible to
enjoy yourself. It was, it was,

680
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:09,820
it was fucking ridiculous.

681
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:12,170
So I think next year we're going
to try to go to Clemson. Yeah.

682
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,103
MMM.

683
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,850
I think we're going to try to go to
Clemson or something like that and, uh,

684
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,840
we're going to try to knock out all
those ones that are in like hurricane,

685
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,700
you know, part of the world just so, uh,

686
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,140
you know,
with global warming and all of that shit,

687
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:37,230
we want to try to knock those up
before those stadiums are under water.

688
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,100
It's so sad, but when he can't do
anything but laugh about it, right.

689
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,540
Um, oh, I got a Texas person back,

690
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,940
uh,
be there.

691
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'll be there around 1215.

692
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,220
There we go. There we go. Um,
all right, plowing it. Let's,

693
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:05,630
let me do a couple of reads here.

694
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,370
Okay,

695
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:12,260
let me do it, Joe. Bob, Nick.
Okay, here we go. Uh, oh my bookie,

696
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:15,110
everybody. Oh Jesus Christ. By the way,

697
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,330
how bad where my picks,

698
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,710
one of my locks of the weeks with was the
giants take the giants with the points

699
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:26,690
at home. Holy Shit. Sorry. Although
I might be good at picking games.

700
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,420
We just listened to me
and you do the opposite.

701
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,270
I want to say a couple of them came in.
I think I went two and three.

702
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,840
I think it was more like one and two.
Um,

703
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,070
okay.

704
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,430
I picked three games, so either two,
one one or I went one, one and two.

705
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:42,250
I can't remember which. All right.
Sure. Watching football is fun,

706
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:46,880
but it's more entertaining
when he got some action on
the game guys. Yeah, me too.

707
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:50,200
I'll get about this for weeks and some

you can create a big payday parlay.

711
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,080

their mobile site is easy to use.

718

00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,260
I didn't know this one for any
smokers out there trying to quit.

727
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,940
If you know someone who is,

728
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:03,470
there's a revolutionary revolutionary
new way to quit called zero zero's.

729
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:08,471
Quick Kit is a new quitting solution
proven to increase your chances of kicking

730
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:13,130
the habit by up to four times
compared to going cold Turkey. Um,

731
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,750
talk about your experience
or the experience of someone
you know who is trying

732
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,780
to quit smoking. Well, I never
really, I mean I smoked cigars,

733
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:25,570
but I never did the cigarette. The
cigarette thing is the hard thing. Um,

734
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,240
and evidently it's harder to
quit than kicking heroin. So,

735
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,040
and um,
that's all I know.

736
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,830
The zero quick kit is a three tiered
approach that includes prescription

737
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,450
medication, nicotine, gum, and
continued support through a mobile app.

738
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,830
Here's how it works.

739
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:50,210
Go to quit with xero.com to
start your online doctor visit.

740
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,010
After your five minute visit,

741
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:55,490
a physician will then determine if
you're eligible to use the quick kit.

742
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,541
If you're eligible,

743
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:00,050
the doctor will prescribe your medication
in the quick kit will be shipped

744
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,130
directly to your door.

745
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:06,310
Zero costs less than what the average
smoker spends on cigarettes and less than

746
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:12,050
other quittings options go to quit.
Would xero.com/pir and for a limited time,

747
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:16,130
my listeners can get their first month
of the quit kit to stop smoking for just

748
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:17,120
$37.

749
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:22,121
That's quit with zero.com/burr quit
with xero.com/bar that's like another

750
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:26,330
fucking thing where you just realize
that it really is all about money.

751
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,780
You know, because you know, we're,

752
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:34,280
we're allegedly fighting a war on
terror and you have a fucking American

753
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:39,281
corporations that like literally put
glass in dip to give you microscopic cuts

754
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:45,320
so you get more of a buzz and get more
fucking into it. And just, I mean,

755
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,750
they literally killed people
that fucking mass mass murderers,

756
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,970
mass fucking murders. You tell me what
isis would do different with tobacco.

757
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,840
They probably try to kill you a
little quicker. Those dumb fucks,

758
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:02,900
they'd probably put some fucking
explosives in it and they only kill a few

759
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:06,810
people and then get caught. Um, yeah.

760
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,150
But you know what I'm telling you,

761
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:13,151
all you need to do to go from being a
terrorist to an upstanding us citizen is

762

just donate to a politician's
campaign and then you'll, you're,

763

you're in the clear, that's all you got

MMM.

00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,430
Oh my God. The late shows. That means I'm
doing two shows. Jesus Christ, Chicago.

819
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:42,800
All you guys always supported me, man.
I really appreciate that. All right,

820
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:44,750
let's get into some of the questions
here for the week. All right.

821
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:48,170
Sociopath island.
You'll Billy one punch.

822
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,790
Checkout psychopaths.

823
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,140
It's an animated show about the same
idea you had last week throwing all this

824
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:55,550
psychos on an island.

825
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,420
MMM.

826
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,210
Hey. You know what, man, I got a
phone. I actually just watched the, uh,

827
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,840
I watched the clip of that. I think
I'm going to get into that show. Um,

828
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,180
as far as I can tell,
cause there's no talking or anything,

829
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:09,180
there's no dialogue in it.

830
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:13,460
It looks like there's a group of people
who aren't sociopaths and for some

831
00:48:13,461 --> 00:48:16,940
reason they have to go to associate
psycho island in fucking maybe rescue

832
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:17,940
somebody.
Yeah.

833
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,893
MMM.

834
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,370
I Dunno. But it's definitely
interesting and it's always, uh,

835
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,530
I came up with a great idea that not
only did somebody else already have,

836
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:29,830
they've already developed it. Um,
that happens to me all the time.

837
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,840
And the worst case of it was a time
when I wanted to do a parody of a drum

838
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:39,310
instructional video and someone's like,
somebody already did that. I was like,

839
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:43,540
you gotta be fucking kidding me,
Fred. Armisen. All right, dude.

840
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:47,830
You called it DNA. Uh, Yo belt.
Listening to the throwback last week.

841
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,300
And you mentioned how even if you don't
bank online, your shit is online anyway.

842
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,740
So that was 2010.

843
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,810
Now you're coming down on ancestry DNA
test and I think history is going to

844
00:48:58,811 --> 00:48:59,830
repeat itself.

845
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,250
This article basically says that even
if you don't send your DNA into the

846
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:07,810
Internet, they will be able to deduce
all of your DNA Info anyways. Yeah,

847
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:12,730
they need like 6 million people.
They're halfway there. All felons,

848
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,070
you know,
have to give up their fucking DNA.

849
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,640
And then all these fucking
mouth breathe in fucking morons

850
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,680
who just trust people are sending in
their fucking saliva to the fucking

851
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:26,060
Internet.
It's so stupid.

852
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,050
The article says once the registry reached
3 million off, I, okay, I was wrong.

853
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,340
There'll be able to identify the people
who haven't sent in their DNA currently

854
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:37,610
there at the 1 million mark.
Dude, you called it. Yeah.

855
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,220
And it's like what are they
going to do with it? Like the,

856
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:44,590
the fact that you're going to sit there
and you're going to depend on all of

857
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:48,620
these fucking people to do the right
thing. I mean, look, look what's going on.

858
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:51,550
Like everybody knows what the fuck
is going on in the world right now,

859
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,760
but she can't really talk about
it because they got the game.

860
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:59,950
So sewed up that you're viewed as like
a sociopath or fucking UNAMERICAN.

861
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:03,700
If you even remotely criticize what the
fucking people who are making tons of

862
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:07,030
money off of other people's misery, R
and d, they're just going to have you,

863
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:08,950
it's going to be game set.
Fucking match.

864
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,403
MMM.

865
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,710
And I'm not even gonna read that article
because it's going to be so fucking

866
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,470
depressing because people are just,
they're just gonna keep doing it.

867
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,713
MMM.

868
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,330
Yeah.
It's just going to be like,

869
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:24,870
okay.

870
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,670
I think it,
it all ties into,

871
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:32,660
uh,
how people that are in control,

872
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,120
if they're doing wrong things,

873
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,900
it makes you paranoid and you can not
have enough information on people.

874
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,190
And then also there's no
fucking way that these people,

875
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:45,230
when they go to those
Bilderberg fucking meetings,

876
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:48,350
there is no fucking way that
they are not having hardcore,

877
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,001
you know,

878
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:54,630
I need to go to the hotel bar after
this and fucking drink this meeting off

879
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,290
talks about the population
problem and climate change.

880
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,910
There's no fucking way that, that, that
they're not talking about that shit.

881
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,680
How the fuck they're going to handle it
and how they're going to survive and who

882
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:11,970
else they're going to determine it's going
to survive and that God has put us in

883
00:51:11,971 --> 00:51:16,830
power. We have to make these tough
decisions. Um, which I mean, I like,

884
00:51:16,831 --> 00:51:20,190
I have a solution on how
to, you could fucking solve
those problems, but you know,

885
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:22,763
I don't know.

886
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,900
So I think they're trying to get as much
information so they don't, you know,

887
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,540
I think once they get
everybody microchipped uh,

888
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,960
then that's when they're going to start
fucking thin in the herd and they need

889
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:39,540
to do it quick.
And this right here,

890
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:42,630
this train of thought is why I don't
watch the fucking news because that's

891
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:44,700
everything that's going on in
everything that they're showing.

892
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,530
That's what I can't even watch the weather
channel anymore. I'm just like, dude,

893
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:53,760
this is like, this is, this is a fucking
done deal here. This is over. Um, anyways,

894
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:56,820
buying a car. Hey, let's get back to
some fucking bread and circus here.

895
00:51:56,821 --> 00:52:01,590
Buying a car. Dear Billy Ball boy, uh,

896
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,800
a bill first. I just first, uh,

897
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,350
just wanted to say thank you for
your show you put on in Springfield.

898
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:10,320
It was fantastic and definitely
would love to see come back sometime.

899
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:11,670
I had a great time to thank you.

900
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,780
I always listened to the podcast
on my bus ride to school. Anyways,

901
00:52:15,781 --> 00:52:18,870
I am a sophomore in high school
and I just received my permit. Ah,

902
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,520
good for you man. That's a big day. I
have a job and I'm saving up for a car.

903
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:28,521
I was wondering what your first car ever
was and what kind of car would be good

904
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,730
for a first timer like me and what
should I look for when buying a car that

905
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:34,770
would be beneficial.
Thanks to go fuck yourself.

906
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,360
I had a 1983 Ford ranger,
four cylinder,

907
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:44,250
five speed overdrive,
a black vinyl seats,

908
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:48,120
fire engine red. Um, the long bed,

909
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:51,540
there was enough two wheel
drive, nothing cool about it. Um,

910
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:56,400
but it only at 19,000 miles on when I
bought it. So it was definitely reliable.

911
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:01,140
I paid five grand for it. Um, I went
out and got alone and with the job.

912
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:04,170
So you know, I got alone, I established
credit and that type of shit.

913
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,670
Still remember my, my, it
was Danvers savings bank,

914
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,660
one cone and street Danvers mass,
something, something, something. And I'm,

915
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,050
my payment was $138 and 63 cents.
I still fucking remember that.

916
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:21,390
So if I was you, um, you're
obviously going to buy a used car.

917
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:22,990
Okay.

918
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:26,690
I mean, I always loved the Honda's and
the Toyota's back in the day because those

919
00:53:26,691 --> 00:53:30,440
engines would just last forever.
I don't know what they're doing now,

920
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:34,610
but I remember I, I got some
acting work and it made some money,

921
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,200
but I've always been a
frugal son of a bitch.

922
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:40,310
So rather than buying a new
car in like the late nineties,

923
00:53:40,311 --> 00:53:44,660
I bought a 1988 Honda
accord LX five speed,

924
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,870
four to a five speed.
And I fucking loved that car.

925
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,680
It had a hundred thousand
miles on it when I drove it.

926
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,530
And that fucking thing could
cruise at a hundred miles an hour.

927
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,920
Still no fucking problem.
It was such a well built car.

928
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:01,910
So if I was going to go
used, you know, you gotta be,

929
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,170
you gotta be careful with
whatever the flashy cars are.

930
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:07,040
Like when I was a kid,

931
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,910
everybody would try to go out and
buy the Burt Reynolds fucking trans.

932
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:13,010
And with the screaming
chicken of the flaming Eagle,

933
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:14,510
whatever the fuck they
called it on the hood.

934
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,750
And you just had to know
that those cars were,

935
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,110
they would driven like a sports car,

936
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,790
fucking burnouts and neutral drops and
all this shit that people use to do,

937
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,420
try and do the gym Rockford back in an
up and whip in the fucking front end

938
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:34,010
around. So, um, I dunno.

939
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:38,240
And I also liked having a four door car
cause I used to like hanging out with my

940
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:42,320
friends. Everybody could
pile in and uh, you know,

941
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,540
all depends on what you're looking for.
But I would definitely,

942
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,210
I would get something that, uh, is, is uh,

943
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,790
that has the reputation
of lasting rather than,

944
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,220
I dunno. I mean you do want
something kind of cool try.

945
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,810
If you can blend both those worlds,
something kind of cool looking,

946
00:54:59,811 --> 00:55:03,410
but also it's going to last. I
would get something like that. Um,

947
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,160
and you know, if you have to take
out a little bit of a loan, you know,

948
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:11,240
you already got a job that's fucking
cool. You established credit, um,

949
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:16,160
you pay the fucker rough. And, uh, then
you know, then you're into that world,

950
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,840
right? Learn about money and
all of that shit. All right.

951
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:24,610
Halloween costumes. Um, oh,

952
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,710
I gotta wrap this up quick here
because I got to get running here.

953
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,450
All dear Billy Billy's
dear Dr. Billy Stein,

954
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,380
I have a two year old daughter.
Oh, congratulations as well.

955
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,580
And I'm starting to remember all this
fun stuff we do this autumn season,

956
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:39,510
jumping piles,
Aleve,

957
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,780
watch Halloween movies and tried to scare
the shit out of ourselves by running

958
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:43,650
through the woods at night.

959
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,280
I don't think I've ever heard you recall
any favorite Halloween costumes for

960
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:48,120
Halloween memories.

961
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:52,500
The you and Nia have any place plans
to dress up your daughter. Also,

962
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:55,950
if you had a professional
costume and makeup team,

963
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,370
what would you go for as Halloween
at this point in your life?

964
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:05,680
Um, ps, nothing goes better
with the cigar than apple cider.

965
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,870
Nothing really. Rarely. Well,

966
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,640
it just so happens I know somebody who
makes apple cider who also happens to be

967
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:18,000
one of my favorite drummers of all time.
Tim Alexander from Primus.

968
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,410
He has his own a site or what
the fuck is it called again?

969
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,420
He just fucking ask me if I wanted
some too, when I told them I can't,

970
00:56:26,421 --> 00:56:30,980
I'm fucking in sober October,
which I was.

971
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,340
And now I'm not.
Let's see.

972
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:38,450
Tim Owl eggs and they're cider.

973
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,770
The shit is, I mean if you're into, if
you're into fucking site or man. Okay.

974
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,240
Herb site or.com.

975
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,573
MMM.

976
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:51,590
What do we got here? Here we go.
Yeah, it's called heard cider.

977
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,143
It's hard.

978
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,440
Our herb site or is a craft cider
produced by world renowned drummer,

979
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:02,441
Tim Herb Alexander and his wife Sharma
created their first batch of cider in

980
00:57:03,021 --> 00:57:06,920
their garage in the fall of 2016. Yeah,
dude, he gave me some of that stuff.

981
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:10,310
It's fucking delicious. And then I brought
me, give me like a whole case of it.

982
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:12,770
So I brought it down to the comedy
store and gave it out to see a bunch of

983
00:57:12,771 --> 00:57:17,150
comics and everyone's just like kind of
fucking went nuts for it. So anyways, um,

984
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,800
let's get back to the Halloween stuff.

985
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,820
Um, mum, mum, mum, mum.

986
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,320
Uh, okay. What are you asking me? Do I
have any plans to dress up? Yeah, I mean,

987
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:31,980
I usually dress up like John
Bonham or a fucking, you know,

988
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,650
maybe I was going to go with
Vinnie Paul this year, you know,

989
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:39,790
just as he passed away this
year or something like that.

990
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,990
And as far as our daughter, my wife
was talking, she was going to dress,

991
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:47,260
dress her up like Bruno Mars because
our daughter has like curly hair.

992
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:50,050
She's so fucking cute.
It's ridiculous. But uh,

993
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,790
at the last second she went to the
costume place and she got us all like

994
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,090
matching like skeleton costumes,

995
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:02,080
which I thought was a little hacky going
out as, as, uh, when she told me the idea,

996
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,420
but then I saw him, they're really
fucking cool and it's going to look cute.

997
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:09,010
You know, we're having a, um, Nia does
the kid Halloween party every year,

998
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:10,510
so we have a bunch of kids come over.

999
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:14,860
So I guess I couldn't dress
up like something too scary.

1000
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:18,700
And I guess if I dressed up
like John Bonam or Vinnie Paul,

1001
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:19,660
they wouldn't know who it was.

1002
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:23,080
And it probably just looked
like a scary fucking guy. Um,

1003
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:24,470
okay.

1004
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:29,060
So anyways, um, did I
answer your question?

1005
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:31,790
I don't even fucking know.
I'm just thinking about smoking a scar.

1006
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,940
Drink at some fucking apple
cider. Them are underrated. Uh,

1007
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,740
going to things by yourself.
A No girls, no friends,

1008
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:42,860
no family, no problem. Hey
there, Billy freckled glutes.

1009
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,900
My whole life I had this dilemma regarding
going to events or social gatherings

1010
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:53,720
alone.
I've even had friends say that I,

1011
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:58,190
if you eat alone at a restaurant or
Mcdonald's or something that's social

1012
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:02,720
suicide. Well, no one ever told me that
I love going to ship on myself. Uh,

1013
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,260
this can be really debilitating,
especially if your work schedule sucks.

1014
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:10,100
You live in a town or a
million other reasons.

1015
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:13,100
But I figured I've been thinking well,
but I finally figured it out.

1016
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,310
Who cares half the time that you could,

1017
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:19,400
that you do have a group to go
to something with people, flake,

1018
00:59:19,401 --> 00:59:23,720
want to change plans, times, cetera. If
there's an event you really want to go to,

1019
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:26,120
you have to think about
yourself and just go,

1020
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,180
even if you are by yourself.

1021
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,400
And I write this as,

1022
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:35,840
I'm a little nervous wanting to go to
see a comedy show tonight that I have to

1023
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:39,620
drive a bit to that's out of
the way and go there alone.

1024
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,490
Well, I'll be honest with you,
I just don't sit up front.

1025
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,550
If you go to a comedy show
alone, but other than that,
there's no problem with it.

1026
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:49,610
And then, you know, usually
meet people. You know,

1027
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,530
I used to go to shit by myself all the
time, baseball games, football games,

1028
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:57,590
all of that shit. I wouldn't talk to
anybody because I was a fucking lunatic.

1029
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,820
Anyways, I say this because I say this
constantly having to deal with the issue,

1030
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,770
uh,
including your tours.

1031
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:07,340
Some very good friends dropped out
of going to your show show. Well,

1032
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:08,690
I don't blame them.

1033
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:13,070
I just feel like for me it
puts you in this spot of, oh,

1034
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,780
now I just can't go.

1035
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:20,260
And your instinct is that you
getting that experience is impossible

1036
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,920
and your instinct is that you are
getting that experience is impossible.

1037
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:25,754
We'll fuck that.

1038
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:30,290
You might as well go because if you think
of it and that way you will miss out

1039
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:33,140
on a thousand bill birth, special
sporting events, holidays.

1040
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,520
And before you know it,
you're,

1041
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:40,550
you're at the end of your road and
have all these piled up regrets.

1042
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:45,470
Forget about the stigma of Solo attending
things. Live your life and have fun.

1043
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,150
Did you guys hear my
stomach growl in there?

1044
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:51,350
Try not to eat like a fucking asshole
here. Um, and that's all you have to say.

1045
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,790
That's all I have to say about that.

1046
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:57,670
Can't wait for you to see what
the guidance you ranty bastard.

1047
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,860
Go Fuck Yourself. Thanks for the
laugh. Inspiration. And one more time.

1048
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:03,810
Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah, you've
got, if you want to go, go. Yeah.

1049
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,620
Just because someone else can't go.
I mean, what are they, what are they,

1050
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,800
the the fucking dictator of
what you go to. Absolutely.

1051
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:13,280
Go to use by yourself and then
chat up a couple of ladies.

1052
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,380
Who were you here with?
Ah, I came by myself.

1053
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:19,310
It's actually like a fucking strong move.
All my friends slaked and I was like,

1054
01:01:19,311 --> 01:01:21,860
fuck it. I'm going to go. I'm show
me somebody nice and look at it.

1055
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:24,200
I ran into you and then your red,

1056
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:26,660
right?

1057
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:31,600
Go on a fire. My baby got a hold.
It's hard going to have an afternoon.

1058
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:36,950
I came to this shit all by myself
and now I'm talking to you.

1059
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:41,340
Would you like to see my deck?
Hey, I was just fucking around.

1060
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,230
Please don't lead to me age. Sorry. Um,

1061
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:51,920
anyways, would you like to see my
Dick? I asked fucking permission.

1062
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:53,350
Why you flip out?

1063
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:59,510
Please don't put that on Twitter. Uh,
sorry. I'm losing my fucking mind.

1064
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:03,350
You don't want to realize too, I'm in my
fucking this fucking apartment here and,

1065
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,860
and people. Yeah. People are gonna

1066
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,890
be hearing me down the hall singing
about me to stuff and I don't want to

1067
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:12,410
trigger anybody. All
right. Dash had. All right,

1068
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,500
go red sox. Go Patriots.
Patrick bulbs is the real deal.

1069
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:21,660
I miss defense in the NFL.
Um, that's all I have to say.

1070
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,720
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
